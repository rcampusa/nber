                            A THEORY OF MANAGED TRADE


                                    ABSTRACT




     This paper proposes a theory that predicts low levels of protection during

periods of "normal" trade volume coupled with episodes of "special" protection

when trade volumes surge.   This dynamic pattern of protection emerges from a

model in which countries choose levels of protection in a repeated game

setting facing volatile trade swings.    High trade volume leads to a greater

incentive to unilaterally defect from cooperative tariff levels.    Therefore as

the volume of trade expands, the level of protectionmust rise in a cooperative
                                                                       to
equilibrium to mitigate the rising trade volume and hold the incentive

defect in check.

               -                I.    Introduction



     Two major trends have dominated the post war history of trade policy in

industrializedcountries.     One is the dramatic multilateral reduction in

tariffs negotiated under the GATT.      The other is the move toward "special"

protection that has occurred as the industrialized countries of the world

have become more integrated and as volatility in trade flows has become a

more important source of domestic disruption.        The rise in special forms of


protection is epitomized by the growing use of Voluntary Export Restraints

(VERs), Orderly Market Arrangements (OMAs), and tariffs that are tailor made

to suit the needs of particular sectors.      These policy tools are typically

utilized by countries to limit the rate of expansion of imports or exports

from that which would occur absent intervention.        The term "managed trade"

is often invoked to characterize the current international       trading

environment,   since it consists of a relatively low "baseline" or "normal"

level of protection combined with the use of special protection to dampen

underlying changes    in trade flows.

     The low baseline level of protection sustained by countries      suggests

that a standard non-cooperative      Nash equilibrium view is inadequate to

explain existing levels of protection.      One alternative way to view the


existing trading environment is that it is the result of explicit agreements

among countries.     This approach to explaining levels of protection has been

taken by Mayer (1981) and Riezman (1982).      However, such explicit agreements

require the existence of a workable enforcement mechanism, and at the

international level it is unclear what that mechanism might be.       A second

alternative is to consider only self-enforcing agreements or tacit

cooperation among countries.      As Dixit (1987) and Jensen and Thursby (1984)
                                             2

 have shown, the (credible) threat of future punishment can sustain a more

 liberal trading environment than that predicted under the static Nash

 equilibrium.     These models can help explain how countries are able to

 sustain a relatively liberal trading environment in "normal" periods.

However,    they remain silent on the issue of "special" protection,    since they

take each period to be the same as every other,         In this regard, Corden

 (1974) has argued that countries rarely initiate protection for the purpose

of capturing terms-of-trade z&Jaa presumably
                                           due to the fear of future

retaliation by their trading partners, but that countries do employ

protection for its terms-of-tradeeffects in periods when their terms-of-

trade would otherwise decline.      Corden argues that retaliation by trading

partners is less likely during such periods.       This suggests that episodes of

"special"     protection might usefully be viewed as part of a tacit
international     agreement in a chanaina environment.
        We attempt to formalize this view by considering the way in which

sustainable     levels of protection in tacit cooperative equilibria are

affected by changes in the underlying trade volume.        Since potentially

exploitable terms-of-tradeeffects will embody greater potential national

welfare gains the greater is the underlying volume of trade, periods of high

trade volume are likely to correspond to periods of great incentive to

exercise one's power over the terms-of-trade.      If the trade volume is large

enough, the     iaediate gains from protection may outweigh    the losses from

punishment,     end free trade will be unsustainable.    However, this does not

imply    that international cooperation need break down. Countries can
cooperatively utilize     protection during periods of exceptionally high trade

volume   to mitigate the incentive of   any country to unilaterally defect, and
                                            3

in   so doing can avoid reversion to the non-cooperativeNash equilibrium.
                                                            of "special"
Thus, surges in the underlying trade volume lead to periods

protection as countries attempt to maintain some level of international

cooperation.    In this sense, the model we develop below depicts managed

trade as the outcome of tacit cooperation among countries     in the presence of

volatile trade swings.

      We adopt a very simple partial equilibrium framework within which to

make these points.    The next section lays out the basic model under the

assumption of free trade, and calculates the underlying free trade volume as

a function of the parameters of the model.      Section III solves for the

static Nash equilibria in the quota and tariff games.      Our results here are

similar to those developed in Dixit (1987).      These equilibria constitute the

credible (subgame perfect) punishments in the dynamic game of the following
section, the threat of which will be used to support tacit cooperation.
The dynamic model for the quota and tariff games is analyzed in section IV,

where   it is shown that equilibrium trade policy becomes more restrictive

                                                 This result is reminiscent of a

related point made by Rotemberg and Saloner (1986), who argue that collusion

is made more difficult by high demand states, and thus that price must be

held down during such states.1     Section V adds a second sector and

considers the podel's implications for the relationship between bilateral

trade imbalances and protection.       Section VI discusses the generality of our

results and considers several extensions.       Section VII concludes.



                                 II.   Free Trade.

       We begin with the characterizationof free trade in     a   simple partial
                                                              4

equilibrium model of trade in a single sector between two countries.                           While

we choose a very simple model es the starting point of our analysis, we

argue in section VI that the flavor of our conclusions will be preserved in

much more general models.

        Consider,        then, a single sector in which trade takes place between two

countries.            For simplicity,         the world (two-country) output in the sector is

fixed at 2.           At the beginning of any period, the distribution of world

output between the "domestic" end the "foreign" country is determined by a

commonly known distribution function F(e)                           that generates domestic output

e c(O,2]      with foreign output then given by                     2-c.   Since the direction of

trade between the two countries                  in any period will depend on the realization

of    e,    we will use        '*'       to   denote variables associated with the importing

country. Accordingly, we define                    Q   (Q*)       as the output level in the

exporting (importing) country.                   On the demand side, each country is assumed

to have an identical linear demand



      C    — a    -
                      $P, C* — a     -




where      C (C*)       is the consumption level of the exporting (importing) country

and   P    (P*)       is the exporting (importing) country price.                Competitive   fins
supply the product           in each country. For simplicity,               we assume   production
costs are zero end           that     a > 2.
      Free tradewill ensure that a single price Pt prevails in both
markets so that P a    — pf,  me equilibrium condition that world supply
equals     world demand, 2      — C(P) + C*(P), determines the                 free trade price pf
                                                             5


as pf —                 Thus,       consumption levels for the       exporting and   the importing



country under free trade are given by C(P) —                       C*(P) — 1.     Finally, the

free trade volume             v is given by
       V   —   Q   -   C(P)     —    C*(P)    -
                                                  Q*
           —
               Ic-li.

       In periods when               c—i,    both countries have equal supply and there will

be no trade between them.                   When e>i (e<l),       the domestic (foreign) country

exports the quantity c-i (i-c).                        Hence, free trade volume rises as     e

moves away from 1.              This completes the characterizationof trade volume

under conditions of free trade.



                                III.        A Static Model of Protection

       In this section we characterize the set of static Nash equilibria for

the simple model of the previous                       section when countries choose either trade

taxes or quotas.             These equilibria will serve as credible (subgame perfect)

punishments        in the dynamic games considered in the next section, the threat

of which can support tacit cooperation in a repeated setting.

       The two countries are assumed to observe the currant realization of                          e,

and thus the trade volume that would prevail in the                      period   under   free   trade

   —   ia-li,          and   then    to simultaneouslychoose their protective policies for

the period.            Each country's objective is to maximize its sum of producer

surplus, consumer surplus, and rents from protection.                        It is perhaps

simplest to think of the two countries as jointly choosing a level of

bilateral trade in the sector (through their choice of trade restrictions)
                                               6

as well as an international       division of the rents from protection.      In the

case where the policy instruments Set by the two governments are trade

taxes,    they can   be thought of either as explicit taxes on trade or as import

and export license fees that Implicitly define corresponding trade quotas.

The alternative set up we consider is one In which countries choose trade

quantities directly through the choice of quotas.

      Consider first the determination of the static Nash equilibrium when

countrIes   choose trade quantities directly in the form of import and export

quotas.     Provided that quota licenses are either auctioned off by the

governments    of each country or simply given to their respective firms, the

country whose quota binds--the country with the smaller quota- -will capture

all the quota rents.        This means that, as long as there is trade, each

country can always do better by tightening its quota beyond that set by its

trading partner, which leads to the well-known property that the unique

static Nash equilibrium in the quota game is autarky (see, for example,

Tower, 1975).     Thus,   regardless of the realization of       e   and the underlying

free trade volume      v,    the static Nash equilibrium in the quota game

ensures that no trade will take place.

      We turn now to the determination of the static Nash equilibrium level

of protection when countries choose specific export and import taxes,              (V)
and   r*(V)     respectively,   as functions of the observed free trade volume.2

To begin, the actual nature of trade following the realization of the free

trade volume          and the selection of trade taxes     r(Vt)     and   r*(V)   is

easily characterized.       If trade occurs, then effective prices to producers

in the exporting country must      be   equal across countries   and world supply and

demand must also be equal.       Since (nonnegative)   taxes can never reverse the
                                                                7

free direction of trade, we have P*                 -       P   —   v +   f*   and   2 — C(P)     + C*(P*).
Trade will occur when trade taxes are not prohibitive;                               in our model, it is

eacy to show that trade occurs provided

      With the payoff functions now defined by 2), 3), 5), and 6), a

eauilibrium for the static tariff game can be defined as a pair of tariff

functions,    r5(Vt)       and      r(V),         such that for every                 [0,1),   c5(V1)

maximizes    W(V,T,t(V))                 over r        and       (V)      maximizes W*(V,f5(V),,*)

over r*.     To solve for Nash equilibria, we first characterize best

response correspondences,                5(V,*)         and          r(Vt,i),   defined, respectively,

as the maximizers of           W(V,r,r*)          and W*(V,,.c*).

      To summarize,           the static tariff game between countries generates two

sets of equilibria:                an interior Nash equilibrium and a set of autarky Nash

equilibria.       The static quota game has autarky as its unique Nash

equilibrium.

      Finally, we note that the equilibrium payoff configurations in the

static tariff and quota games can be unambiguously ranked.                  In all (tariff

                           IV.   A Dynamic   Xodel of   Protection

       We now extend the model to allow for repeated interaction.            In

particular,     we explore the sense in which a dynamic environment enables

countries to lower protection from the levels that would prevail in a static

setting,      and characterize the relation between the achieved protection and

trade volume.

       The dynamic game upon which we focus is simply the static game studied

above infinitely repeated.         Thus, at the start of any period, a value for         e


(and thus       V)   is realized and observed by all.         Current period protection

                                                                     At the beginning of
policies are then set, and current welfare determined.

the next period,      all past choices are observed and a new value for           e   (and

thus    Vt)     is determined.     We assume that e      is drawn from the same

distribution independently every period.5

       We examine    symmetric (subgame perfect) Nash        equilibria, in which the
countries      cooperate   with low, common protection levels and credibly threaten

to forever revert to a static Nash equilibrium if cooperation is violated.

In the tariff game, common cooperative tariff levels imply that both

countries      share symmetrically    in the cooperative tariff rents.       Analogously,

in the     quota   game we assume that quota rents are shared symmetrically in the

cooperative equilibrium.6

       As discussed above, the most preferred symmetric trade policy is free

trade, and, in general, lower symisetric levels of protection are always

preferred Jointly to higher sylNietric levels of protection.              For some values

of     V,     we will see that the threat of reversion is sufficient to generate

free trade.        However, for other values of         V,   fre. trade can not be
                                                    12

maintained and the cooperative level of protection entails positive

symmetric tariffs.

          We consider first the tariff game.         The cooperative trade tax function,

      —   1(V),      must provide each country with no incentive to defect.         That

is, for every         V,     the expected discountedwelfare to each country       under
the strategy         r(V)        must be no less than the welfare achieved by the

country when defecting and thereafter receiving the expected discounted

welfare associated with a static Nash equilibrium.              Clearly, a country

choosing to defect does best by selecting a tariff on its reaction curve.

Thus,      from 7) and 9), if countries are cooperating and allowing trade, the

optimal tariff with which to defect is

          We   now fix   V   and a cooperative tariff level            and characterize

the static incentive to defect.              Let

represent        the respective static gains from defection for the exporting and

the importing country.

          Figure 2 illustrates the static incentive to defect from the

cooperative       tariff           0.    The (importing country's)   import demand curve
                                                     13



is given by the downward sloping line with slope                 -    .    The (exporting

country's)        export supply curve is given by the upward sloping line with

slope         .    The cooperative tariff       r    results in prices       P*(r,r)            and

                  in the importing and exporting country, respectively.                 The

importer's gain from trade under                    is the sum of the trade surplus, given

by the area of the triangle djc,                and the importer's share of cooperative

tariff revenues, given by the area of the rectangle                  jcba.       The exporter's

gain from trade under                 is analogously given by the sum of the areas of

the triangle          oaf   and the rectangle       oeba.   Now consider a defection from

r   .   We   know from      (12) that both countries will defect to the caine                   r.
Hence which ever country defects, prices will be                 P(TC,rD)            P*(D,)
and     P(r,r) —        P(r0,r)    in the importing and exporting countries,

respectively.          The importer's static gain from defection is then given by

the net increase in its collection of tariff revenues,                    representedby the

difference between the rectangles               onml and kbci,       minus the efficiency

loss in its trade surplus, represented by the triangle hic.                          Analogously,

the exporter's static gain from defection is given by                     gjih   -   kbel   -   mie.

As is evident from Figure             2, the equivalence                                —
                                                             t)(V,r0(V,I.),r)
                              holds   for all          0.   All results concerning the

static incentive to defect can therefore be expressed in the exporting

country notation.

        Ucing the envelope theorem, we find that

Using     12), we have that   ( (V,rD(V,1C),rC)       is strictly increasing in     V
and strictly decreasing in            if and only if

Provided that the cooperative tariff is below the static Nash tariff, the

incentive    to defect from a fixed           is larger the larger is   VZ   and the

smaller is

      These conditions are simple to interpret.         As the underlying free trade

volume increases,     the incentive   to defect gets larger.    This occurs because

the terms-of-trade gains from defection are applied to a larger trade               .

volume,     i.e. because more tariff revenue is collected from one's trading

partner under defection when the underlying trade volume is high.1            The

incentive     to defect can be mitigated by increasing the cooperative tariff,

which acts to reduce the volume of trade.           Thus, when the trade volume

surges, one might suspect that a high               would be required to avoid

defection.      This is indeed what we will find.

        Having characterized the static incentive to defect, our next step is

to examine the expected future loss suffered by a country which defects.

Letting E       be the expectations eperator with expectations taken over Vt
                                                 15

and 6     be the discount factor, we represent the respective present

discounted values of the expected future gain from not defecting today for

the exporting and the importing country as

19)           [EW*(V,r(V),r(V)) - EW*(Vf,rN(Vf),TN(Vf))J o*(r(.))



Since     e    (and thus   V)   is i.d.d. across periods,           o   and 0*     are

independent of the current value of                  as well as the current value of

r(V).         The function   i(')   will affect        w    and o*,     however,   since the

function's distributional characteristics              influence the corresponding

expected values.      Observe that        w   and w*       will be strictly positive when

S > 0     and   ,(Vt) < -5(V)       for all            in which     case the threat of

future punishment is meaningful.

        We first consider the case where punishment involves infinite reversion

to the interior Nash tariff equilibrium of the static game.                  Note also that

a credible alternative to this punishment scheme involves infinite reversion

to the autarky equilibrium.         This will be considered further below.

        Using 2) and 3) we now have



20)     w(c(.)) —   w*(1'(.)) —                                 -

Note that the expected future gain from cooperating is higher when                          and

EV    are higher, holding fixed             r(V).        This reflects the fact that the

gains associated with cooperation (low protection)                are increasing and convex

in the underlying free trade volume.

      We have now characterizedboth the             iediate gain      from defection and

the expected future loss.             Both expressions are identical across countries,

which enables us to focus on the exporting country henceforth.                  Now, for

credible cooperation to occur, the cooperative trade tax function,                     r(V),
must be such that, at every                  no country has incentive to       defect, or




21)   C(V,rD(V1,rC(V)),rC(V))<w(1())


This is our fundamental "no defection" condition, which implicitly defines a

cooperative    trade tax function.

      There will in general be many functions which satisfy 21).                 To

characterize the "most cooperative" trade tax function, we hold w                      fixed at

a constant level and solve for the lowest, nonnegative                 c satisfying        2l).
This process generates a trade tax function, with independent variables

and   w,   and determines the necessary properties which the most cooperative

trade tax function must satisfy.

      To begin, fix         w>   0.   For Vz_O,     12) and 13) establish that

fixed at zero    md increasing          V,    we know from 15) that      0   (V,rD(V,O),0)

increases monotonically. If             w    is not too large, which will always be the

case if    6   ii not too large, then there exists a critical value of                 V, V,
such that

      The next two        figures summarize 24)               and 25).     Figure 3 plots    r    as a

function of      V,       the trade volume that would prevail under free trade.                     The
                                                       18

threat to revert to the static interior Nash equilibrium supports free trade

over a range of moderate trade volume.                 Intuitively,       if the underlying free

trade volume is low, then the incentive                to defect with a tariff is low, even

if the natural flow of trade is unrestricted (raO).                           Once the trade volume

becomes extreme, the trade tax function increases with the magnitude of the

volume.     Here,    the incentive to defect is large because the natural flow of

trade is high, and so the volume of trade must be mitigated somewhat                                     (i->O)

in order to prevent defection.

      Figure 4 presents the same information, but with direct emphasis on the

qusntity restrictions implicit in the cooperative trade tax.                                  While the

trade volume that would arise with free trade,                    vt,     is still plotted on the

horizontal axis, the actual cooperative trade volume,                         Vc ,       is    now plotted

on the vertical axis.             Free trsde corresponds        to the 45        line.          Past a

threshold level, free trade is not sustainable and greater trade volume

results in greater restraint            of trade.

      The above analysis characterizes              the necessary features of the optimal

trade tax function, and gives us an expression r                    —   c(Vt,w).               The analysis

was conducted under the assumption of an exogenously given                               w.     In fact, as

20) illustrates,       ce    depends on the                   function,       w — w(r(.)).               To

establish existence of the optimal trade tax                   function,      we must ensure that

these equations are consistent, so that the                   w   with which we began is also

the   i.,   value   which     v(Vt,w)       generates.      Substituting the first equation

into the second and using 20), 23), and 24),                    we can write the resulting

equation as     (w)     —   to,    since    to(r(.))     is   independent of             v5.     The most

                trade function can then be represented as                            —               when

       We   must now prove that such a fixed point does exist.                                     Observe first

that a fixed point does occur at                             —   0,    corresponding        to the continual

[0,l/(6flfl. Hence, as Figure 5 illustrates,                               a necessary and sufficient

condition for a unique fixed point                                    (O,1/(6fl))     is    (l/(6))      <   1/(6),

cooperative trade tax function, which can be expressed solely in terms

Vt   and other exogenous parameters, such as                 6,         and    EVt.

         The trade tax function is easily understood.               When S      and    tat+

(EV)]           are small and 27) holds, the threat of interior Nash reversion is

unimpressive.          Intuitively,   since    6   is small, future losses from defection

are not weighted heavily, while a small                [4f    +(EVf)2)        implies that the

reduced trade volume induced by the reversion is not expected to be large or

variable and does not therefore represent a great loss in welfare. This

case corresponds to Figure 3 and 4 with               w    defined via the fixed point

condition in terms of exogenous variables.                 If on the other hand            6   and

         + (EVt)2]      are large and violate 27), then the reversion threat is

acute, and so free trade is sustainable               for all     Vt.

         Note that 24) and 26) together imply that surges in trade volume will

tend to lead to greater increases             in protection the more "unusual" they are

for the sector under consideration.                That is, the level of protection

sustainable in the cooperative equilibrium of the dynamic tariff game will

depend on the realization of Vt               and its mean EV5          on the one hand, and on

the variance of                 c,    on the other.       If free trade is sustainable when

Vt   —   EVE,       then all else equal, a given      increase in Vt          above   EV       will be

associated with         a   higher cooperative tariff the more "unusual"              is   the trade

volume surge (the smaller is              45).
         More cooperation       is also   given by a stronger      form of punishment.           In

particular,          suppose now that defection is followed by infinite reversion to

the static autarky equilibrium.               Letting v(Vt)        be   an autaricy equilibrium

              can be defined analogously.          Using 2), 3), 5), and 6), explicit

calculations give

Observe     that wA(?C(•)) > w(r())          for fixed    r(Vt),      since        +

                                                                                  a high
(Jf)Z)      plays a stronger role in the autarky case.             Intuitively,

expected    free trade    volume and    variance implies a large loss with autarky,
since    trade is completely restrained in the autarky equilibrium.               This in

turn implies a larger value for w            under autarky, suggesting greater


cooperation,      as we now show to be the case.

        Arguing as above and writing 29) as          &A(w),   we find that



30)     (w)   -
                  8fl(l-6)   (4[   +    (1)    -         (V-V)2     dF(Vt)]




Thus,     (w)      involves a parallel shifting of w(w),            by amount

                  + (EV)2].     Exactly analogous argtents         establish a unique,

most cooperative trade tax         function.   In the case of autarky, however, a

fixed point              (O,l/(6fl)),   exists if and only if       A(1/(6fl)) <   l/(6fi),


or

               3[Zf   + (\7f)Z]   +


       Now, it    is straightforward          to verify        that   6   >   6.     Thus,    if    6

then either form of reversion is sufficient to generate free trade for all

V.     Alternatively, if          6   >   S    II.'
                                                       then the threat to revert to autarky

always gives free trade, but the interior reversion threat only gives free

trade for             near zero, as in Figures 3 and 4.                   Finally,    if     6A >   6,   then

both forms of reversion provide only limited free trade.                             However, the fixed

point for the autarky case is easily shown to be larger than that for the

interior case, for reasons discussed above, and so the range of free trade

is larger and the cooperative             taxes are lower under autarky, as shown in

Figure 6.

       The autarky threat is in fact optimal over all punishment schemes,

since it represents the most severe punishment which countries will

endure.1°        The extreme severity of the autarky threat, however, may make it

implausible.11          We have thus also explored a softer form of punishment,

where reversion is to the interior equilibrium.                       The intuition established

for these two cases then makes it easy to evaluate other punishment schemes.

For example, temporary reversions represent an even milder form of

punishment,       and   thus   generate a relativelyhigh level of protection.12 As

Dixit (1987) notes, the autarky equilibrium is also aignificant, because it

enables    cooperation even        in finite-horizonsettings.

       To su.ariza, we have demonstrated that a high natural trade volume

increases the incentive to defect.                    Protection is then needed to mitigate

the volume of trade, thus sustaining the cooperative equilibrium.                                   Higher
                                                       23

values of     6    and          + (EV)2]          act to make punishment more severe, and

therefore    make cooperation easier facing any given free trade volume                   V.

Similarly,    as discussed above, stronger forms of punishment generate less


protection.

       The basic results of our analysis also carry                through   if country's

                                                                                               In
explicitly choose trade quantities (quotas) rather than prices (taxes).

particular,       suppose countries        set import and export quotas, and then either

                                                                     them
give the chosen quantity of quota licenses to their firms or auction
off.   As noted in section III, the unique static Nash equilibrium of this

                                                            the credible punishment for
game is autarky, which then characterizes

defection.        Hence punishment in this game is characterized exactly as in the

tariff game analyzed above with Nash reversion to autarky.                     It is also


easily shown that if the two countries set import and export quotas that

differ,     the country whose quota binds (the one with the smaller quota)

captures all the quota rents.               Finally,    as in the tariff game, the greatest

amount of cooperation will be supported by equal sharing of the quota rents

in the tacit cooperative equilibrium.                  Thus, while as in the tariff game the

current incentive        to defect from the tacit cooperative quota is increasing

in underlying trade volume, it is greater for a given trade volume in the

quota game than in the tariff game, since defection in the quota game

secures gfl       the rents   of protection for the defecting country.'3

Calculations similar          to thoae above yield the following representation of

the most cooperative quota tule               qc(Vf,c.,):

      Figure 7 summarizes (32).             Here the cooperative quota level             qc(Vf,w)

 is plotted against the underlying free trade volume                V.        For low to

moderate levels of        v,     freetrade       is sustainable   and is reflected in a
movement along the 45          line.    When         passes the threshold value of

VI,          however,   free trade is no longer sustainable as a cooperative

equilibrium.     Moreover, any quota that restricts trade by less than the

quota to which countries would optimally defect from free trade will only

tncrease the static incentive to defect-               since such a quota could not bind

under defection, it would simply reduce the current welfare under

cooperation for both countries but have no impact on current welfare under

defection.     For this reason, Figure 7 shows a discontinuity at                   V,    with

higher free trade volumes leading to a discrete tightening of the trade

restricting cooperative quota.              At this lower cooperative quota, the optimal

defection entails slightly tightening the quota so as to secure all

cooperative quota rents.            By choosing a sufficiently low cooperative quota,
the countries reduce the size of cooperative                quota rents and thus the

incentive    to defect.

     Finally,    it is interesting to compare the levels of cooperation

attainable in the tariff and quota games.                 The complexity of                   in
                                                                                   q(Vf,w)
(32) makes for   a   complicated       &'(w)    function.    However,    the following points

can be established.       If    6              so that countries care sufficiently about
                                       6,
the future, then all regimes (quota, autarky tariff, and interior tariff)

sustain free trade for all trade volume realizations.                   For    6                 the
                                                                                    (6,6),
quota and autarky tariff regimes support free trade over all trade volumes,

while the interior tariff regime does not.                Finally, for 6        sufficiently

liberal trade can     be supported for any free trade volume under the autarky

tariff regime than under the interior tariff regime, which           in turn can
support more liberal trade than the quota regime.

    We conclude that the threat of autarky reversion in the tariff game

will generally support the most liberal trading environment.            However,

whether trade will be more liberal under a regime in which countries set
                                                                Nash
quotas or under a regime of tariffs with the threat of interior

reversion depends on the degree to which countries care about the future:

the more the future is valued,        the more likely it will be that tariffs with

the threat of interior Nash reversion are inferior to quotas in supporting

liberal trade.



                        V.    Protection end the Trade Balance

     In this section we explore how the relationship between trade volume

and protection analyzed in the previous section translates into a

relationship between trade balance and protection.            While the model

                                                              trade volume,
developed above relates levels of protection most directly to

there is a large informal empirical         literature   on trade imbalance as a

determinant of protection, and it may be useful to explore the implications

of our   .od.el   in this   regard.

     The basic insight        developed   in the previous sections is that the

incentive    to defect unilaterally from cooperative tariff levels is highest

when trade volume is highest:         therefore, as   the   volume of trade expands.

the level of protection rises in a cooperative equilibrium to mitigate the
                                                                           When applied
rising trade volume and hold the incentive to defect in check.
                                                26

to a single sector as in the previous section, this implies that periods of

greater than average trade volume will be associated with higher than

average protection.        We now show that, when applied in the aggregate,         this

implies that the relationship between aggregate            trade imbalance   and the

level of protection will depend on the         sectora].   makeup of the imbalance.         A

widening trade imbalance will be associatedwith greater levels of

protection to the extent that the deficit (surplus) country's imports

(exports) increase.        However,   a widening trade imbalance will be associated

with lower levels of protection to the extent that the deficit (surplus)

country's exports (imports) fall.

         To show this, we consider the addition of a second sector to the model

of the previous section, and explore the relationship between the bilateral

trade imbalance associated with trade between the home and foreign countries

and their levels of protection.          For simplicity,    we suppose that the home

and foreign country trade only in-these two -products, and that there is a

large rest of the world with which both countries            also trade, so that the

bilateral trade in these two goods is small relative to each country's total

world trade.       Thus, we stay within the partial equilibrium framework           of the

previous sections, and focus on the relationship between bilateral trade

imbalance and protection.1

         To keep things simple, suppose that the second product is identical to

the first in every way except that when the first good is imported by the

home country, the second good is exported.           In particular, suppose as before

that the home (foreign) country's endowment of good 1 is given by               e    (2-c1)

and      that the home   (foreign)   country's endowment of good 2 is given by         o2
                                                                                            —

         e   (e1). Let    '*'   now represent the importer (exporter) of good 1

                              since            and        are symmetric   around   1,   free trade-

volumes will be identical in the two sectors and the results of the previous

section imply that the two goods will share identical                      levels of protection

in the cooperative equilibrium for every realization of                       e     (and thus    Vi).

Therefore,           c   —     —         for   all   v    and      is increasing in             But

the bilateral trade balance will be given by

                                   (C1-e1)

                                       [c1-e]

            —o

where   the second-to-last equality follows from the symmetry of the set up

which ensures that C2 —                 C.
       What we have shown is that observations on the trade balance are not

                                                                                   in the extreme
generally sufficient to determine the path of protection:

case illustratedhere, the trade balance is always zero, independent of the

value of Vt,             even though the cooperative level of protection viii change

with    V       as   was     the case    in the previous section.         Hence, to predl,ct the

relationship between trade imbalance and protection, our model suggests that

information on the sectoral makeup of the trade imbalance will be needed.

       We note finally a separate issue that arises with the introduction of

more than one sector:                  this is   the notion of multimarket contact developed
                                                28

by Bernheim and Whinston (1987).           The central idea is that multimarket

contact allows the pooling of incentive constraints            over markets:    if there

exists slack in the incentive constraints of some markets, pooling may

augment the degree of cooperation sustainable            in other markets.

     In the special two     sector   case considered above, there is no gain from

pooling incentive constraints since the sectors are identical in all

relevant ways.     More generally, however, the ability of governments to pooi

incentive   constraints across sectors is likely to undermine a strict sector-

by-sector relationship between trade volume and protection.             Instead, a

surge in overall bilateral trade volume would lead to an overall rise in

bilateral protection.



                                     VI.    Extensions

     We discuss in this section a variety of further extensions which can be

introduced to the model.      We begin by exploring the generality of the

relationship between underlying free trade volume and the incentive for

countries to defect that characterizes the model of the previous sections.

The property that at least one countrys incentive to defect from free trade

rises during periods when the underlying free trade volume is high is

crucial in generating the positive correlation between cooperative

protection levels and trade volume depicted above.             We now examine the

generality of this relationship and provide support for a presumption in its

favor.

importing country's static incentive          to defect from free trade for general

export supply    (X(k,P))    and import demand       (M(k*,P*))    functions:

on each country's incentive to defect:    the less elastic are the export

gain from defection.

        From (38) and (39) it is clear that a shock to the export supply or

sufficiently small, i.e., provided that the elasticities of export supply

and import demand evaluated at free trade are sufficiently small.              But, in

the context of a defection,    this is likely to be the case, since the

relevant elasticities are very short run in nature, i.e., they reflect the

time it takes for one's trading partner to detect a defection and respond.
                                                                and import

likely to be satisfied, ensuring that at least one country's incentive

defect from free trade will rise whenever the underlying free trade volume

rises.     This supports the presumption in favor of an increasing relationship

between free trade volume and the incentives of at least one country to

defect from free trade, and suggests that the flavor (though not the

transparency)    of our results would be preserved in much more general

settings.

        We tutu next to the interpretationof the export tax.         It is certainly

                                                                   taxes.15
 true that import taxes are more commonly observed than are export
                                             32

Moreover,     in multi-good, general equilibrium models, the Lerner symmetry

theorem between export and import taxes establishes that export taxes can

indeed be formally ignored as well.        In our partial equilibrium model,

however,     export tsxes are actively employed.
       Our modeling approach can be defended on several levels.        The basic

point we develop is that protection is positively correlated with the volume

of trade, since high volume creates a large incentive to defect from tacit

cooperation.      This intuition would also find representation in a multi-good,

general equilibrium model festuring only import taxes.        We believe, however,

thst a partial equilibriummodel offers a simpler, and more appropriate,

characterizationof observed trade wars, which are typically within narrow

product groups.      In this setting, export taxes can not be ignored on a

purely formal basis, and so we have constructed a general model allowing for
both export and import taxes.

       It is possible, however, to amend the general model with an ad hoc

requirement that countries are unable to impose export taxes, perhaps due to

political pressures.      In this amended model, there is a unique static Nash

equilibrium in which the importing country chooses the import tax
—            Cooperation in an   infinite-horizon   setting is then made possible
with the threat to forever revert to the static equilibrium if a defection

from   a   low tariff is ever observed.    Our baeic result readily extends to

this model.     During periods of high-volume trade, the importing country will

have large incentive to deviate to the tariff                This   incentive   is

reduced only if the cooperative tariff is allowed to rise somewhat, so that

the importing country is appeased.        Thus, even if the exporting government

has no control over the volume of trade, higher protection will continue to
                                             33

correspond to higher trade volume,

     Our general model also admits alternative     interpretations    for the

                                                                     In particular,
export tax which are consistent with empirical observations.

one interpretationof our model is that the export and import taxes are

really export and import license fees which implicitly define corresponding

trade quotas.   An important consideration is then the allocation of quota

rents.   VER's would correspond to the collection of rents by the exporting

country; whereas,    the importing country would collect the rents if it

auctioned import licenses.     Our finding that the most cooperative tariff

rule is symmetric corresponds to a sharing of the rents.       This is perhaps

to imports exceeding the limit, as Feenstra and Lewis (1987) suggest in a

different context.

     We have assumed throughout that     e    is i.i.d. through time.

                                                                      and
Haltiwanger and Harrington (1987) have recently criticized Roteuiberg

Saloner's use of the i.i.d. assumption in their oligopoly model, arguing

that if demand follows a cyclical path, then high demand increases the

iediate benefit      of defection but may also portend high demand states for

the future, which acts to increase the cost of defection.       Analogously, in

our model, if a high    V   portends a sequence of high Vts, then the cost of

defection rises for both countries.     As Haltiwanger and Harrington note,

however, the implications of the i.i.d. model are reversed only if 6 is

sufficiently large.     But, as Dixit (1987) has argued, it is the small 6 case

that is likely to be relevant in the present context, since governments may

be presumed to face very short time horizons.       Thus, while correlated shocks

would surely effect the statement of our results, it appears that our basic
                                           34

conclusions would survive this extension       for a range of sufficiently small

65.

        Finally, we have chosen to focus on governments    that pursue protection

for its terms-of-tradeeffects.      However,    the basic insights we have

developed are consistent with other government objectives.          For example,

suppose instead that trade policy is set by governments with a very specific

purpose in mind, namely, to maintain the status quo income level of import

competing producers (and their factors of production). Such an objective            is

in the spirit of Corden's (1974) Conservative Social Welfare Function.

Absent protection, a "good supply realization in the exporting country

would result in higher trade volume at a lower world price, and would reduce

the (real) income of import competing producers in the importing country.           A

bad" supply realization in     the importing    country would, absent protection,

lead to higher trade volume at a higher world price but, provided that

product demand is not too inelastic, still reduce the (real) income of the

import competing producers in the importing country.        Thus,   the workings of

such a model would be qualitatively    similar to the model we have studied

here:    unusual surges in trade volume would be associated with unusually

large static gains from defection to a high tariff for the government of the

importing country, and an increase in the equilibrium level of protection

wouldbe required to avoid a complete breakdown in international
cooperation, i.e. a tariff war.
                                           35

                               VII.   Conclusions

     We have attempted to develop a theory of managed trade that correlates

periods of unusually high trade volume with increased protection.        While the

model we have chosen is special in a number of ways, the insights it

generates   appear to be much more general.

     In particular, the notion that periods of unusually high trade volume

present countries with an unusually strong incentive to defect from

cooperative trading arrangements seems to be quite general, and forms the

heart of our analysis.    Given this, it follows naturally that countries will

attempt to manage the volume of trade with protective instruments that serve

to dampen fluctuations in trade volume.       Trade management can then be

understood as an attempt by countries to maintain the selfenforcing nature

of existing international cooperation.

     Finally, we have emphasized the role of VERa and OMAs in sustaining

tacit cooperation among countries in volatile environments.        An explicit

institutional manifestation of our ideas may be found in the safeguard

provisions of the GATT, whereby countries are given the right to raise

protection in the event of unforseen developments.        Our analysis suggests

a role for safeguard provisions when trade volume is unexpectedly high, as a

means of maintaining the credibility of the GATT      system   and avoiding a

reversion to noncooperative interaction.

                                  FOOTNOTES




1.  In concluding, Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) conjecture that, when
applied to the study of tariff wars, their framework could yield a
prediction of trade wars occurring in states of depressed demand. Our paper
addresses a different issue, but in a similar spirit. Also, Riezman (1987)
introduces random terms-of-trade shocks into the tariff model of Dixit
(1987). Assuming that countries adopt trigger strategies which require free
trade if free trade prevailed last period and infinite reversion otherwise,
he notes that shocks to the terms-of-trade that increase the current gain
from defection will increase the likelihood of Nash reversion.    His
concern, however, is with the effect of unobservabilityof shocks and
tariffs on the ability of countries to sustain low cooperative tariffs.
Thus for this reason, while the general idea that shocks can effect the
incentives to defect is considered, it is not formally developed.

2.  Our results would differ if countries set ad valorem tariffs, hut not in
a qualitatively important way.

3. Note that, as long as tariffs are not prohibitive so that (1) holds,
prices will only be affected indirectly by the realization of e, through
r and r*. The absence of a direct impact on prices is due to the perfect
negative correlation across countries of the supply shocks we consider.
While a useful simplifying assumption, we argue in section VI that our
results will be preserved in much more general models.

4.  Johnson (1953/54) notes that one country may prefer the (internal) Nash
tariff equilibrium to free trade if its import demand is sufficiently
elastic relative to that of its trading partner.  Keenan and Riezman (1988)
have linked this possibility to differences in country size. While the
symmetry in our model, reflected in the common interior Nash tariffs
defined by (11), does not allow this possibility to arise, the main
complication it would introduce to our analysis is to alter the focus from
symmetric to asymmetric tariff equilibria. See also the discussion in
Section VI.

5.   Correlated shocks are discussed in section VI.

6. It is natural to focus on common protection levels in this simple model,
where countries are assumed symmetric. Moreover, one can show that
symmetric rent-sharing supports the highest degree of cooperation in this
model.  A more general model is discussed in section VI, where our basic
conclusions hold but asymmetries play a real role.

7.   See section VI for a discussion of the generality of this relationship.

8. The assumption of a linear demand generates a welfare function which is
quadratic in v. Since the Nash tariff is linear in V', only the mean and
variance of  v appear in (20). The higher order moments might be important
with nonlinear demand.
                                            37

9.  A focus on the most cooperative equilibrium seems quite natural in this
context, since countries are free to communicate openly about which self-.
enforcing equilibrium they viii settle on, and the most cooperative
equilibrium is the only symmetric equilibrium that is not Pareto dominated.
Indeed, CATT may be viewed as a forum within which the most cooperative
(self-enforcing) trading arrangements are codified.

10. For a general treatment      of optimal punishment strategies, see Abreu
(1988).

11. In particular, one might expect that the countries would choose to
 renegotiate  .strategies if ever autaricy were expected.  This incentive is
also present when reversion to the interior equilibrium is expected, but it
is especially acute in the autarky situation.    While the particular
equilibria we analyze are not renegotiation-proof, we note that our basic
conclusion as to the relation between trade volume and protection is
consistent with the potential for renegotiation.    To construct punishment
schemes which will not be renegotiated, specify asymmetric tariffs (off the
equilibrium path), so that the country which did not cheat enjoys the
punishment phase. For more on the notion of renegotiation-proof equilibria,
see Farrell and Maskin (1987).

12. In fact, a temporary reversion to the interior (autarky) equilibrium
can be identified with an infinite reversion to the interior (autarky)
equilibrium at a lower 6 value. Thus, the above analysis is perhaps most
plausible for small 6, where we have seen that trade is restricted.

13. In terms of Figure 2, defection in the quota game captures the
additional revenue rectangle aklo for the importer or ajik for the
exporter, thus increasing the static gains from defection above that in the
tariff game.

14. See, for example, Bergsten (1982) on the importance of the Japan-U.S.
bilateral trade imbalance in determining levels of protection between the
two countries.

15. See, however, Conybeare (1987), who notes that wool exports from
medieval England were heavily taxed to induc monopoly supply. An export_
tax can also be identified with the more popular strategy of cartelization.

16.   For a   discussion   of safeguards, see   Richardson   (1988).
