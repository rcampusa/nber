                                           ABSTRACT

We conducted a natural field experiment to explore the effect of price changes on charitable
contributions. To operationalize our tests, we examine whether an offer to match contributions to
a non-profit organization changes the likelihood and amount that an individual donates. Direct mail
solicitations were sent to over 50,000 prior donors. We find that the match offer increases both the
revenue per solicitation and the probability that an individual donates. While comparisons of the
match treatments and the control group consistently reveal this pattern, larger match ratios (i.e.,
$3:$1 and $2:$1) relative to smaller match ratios ($1:$1) had no additional impact. The results have
clear implications for practitioners in the design of fundraising campaigns and provide avenues for
future empirical and theoretical work on charitable giving. Further, the data provide an interesting
test of important methods used in cost-benefit analysis.

        “There is an extraordinary amount of money available. The lack is of good ideas on how
        to get the basket under the apple tree.” Fund-raising consultant Tony Kneer, The
        Economist, July 29th, 2004.


        Private giving to charitable causes has significantly grown in the past several decades.

Recent figures published by Giving USA show that in the U.S. charitable gifts of money have

been 2% or more of GDP since 1998, and more than 89% of Americans donate to charity

(Sullivan, 2002). Experts predict that the combination of increased wealth and an ageing

population will lead to an even higher level of gifts in the coming years (see, e.g., The

Economist, July 29th, 2004).1 Such trends have left fundraisers, who are typically long on rules

of thumb and short on hard scientific evidence, divided as to the most efficient means to attract

these dollars. Indeed, even though the economics of charity has been well studied on the supply

side, critical gaps remain on the demand side (Andreoni, 2005).

        This study uses a large-scale natural field experiment to fill in some of these gaps.2

Specifically, we use a direct mail solicitation to explore whether, and to what extent, “price”

matters in charitable fundraising. There is a rich and interesting literature that examines price

effects via rebate mechanisms (such as changes in tax deductions) through which charitable

contributions can be used to reduce one’s tax burden (see, e.g., Clotfelter, 1985; Randolph,

1995; Peloza and Steel, 2005).3 Overall, it is fair to say that the four decades of empirical

estimates of these supply-side effects vary widely, and it is difficult to make strong inferences




1
  Such conjectures are reinforced when one considers that some empirical evidence suggests that older agents tend to
be more altruistic than younger agents (see, e.g., List, 2004).
2
  The term “natural field experiment” follows the classification scheme outlined in Harrison and List (2004).
3
  The charitable donation tax deduction was enacted in the U.S. in 1917 and has become quite important to
taxpayers: the aggregate amount of these deductions in the U.S. from 2001 to 2005 is estimated to be $145 billion
(Colombo, 2001).


                                                                                                                  1
from the price effect estimates obtained from the naturally-occurring data (Auten et al., 2002).4

Laboratory experiments, on the other hand, typically find that the level of giving to others

increases as price decreases (Andreoni and Miller 2002).                     In this study, we combine the

attractive features of each of these lines of research by collecting data from a controlled field

experiment in an actual fundraising effort.

         A natural means to use a field experiment to explore the effects of price in this setting is

to estimate the comparative static effects of large changes in rates of matching gifts, a

commonly employed tool used by fundraisers to increase charitable gifts. A matching gift is a

leadership gift that is a conditional commitment by a donor(s) to match the contributions of

others at a given rate, up to the maximum amount the leadership donor is prepared to give.

While the rate of matching is typically the result of an agreement between the fundraiser and the

leadership donor, fundraising consultants ubiquitously note that increases in the matching ratio

have noticeable power to influence future contributions. For instance, Dove (p. 15, 2000) warns

that one should “never underestimate the power of a challenge gift” and that “obviously, a 1:1

match—every dollar that the donor gives is matched by another dollar—is more appealing than

a 1:2 challenge…..and a richer challenge (2:1) greatly adds to the match’s attractiveness.” Such

strong claims have lead fundraisers to make use of the perceived extra power of larger matching

ratios. For example, a recent $50 million challenge grant gift to Drake University, which was

among the forty largest gifts in U.S. history to an institution of higher education by an

individual, was used to spur further gifts through 2:1 and 3:1 matching solicitations (Dove,

  Yet, the creative work of Auten et al. (2002) significantly advanced our understanding of the price effects,
delivering persistent price elasticity estimates of -0.79 to -1.26; the elasticity of giving with respect to transitory
price changes is much smaller, -0.40 to -0.61.


                                                                                                                     2
2000). Nevertheless, such “rules of thumb” are largely anecdotal, as little scientific study has

been completed to examine such demand side claims.5

        We take advantage of a unique opportunity to address these issues as part of a capital

campaign at a liberal politically-oriented non-profit that focuses on social issues and civil

liberties. The organization solicited contributions from more than 50,000 prior donors who

currently reside in the U.S. This organization typically asks citizens to send tax-deductible

donations several times per year and our field experiment was one of those fundraising drives.

In this spirit, each group was solicited with a standard solicitation letter but we varied randomly

the matching grant rate, matching grant amount, and suggested donation amount across the

various treatment groups. 6

        We find that simply announcing that a match is available considerably increases the

revenue per solicitation—by 19%. In addition, the match offer significantly increases the

probability that an individual donates—by 22%. Yet, while the match treatments relative to a

control group increase the probability of donating, larger match ratios—$3:$1 (i.e., $3 match

for every $1 donated) and $2:$1—relative to smaller match ratios ($1:$1) have no additional

impact. The elasticity estimate of the price change from the baseline to the treatment groups, -

0.30, is near the lower range of the elasticity of giving with respect to transitory price changes

reported in Auten et al. (2002). Elasticity estimates over the price range of the matching

treatments are roughly zero, however. These results call into question the accepted wisdom of



5
  Exceptions are beginning to arise in other areas of fundraising, however. List and Lucking-Reiley (2002) and
Landry et al. (2006) examine the efficacy of using a different type of leadership gift—challenge gifts—and find that
such seed gifts announced by the fundraiser influence charitable contributions. In a related line of work, Frey and
Meier (2005) explore interesting behavioural hypotheses using smaller changes in leadership gifts in a dichotomous
choice fundraising experiment. And, in a much different environment and context, Eckel and Grossman (2003) use
lab experiments to compare matching to an equivalent rebate of one’s contributions in the context of a dictator game
and find that matching contributions lead to significantly larger contributions than the rebate mechanism.
6
  Anonymous donors agreed to make a series of matching donations in conjunction with these experiments.


                                                                                                                  3
fundraisers and raise the possibility that millions of dollars of potential gifts are foregone due to

application of incorrect rules of thumb.

       We also find, interestingly, that an exploration into whether treatment effects are

spatially heterogeneous reveals that the matching gift result is driven by agents in states that

voted for Bush in the 2004 presidential election: the match increases the revenue per solicitation

by 55% in “red” states whereas there was little effect observed in “blue” states, suggesting that

an individual’s political environment also has the capacity to influence her giving behaviour.

       These results have clear implications for practitioners in the design of fundraising

campaigns, and provide avenues for future empirical and theoretical work on charitable giving.

The results could also provide insights into certain areas of policymaking. For example, while

price is central to our modelling of the individual response to public goods problems, one

interpretation of our data is that there are important ranges of the price vector that do not

influence solicitees’ behavior. This result has potentially far-reaching policy implications.

Practically, it speaks to state of the art methods used to measure non-market values for cost-

benefit assessments.    The contingent valuation method (CVM), for example, is a survey

technique commonly used to measure the economic value of a good or service. While hotly

debated, some evidence in the CVM literature (e.g., Kahneman and Knetsch, 1992) suggests

that individual values from CVM do not pass a “scope test,” the value to a representative agent

of saving 100 Peregrine falcons is not different from that of saving 100,000 (see also Diamond

and Hausman, 1992). Of the dozens of studies that report data that passes or fails the scope test,

we are unaware of any that use real stakes; rather they all ask “contingent” or hypothetical

questions. In this light, our data might be viewed as a useful test of scope using an approach

consistent with natural provision of a real public good.




                                                                                                    4
        The remainder of our note proceeds as follows. The next section sketches a framework

to aid in the interpretation of our data. Section II provides the experimental design and results.

Section III concludes.

                                       I.       Theoretical framework

        We present a simple model of the voluntary provision of public goods to provide the

intuition for the set of factors that might underlie fundraisers’ anecdotal evidence concerning

matching grants.       The model also supplies a means to interpret the data from our field

experiment.     We apply a variant of Andreoni’s (1989, 1990) impure altruism model that

recently has been used by Landry et al. (2006) to lend insights into door-to-door fundraising

campaigns.7

        We assume that there are n symmetric agents who derive utility from consuming a

numeraire good, yi , a public good, G , and their own contribution, bi , to the public good. Each

agent faces a budget constraint yi + bi ≤ w and derives ex post utility according to

        (1)      Ui = u(yi) + δih(G) + γf(bi)

where u ( ) , h( ) , and f ( ) are (strictly) increasing and concave; δ ∈ {0,1} . The term γ f ( )

depicts the “warm glow” effect from giving, where the parameter γ might depend on the

presence, and magnitude, of the promised matching grant monies. This implies that as long as γ

is positive, the agent receives utility from the mere act of contributing to the public good.

Further, we assume that agents have incomplete information (or, more broadly, heterogeneous


7
  The model can be traced to a footnote in Becker (1974). Cornes and Sandler (1984) and Steinberg (1987) develop
rich models of cases of mixed public/private goods. Andreoni (2004) provides an excellent overview of the general
model as well as supply-side elasticity estimates. There are important alternative modeling approaches to our
framework. For example, some have considered moral or group interested behavior (see, e.g., Laffont, 1975; Sen,
1977; and Sugden, 1984). In Sugden, (1984), for instance, agents adhere to a “moral constraint,” whereby they
compare themselves to the least generous person when making their contributions. Relatedly, in Bernheim’s (1994)
conformity model agents value status, and behavioral departures from the social norm impair status. Akerlof (1982)
obtains similar conformity results by assuming deviations from social norms have direct utility consequences.


                                                                                                                5
perceptions) regarding the value of the public good at the time of receiving the solicitation, and

thus attach δ to h(G).

        As described more patiently below, our treatments include cases where there is no match

money, and cases where announced match money is to be used at various ratios ($1:$1, $2:$1,

and $3:$1). In the $1:$1 treatment, for instance, every dollar contributed is matched with $1

from a leadership donor; thus invoking a “buy one, get one free” spirit. In this case, G = 2∑bi.

Individuals give according to the first-order condition (for an interior solution):

        (2)      u’(w-b) = δФh’(nФb) + γf’(b),

where Ф is the matching multiplier — Ф = 2 for $1:$1, Ф = 3 for $2:$1, and Ф = 4 for $3:$1.

Concavity of the utility functions immediately implies that contributions are increasing in γ .

        The first order condition provides intuition into why fundraisers might view matching as

an attractive method to enhance contributions. First, the level of individual giving increases

with enhancements in Ф due to the price effect since G is the product of b and Ф.8 Second, the

announcement of the availability of a leadership gift can reduce or eliminate any uncertainty

about the credibility and value of a charitable organization or the particular task at hand, which

also generates an increase in equilibrium contributions via δ. Note a leadership grant could

change δ via a quality-signalling effect (i.e., a change in the perception of the quality of non-

profit (Vesterlund, 2003)) or a timing-signalling effect (i.e., a change in the perception of the

importance of this gift now to the non-profit). Implicit here we assume that δ is not influenced



8
  This contrasts with using leadership gifts as seed money, where G results from the summation of b and the level of
seed monies available. Since seed money unconditionally increases the existing provision level of the public good,
marginal utility may be reduced leading to lower individual contributions (see Landry et al., 2006). Andreoni
(1998) uses a neat theoretical construct to explore a different effect of seed money in threshold public good
provisioning: his model of charitable giving has multiple equilibria, and in the absence of seed money there exists a
Nash equilibrium with zero charitable giving. The zero-contribution equilibrium can be eliminated, however, by
initial commitments of seed money, which lower the remaining amount needed to be raised in the public fundraising
campaign. Thus, in his model seed money is used as an elimination device rather than as a credibility device.


                                                                                                                   6
by the ratio of a matching grant, but rather is influenced by the mere presence of a leadership

gift. Thus, a first prediction of our simple model is that when the agent’s utility for the public

good is (strictly) increasing and concave, an announcement of a matching grant unequivocally

increases total contributions. Likewise, under similar assumptions, our model predicts that

contributions further increase as the fundraiser uses a more generous match ratio.

        An important alternative set of predictions arises in our model when the number of

agents, n, grows large.        As Ribar and Wilhelm (2004) show, as n increases the relative

importance of one’s utility from altruism diminishes and in the limit choices are driven solely

by the warm glow component. As Andreoni (2004) points out, similar results can be achieved

by allowing the size of the charity to grow. In this case, in the limit individuals might gain no

marginal utility from the actual provision of the public good but simply purchase “moral

satisfaction” when contributing. An empirical example of this variant of the model is described

in Kahneman and Knetsch (1992). In their study, and in several subsequent studies (see, e.g.,

Baron and Greene, 2006 and the citations therein), a recurrent finding of hypothetical valuation

experiments is that the value assigned to a public good does not depend on the quantity, or

“scope,” of the good in question. For example, Kahneman and Knetsch (1992) report that

agents have a similar willingness to pay to improve sport fish stocks in British Columbia fresh

water as they do for all of Canadian fresh water. Likewise, they report that famine relief in

Ethiopia is valued similarly to famine relief across the whole continent of Africa. In effect,

agents are insensitive to quantity, or “price” changes.

        Such results are fiercely debated in the literature9 and certainly could be due to the

hypothetical nature of the exercise, but they do represent an important variation of our model.


9
 Indeed, the Kahneman and Knetsch (1992) study remains one of the most highly cited papers ever published in the
Journal of Environmental Economics and Management.


                                                                                                              7
If utility is solely a function of one’s own contribution, γf(bi), then a stark prediction is that

there should be an insensitivity of individual contributions to changes in the matching grant

rate, Ф. Recent theories of social preferences refine this prediction by suggesting that agents

are “conditionally” cooperative, or might be willing to contribute more to the public good if

they learn that others have contributed, regardless of the magnitude of these previous

contributions. The underlying mechanisms at work in such behavioural patterns include models

of conformity, social norms, and reciprocity (see the discussion in Frey and Meier, 2005). In

this light, the presence of any matching ratio might influence a warm glow effect from giving, γ,

leading to higher individual contributions in the matching treatments compared to the controls.

       Clearly, predictions from these alternative models are difficult to parse from a model

where utility is flat over the relevant range of actual provision of the public good. In an effort

to consider this possibility and provide a cleaner test of the competing predictions, we not only

liberally change the match ratio, but also make use of treatments that liberally change the

matching grant amount.

                             II.     Experimental design and results

1. Design

       The Organization is a liberal organization in the United States that works on social and

political issues relating to particular civil liberties. According to a 2002 survey of its donors

70% of members are male, 60% are above 65 years old, 80% have a college education, 30% are

Christian, 25% are of no particular religious identity, 15% are Jewish, and 85% first donated to

the organization after 1992. In the 2000 Presidential election, 85% self-reported voting for

Gore, 3% for Bush and 7% for Nader.




                                                                                                  8
        Our sample frame consists of all 50,083 individuals who have given to the Organization

at least once since 1991.10 Table 1 provides basic summary statistics and demonstrates that the

assignment to treatment and control was orthogonal to observable demographic information and

prior giving history. We assigned individuals randomly to two groups: a treatment “match”

group (33,396, or 67% of the sample) and a control group (16,687 subjects, or 33% of the

sample). All individuals received a four-page letter identical in all respects except two: (1) the

treatment letters included an additional paragraph inserted at the top of the second page that

announced that a “concerned fellow member” will match their donation, and (2) the reply card

(see Figure 1) included in bold language the details of the match. For the control group, the

reply card match language was replaced with a large logo of the organization.

        The remainder of the letter, written and designed by the Organization, conformed to

their typical fundraising practices. The letter discussed a pressing national issue (Supreme

Court nominations) that the Organization was facing that particular month.

        The specifics of the match offer were then randomized along three dimensions: the price

ratio of the match, the maximum size of the matching gift across all donations, and the example

donation amount suggested to the donor. Each of the sub-treatments (ratio, maximum size of

match, and example amount) were assigned with equal probability.




Figure 1

  Individuals who have requested to be removed from mailing lists were excluded from this experiment, and large
(over $1,000) prior donors were excluded.


                                                                                                             9
   a) Maximum Size of the Matching Grant:

       As shown in Figure 1, we test four treatments for the maximum matching grant amount:

$25,000, $50,000, $100,000, and unstated. Depending on the assumptions invoked, our theory

is ambiguous as to whether a larger maximum amount (which makes the matching grant more

likely to be relevant for the donor) will lead to a higher response rate and contribution level.

   b) Price Ratio

       We test three treatments for the price ratio (hereafter “ratio”) of the match, $1:$1, $2:$1

and $3:$1. A $1:$1 ratio means that for every dollar the individual donates, the matching donor

also contributes $1, hence the charity receives $2. The $2:$1 ratio means that for every dollar

the individual donates, the matching donor contributes $2, etc. (subject to the maximum amount

across all donations, as discussed above). Again, as with the maximum match amount, the

relationship between the price and likelihood to give and amount given depends critically on the

modeling assumptions.




                                                                                                   10
     c) Ask Amount

        At the top of the reply card, the Organization includes three individual-specific

suggested amounts equal to the individual’s highest previous contribution, 1.25 times the

highest previous contribution, and 1.50 times the highest previous contribution (all

appropriately rounded). In the matching grant paragraph, we randomly chose one of the three

suggested amounts from the reply card and used that as an example to illustrate the effect of the

grant on the amount the charity would receive.

        Within our model, a higher suggested amount may influence the nature of the warm

glow effect, γ. If the “moral satisfaction” is deemed too costly, and the individual does not

consider giving less than the example amount, then a higher example amount may make

individuals less likely to contribute. In fact, Warwick (2003) finds that the net effect of

lowering the ask amounts on the reply card typically increases the revenue (response rate

typically increases, and amount given rarely changes).11

     d) Heterogeneous treatment effects

        Finally, since we are fundraising for a liberal politically-motivated group and sending

solicitations to all 50 states, it is possible that the observed treatment effects are heterogeneous

across different solicitees and different environments. For example, some researchers have

argued that solicitee income level is a key determinant of the price elasticity of charitable

donations (see, e.g., Auten et al., 2002; Anderson and Beier, 1999). Further, Lindahl (1995)

identifies the length of relationship as a key variable in charitable fundraising. In addition, it is

possible that utilitarian effects of contributing to our politically-motivated charity are different

spatially due to the local political environments. To test for these effects, we merge our

11
  The “ask amount” refers to the amounts on the reply card, whereas we have tested the example amount within the
matching grant offer language (holding constant the ask amounts). Hence, we have not tested exactly what it is
reported in Warwick, yet the similarities warrant comparing the results.


                                                                                                             11

level, (ii) state and county returns from the 2004 presidential election, and (iii) data from the

Organization on frequency of their activities within each state.

2. Experimental Results

        Table 2 presents the summary statistics and provides the core experimental results. In

Table 2, we focus on two measures:            a binary variable equal to one if any charitable

contribution is made within one month of the direct mail solicitation, and a continuous variable

for the amount given. As Panel A suggests, in total we raised $45,860 in the fundraising drive:

$13,566 in the control groups and $32,294 in the matching treatments (note that twice as many

matching letters were sent). In the matching treatments, we raised $10,431, $11,423, and

$10,439 in the $1:$1, $2:$1, and $3:$1 treatments, respectively. This amounted to $0.813,

$0.937, $1.026, and $0.938 in terms of revenue per solicitation in the control, $1:$1, $2:$1, and

$3:$1 treatments, respectively. In terms of the other treatment variables, neither the match

threshold nor the example amount seemed to have a meaningful influence on behaviour.

        As a first basic examination of these giving rates, we use a distribution free test to

explore whether the contribution amounts vary across treatment cells. Using a signed-rank

Wilcoxon test, we find that the distribution of the gifts in the matching treatments is situated to

the right of the distribution of the gifts in the control treatment at the p < .05 level. Yet, the gift

distributions across the various matching ratios are not significantly different from one another.

        Next, we impose parametric assumptions to estimate the effect of the match (and its

different features) on the likelihood of giving. Using probit models, we estimate the following

two specifications:




                                                                                                     12
       (3)     Yi = α0 + α1Ti + εi

               (4)     Yi = β0 + β1Ti + β2TiSi + β3TiPi + β4TiXi + εi,

where Yi is a binary variable equal to one if individual i donated within one month of receiving

the solicitation. Ti equals one if individual i received any of the match offers. Si is a vector of

three indicator variables for three of the four match sizes (the omitted category is unstated). Pi

is a vector of two indicator variables for two of the three price ratios (the omitted category is

$1:$1). Xi is a vector of two indicator variables for two of the three example amounts (the

omitted category is the low example amount).

       Table 3 presents the basic experimental results on the likelihood of contributing, and

also examines heterogeneous treatment effects based on whether the individual had given

already in 2005 and size of prior donation. We find the match is slightly more effective for

those who had not yet given in 2005 (Columns 3 and 4 versus Columns 5 and 6), and we find

that the match is significantly more effective for small prior donors (below the median $35 gift)

than large prior donors (Columns 7 and 8 versus Columns 9 and 10).

       We also model the amount given as the outcome of interest. This analysis necessarily

confounds two effects: the match may alter the type of person who responds (i.e., those pre-

disposed to give large versus small amounts), as well as may alter the amount given conditional

on giving. We estimate two specifications on both the full sample as well as the restricted

sample of those who gave:

       (5)     Ai = α0 + α1Ti + εi

               (6)     Ai = β0 + β1Ti + β2TiSi + β3TiPi + β4TiXi + εi,




                                                                                                 13
where Ai is a continuous variable equal to the amount donated within one month of receiving

the solicitation.

        In Table 4, for the amount given (Ai), Panel A reports results for the full sample, and

Panel B reports results restricting the sample to the individuals who responded (Yi=1). The first

combines the effect on response rate with the effect on amount given, thus providing the

aggregate effect on charitable giving. This is particularly important from the fundraiser’s

perspective in determining optimal demand side considerations to maximize charitable giving.

The second specification allows us to remove the average effect on the response rate from

estimate, but two effects remain: the match may attract individuals with higher (or lower)

typical giving amounts, and of course the match may change the amount an individual gives.

        Our data also permit a rough estimation of the price elasticities of giving.                        When

considering price movements from the control to the treatment cells, we estimate that elasticity

of giving to be      -0.225,12 and on sub-samples ranges from completely inelastic (states lost by

Bush in the 2004 presidential election) to as large as -0.668 (states won by Bush in the 2004

presidential election). A useful comparison to these numbers is the estimated price elasticities of

charitable tax deductions in the literature. Ever since Taussig’s (1967) original estimates of the

effect of changes in tax deductibility, four decades of research has provided estimates of the

price elasticities.13 Our estimates are in the range of several previous studies. For example,

Andreoni et al. (1996) report a price elasticity of -0.35, Kingma (1989) estimates the elasticity

for public radio contributions to be -0.43 (although Manzoor and Straub (2005) obtain different



12
   This is calculated from Table 2 Panel A Columns 1 and 2 on total dollars contributed (not including the match)
per letter sent. The dollars raised increased by 19%, and the average price to “buy” $1 of the public good was $0.36
(hence a decrease of 64%), which implies an elasticity of -0.30 before taxes. Assuming a 25% marginal tax rate, the
elasticity is then -0.225.

examine price elasticities with a meta-analysis.


                                                                                                                14
empirical estimates than Kingma (1989) using updated data).           Likewise, our estimates are

consistent with estimates of the elasticity of giving with respect to transitory price changes

reported in Auten et al. (2002).

Heterogeneous spatial treatment effects

       Table 2 Panels B and C provide summary statistics for blue (Kerry in 2004) and red

states (Bush in 2004) to provide a sense of the spatial variability of our estimates. The results

are stark. Overall, the response rate in blue states is higher than in red states, but is equivalent

across the treatment and control groups (treatment = 2.1% and control = 2.0%). Alternatively,

the response rate in red states is significantly higher for the treatment than the control group

(treatment = 2.3% and control = 1.5%). Note that whereas the level of giving is much higher in

the blue states than in the red states (1.5% in red versus 2.0% in blue) under the control

condition, the level of giving is roughly equivalent under the treatment condition (2.3% in red

versus 2.1% in blue). The summary statistics again show insignificant responsiveness for all

other treatments — size and suggested amount — across both red and blue states.

       Table 5 presents the econometric results by political environment of the individual’s

state (whereas Table 2 Panel B versus Panel C showed the summary statistics). We employ

four measures: the vote share by state for Bush in the 2004 general presidential election, the

vote share by county for Bush, and the number of court cases between 2002 and 2005 by state

in which this Organization was either a party to or filed a brief, and the number of non-court

case incidents between 2002 and 2005 by state reported in this Organization’s newsletter to its

members. These measures do not incorporate the intensity or importance of any given court

case or incident. Hence they are noisy measures of the level of activity of this Organization




                                                                                                  15
within each state, and even noisier measures of the perception of the individuals of the local

activity of the Organization in their state.

        Table 5 Panel A shows clearly that the matching grant treatment was ineffective in blue

states, yet effective in red states. The nonlinearity is striking, as noted by comparing Column 4

to Column 5: the differential response rate for states in which Bush narrowly lost (47.5% to

49.9%) was 0.2% points, whereas the differential response rate for states in which Bush

narrowly won (50.0% to 52.5%) was 1.6% points. Figure 2 plots the coefficients from the eight

regressions in Table 5 Panel A. Figures 3 and 4 plot the response rates for each state, where

each bubble is sized proportionally to the number of observations in the dataset. Figure 3 plots

Bush’s vote share on the x-axis and the overall response rate on the y-axis, demonstrating a

slight downward slope: individuals in red states on average give less. Figure 4 plots Bush’s

vote share on the x-axis and the differential response rate for the match on the y-axis,

demonstrating that no particular outlier states are driving the red/blue state difference.

        Given the striking nature of our red/blue state result, it is important to take care to

examine the robustness of this result. Note that analytically many explanations could be

provided for why individuals in red versus blue states are more (or less) likely to give to a

liberal Organization. The finding here, however, is that individuals in red states are more

responsive to a matching grant offer, increasing the likelihood of contributing but not the

amount given. The level effect for treatment groups is the same for red and blue states, whereas

the control group for the red states is lower than the control group for the blue states. As noted

earlier, some scholars have argued that income level is a key determinant of donor

responsiveness (see, e.g., Lankford and Wyckoff, 1992; Auten et al., 2002). In this spirit, our

results might be capturing underlying demographic differences between red and blue state




                                                                                                16
contributors. To test for this, we merge our data with demographic census data aggregated at

the zip code level. Table 6 shows these results. After interacting treatment with education,

income, racial composition, age, household size, homeownership, and number of children, the

coefficient on the interaction term of red and treatment remains strong and significant. We also

test and reject that the red/blue state finding is driven by underlying differences in intensity of

prior support for the Organization (Table 6 Column 1).14

         These results, coupled with those discussed above, can lend insights into the broader

applicability of the elasticities reported in the supply-side literature. Even though some studies

have found negative and highly elastic price elasticities, many researchers have presented

estimates that strongly challenge the view that tax incentives are a useful stimulus to giving

(Peloza and Steel, 2005). The reported results have compelled some leading scholars to argue

that the overall evidence on the price effect is decidedly mixed (see, e.g., Steinberg, 1990; Auten

et al., 2002). Thus, we view our results as providing some confidence in the estimates in the


14
    Given the robustness of these results, we empirically explored three specific possible explanations for the
success of the matching grant in red but not blue states. First, we examined whether the immediate political
environment of the individual (perhaps capturing the political leaning of those they interact with most often)
matters, or whether it is indeed the state. We find that the political leaning of the county is irrelevant: individuals
living in red counties in blue states behave just like individuals living in blue counties in blue states (and do not
respond to the match), and individuals living in blue counties in red states behave just like individuals living in red
counties in red states (and respond significantly to the match). Perhaps individuals are more responsive to price
when they are considering goods for personal consumption? If individuals in red states perceive this Organization
to be engaged in work that could directly affect their lives, then perhaps they are more responsive because of the
private return to this Organization’s work. This would suggest that the red versus blue state differential was
masking an omitted variable, the Organization’s local activity. In complementary models we examine this by
including controls and interactions for the Organization’s activity. Including these variables does not change the
core result that the matching grant only worked in red states. Lastly, perhaps the red versus blue state merely
captured an observable difference in the dedication or passion of the individual donors. With no survey data
available on these individuals, the only measure we can use is prior giving. We run alternative models to examine
whether the red versus blue state finding is robust to the inclusion of controls and interactions for prior giving.
Indeed, those variables do not matter, and the red/blue state distinction remains the largest determinant of
responding to the matching grant offer. A theory from social psychology, untestable directly with our data and
experimental design, argues that individuals in a minority group have a stronger sense of social identity, and hence
perhaps the peer nature (a social cue) of the matching grant acted as a catalyst to trigger the salience of this
identity. This theory suggests that the “signal” (δ in our model) generated by the leadership gift is effective as
either a quality or timing signal, and that those in the minority political group are more responsive to such signals.



                                                                                                                     17
most recent literature, but they serve to highlight that wide context-specific variation exists, not

only based on demographics (e.g., income) but also on the timing and quality signal value of

leadership gifts.

                                        III.    Conclusions

       The supply side of the economics of charity typically utilizes a model of charitable

giving that treats donations no differently than any other purchase the consumer makes. In this

view, changes in tax deductibility emulate a change in the price of donating. This study pushes

this literature in a new direction by focusing on the price effects on the demand side of

charitable fundraising. In particular, we explore large price deviations by liberally changing the

match rate in an actual charitable fundraising field experiment that targeted over 50,000 donors.

       Several insights emerge. For example, we find that using leadership gifts as a matching

offer considerably increases both the revenue per solicitation and the probability that an

individual donates.     This finding supports the anecdotal evidence among fundraising

consultants on the efficacy of a matching mechanism. Yet, at odds with the conventional

wisdom, we find that larger match ratios (i.e., $3:$1 and $2:$1) relative to smaller match ratios

($1:$1) have no additional impact. This result directly refutes the integrity of using larger

match ratios, and stands in sharp contrast to current fundraising practices. In this light, our

results have practical import.

       Our data also provide a test of an important method used in cost-benefit analysis. Cost-

benefit analysis remains the hallmark of public policy decision making. Indeed, in the U.S.

President Clinton's Executive Order 12866, which reaffirmed the earlier executive order from

the Reagan Administration, requires that federal agencies consider costs, benefits, and




                                                                                                 18
economic impacts of regulations prior to their implementation.15 Estimation of benefits has

been controversial, but the state of the art method is a stated preference approach (e.g.,

contingent valuation) if the total economic value (use and non-use) of a non-marketed good or

service is sought. This approach has been criticized for several reasons, but perhaps most

importantly for its hypothetical nature and the fact that few contingent studies pass a formal

“scope” test (see, e.g. Diamond and Hausman, 1992; Kahneman and Knetsch, 1992). To the

best of our knowledge, our data represent a first attempt to explore the “scope” of a public good

that is actually provided in a naturally-occurring environment. In this regard, our data are

consistent with the insensitivities observed in the CVM literature.

         Finally, from a theoretical viewpoint, while our model provides insights into some of

our results, the size and starkness of the differential response rate suggests that further theory

would be useful. Future research in political psychology and social identity can help us better

understand why the matching grant works in red states but not blue states.16 Furthermore, in

light of the fact that Feldstein (1975) shows that price elasticities vary among the types of

charitable organizations, it is important to explore whether, and to what extent, our results on

heterogeneous spatial treatment effects are robust to other charity types such as religious,

educational, and environmental organizations. Perhaps the nature of an organization’s activities

influences whether donors contribute to gain “moral satisfaction” or to increase the provision of

15
   The more than 100 federal agencies issue approximately 4,500 new rulemaking notices each year. About 25
percent of those 4,500 are significant enough to warrant Office of Management and Budget review. Of those, about
50-100 per year meet the necessary condition of being “economically significant” (more than $100 million in either
yearly benefits or costs). Every economically significant proposal receives a formal analysis of the benefits and
costs by the agency.
16
   For example, our finding could be a political analog to the racial “acting white” phenomenon discussed in Austen-
Smith and Fryer (2006). The “acting white” phenomenon (being socially sanctioned for performing well in school)
occurs when blacks are in the minority in a school. Even if minority status makes one’s political identity stronger,
this is not sufficient to generate our result (in fact, as-is, that may argue that those in red states should give more on
average than those in blue states, all else equal, but we find the opposite). To fit our setting, one must also argue
that this identity is latent (perhaps out of frustration with their local political outcomes), and then primed by the
stimuli of the matching grant offer.


                                                                                                                      19
the public good. As our model predicts, the motive of the donor will lead to significantly

different response rates to manipulations of the price of the public good.

       These results highlight the usefulness of potential future research examining the relative

strength of non-price effects.    The fact that responsiveness to a matching grant is partly

determined by the political environment, rather than the economics of the matching grant itself,

is important and consistent with recent work that reveals the relative importance of non-

economic factors in driving decision-making in charitable giving (Landry, Lange et al. 2006)

and consumer credit (Bertrand, Karlan et al. 2005).        Manipulations that make salient the

importance or effectiveness of a gift can generate further donations (Vesterlund, 2003).

Clearly, further work is necessary to understand which signals generate such effects. Such

work will inform both positive and normative issues in economics. Further, such results will be

useful for theorists and empiricists interested in obtaining deeper insights about the motivations

behind the provision of public goods, as well as to non-profits interested in improving their

fundraising practices.
