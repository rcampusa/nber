                                               ABSTRACT

Although a large literature seeks to explain the “missing middle” of mid-sized firms in developing
countries, there is surprisingly little empirical backing for existence of the missing middle. Using microdata
on the full distribution of both formal and informal sector manufacturing firms in India, Indonesia,
and Mexico, we document three facts. First, while there are a very large number of small firms, there
is no “missing middle” in the sense of a bimodal distribution: mid-sized firms are missing, but large
firms are missing too, and the fraction of firms of a given size is smoothly declining in firm size. Second,
we show that the distribution of average products of capital and labor is unimodal, and that large firms,
not small firms, have higher average products. This is inconsistent with many models in which small
firms with high returns are constrained from expanding. Third, we examine regulatory and tax notches
in India, Indonesia, and Mexico of the sort often thought to discourage firm growth, and find no economically
meaningful bunching of firms near the notch points. We show that existing beliefs about the missing
middle are largely due to arbitrary transformations that were made to the data in previous studies.

I.     Introduction

         The notion that the distribution of firm size in poor countries is characterized by a
bimodal distribution with a "missing middle" is a widely accepted stylized fact in development.
The missing middle "fact" is cited as evidence for two broad stories of development. Perhaps the
most prominent one is that most firms in poor countries do not have the resources necessary to
grow. For example, advocates of microfinance argue that small firms have difficulty accessing
capital and thus do not grow to become medium sized firms.
         A second story for the missing middle is the dual economy view. There are two versions
of this story. One version is that large formal firms are subject to onerous regulations and higher
input costs. For example, the classic work by Harris and Todaro (1970) posits that formal firms
are forced to pay wages that are above the market clearing wage, or are subject to a variety of
regulations that small firms are exempt from. A second version is that the fixed cost of becoming
a large firm is high in poor countries. For example, Banerjee and Duflo (2005, 2011) argue that
the fixed costs of adopting modern technologies are prohibitively high in poor countries.
         What is missing in this literature is evidence on the distribution of firm size. An empirical
challenge is that available microdata on firm surveys rarely include small informal firms, and it
has previously been difficult to access microdata of complete economic censuses that capture all
firms. For example, the widely used Chilean Manufacturing data surveys firms with more than
ten employees, and the World Bank’s Economic Surveys that are widely available for many
countries only surveys formal firms. As a result, the little evidence we have on the distribution of
all firms tends to be based on a few aggregate tabulations of the data, which we show can lead to
misleading answers.
         In this paper we present evidence on the firm size distribution from India, Indonesia, and
Mexico where we have representative firm micro data on all manufacturing firms. Importantly,
the datasets we use includes small informal firms that account for a large share of employment in
these countries. We use the microdata on these firms, so can look at the complete distribution of
firm size, rather than arbitrary bins of the data.
         We present three facts. First, there is no evidence of a missing middle in India, Indonesia,
or Mexico, regardless of how we slice the data. To be sure, there are many more small firms in
developing countries – but while medium sized firms are missing in the data, large firms are
missing as well. Put differently, while there are fewer middle-sized firms in developing
countries than developed ones, there is no missing middle in the sense of a bimodal distribution.
The absence of a missing middle suggests that the two broad stories of development that cite the
missing middle “fact” are not correct, at least without modifications.
         Second, the average product of labor and capital is significantly lower in small firms
when compared to larger firms. This suggests that, to the extent that the average and marginal
products of capital move together, the view that small firms do not grow because they face high
marginal costs of capital is not likely to be correct. However, this fact supports the dual
economy view that large firms face constraints that raise the effective cost of their inputs
(relative to the costs faced by small firms.) Put differently, it is not that small firms cannot grow
because they faced large fixed costs or do not have access to credit. Instead, it is the large firms
that are more stifled and cannot grow.
         Third, there is no evidence of meaningful discontinuities anywhere in the firm size
distribution. In particular, we focus on areas where we believe there to be thresholds in
enforcement – a size threshold of 100 employees in India where various labor regulations kick in,
and a revenue threshold in Indonesia above which firms are required to pay VAT, and a revenue
threshold in Mexico above which firms face higher tax rates – and find no economically
meaningful bunching of firms around these thresholds.
        The absence of bunching around these thresholds suggests that stories based on
thresholds due to formality or regulations are unlikely to be causing major distortions in the
economy. This evidence does not rule out the possibility that such forces are present, but it
suggests that if fixed costs or thresholds are important, they must vary substantially across firms.
For example, if firms above a certain size are legally obligated to pay high minimum wages or
pay higher taxes, implementation of the minimum wage or enforcement of the tax law is
imperfect or the burden they impose is not large enough to significantly constrain firm growth.
        Where does this misconception about the missing middle come from? We suggest it
comes from the combination of two transformations that had previously been made to the data.
While there is much discussion of the missing middle, the main citation is a table on the
distribution of employment shares in a number of countries in Tybout’s (2000) well-known
survey article, much but not all of which is drawn from Leidholm and Mead (1987), which in
turn summarized a variety of other studies. Due to data limitations, these tabulations are for
most countries binned into three groups: firms with less than 10 employees, 10-49 employees,
and 50 or more employees. The “missing middle” refers to the fact that there is less employment
in the middle category (10-49 employees) than in the other two bins. In addition, these
tabulations present the distribution of employment share by firm size and not the distribution of
the number of firms by size. However, the relevant theories for which the missing middle is a
key fact are about the firm itself (e.g. firms over a size are differentially taxed, firms have trouble
getting credit so can’t grow above a certain size) and not about the employment share, which is
instead more relevant for understanding where the typical worker in the economy works.
        We show that the widely cited facts about the missing middle come from the product of
these two transformations of the data. That is, if we bin the firm size distribution into these three
broad bins, it still appears unimodal. Similarly, when plotted flexibly as a histogram, the
employment share distribution appears unimodal. Only when one groups the employment share
distribution into these three bins does the “missing middle” pattern emerge.
        The paper proceeds as follows. We first present the theories of development for which
the missing middle is a central fact, and discuss the auxiliary implications of these theories. We
then present facts from our data from India, Mexico, and Indonesia. We then discuss the source
of the perception of the existence of the missing middle. The final section discusses the
implications of our new facts for theories of economic development.

II.    The Missing Middle and Development

        There are at least two models of development where the missing middle is an important
stylized fact. Perhaps the most prominent is the view that the institutional environment in poor
countries discriminates against small firms and favors big firms. There are several versions of
such models. The most common is based on credit constraints, where small firms are credit
constrained and large firms are not. Closely related mechanisms are based on the idea that
property rights are protected for formal firms but not for informal firms (De Soto, 1989) and that
large firms have better access to intermediate inputs and output markets. Other models are based
on the idea that government interventions benefit large firms. This can be because large firms
are state owned firms, or because industrial policy targets large firms, or because large firms are
the beneficiaries of protectionism and entry barriers.
         We note that in addition to the missing middle, a central prediction of many of these
models is that the marginal return to resources should be higher in small firms compared to large
firms. This is because there are many small firms that are constrained so they have high marginal
products. For example, a number of papers show that the return to capital is very high in small
firms in developing countries (de Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff (2008), Anagol and Udry
(2006), Kremer et. al (2013)). In addition, while there is significant evidence that there is more
dispersion in the return to capital in developing countries, the question however is whether the
return to capital for small firms is higher than the return to capital for large firms.
         A second model of development that generates the missing middle is what we call the
“dual economy” view. For example, McKinsey (2001) argues that the most productive firms in
poor countries are as productive as the firms in rich countries but the vast majority of firms in
poor countries are low productivity ones. Bloom and Van Reenan (2007) provide similar
evidence, focusing on the distribution of the quality of management. This view harkens back to
Arthur Lewis’ (1954) famous characterization of poor countries as “islands of capitalist
employment, surrounded by a vast sea of subsistence workers…a few industries highly
capitalized, such as mining or electric power, side by side with the most primitive techniques; a
few high class shops, surrounded by masses of old style traders; a few highly capitalized
plantations, surrounded by a sea of peasants.”1 Banerjee and Duflo (2005 and 2011) make this
idea explicit. In their view, the marginal return from increasing scale is low for firms using
“primitive” technologies and high in firms using “modern” technologies. However, because the
fixed cost of modern technologies is prohibitively high in poor countries, only a small number of
firms adopt such technologies. These firms are Arthur Lewis’ “islands of capitalist employment”
while the “vast sea of subsistence workers” are employed in firms utilizing low fixed cost
primitive technologies.
         Another version of the dual economy view is that large firms are subject to constraints
and regulations that small firms are able to evade. The classic paper by Harris and Todaro (1970)
was the first to make this idea explicit by positing a “modern” sector that pays above-market
wages and a “traditional” sector that pays market wages. Rauch (1991) formally shows how this
mechanism can generate a missing middle by assuming a fixed threshold due to minimum wage
laws or labor unions above which firms have to pay above-market wages. Krueger (2009),
McKinsey (2005), and Levy (2008) are recent versions of the same idea, where large firms pay
taxes and are subject to regulations (in India, Brazil and Mexico, respectively) that smaller firms
are able to evade.
         We make following points about the empirical predictions of the dual economy model.
First, in the dual technology version of the model, the missing middle is generated by the
simultaneous presence of modern firms with high fixed costs and “primitive” firms with low
fixed costs. Second, in models where the average product of capital and labor are proportional to
their marginal products (such as Cobb-Douglas) and where the factor intensities are the same in
the types of firms, the average product of capital and labor will also be the same in large vs.
small firms. However, if high fixed cost technologies are also more capital intensive, then the
average product of labor would be higher and the average product of capital would be lower in
large firms (compared to small labor intensive firms). In addition, if some of capital measured in

the data includes the fixed cost of the modern technology, this would further lower the average
product of capital (the sum of fixed and variable capital) in large firms.
        Although a dual technology model with Cobb-Douglas production technologies predicts
that the average product of capital is lower for large modern firms, this prediction does not
generalize. For example, imagine that the production function for the two technologies is
Leontief (so the marginal product of capital and labor for a given technology is zero), and the
average product of capital and labor with the modern technology is higher than in firms using
traditional technologies. Here, although the average product of capital and labor in the
traditional firm is low, the marginal return from switching to the modern technology is
presumably high.
        In the “large firms are constrained” version of the model, the missing middle is due to the
fixed threshold above which firms face higher taxes or subject to onerous regulations. However,
if taxes or regulations are imperfectly enforced, say because of an inefficient bureaucracy, the
outcome will be a right skewed firm size distribution instead of a bimodal distribution. The
“constrained large firm” model also predicts that the marginal return to resources will be lower
in small firms compared to large firms. This is true even if taxes and regulations are imperfectly
enforced (and thus there is no missing middle).

III.    Results

Data
        Here we present evidence from the firm size distribution in India, and Indonesia, and
Mexico. We use these three countries since we could obtain complete, representative microdata
on the entire manufacturing sector for these countries, including both formal and informal
enterprises. These countries differ substantially in terms of GDP per capita, with Mexican real
GDP per capita about 4 times higher than India and Indonesia in the year our data was collected.2
        We use micro-data from the manufacturing sector in the Mexican Economic Census, the
Indonesian Economic Census, and India’s Annual Survey of Industries and National Sample
Survey (Schedule 2). The Mexican Economic Census is a complete enumeration of fixed
establishments. The Indonesian Economics Census is a complete enumeration of all
establishments with 20 or more employees (medium and large firms) and a random 5% sample
of establishments with 20 or fewer employees (small firms). We combine these two samples to
get a complete picture of the entire Indonesian manufacturing sector, including both formal and
informal enterprises. The Indian Annual Survey of Industries is a census of formal
establishments with more than 100 employees and a random survey of formal establishments
with less than 100 employees. The National Sample Survey is a survey of informal
establishments. We combine the data from the two surveys when we present evidence from
India. For each country, we present the most recent wave of data available. The key variable we
use is the number of workers, including unpaid family workers.

The Firm Size Distribution
        Figure 1 presents the distribution of firm size in bins of 10 workers. The first column
presents the size distribution of all firms. The first row presents the distribution for India (2011),
the second row for Indonesia (2006), and the third row for Mexico (2008). The figure shows that

2
 Real per capita GDP in PPP terms in the year of our data was $3,700 in India (2011), $3,600 in Indonesia (2006),
and $14,200 (2008) (World Bank World Development Indicators 2013).
the vast majority of firms in all three countries are small, with no evidence of bimodality in the
firm size distribution. The next columns focus on different samples of the data so that the
patterns are more easily visible. Specifically, we restrict the sample to firms with 10 to 200
workers (column 2), 20 to 200 workers (column 3), 50 to 200 workers (column 4), and 200 to
3000 workers (column 5). In all cases, the distribution of firm size is right skewed and generally
smoothly declining in firm size, with no evidence of bimodality or discontinuity. This is the first
key fact: there is no evidence of a “missing middle” of firms when one examines the raw
distributions of firm size in any of these three countries.
        Comparing the three countries, the fraction of small firms is lower in Mexico than in
India and Indonesia. About 90 percent of firms in Mexico employ less than 10 workers. In India
and Indonesia, the fraction of firms with less than 10 workers is visually indistinguishable from
100 percent. GDP per capita in Mexico is about four times higher than in India and Indonesia.
This suggests that development is associated with a decline in the right skew of size distribution,
but not with a less bimodal firm size distribution.
        It is worth noting that if one compares these countries to the US, there is a marked
difference: the US distribution of manufacturing firms has as its mode mid-sized firms with
about 45 employees (see Figure 14 in Hsieh and Klenow 2014), whereas the mode in each of
these countries are firms with 1 worker. There are fewer mid-sized firms in India, Indonesia, and
Mexico than in the US. But the overwhelming fact is that most firms are small in our three
developing countries – large firms are also missing, and there is no missing middle in the sense
of a bimodal distribution.

The Distribution of Average Products
        Instead of looking at the firm size distribution, we can also look for evidence for
bimodality in the forces that lie behind potential bimodality in the firm size distribution. For
example, models where capital constraints generate a bimodal size distribution also imply that
the return to capital is bimodal. For example, one might expect small unconstrained firms and
large unconstrained firms to have low returns to capital, but firms that are hitting the constraint –
the firms that would grow to be mid-sized firms but are “missing” – would have much higher
returns. Other theories, such as those based on the idea that large firms face higher labor costs,
those based on the notion that large firms have better access to intermediate inputs, and those
based on De Soto’s (1989) hypothesis that property rights of formal firms are better protected, all
imply that the return to all the resources used by the firm is bimodal, with one set of
unconstrained firms with low returns and one set of constrained firms with high returns.
        We do not directly measure the marginal return to inputs, but we can measure the average
return to capital, labor, and intermediate inputs. If revenue is generated by a Cobb-Douglas
function of the factor inputs, factor-intensities and markups are constant, and fixed costs are zero,
the marginal return of each input is proportional to its average product. We note however that
these assumptions do necessarily hold. In the dual technology model, the average product of
capital will be lower and the average product of labor higher in firms that utilize more capital
intensive technologies. In addition, the average product of the sum of variable and fixed capital
will be lower in firms with high fixed-cost technologies. If markups vary across firms, say
because more productive firms produce higher quality products that are more price inelastic, then
the average product of capital and labor will be higher in larger firms that produce high quality
products.
        Figure 2 looks for evidence of bimodality in the average product of factor inputs.
Specifically, it plots the distribution of the ratio of value-added to capital (column 1), value-
added to labor (column 2), and the ratio of gross output to the value of intermediate inputs
(column 3).3 We truncate the top and bottom percentile to make the histograms more easily
viewable. The distribution of the average product of capital and labor is not bimodal as suggested
by theories of capital constraints or labor costs. The distribution of the average product of
intermediate inputs is also not bimodal, but is roughly right skewed. This is consistent with
theories where a large number of firms use few intermediate inputs.
        Figure 3 looks directly at the correlation between the average product of inputs and firm
size. The first column presents the non-parametric relationship (from a Fan (1992) regression)
between the average product of capital with firm employment. The dashed lines in each figure
represent 95% confidence intervals.
         As can be seen, the average product of capital is increasing with firm employment. If
the average product of capital is proportional to the marginal product of capital, this suggests that
the marginal cost of capital is higher in large firms relative to small firms. This fact is
inconsistent with a widely held view that the return to capital is high in small firms in poor
countries, say because these firms have difficulty accessing capital. Put differently, if the return
to capital is high in small firms, the evidence in Figure 3 suggests that the return to capital in
large firms is even higher.
        This fact would be surprising if one believed in the dual technology view that large firms
operate capital intensive high-fixed cost technologies. For the large firms to have higher average
products of capital in this story, it would either need to be that the modern firms have high
average products of capital but low marginal products (so they are Leontief or close to it), or that
modern firms also face higher marginal capital costs and the net effect of the higher marginal
cost of capital outweighs the effect of capital intensive technologies and the higher fixed cost on
the average product of capital. Neither of these stories are theoretically impossible, but they are
not necessarily what one would have expected from the most standard versions of these theories.
        The second column in Figure 3 plots the non-parametric relationship between the average
product of labor with firm employment. The relationship is positive, as if the marginal cost of
labor inputs is increasing with firm employment. This is a prediction of the Banerjee-Duflo
(2005, 2011) dual technology model if modern technologies are more capital intensive, although
we note that this model is not supported by the evidence that the average product of capital is
also higher in larger firms. The fact that the average product of labor is higher in larger firms
also supports the story by Harris and Todaro (1970), McKinsey (2005), and Levy (2008) that
large firms pay above-market labor costs, except that there is no clear discontinuity in this
relationship. We note that La Porta and Shleifer’s (2008) also find that average labor
productivity increases with firm size (Table X and XI in La Porta and Shleifer, 2008) in the
World Bank Enterprise Surveys, except that we interpret the positive relationship as indicating
that large firms behave as if they face higher marginal labor costs.
        As discussed earlier, an alternative explanation for why the average product of labor and
capital might be higher in large firms is that larger firms charge higher markups. De Loecker
and Warzynski (2012) show that in this case, the markup will be proportional to the ratio of gross

3
  In Indonesia, the questionnaire administered to firms with fewer than 20 employees asked about capital differently
than the questionnaire administered to firms with 20 or more employees so we cannot construct a consistent measure
of the capital stock across these two samples. In the appendix, we show qualitatively similar patterns when we
separately examine firms with 20 or more employees and firms with less than 20 employees.
output to spending on intermediate inputs. The third column in Figure 3 shows the relationship
between revenue per intermediate input and firm size. Here, there is no evidence that the
average product of intermediate inputs is higher or lower in large firms relative to small firms. If
the marginal cost of intermediate inputs is the same for small vs. large firms, Figure 3 indicates
that markups are no higher in large firms. In turn, this suggests that that the higher average
product of capital and labor for large firms do not reflect higher markups but higher marginal
costs. Of course, it is possible that large firms charge higher markups but the effect of the higher
markup on the average product of intermediate inputs is exactly offset by lower marginal cost of
material inputs.
        Together, Figure 2 and Figure 3 produce our second set of stylized facts: the average
product of labor and capital is lower in small firms than in large firms, and there is no obvious
bimodality in any of these distributions. If we believed there was a “missing middle” of
constrained firms with high returns that could not grow, many models would have predicted
either small firms to have higher average products, or potentially an inverted U-shape, with a
mass of high average product and constrained firms in the middle of the distribution. However,
the data does not support this view.

Discontinuities in Firm Size from Tax and Regulatory Notches
         A frequently cited reason for the existence of the purported missing middle is that there is
a tax or regulatory notch. If firms above a certain size are subject to regulations, that would
create a bunching of firms at the notch point, and a missing distribution of firms above the kink
point. There are many examples of this: firms with few employees are frequently exempt from
labor regulations (such as benefits and hiring and firing costs), and there is often preferential tax
treatment for firms below a certain size threshold.
         Although a casual examination of the histograms in Figure 1 suggests no discontinuities,
it is possible that if we zoom in on places where we know ex-ante there are notches in the
regulatory environment we will detect something. In our setting, there are three such notches we
can examine. In India, the Industrial Disputes Act requires firms employing more than 100
workmen (i.e. 100 workers other than managers) to obtain government permission before laying
off workers. This suggests a discrete notch in labor regulation at 100 non-managerial employees,
which some have suggested is an important reason for the small size of firms in India.4
         In Indonesia, firms below a given revenue threshold are exempt from paying the 10%
VAT. This again creates a discrete notch, where we would expect bunching of firms below this
cutoff (Kleven and Waseem 2013). The cutoff is not indexed for inflation; instead, it is adjusted
discretely by the government periodically: adjustments were made in 1992 (50 percent nominal
increase), 1995 (100 percent nominal increase), 2001 (50 percent nominal increase), and 2004
(66 percent nominal increase). In 2006, the year of our census, the threshold was still where it
was in 2004, at IDR 600 million (about USD 65,000), and was not increased again until 2013
         In Mexico, we focus on the revenue threshold due to the simplified tax regime for small
firms. From 1998 until 2013, firms with sales below 2 million pesos (about USD 125,000 in
2008) pay a flat tax of about 2 percent of their sales and are exempt from payroll taxes, income

lay off workers from factories with more than 100 staff. This partly explains why most firms are so small.”

taxes, and VAT taxes. Firms above the 2 million peso threshold are subject a 15% VAT, a 38%
income tax, and a 35% payroll tax.5
         Figure 4 shows the distribution of non-managerial employment in India in 2011.6 We
zoom in on the range from 60 to 140 non-managerial employees, so we can focus on the 100
worker cutoff (shown by the vertical line). We focus on the distribution of all firms (left panel)
but also show the distribution of formal firms (center panel) and informal firms (right panel).
Since the regulation applies only to formal firms, it is possible that even if the regulation doesn’t
affect the total firm size distribution, it affects the decision to switch from formal to informal.
         Visually inspecting the leftmost panel of Figure 4, there is perhaps a slight bit of
bunching at 100 employees, but it is economically very small. In the bin just below the cutoff
(97-100 workers), there are a total of 1370 firms. In the next bin (101-104 firms), there are 1013
firms. Even abstracting from the fact that the overall distribution is downward sloping, so one
would expect fewer firms with 101-104 workers than 97-100 workers, the difference amounts to
at most 2 tenths of one percent of all Indian firms – a few hundred firms in all of India, out of the
17,177,148 total firms.
         Inspecting the central panel, there is no discontinuity whatsoever in formal firms; if
anything, there is a slight spike of firms with more than 100 workers. There is bunching of
informal firms just below 100, but again the economic magnitude is small: the difference
between the number of firms with 97-100 workers and 101-104 workers is about 2.5 tenths of
one-percent of all informal firms – or at most about 418 firms in total for all of India. Thus,
while there may be a small amount of bunching induced by the regulation, the amount we can
detect in the data does not suggest that it is an important driver of small firm size in India.
         For Indonesia, we focus on the discontinuity in revenue at IDR 600 million. One would
expect more heaping in revenue than in employment, since presumably revenue is easier to
adjust in order to stay under the threshold (e.g. firms can choose what year to realize revenue
from a given sale). The top panel of Figure 5 shows the distribution of revenue for all Indonesian
firms; the bottom panel zooms in on firms with more than 20 employees. Since virtually no firms
with fewer than 20 employees have revenue close to IDR 600 million, the figures in the bottom
panel are easier to read. In each panel, the left panel shows the distribution for all firms with less
than IDR 40 billion in revenue (about USD 4.3 million); to zoom in closer to the discontinuity,
the right panel zooms in on firms with less than IDR 1.8 billion in revenue (about USD 200,000).
         The figure (particularly the bottom-right), which zooms in on the relevant part of the
cutoff shows no bunching at the discontinuity in VAT eligibility. Since virtually all firms in the
relevant part of the revenue distribution are from the large firm survey, which is conducted
annually, we can re-generate the zoomed-in graph for large firms for each year back to 1990, and
see if there are any changes in firm size associated with the different cutoffs that were in place
over the years. In the online appendix, we show this figure, with the relevant cutoff line shown
each year. Again, we never find any substantial bunching at the discontinuities.
         Next, we focus on the potential discontinuity above 2 million pesos in Mexico due to the
simplified tax regime for small firms. The left panel in Figure 6 shows the distribution of sales
for all Mexican firms with less than 6 million pesos in sales; the right panel zooms in on firms
with sales between 1 and 4 million. As can be seen, there is no bunching at the discontinuity of 2

million pesos (the vertical line) after which firms legally switch from a flat 2% sales tax regime
to the combination of the VAT, income tax, and payroll tax regime.
         Combined, the evidence from India, Mexico, and Indonesia suggest a third important fact:
at least as we can measure it in our data, we do not see important discontinuities in firm size,
either in general when looking at the distributions or when we zoom in around the places where
one would expect them a-priori based on regulatory and tax notches.
         It is worth noting that there are a small number of other papers that have found some
bunching of firms around similar notches, but in most of these cases the quantitative magnitude
of the bunching is small. For example, Onji (2009) examines the introduction of VAT threshold
in Japan and looks for bunching around the threshold, much as we do in Indonesia. Although he
does find evidence of bunching, the magnitude appears very small: the share of firms below the
threshold falls by less than 0.5 percent. Similarly, Schivardi and Torrini (2008) examine a
discontinuity in Italian employment regulations that applies to firms greater than 15, much as we
do in India. They estimate that after removing the threshold, average firm size would increase by
less than 1 percent. Similarly, Garicano, LeLarge and Van Reenen (2013) estimate the impact of
lifting French regulations that apply to firms with 50 or more workers. Their model implies that
about 3 percent of workers are reallocated from firms of size 50 or more to firms of size 49 and
below. Under the assumption of flexible wages, their model estimates an output loss of 0.16
percent of GDP associated with this change, though the assumption of fully inflexible wages
yields substantially larger estimates. The evidence we present from India, Indonesia, and Mexico
is consistent with the generally small magnitudes of bunching observed in other contexts, with
the possible exception of France.

IV.    Where did the misconception come from?

         Given the facts presented in this paper, a natural question is where the misconception
about the missing middle – in the sense of the bimodality of the distribution – comes from. We
suggest it comes from the combination of two transformations that had previously been made to
the data. In the economics literature, the main evidence typically cited for the missing middle is
Table 1 of Tybout (2000). In that table, Tybout shows the distribution of employment shares
across plant sizes for manufacturing firms for 19 countries. For most countries in the table, he
shows the number of workers in firms of size 1-9, 10-49, and 50+; for a few countries, he
includes 5 or 6 bins of firms instead. The data the table is in turn drawn from other calculations
done by a variety of other authors, most notably Leidholm and Mead (1987), who compile
similar tabulations from other studies. The “missing middle” refers to the fact that in most
developing countries, there is substantially lower employment share in the mid-sized category
(i.e. firms of 10-49 employees) than in either the small category (fewer than 10 employees) or
the large category (50 or more employees). For example, in Indonesia in 1977, the table shows
77 percent of total manufacturing employment is in firms of size 1-9, 7 percent is in firms of size
10-49, and 16 percent is in firms of size 50 or more.
         There are two important differences between the facts reported in the Tybout and
Liedholm and Mead tables and the facts we present here. First, the existing tables refer to the
employment share, i.e. what fraction of total manufacturing employment comes from firms of a
given size, rather than the distribution of firm size. That is, the employment share distribution
reveals in what size firm a typical worker in the economy works, whereas the firm size
distribution reveals the distribution of firms. To compute the employment share statistic, one
multiplies the number of firms in each bin with the average employment size of firms in the bin.
While the employment share statistic is interesting for understanding the aggregate distribution
of employment, most theories about the existence of the missing middle discussed above are
about firm size itself. For example, theories about tax and regulatory notches and credits
constraints are all about whether firms should grow above a certain size, not about the
employment share in aggregate.
         The employment share transformation, in itself, does not create a missing middle. Figure
7 shows the distribution of employment share, analogous to what is shown in Figure 1 for the
distribution of firm size. Although it is shifted to the right (mechanically) from the firm size
distribution, it still appears unimodal in both countries.
        The second transformation is that instead of showing the data as nonparametric
histograms, due to data limitations, the tabulations reported in these papers are arbitrarily binned
into a small number of groups: for most countries, the authors report the totals for three bins,
firms with less than 10 employees, 10-49 employees, and 50 or more employees.
        To see what difference this makes, Table 1 reports the distribution of firm size (panel A)
and the distribution of employment shares (panel B) from our data, grouped into these same 3
categories. Panel A shows that the firm size distribution, even when binned, shows the same
pattern as the histograms – the density of firms is monotonically declining in firm size. But,
Panel B shows that when we apply the arbitrary binning transformation to the employment share
distribution, the pattern from Tybout (2000) re-emerges. For example, in Indonesia in 2006 our
data, 54 percent of total employment is in firms with 1-9 employees, 12 percent is in firms with
10-49 employees, and 34 percent in firms with 50 or more employees – the same missing middle
phenomenon reported by Tybout (2000). Thus, the existing facts about the missing middle seem
to come from the combination of these two transformations to the data – the transformation from
the distribution of firms to the aggregate employment share, and the arbitrary binning of the
employment share distribution rather than examining the distribution non-parametrically.

V.     Implications for Theories of Development

         Ultimately, the main reason we care about whether the size distribution in developing
countries is bimodal or not is what the size distribution tells us about the relevance of alternative
theories of development. The absence of bimodality in the size distribution suggests that neither
the “small firms are constrained” nor dual economy theories of development are correct in their
simplest form. In addition, the fact that the average returns to capital and labor are lower in
small firms suggests that the view that small firms are constrained, say because they have
difficulty accessing capital and thus have a high return to capital, is inconsistent with the simple
versions of these models.
         What would it take to reconcile the models to the facts? It is not enough to simply posit
alternative, more capital-intensive production technologies for large vs. small firms, as it is likely
that large firms use more capital intensive technologies that, all else equal, would lower the
average product of capital in large firms. To make such a dual-economy model fit the facts, one
would need the high productivity firms to have high average products of capital but low marginal
products of capital, and vice-versa. Moreover, one would need substantial heterogeneity across
firms in the employment size in the high intensity firms in order to avoid generating bimodality
in the firm size distribution. It is theoretically possible to write down such models, but the facts
presented here substantially constrain the types of models one can write down.
        An alternative theory that fits all our facts is the view that large firms are constrained, say
by taxes or regulations, but that implementation of these barriers is imperfect. Levy (2008), for
example, documents that the vast majority of small and mid-size firms in Mexico evade the 35%
payroll tax. This view is consistent with the evidence that there is little meaningful discontinuity
in the size distribution, even at thresholds at which one would expect a discontinuity if taxes or
regulations were perfectly enforced. This also implies that the problem is unlikely to be the
(relatively easy to fix) notch in the tax or regulatory code; rather, it suggests that it there is a
confluence of factors that make enforcement easier in larger firms, so that costs from regulation
are rising smoothly in firm size. Another key prediction of the large firms are constrained view is
that the marginal return to resources would be higher in large firms, which is supported by the
fact that the average product of capital and labor is consistently higher in large firms when
compared to small firms. If correct, the fact that firm size distribution in poor countries is
dominated by small firms is because these firms choose not to exert the effort necessary to grow
because their marginal cost would rise if they did grow.
        Put differently, the problem of development is how to relieve the differential constraints
faced by large firms and not how to relax the constraints faced by small firms. In turn, this view
of the world suggests that programs such as microcredit or simplified tax regimes that benefit
only small firms will worsen the development problem by further increasing the incentive to stay
small.
