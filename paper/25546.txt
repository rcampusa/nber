Since 2002, the US government has encouraged business investment using accelerated
depreciation policies that significantly reduce investment costs. We provide the first in-depth
analysis of this stimulus on employment and earnings. Our local labor markets approach exploits
cross-industry differences in policy generosity interacted with county-level variation in industry
concentration. Places that experience larger decreases in investment costs see a level increase in
employment that implies a $53,000 cost-per-job. We find no positive effects on average earnings.
In contrast, we document a persistent growth in capital. These results imply a capital-labor
substitution elasticity that grows over time and can exceed unity.

   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 allows firms to immediately deduct or “expense”
capital investments from their taxable income, effectively making business investment cheaper.
While previous research has shown that similar policies implemented during the previous two
decades significantly increased capital investment, the effects of these accelerated depreciation
policies on the labor market have not been rigorously evaluated. This empirical void is startling
given that job creation and wage growth are central goals of investment tax incentives and that
expensing will cost the federal government $119.4 billion over the next five years (JCT, 2017).
   This paper provides the first in-depth analysis of the effects of accelerated depreciation policies
on employment and earnings by estimating how bonus depreciation affects local labor markets.
Bonus depreciation allows firms to deduct an additional percentage of capital expenditures in the
first year of an asset’s tax life. While this federal tax policy was not targeted at specific industries
or locations, we show there is significant geographic variation in the benefits of the policy. This
variation emerges from the fact that longer-lived assets experience a larger reduction in the
present value cost of investment since bonus depreciation accelerates deductions from farther in
the future. Bonus depreciation will therefore have larger effects on local labor markets where
firms invest, on average, in longer-lived assets. To study the effects of this policy on local labor
markets, we measure a county’s exposure to bonus depreciation by interacting industry-level
heterogeneity in the measured benefit of bonus depreciation with industry location data.
   Our main result is that, even though bonus depreciation stimulated investment, the ultimate
goal of sustained job creation and wage growth proved elusive. While we document that more
exposed areas saw a level increase in employment, the number of jobs created was small relative
to the cost of the policy. Similarly, we find temporary earnings gains that dissipate by 2012.
Comparing the continued growth in capital to the short-lived employment gains implies a growing
pattern of substitution from labor to capital. Thus, while bonus depreciation stimulated capital,
it is hard to motivate the future use of similar policies on the grounds of helping workers.
   We develop these results in four steps. First, we quantify the cumulative effects of our expo-
sure measure on employment growth between 2002–2012. We find that bonus depreciation had
a level effect on employment. Specifically, increasing a location’s exposure to bonus depreciation
by one Inter-quartile Range (IQR) unit – or from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the distribu-
tion – increased employment by 1.9% on average over our sample period. Relative to the cost of
the policy, this employment increase implies a relatively high cost-per-job created of $53,000.


                                                   1
      From the perspective of the labor market, bonus depreciation could be an effective stimulus if
the stalled employment growth we observe is coupled with increases in productivity and wages.
In a second step, we find that bonus depreciation led to a short-lived increase in total earnings
that crests in 2005. We then see a retraction of these earnings gains, which all but disappear by
2012. We do not find a positive effect on earnings-per-worker.
      One hypothesis that could explain the lackluster effects on the labor market would be that
bonus depreciation only had a short-term effect on capital accumulation. As a third step, we
explore whether the stock of equipment capital responds to the policy. Juxtaposing the labor
market effects, we find significant and persistent increases in the capital stock. These results are
in line with Zwick and Mahon (2017, henceforce ZM), who show that bonus has similar effects on
investment in the early and late periods of our sample.1 Together the investment, employment,
and earnings responses suggest that instead of generating persistent growth in jobs and wages,
capital deepening was followed by a pattern of substitution away from labor.
      In our final step, we leverage our unique empirical setting to estimate whether this tax
incentive leads firms to substitute labor for capital. Since both capital and labor increase until
2005, we initially find no evidence of substitution between capital and labor. However, by 2010,
we find that a one percent decrease in the relative cost of capital caused capital to increase by
more than 1% relative to labor. These dynamics imply that over time it becomes easier for firms
to replace workers with machines.
      Our empirical findings rely on a difference-in-differences event-study approach. The assump-
tion behind this research design is that our measure of policy exposure is not correlated with other
shocks that coincide with the implementation of bonus depreciation and that also affect employ-
ment and earnings. We support this assumption in several ways. First, we show graphically that
changes in employment and earnings are uncorrelated with bonus depreciation exposure prior
to initial implementation. Second, our results are robust to including subsector-by-year fixed
effects suggesting that differing labor market trends across subsectors are not driving our results.
Third, our results are also robust to including state-by-year fixed effects; state-level policies or
shocks do not confound our results. Fourth, our results are not affected by controlling for county
characteristics or other within-state shocks, such as trade exposure. Fifth, we find no effects of
a placebo treatment based on exposure to long duration industries with relatively little equip-
  1
      House and Shapiro (2008) also find persistent effects on investment after the early years of bonus depreciation.

ment. Our placebo test shows that our estimates are due to the policy itself and not to trends
in industries with longer-lived assets. Finally, any challenge to our identification strategy needs
to account for the persistent effects on capital accumulation. While the assumption underlying
our research design is fundamentally untestable, our empirical strategies and robustness checks
significantly limit the risk that our findings are the result of a spurious relation.
    Our findings contribute to several literatures. First, we contribute to a growing literature
that studies the impacts of accelerated depreciation policies by providing the first systematic
analysis of the effects of federal bonus depreciation on the labor market (Hall and Jorgenson,
1967; Cummins et al., 1994; House and Shapiro, 2008; Edgerton, 2010; Kitchen and Knittel,
2011; Maffini et al., 2016; Zwick and Mahon, 2017; Ohrn, 2018b). Second, our findings improve
our understanding of the effects of corporate taxation on economic behavior, labor markets, and
inequality (Kovak et al., 2017; Arulampalam et al., 2012; Fuest et al., 2018; Suárez Serrato and
Zidar, 2016; Nallareddy et al., 2018; Yagan, 2015). In particular, this paper shows that national
policies, such as a federal tax policy, can have large effects on local labor markets (Autor et al.,
2016; Kline and Moretti, 2014; Dix-Carneiro and Kovak, 2017; Suárez Serrato, 2018). Finally, our
empirical setting provides a unique opportunity to estimate the elasticity of substitution between
labor and capital. In doing so, we provide new estimates that contribute to the literature studying
this central elasticity (Caballero et al., 1995; Chirinko et al., 2011; Oberfield and Raval, 2014;
Doraszelski and Jaumandreu, 2018; Raval, 2018).
    Our results are immediately relevant for policy makers concerned with job creation and wage
growth. If the estimated trends in the substitution between capital and labor persist, then
incentives for capital accumulation in the TCJA will likely have small effects on employment and
wage growth and may induce investment in labor-replacing capital. Policy makers looking to
stimulate labor markets with these tax incentives for capital accumulation should proceed with
extreme caution.


I    Bonus Depreciation and Local Labor Demand
Since 2002, the federal government has often relied on bonus depreciation to stimulate investment.
The policy decreases the after-tax present value cost of new investments by allowing firms to
deduct a ‘bonus’ percentage of the purchase price of a new investment from their taxable income



                                                  3
in the year the investment is made.2 A 30% bonus depreciation was first enacted in 2002 as
part of the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act. The policy was initially understood to be
temporary, but it was extended to 2003–2004 at a higher, 50% rate. Bonus depreciation was
turned off in 2005–2007 before it was re-implemented in response to the 2008 recession. Apart
from 2011, when bonus was set at 100% (i.e., immediate expensing), bonus depreciation was
available at 50% between 2008–2017. In 2017, TCJA set the bonus rate at 100% for investments
made after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023. Overall, the average value of bonus
in our sample period of 2002–2012 was 39% and it decreased the after-tax present value cost of
new investments by about 2.25% (ZM).
       Previous studies show that federal bonus depreciation increased business investment. Based
on industry-level investment data, House and Shapiro (2008) found substantial increases in in-
vestment when bonus depreciation was implemented in 2002. They also found evidence that
temporary incentives had effects on investment that persisted after bonus was turned off in 2005.
Using financial statement data, Edgerton (2010) found that bonus depreciation created strong
investment incentives even for firm with net-operating losses. ZM is the current gold-standard
in the literature. Using corporate tax return data, ZM find sizable investment effects that were
concentrated among smaller firms.3
       All three of these studies use similar industry-level identification strategies based on Cummins
et al. (1994). The crucial insight is that the types of assets that a business purchases determine
the extent to which bonus depreciation affects its investment plans. Assets that are depreciated
slowly for tax purposes benefit substantially from bonus depreciation because tax deductions are
moved from farther into the future to the present. In contrast, assets that are depreciated quickly
benefit very little from the policy. Therefore, industries that typically invest in long-lived assets
see larger decreases in the average after-tax present value price of new capital than industries
that invest in short-lived assets.
       While policymakers often design incentives that target capital formation, increased invest-
ment is but a means to an end. For instance, the Council of Economic Advisers argued that
capital deepening through policies including 100% bonus depreciation would raise workers’ wages
   2
    Section 168(k) details the policy and the types of investments that qualify.
   3
    Other countries and US states also provide bonus-like policies. Maffini et al. (2016), Criscuolo et al. (2012),
and Zhang et al. (2018) find strong investment responses to similar policies in the UK and China, and Ohrn
(2018b) finds state-level bonus depreciation increased investment but not employment.



                                                        4
(CEA, 2017).4 Whether and to what extent increases in business investment generated by bonus
depreciation translate into gains for workers depends on the interconnected roles of capital and
labor. If capital complements labor, increased investment driven by bonus depreciation will in-
crease labor demand and – by extension – employment, compensation, and wages. If, however,
investment incentivized by bonus depreciation is a substitute for labor, or even certain kinds
of labor, bonus depreciation may decrease labor demand, employment, and wages and further
increase the unequal distribution of income. This dichotomy motivates us to study how bonus de-
preciation affects employment and earnings to better understand whether new capital augments
or supplants the efforts of workers.


II      Measuring Local Exposure to Bonus Depreciation
This paper measures the cumulative effects of federal bonus depreciation on local labor markets.
To identify these effects, we create a county-level measure of exposure to the policy by interacting
subsector-level treatment data from ZM and county-level subsector composition data from the
Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW).

A       Bonus Depreciation Intensity Measure

Our measure of treatment intensity relies on estimates of which industries benefit most from
bonus depreciation. In the absence of bonus depreciation, the Modified Accelerated Cost Recov-
ery System (MACRS) details tax rules for the depreciation of new assets. The present value of
depreciation deductions associated with $1 of investment is equal to
                                                T
                                           0
                                                X        1
                                          z =                  Dt ,
                                                t=0
                                                      (1 + r)t

where T is the class-life of the asset, Dt is the portion of the dollar that is depreciated in year
t, and r is the rate used to discount future cash flows. MACRS rules specify T and Dt in each
period for each type of investment. Long-lived assets — as compared to short-lived assets —
are depreciated more slowly over longer lives and have smaller z 0 s. Therefore, tax deductions
generated by long-lived assets are worth less in present value terms.
    4
   In contrast, Barro and Furman (2018) argue that expensing may be desirable since it matches corporate tax
deductions with investment cash out-flows.




                                                      5
        Bonus depreciation allows firms to write off b percent of qualifying investments immediately;
the remaining 1 − b percent are depreciated according to MACRS rules. Bonus reduces the
present value cost of investment by b(1 − z 0 ). Since this difference is larger when z 0 is smaller —
when assets have longer class-lives and are depreciated more slowly — z 0 is a measure of bonus
depreciation treatment intensity.
        ZM calculate an industry-level measure of z 0 as follows. First, they calculate z 0 for each
asset-class defined by MACRS assuming a 7% discount rate. Second, they use tax return data to
calculate the share of each bonus-eligible asset-class purchased by each 4-digit NAICS industry.
Finally, ZM weight the asset-class z 0 s by the industry shares to create zj0 , which measures the
present value of depreciation deductions for the average asset in which industry j invests. It
is worth noting that zj0 ’s vary considerably even within a given sector. Figure 1A displays the
within-sector coefficients of variation relative to the manufacturing sector. This figure shows that
there is significant variation in zj0 ’s across industries in the Accommodation and Food Services,
Manufacturing, Retail Trade, and Health Care sectors.5

B        Local Exposure to Bonus Depreciation

Our measure of exposure focuses on industries that typically invest in long-lived assets and have
the smallest zj0 ’s. As shown in Figure 1A, there is considerable within-sector variation in zj0 ’s
implying that industries that invest in long-lived assets are not in a specific sector. We define an
industry as treated if it is in the bottom third of the zj0 distribution.6 The sector with the largest
share of employment among treated industries is Accommodation and Food Services with 33%.
Industries in the Manufacturing, Retail Trade, and Health Care and Social Assistance sectors
contribute an additional 40% of the employment in long duration industries.7
        We now map our industry-level treatment onto counties. QCEW provides county-by-industry
employment data using 4-digit NAICS categories. Using these data, we construct Exposure (to
Long-Duration Industries) as

                                                       Empjc2001 1(treatedj = 1)
                                                P
                                                   j
                              Exposurec =                P                       ;                              (1)
                                                            j Empjc2001

    5
     Table G1 summarizes zj0 ’s by sector.
    6
     Since the distribution of zj0 is left-skewed, we identify the industries that are most affected by the policy.
While there is a natural break at the 33rd percentile, the Online Appendix shows our results are robust to splitting
the distribution at the 25th or 40th percentiles.
   7
     Figure G1 shows the fraction of long-duration employment by sector.

the percentage of employees in each county working in treated industries in the year 2001. For
example, our county-level Exposure measure would be 0.2 if 20% of employees work in treated
industries and the remaining 80% work in untreated industries.8
        Figure 1B plots our county-level Exposure measure relative to the state average. This map
shows there is considerable variation in Exposure within a given state.9 For example, only 16% of
employment in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, occurs in long-duration industries. Meanwhile,
56% of employment in nearby Atlantic County, New Jersey, occurs in long-duration industries.
These two locations on polar opposites of our Exposure distribution are only 120 miles apart.
        Overall, our Exposure variable captures significant differences in tax incentives across lo-
cal labor markets and allows us to measure the unequal geographic benefits of federal bonus
depreciation.

C        Estimating Equation and Identification Strategy

We use an event-study framework to measure the cumulative effects of bonus depreciation on
local labor markets from 2002-2012. The regression specification we estimate is
                           2012                          
                                βy Exposurec × 1(t = y) + X0 c γ t + µst + νjt + cjt ,
                           X
          ∆Empcjt = α +                                                                                       (2)
                               y=1997

where
                                                    Empcjt − Empcj2001
                                     ∆Empcjt ≡                         ,
                                                       Empcj2001
is defined as the county-by-subsector percentage change in employment between year t and 2001.
Because county-by-subsectors vary in size, we weight this regression by the national share of
employment in each county-subsector in 2001.10 We estimate similar specifications to quantify the
effects of bonus on total compensation, compensation-per-employee, and the stock of equipment
capital. We scale Exposure so the coefficients βy capture the dynamic effects of an increase in
Exposure from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the distribution.
        The identifying assumption of Equation 2 is that cjt is not correlated with our measure of
Exposure. The differenced county-subsector outcomes eliminate any concerns that permanent
    8
      Our results are robust to redifining our shock based on employment patterns in 2008.
    9
      Figure 1B plots Exposure relative to the state mean since our empirical analyses include state-by-year fixed
effects. Figure G2 plots a raw measure of exposure. Table G2 lists the most and least Exposed counties.
   10
      “Subsectors” denote 3-digit NAICS categories. We use a balanced-panel of county-subsectors as our ob-
servational unit because QCEW data provide better coverage at this level. Our results are similar when using
county-by-4-digit NAICS outcomes.

                                                        7
level differences across county-subsectors can be correlated with Exposure and drive our results.11
Our preferred specification includes state-by-year fixed effects, µst , which account for the effects
of time-varying state-level policies such as changes in state-level corporate tax rates (Suárez
Serrato and Zidar, 2017) or state-level adoption of bonus depreciation (Ohrn, 2018b). We also
include subsector-by-time fixed effects, νjt , which rule out the concern that other industry-by-
time variation may be responsible for our empirical results.12
       Additionally, we include county-level controls, Xc , to isolate the portion of Exposure that
is unrelated to contemporaneous policy shocks, initial business conditions, and demographic
characteristics. Xc includes exposure to trade from NAFTA (Hakobyan and McLaren, 2016),
China (Autor et al., 2016), and the domestic production activities deduction (Ohrn, 2018a), the
share of routine labor (Autor and Dorn, 2013), tangible and intangible capital stock measures,
and demographic characteristics from the 2000 Census.13
       Because Exposure is defined at the county-level, we cluster standard errors within counties
(Cameron and Miller, 2015).
       By ruling out level differences, state-by-year shocks, subsector-by-year shocks, and other
observable shocks, we significantly reduce the risk that our results are driven by some spurious
relation and increase the likelihood that we provide unbiased estimates of the effects of bonus
depreciation.


III        Local Labor Market Effects of Bonus Depreciation
We begin by examining the effects of bonus depreciation on employment in Figure 2A. This figure
shows that county-subsectors with a greater Exposure to bonus depreciation were on similar
growth paths before the onset of the policy in 2002. Upon implementation, employment in more
Exposed county-subsectors experienced additional growth through 2005, relative to other units.
The increase in employment tapered slightly during years 2005–2007 before stabilizing during
the 2009–2012 period.14
  11
     This eliminates the need to include county-subsector fixed effects in our regressions.
  12
     This specification addresses a major criticism of studies that measure the effects of tax policy using industry-
by-time variation (Cummins et al., 1994; House and Shapiro, 2008; Zwick and Mahon, 2017; Ohrn, 2018a).
  13
     Capital measures come from BEA data on the Current-Cost Net Capital Stock of Private Fixed Assets.
Demographic characteristics include the share of population with less then a high-school degree and the share
with a college degree, as well as white and black shares of the population. See Appendices A-B for more detail.

    Table 1 reports the average effect on employment for years 2003–2012. Our main specification
in column (2) shows that increasing the Exposure to bonus depreciation from the 25th to the
75th percentile of the exposure distribution increased employment by 1.9%. Column (1) excludes
state-by-year fixed effects. Column (3) winsorizes the employment treatment weights at the 1%
level and column (4) limits the analysis to county-subsectors with more than 1,000 employees in
2001. Our estimate in the absence of state-by-year fixed effects suggests that state shocks are
largely uncorrelated with Exposure while the stability of our results with winsorized treatment
weights and without small county-subsectors suggests neither very large nor very small units
of observation are primarily responsible for our estimates. Overall, bonus depreciation led to
persistent differences in employment across county-subsectors during the period 2003-2012.15
    To better appreciate the magnitude of this effect, we compare the fiscal cost of the policy to
the number of jobs it created. Relative to the 109.3 million workers in the US in 2001 (QCEW,
2018), our estimates suggest that the average Exposure level would increase employment by 5.65
million jobs.16 Compared to estimates from the GAO (2013) that place the 10 year cost of bonus
depreciation at $297.5 billion, the cost-per-job created is approximately $53,000.17
    This cost-per-job is greater than estimates from the literature on fiscal multipliers (Suárez
Serrato and Wingender, 2016; Chodorow-Reich, 2017), which place the cost-per-job from gov-
ernment spending closer to $30,000. Zidar (2017) finds a cost-per-job of $30,000 when personal
income tax cuts are directed to earners in the bottom 10% of the income distribution and $60,000
when tax cuts are equally split between low and high income earners. Closest to our estimate,
Suárez Serrato (2018) finds that repealing tax credits for US multinationals resulted in a cost-
per-job of $48,000. Thus, while bonus depreciation had measurable effects on the labor market,
our results suggest that tax cuts to corporations are not the most cost-effective forms of stimulus.
    One source of the employment gains from Exposure to bonus may be the geographic relocation
of workers. Appendix E shows we obtain similar results when we analyze the effects of bonus on
without controls. Appendix C lists additional robustness checks.
  15
     Appendix D discusses the role of corporate losses and Section 179 in interpreting these estimates. Adjusting
for these time-varying factors has relatively small effects on our results.
  16
     This follows from an average value of Exposure of 2.72 (IQR units), an effect of 1.9%, and base employment
of 109.3 million jobs: 5.65 = 109.3 × 0.019 × 2.72. Since our estimates are based on cross-sectional variation that
absorbs general equilibrium effects, we can not directly estimate the macroeconomic effects of bonus depreciation.
See Fuchs-Schuendeln and Hassan (2016) for related approaches to estimating effects of macroeconomic policies.
  17
     The GAO (2013) estimates that 100% bonus depreciation cost $76.1 billion for one year. Given the average
bonus depreciation level during our sample period was 39%, we calculate a 10 year cost of $297.5 billion.




                                                        9
the employment-to-population ratio, which accounts for this factor. While we find that bonus
has very similar dynamic effects on the employment-to-population ratio, these estimates imply
a larger cost-per-job holding population constant of $73,000.

A        Effects on Compensation and Compensation per Worker

We extend our analysis of bonus depreciation to county-subsector compensation and compensa-
tion per worker in Figures 2B-2C. Cumulative compensation patterns do not differ by Exposure
in the pre-period. Upon bonus implementation in 2002, compensation in more Exposed county-
subsectors increases substantially relative to less Exposed units. In contrast to employment, the
effects on compensation decline after 2005 and are no longer statistically significant by 2008–
2012. Our estimates in Table 1 suggest that one unit of IQR Exposure to bonus depreciation
increased cumulative compensation by 1.7% from 2003–2012, on average.
       Figure 2C shows that bonus depreciation had no effect on compensation per worker during
the pre-period or during the years 2002–2006. Compensation per worker in more exposed county-
subsectors then decreases during the 2009–2012 period. Table 1 shows that a one unit of IQR
Exposure decreases cumulative compensation per worker by 0.5% during the treatment period.
The timing of the decline in compensation per worker coincides with decrease in the compensation
effects, suggesting changes in compensation per worker explain some of the later-period decline in
total compensation. Overall, the lack of persistent growth in earnings and even slightly negative
effects on earnings per worker starkly contradict the prediction that capital deepening would
translate into productivity and wage growth.
       The compensation declines during the later half of the treatment period may be driven by a
shift in the types of jobs created by bonus depreciation. To explore this hypothesis, we estimate
the employment effects of Exposure on county-subsectors that were most likely to lose jobs to
automation (as defined by Autor, 2015) during the 2007–2012 period.18 Figure 3A presents the
results of this exercise and shows that county-subsectors that were most likely to lose jobs to
automation were extra responsive in the early years of the policy. These same county-subsectors
then saw more rapid declines in cumulative employment after 2006. As many jobs lost to au-
  18
    We classify a county-subsector as High Automation if the county-subsector is in the top third of county-
subsectors in terms of the percentage of jobs classified by Autor (2015) as the fastest declining industries in
2007–2012. We link occupations to subsectors using 2002 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational
Employment Statistics. We then regress percentage changes in employment on Exposure and Exposure interacted
with High Automation to produce Figure 3A.


                                                      10
tomation were well-paid jobs in production, administration, and sales, the rapid decline in these
county-subsectors likely explains some of the later-period declines in compensation and compen-
sation per worker.

B        Capital Stock Responses to Bonus Depreciation

We now explore whether the employment and compensation effects we observe are due to response
patterns in the policy’s primary target: capital accumulation. To apply our methodology to
capital, we use BEA data on the Current-Cost Net Capital Stock of Private Nonresidential
Fixed Assets to create county-level measures of the stock of equipment capital, Kct . We then
calculate the percentage change in capital relative to 2001 for each county to estimate a version
of Equation 2.19
       One limitation of the fact that our capital stock outcome does not vary across subsectors in a
given county is that we cannot include subsector-by-year fixed effects in this analysis. Without
these fixed effects, we observe that the capital stock declines in counties with greater exposure
to bonus depreciation prior to 2002. To correct for these “pre-trends,” we employ an estimator
proposed by Freyaldenhoven et al. (2018, henceforth FHS). This estimator uses the fact that
intellectual property (IP) capital is not eligible for bonus and shares the same pre-trends as
equipment capital. The parallel trends in IP allow the estimator to correct for the unobserved
confounders behind the equipment pre-trends.20 Our specification of the effects on capital accu-
mulation then includes the controls mentioned in Section II, state-by-year fixed effects, and the
FHS adjustment.
       Figure 2D presents the results of our capital stock analysis. A greater exposure to bonus
depreciation stimulates growth in the capital stock throughout the treatment period. Accel-
erations in equipment stock growth are apparent both at policy onset in 2002 and at policy
re-implementation in 2008. Notably, House and Shapiro (2008) and ZM also find persistent ef-
fects of bonus on capital accumulation. Table 1 shows that, on average, a unit IQR Exposure
increases the stock of equipment capital by 3.3% during the period.
       The persistent capital effects rule out many potential explanations for the lackluster effects
  19
     We focus on percentage changes in the level of capital to match the effects on employment; focusing on
investment would capture only the inflows. See Appendix B for details.
  20
     Appendix F discusses this estimator and shows that our labor market results are qualitatively unaffected by
this correction.



                                                      11
of bonus on the labor market. For instance, these patterns imply our employment results are
not the result of long-lived industries being more sensitive to the business cycle.
    The capital accumulation effects further contextualize the labor market results. During the
first half of the treatment period, capital and employment increased in tandem. Increases in
employment led to higher overall compensation but not average wages. In contrast, increases in
capital stimulated by bonus depreciation were not matched with additional employment growth
during the later half of the treatment period. Instead, the additional capital accumulation
in the later years coincided with stagnation in the number of jobs and relative reductions in
compensation.
    The juxtaposition of persistent increases in capital accumulation with the anemic effects on
labor market outcomes casts doubt on the hypothesis that capital deepening may complement
the efforts of workers in the modern economy.

C    Placebo Test

We use the fact that structures and IP were not eligible for bonus depreciation to conduct a
natural placebo test. We create a placebo exposure — mirroring Equation 1 — to long-duration
industries that own five times as much stock in structures and IP as in equipment. Figure 3B
reports the results of this test. Contrasting these flat patterns with Figure 2 suggests that the
effects of bonus depreciation are driven by the policy itself and not by trends in industries that
invest in ineligible but long-lived assets.


IV      Capital–Labor Substitution in Local Labor Markets
The previous section showed that the bonus-driven capital accumulation had short-lived effects
on employment growth and did not translate into wage gains. The data therefore suggest a
particular dynamic: capital substitutes for labor and the rate of substitution increases over time.
Our empirical setting allows us to directly measure the elasticity of capital-labor substitution
and how it changes over time.
    Building on Equation 2, we estimate how percent changes in the relative cost of capital, ∆ρcjt ,
                                                          
                                                      Kcjt
affect percent changes in the capital-labor ratio, ∆ Lcjt    :
                                 
                             Kcjt
                         ∆          = −σ∆ρcjt + X0 c γ + µst + νjt + cjt .                    (3)
                             Lcjt

                                                12
While Equation 3 can be motivated with a CES production technology (Raval, 2018; Doraszelski
and Jaumandreu, 2018), we do not view our estimates of σ as structural parameters. Rather,
Equation 3 provides a flexible approach to summarize the substitution patterns in Figure 2. As
in Oberfield and Raval (2014), our estimates of σ within local labor markets have a “macro”
interpretation that captures substitution across firms with different capital intensities as well
as within-firm changes in input use. Relative to prior work, our setting has the advantage of
capturing the cumulative effects of a sustained policy experiment on the capital-to-labor ratio.
       We construct the capital-labor ratio using QCEW data on employment at the county-subsector
and our BEA capital stock measure. We estimate the user-cost for a given year using data on
state taxes and investment tax credits, estimates of economic depreciation, and zj0 .21 To capture
the cumulative effects of bonus on the stock of capital, we define ρcjt as the cumulative average of
yearly cost-of-capital estimates relative to wages using using compensation-per-employee data.
All percent changes are relative to 2001 levels and include the FHS adjustment. Equation 3
includes state-by-year and industry-by-year fixed effects and county-level controls.
       We identify σ using Exposure as an instrument for ∆ρcjt . Exposure is a strong instrument
for ∆ρcjt since bonus depreciation enters directly into ρcjt . Exposure also has significant effects
                                                                                  cjt                 K
on employment and capital; intuitively, the reduced-form effect of Exposure on ∆ Lcjt is the
difference between Figures 2A and 2D. Finally, the exclusion restriction — that Exposure is not
correlated with other industry-county-level shocks — is supported by the evidence in Section III
that Exposure affects local labor markets only through variation in bonus depreciation.
       We first estimate Equation 3 on the early years of the policy (2002-2005). Figure 4A shows
that, consistent with a Leontief production function, we do not find a statistically significant effect
of ∆ρcjt . In contrast, Figure 4B estimates Equation 3 for years 2006-2010 and shows that ∆ρcjt
had large effects on the capital-labor ratio. Specifically, a 1% reduction in ∆ρcjt would increase
the capital-labor ratio by 1.69%, exceeding the substitutability of a Cobb-Douglas production
function.22 This result implies a net-of-depreciation-σ = 1.27 after performing the adjustment
of Rognlie (2016).
       One way to appreciate the role of capital-labor substitution is to relate σ to the cost-per-job
  21
     We construct the cost-of-capital as (r + δct ) 1−τst 1+τ
                                                          (zct +Invst )
                                                               st
                                                                        using data from Chirinko and Wilson (2008);
Bureau of Economic Analysis (2017); Suárez Serrato and Zidar (2017); Zwick and Mahon (2017) where r =7%;
see Appendix B for details.
  22
     The first-stage implies that an IQR increase in Exposure lowers ∆ρcjt by 0.61% (F-stat=13). Since an IQR
increase in Exposure increases the capital-labor ratio by 1.03%, σ = 1.03   0.61 = 1.69.



                                                        13
calculation. If σ = 0, as in the early years of the policy, capital and employment would grow in
equal proportions. Thus, had employment grown at 3.3% following an IQR of Exposure — the
average effect on capital — bonus depreciation would have been a more effective labor market
policy with a cost-per-job of $30,000. Our cost-per-job estimate of $53,000 in Section III therefore
reflects the degree to which capital became a substitute for labor over time.
      To capture how σ changes over time, we use a control function approach that includes inter-
actions between ∆ρcjt and a cubic trend in Equation 3. Figure 4C reports year-by-year estimates
of σ. We estimate σ ≈ 0 in 2003. For 2004-2006, we find σ ∈ [0.3, 0.7], consistent with Chirinko
(2008) and Oberfield and Raval (2014). Over the long term, however, we find σ > 1, as in
Karabarbounis and Neiman (2013) and Piketty and Zucman (2014).23
      Why does the policy-driven capital accumulation turn from being a complement to a substi-
tute for labor? One potential mechanism is that firms are able to substitute between capital and
labor more freely over time. That is, in the short-run, firms install capital in the same proportion
as before the policy. As the cost of capital remains low, firms substitute to more capital-intensive
forms of production, resulting in larger elasticities. This mechanism is consistent with a pow-
erful intuition dating to Samuelson’s (1947) LeChatelier’s principle. More recently, putty-clay
environments where firms are constrained in their ability to adjust their capital intensity result
in larger long-run elasticities (Lambson, 1991; Sorkin, 2015; Bayer et al., 2015).


V        Conclusion
This is the first study to provide a detailed analysis of the labor market effects of bonus depre-
ciation. Using a local labor markets approach, we find short-term growth effects on employment
and earnings. Bonus depreciation generated one job for every $53,000 spent on the policy with
no positive effects on average earnings for workers. Finally, our results are consistent with a
pattern of increased substitution from labor to capital over time.
      Theses findings have immediate policy implications as the federal government currently
spends $25 billion per year on accelerated depreciation policies. Overall, our results show in-
centives for capital accumulation stimulate investment but do not create long-run job or wage
growth. It is therefore challenging to justify these expenses on the premise of helping workers.

      Figure G8 shows we obtain similar estimates when σ has a linear trend; see Table G14 for estimates.

Notes: Author’s calculations using data from QCEW and Zwick and Mahon (2017). Figure 1A shows
the within-sector variation in duration of industries relative to manufacturing. For each sector, we
calculate the within-sector coefficient of variation of the measure of duration from Zwick and Mahon
(2017) and multiply that by the share of sector capital and sector employment, respectively. We
normalize each measure of weighted variation to the manufacturing sector (NAICS 31-33). Figure 1B
shows the standardized percent of employment in each county that comes from the top three deciles of
employment-weighted industries by average duration of investment. The exposure measure is normalized
by average exposure at the state level so the coefficients are interpretable as standard deviations in
exposure from the state average exposure. Long duration exposure values are shown in Figure G2
without adjusting for state means.

                                         Notes: Author’s calculations using data from QCEW and Zwick and Mahon (2017). This figure shows
                                         the annual coefficients from an event study around the implementation of bonus depreciation following
                                         the structure of Equation 2. The dependent variable is Employment in Figure 2A, Compensation in
                                         Figure 2B, Compensation per Worker in Figure 2C, and Capital Stock in Figure 2D. The variable of
                                         interest is the percent of employment that resides in long duration industries normalized to the inter-
                                         quartile range (IQR). See Section III for more discussion regarding the interpretation of the event study
                                         results. These results are robust to the exclusion of the local controls as shown in Figure G3, the FHS
                                         estimator as shown in Figure G4, and the definition of a long-duration industry exposure as shown in
                                         Figures G5, G6, and G7. Tables G6, G7, G8, and G9 show the annual coefficients for employment,
                                         compensation, compensation per worker, and equipment, respectively, with additional specifications.
                                         Standard errors are clustered at the county level.

Notes: Author’s calculations using data from QCEW and Zwick and Mahon (2017). Figure 3A shows
the heterogeneous effect of exposure to bonus depreciation on local employment growth. The regression
matches Figure 2A and is estimated separately for the full sample and interacted with industry automa-
tion categories. The coefficients for high automation likelihood industries rise in a similar manner to
the coefficients of the full sample of industries and are not statistically different. Figure 3B shows the
coefficients from regressions of outcomes on exposure to long duration industries that use more than
five times more structures and intellectual property products than equipment in 2001. Structures and
intellectual property products are not eligible for bonus depreciation. The set of long duration industries
that use relatively little equipment includes the following NAICS codes: 2111, 4821, 5311, 7111, 7112,
7211, 7212, and all of 81. The results of Figure 3B  20give evidence that structures and land investment
are not driving the results. Standard errors are clustered at the county level.

                      Notes: Author’s calculations using data from QCEW, Zwick and Mahon (2017), the Census Bureau,
                      and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Figures 4A and 4B display instrumental variables estimates of σ
                      for the early and late years of the policy. Data are residualized from state-by-year and industry-by-year
                      fixed effects and controls. We instrument ∆ρjct with Exposure and present the 1st -stage F-statistics
                      below each graph. In 2002-2005, we estimate an average elasticity of -0.59 and fail to reject the null
                      hypothesis of a Leontief production function. In 2006-2010, we estimate an average elasticity of 1.69,
                      which is larger than substitution implied by a Cobb-Douglass model. In Figure 4C, we use a control
                      function approach that allows for σ to vary by year according to interactions between ∆ρjct and a cubic
                      trend. The plot also includes 90% confidence intervals. The estimated elasticities increase from zero
                      in 2003 to over 1.5 by 2010. See Figure G8 for estimates from a linear trend and Table G14 for point
                      estimates. See Section IV for more discussion and 21 information about the regressions.

Notes: This table shows estimates from Equation 2 where β is not allowed to vary by year and
all controls discussed in Section III are included. The sample for this table includes years 2003 to
2012. The outcomes are employment in the first row, compensation in the second, compensation
per worker in the third, and equipment stock in the final row. Column (1) shows estimates with
subsector-by-year fixed effects while column (2), the main specification, adds state-by-year fixed
effects. The following two columns show robustness of the results to winsorizing the weights at
the 5% level and to dropping county-subsectors with less than 1,000 workers in 2001. Standard
errors are clustered at the county level. The same regressions for the pre-period, 1997 to 2000,
are shown in Table G5 and fail to reject parallel trends. The regressions without county level
controls are displayed in Table G4 to show robustness.
†
  The regressions of equipment capital stock combine all subsectors together, so the subsector-
by-year fixed effects are only year fixed effects for the equipment outcome.

B       Data Construction Details
In this appendix we provide additional details on the construction of specific variables.
    In Section III.B, we use a county-level measure of the equipment capital stock. To construct this
measure, we use BEA data on the Current-Cost Net Capital Stock of Private Nonresidential Fixed
Assets are available at the subsector-national level. We use these data to create county-level measures
of capital stock, Kic . To do so, we allocate the national equipment capital in each subsector in each
year, Kit , to counties by the share of national employment in the subsector in each county in each year,
sict , so that:
                                                    X
                                            Kct =          sict × Kit .
                                                     i

Since Kct does not vary within counties, we assign our measures of the change in capital to all subsectors
in a county.
    In Section IV, we use an estimate of the relative cost of capital to estimate Equation 3. To con-
struct the cumulative user cost of capital that is relevant for the capital stock, we first compute the
instantaneous use cost of capital

We assume the return on capital r is 7%. We derive county-level measures of the economic depreciation
rate δct based on BEA investment data, county-industry mixes from QCEW, and the law of motion for
capital. Corporate tax rates, τst , vary at the state level and are taken from Suárez Serrato and Zidar
(2017). We compute a county-level average of the discounted present value of depreciation deductions,
zct , using data from Zwick and Mahon (2017) and the QCEW. Finally, state investment tax credits,
Invst are taken from Chirinko and Wilson (2008). Since the adoption of bonus depreciation persistently
decreased the cost of investment, we calculate the relevant user cost uccct as the cumulative average
                                                                                            uccct

C      Additional Results
This appendix describes tables and figures that report additional details of the specifications in Figure
2, as well as additional results.

    • Descriptive Statistics. We include several figures and tables to more completely describe the
      variation in duration both across space and across industries that we use as identifying variation
      in exposure to accelerated depreciation.

         – Figure G1 provides a summary description of the source of employment in long duration
            industries.

         – A map of the geographic distribution of long duration industries without normalizing within-
            state means to zero is shown in Figure G2.

         – A list of the top and bottom ten counties with over 100,000 population in 2001 based on the
            percent of their employment coming from long duration industries is shown in Table G2.

         – Table G1 describes the within sector variation in duration as well as shares of national
            employment from QCEW (2017) and capital stock from Bureau of Economic Analysis (2017).
            The final column shows total variation (coefficient of variation multiplied by employment
            weight) with the manufacturing variation normalized to be equal to one.

         – Table G3 shows additional county descriptive statistics associated with exposure to long
            duration, population, and local capital stock.

    • Robustness to Controls and FHS Estimator. We show the robustness of the county-level
      regressions of employment, compensation, compensation per worker, and equipment in a series of
      expanded results with different controls and different definitions of key variables. The results are
      robust to the inclusion or exclusion of the controls.

         – Figure G3 shows the robustness of the specifications in Figure 2 to not including the baseline
            county-level controls. The controls for trade exposure, demographics, routine jobs, and
            capital stocks in 2001 are not included in the robustness figure.

         – Table G4 shows the analogue to Table 1 that does not include the controls for other county
            level variables.

         – Table G5 shows the pre-period regression results associated with the regressions in Table 1
            to show that there were no pre-trends going into the sample period.


                                                   26
     – We also include several results that show the robustness of the baseline results on em-
       ployment, compensation, and compensation per worker to the FHS estimator. Figure G4
       shows the effects of bonus depreciation on county level outcomes with the FHS estimator
       corresponding to Figure 2.

     – Tables G6, G7, G8, and G9 show the annual coefficients from Figure 2 for employment,
       compensation, compensation per worker, and equipment, respectively. The labor market
       outcomes tables all include four specifications where column (2) is the preferred specification
       with state-by-year and subsector-by-year fixed effects. The equipment table combines all
       subsectors and so column (1) is the preferred specification.

• Robustness to Definition of Exposure and Placebo Tests. We also show the robustness
  of the baseline results shown in Figure 2 to the definition of the long duration exposure at the
  county level. Instead of defining firms in the top tercile of industries ranked by duration to be
  “long” duration, we change the threshold to the top 25% and 40% of industries and show that
  the results are unchanged. We also include a placebo with exposure to long duration industries
  that primarily invest in structures and intellectual property, NAICS 2111, 4821, 5311, 7111, 7112,
  7211, 7212, and all of 81, which are long duration industries with more than five times more
  structures and IP than equipment.

     – The analogue of Figure 2 is shown using exposure to the top 25% of long duration firms in
       Figure G5. The equipment robustness is shown separately in Figure G7.

     – The analogue of Figure 2 is shown using exposure to the top 40% of long duration firms in
       Figure G6. The equipment robustness is shown separately in Figure G7.

     – Tables G10, G11, G12, and G13 show the annual coefficients from Figure 3B for employ-
       ment, compensation, compensation per worker, and equipment, respectively. The labor
       market outcomes tables each include four specifications where column (2) is the preferred
       specification with state-by-year and subsector-by-year fixed effects. The equipment table
       combines all subsectors and so column (1) is the preferred specification.

• Robustness of σ Estimates. Finally, we show robustness of our results in Section IV of the
  capital-labor elasticity of substitution.

     – In Figure G8 we show that year-by-year estimates of σ following a linear trend are qualita-
       tively similar to the estimates presented in Figure 4C with a cubic trend.

     – We present point estimates and further results in Table G14.

D       Adjusting for Losses and Section 179
This appendix discusses the role of losses and Section 179 expensing rules in interpreting our results.
In particular, we clarify that the interpretation of our main result is that of an intent-to-treat (ITT)
effect. Our main estimate differs from the treatment on the treated (ATOT) for three reasons. First,
some companies may rely on Section 179 expensing instead of bonus. Second, some companies may
not take up the incentives of bonus depreciation if they plan to report tax losses. A third complication
is that bonus depreciation has varied in intensity across our time period. This section clarifies the
interpretation of our results in light of these three factors.
    We make four related points in this appendix:

    1. First, accounting for Section 179 has small effects on our reduced-form estimates of the effects of
       bonus depreciation. Specifically, our estimates would be 11% smaller in the absence of Section
       179 expensing.

    2. Second, accounting for the fraction of firms with losses implies that the ATOT would be 33%
       larger than the ITT. Accounting for both losses and Section 179 results in estimates of the ATOT
       that are 19% larger than our ITT estimates.

    3. Third, these adjustments have no effect on the estimation of rates of substitution between capital
       and labor in Section IV. The adjustments to the reduced-form effects apply equally to the depen-
       dent and endogenous variables in this estimation and they cancel out as part of the instrumental
       variables strategy.

    4. Finally, we show that the time-pattern of losses and Section 179 expensing limits has negligible
       effects on the time-path of our reduced-form effects in Figure 2.

Marginal Investment Incentives with Losses and Section 179

As noted by Kitchen and Knittel (2011), the effects of bonus depreciation interact with two important
factors. The first is corporate losses. Since firms can only get the immediate benefit from the bonus
depreciation deduction if they owe corporate taxes, we would expect to find smaller effects when a
larger fraction of firms experience year-end losses. Second, Section 179 allows firms to fully expense
capital investments if the investment value is below a given threshold. A higher Section 179 limit could
therefore confound the effects of bonus.
    In order to explore the role of these interactions, we start by characterizing the present discounted
value (PDV) of depreciation deductions. To do so, we make use of the following definitions:


                                                     28
    • Under the modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS), the PDV of depreciation deduc-
      tions for the marginal dollar is z 0 .

    • Under Bonus, the PDV of depreciation deductions for the marginal dollar is b + (1 − b)z 0 . Figure
      D1A shows how the policy parameter b varies over time. The average value of b over our sample
      period is 39%.

    • Under Section 179, the PDV of depreciation deductions for the marginal dollar is 1 if Ij,t < I¯t ,
      where I¯t is the Section 179 limit. Moreover, Share 179t = E[I[Ij,t < I¯t ]]t is the share of investment
      that is eligible for Section 179 expensing. Figure D1B reports data from Kitchen and Knittel
      (2011) that describes the time variation in Share 179t . The Share 179t is relatively stable over
      out time period with an average value that is close to 8%.

    • Let I[Gainsj,t ] be the event that a firm is in the gains domain and Share Gainst = E[I[Gainsj,t ]]t .
      Figure D1C uses data in corporate losses by industry from the IRS Statistics of Income and
      describes the time variation in Share Gainst . Over our sample period, the average value of
      Share Gainst is close to 75%.

    For an individual firm j, the general value of depreciation deductions for the marginal dollar of
investment is:

                         z = (b + (1 − b)z 0 ) × (1 − I[Ij,t < I¯t ]) + 1 × I[Ij,t < I¯t ]

                            = (b + (1 − b)z 0 ) + I[Ij,t < I¯t ][1 − b − (1 − b)z 0 )]

                            = (b + (1 − b)z 0 ) + I[Ij,t < I¯t ][(1 − b)(1 − z 0 )].

Taking the difference between this value and z 0 we have :

                             z − z 0 = (1 − z 0 )b + I[Ij,t < I¯t ][(1 − b)(1 − z 0 )]

                                      = (1 − z 0 )[b + (1 − b)I[Ij,t < I¯t ]].

Intuitively, Section 179 gives b = 1 when Ij,t < I¯t so the combined policy of bonus and Section 179 has
a larger effect on z − z 0 whenever the event I[Ij,t < I¯t ] is more likely.
    Assume now that a firm only values depreciation deductions in the gains domain. The average value
of the shock in a county is then:

                  E[z − z 0 ]c,t = (1 − z 0 ) × Share Gainst × [b + (1 − b)Share 179t ]

                                 ≈ Exposurec × Share Gainst × [b + (1 − b)Share 179t ],                 (D.1)

where we use our Exposurec measure as the empirical approximation of (1 − z 0 ) .

                                                        29
Adjusting Average Reduced-Form Effects for Losses and Section 179

Equation D.1 formalizes the notion that estimates that rely on Exposurec for identifying variation
will result in estimates of intent-to-treat effects. To see this, assume average values of b = 39% and
Share Gainst = 75% and temporarily ignore the role of Section 179 by setting Share 179t = 0. Equation
D.1 then suggests that to recover the ATOT we would need to divide our estimates by Share Gainst =
                                                          1
75%, which would increase their magnitude by 33% (≈      0.75 ).

   To understand the role of Share 179t , assume that Share Gainst = 1 and b = 39%. To obtain the
equivalent effect of an average bonus rate of b = 39% absent Section 179, we would need to multiply our
                      39%
estimates by:   39%+(1−39%)×8%   ≈ 0.89, which would make them 11% smaller. For instance, column (2) in
Table 1 shows that the average increase in employment growth from an IQR increase in exposure to bonus
depreciation was 1.9%. Accounting for the role of Section 179, our estimate would be 1.7% = 1.9%×0.89.
   To offset the effects of both losses and Section 179, we would have to multiply our estimates by
        39%
75%×[39%+(1−39%)×8%]   ≈ 1.19. The combined effect of losses and Section 179 would be to make our
estimates 19% larger. Absent Section 179 and in a world where no firms were constrained in claiming
bonus due to loss effects, we would expect to find an increase in employment of 2.3% = 1.9% × 1.19.
   Similarly, suppose that we are interested in evaluating the effects of a policy where b = 50% for a
decade. Again, assuming no Section 179 and no frictions from corporate losses, we would expect an
                                                                           50%
increase in employment of 2.9% = 1.9% × 1.52 where 1.52 =          75%×[39%+(1−39%)×8%] .

   Finally, we note that these adjustments have no bearing on our estimates of substitution patterns
in Section IV. This is because this adjustment affects both the dependent variable (changes in the
capital-to-labor ratio) and the endogenous variable (changes in the input cost ratio).

Adjusting Dynamics of Reduced-Form Effects for Losses and Section 179

As discussed above, while corporate losses and Section 179 expensing interact with bonus depreciation,
accounting for these interactions has small effects on the interpretation of our average estimates. An
additional concern is that the time patterns in b, Share Gainst , and Share 179t influence the dynamics
of the effects shown in Figure 2. We now perform similar adjustments as above to show that this is not
the case.
   Conceptually, Equation D.1 shows that our treatment is time-varying, and that the intensity of the
policy depends on the time patterns of b, Share Gainst , and Share 179t . The goal of this exercise is to
use our estimates and the time patterns in b, Share Gainst , and Share 179t from Figures D1A-D1C to
compare the observed policy to a counterfactual policy where b, Share Gainst , and Share 179t are held
constant at their average values over our time period.


                                                    30
   To do so, Figure D1D plots the value of the adjustment factor Share Gainst × [b + (1 − b)Share 179t ]
over time. This plot mostly follows the time path of b; however, the amplitude of the curve is diminished
by Share Gainst and the minimum value is augmented by Share 179t . Because outcomes in a given year
t are affected by the policy in previous years, we adjust our estimates by the cumulative average of
Share Gainst × [b + (1 − b)Share 179t ] from 2001 until a given year t. Figure D1E plots this cumulative
average relative to the average value of Share Gainst × [b + (1 − b)Share 179t ] over the time period. We
can then divide our estimates in Figure 2 by the values of Figure D1E to obtain the reduced-form effects
of a policy where b, Share Gainst , and Share 179t are held constant at their average values over our time
period. Figure D1D shows that a time-consistent policy would result in larger effects in years 2002 and
2006-2009. Similarly, this adjustment would imply smaller effects in years 2003-2004 and 2011-2012.
   Figure D1F shows that adjusting our estimates on the effects of bonus depreciation on employment
so that they have a time-consistent interpretation results in very similar effects. The largest change is
that we observe a slightly larger effect in years 2006-2007.
   Overall, the pattern of losses and Section 179 expensing do not play a material role in explaining
the dynamics of how bonus depreciation affects the labor market. For this reason, we present the un-
adjusted results in the paper. This result is also consistent with results in Zwick and Mahon (2017) that
show that business investment was similarly responsive to bonus depreciation in the early and latter
years of our sample.

Notes: Author’s calculations using employment data from QCEW, industry duration data from Zwick
and Mahon (2017), net operating loss shares from IRS (2017), and Section 179 use from authors cal-
culations and results reported in Kitchen and Knittel (2011). This figure shows the annual coefficients
from an event study around the implementation of bonus depreciation that is adjusted for national net
operating losses and access to Section 179. Section D discusses a correction to our baseline estimates
that adjusts for the intensity of treatment from Bonus in a given year due to interactions with losses
and Section 179. Figure D1A shows the bonus rate b for each year. Figure D1B shows the fraction of
total investment that is eligible for Section 179 deductions. Figure D1C shows the percent of assets and
revenues in firms that do not have losses. Figures D1A, D1B, and D1C combine into Figure D1D, the
adjustment factor, and Figure D1E, the normalized    32 cumulative average adjustment factor. Dividing
the regression results from Figure 2A by the adjustment factor yields the adjusted effect of Bonus on
Employment shown in Figure D1F.
E      Effects of Bonus Depreciation on the Employment-to-
       Population Ratio
One potential mechanism behind the increase in employment is the geographic relocation of workers. In
order to account for this factor, we estimate the effects of our shock on the employment-to-population
ratio, as in Autor et al. (2013).
    Figure E1 plots the results of this analysis and shows that, similar to Figure 2, the effects of bonus
depreciation on employment crest in 2006. This figure shows that, by 2006, a unit IQR increase in
Exposure increases the employment-to-population ratio by 1 percentage point.
    Overall, the average effect for years 2003-2012 is that a unit IQR increase in Exposure raised the
employment-to-population ratio by 0.76 percentage points. Relative to the average US working-age
population during our period of 195 million, this implies that the average effect of Exposure would be
to raise employment by 4.06 million jobs. Comparing this employment effect with the cost of the policy
implies a cost-per-job of $73,000 ≈ 297.5
                                          
                                     4.06 .

    Our discussion in the paper focuses on the cost of creating a job in a given location. For this reason,
our main estimate of $53,000 is smaller than the estimate of $73,000, which applies to the cost of creating
a job relative to a given population. We choose to focus on the percentage change in employment since
this outcome is comparable to previous work on local fiscal multipliers and since it allows us to study
how changes in the stock of employment relate to the stock of capital in Section IV.
    Finally, it is worth noting that the dynamics of the effects of bonus depreciation in Figure E1 are
very similar those of our main result in Figure 2A. Specifically, bonus depreciation has temporary effects
on the growth of employment. While these level effects are persistent, bonus depreciation does not lead
to sustained increases in the rate of employment growth.

Notes: Author’s calculations using data from QCEW and Zwick and Mahon (2017). This figure shows
the annual coefficients from an event study around the implementation of bonus depreciation. The
dependent variable is the change in in the Employment-to-Population ratio. The variable of interest
is the percent of employment that is resides in long duration industries normalized to the interquartile
range (IQR). This estimating equation for this figure matches that of Figure G4.




                                                                                   34
F      Details on the use of the Freyaldenhoven et al. (2018)
       Estimator
As we discuss in Section III.B and Appendix B, our measure of capital stock does not vary across subsec-
tors in a given county. This prevents us from including subsector-by-year fixed effects when estimating
the effects of bonus depreciation on capital accumulation using the specification in Equation 2. More-
over, when we estimate a model without subsector-by-year fixed effects, we find that counties that were
more exposed to bonus depreciation experience relative patterns of decline prior to the implementation
of the policy in 2002–see Figure F1A.
    The concern raised by these pre-trends is that there is a confounder ηct that could bias our results.
That is, the true data generating process may be as follows:
                                 2012                       
                                      βy Exposurec × 1(t = y) + δηct + µst + ct .
                                 X
                   ∆Kct = α +                                                                            (F.1)
                                  y=1997

Our estimates of the effects of bonus depreciation could then be biased if δ 6= 0 and ηct is correlated
with Exposure.
    To deal with this concern, Freyaldenhoven et al. (2018) propose an estimator to correct for the role
of the confound ηct . The estimator makes use of a covariate xct that is related to the confound ηct
but that is not affected by Exposure. The second requirement for this covariate is that the dynamic
behavior between xct and Exposure mirrors that between ηct and Exposure.
    As we show in Figure F1B, the stock of intellectual property has a similar pre-trend with respect to
Exposure as the stock of equipment capital. Moreover, since bonus depreciation only applies to capital
equipment, the stock of intellectual property should not be affected by bonus depreciation. We therefore
use the stock of intellectual property in the role of the auxiliary covariate xct .
    The equation we aim to estimate is then:
                               2012                       
                                    βy Exposurec × 1(t = y) + λxct + µst + ct .
                                X
                  ∆Kct = α +                                                                             (F.2)
                                  y=1997

Note, however, that even though xct is related to ηct , controlling for xct in Equation F.2 would only
correct for the confounder if xct = δηct ; that is, if the effects of ηct on xct and ∆Kct are exactly parallel.
To get around this problem, Freyaldenhoven et al. (2018) propose to use leads of the Exposure variable
as an instrument to identify the coefficient λ that scales the auxiliary covariate xct in order to properly
account for δηjt in Equation F.1. In practice, we use leads of Exposure to instrument for the average
effect of IP capital in the pre-period.
    The intuition for this adjustment can be visualized in Figure F1. By using leads of Exposure as
instruments for xct , we rescale the coefficients in Figure F1B to have the same scale as those in Figure

                                                      35
F1A The result of this process is Figure F1C, which shows a lack of meaningful pre-trends. Comparing
Figure F1A and Figure F1C, we find a slightly larger effect of Exposure on the stock of equipment
capital. This follows from the idea that, absent bonus depreciation, ηct would have put downward
pressure on both equipment and IP capital.
   Finally, note that this adjustment does not affect our estimates of the effects of bonus depreciation
on employment, compensation, and compensation per worker, as shown in Figure G4. This result
follows from the graphical intuition behind this procedure. By rescaling Figure F1B to the scale of
the pre-trends in Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C, the variation in the post-period in xct is rescaled to have a
very small magnitude. This follows since the lack of pre-trends in Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C imply that
the effects of ηct on employment, compensation, and compensation-per-worker are very small (i.e., the
corresponding δ’s for these outcomes are close to zero).

    Notes: Author’s calculations using data from QCEW, Zwick and Mahon (2017), and the Bureau for
Economic Analysis. This figure shows the implementation of the FHS estimator that uses correction
for unobservables. Figure F1A shows the yearly estimates from the raw event study of equipment
investment without using the FHS estimator. Equipment stock was growing more slowly in counties
more exposed to bonus depreciation from 1997 to 2001, but the exposed counties grew more quickly
from 2002-2012. The presence of a pre-trend hints that there is an unobservable confound that is
affecting equipment capital stock formation in counties with more bonus exposure. Figure F1B shows
that the pre-trends are shared with IP capital stock, which is not eligible for bonus depreciation. We
estimate the FHS estimator using IP capital stock as the variable that is not affected by the policy but
is correlated with county unobservables and show the results of the corrected regression in Figure F1C.

Notes: Author’s calculations using data from QCEW and Zwick and Mahon (2017). This figure shows
the annual coefficients from an event study around the implementation of bonus depreciation. The
dependent variable is Employment in Figure G3A, Compensation in Figure G3B, Compensation per
Worker in Figure G3C, and Equipment Capital Stock in Figure G3D. The variable of interest is the
percent of employment that is resides in long duration industries normalized to the interquartile range
(IQR). These regressions correspond to those displayed in Figure 2 with the FHS estimator for all
outcomes. Standard errors are clustered at the county level.

Notes: Author’s calculations using data from QCEW and Zwick and Mahon (2017). This figure shows
the annual coefficients from an event study around the implementation of bonus depreciation. The
dependent variable is Employment in Figure G4A, Compensation in Figure G4B, Compensation per
Worker in Figure G4C, and Equipment Capital Stock in Figure G4D. The variable of interest is the
percent of employment that is resides in long duration industries normalized to the interquartile range
(IQR). These regressions correspond to those displayed in Figure 2 with the FHS estimator correction
using intellectual property products capital stock as described in Appendix F.

Notes: Author’s calculations using data from QCEW and Zwick and Mahon (2017). This figure shows
the annual coefficients from an event study around the implementation of bonus depreciation. The
dependent variable is Employment in Figure G6A, Compensation in Figure G6B and Compensation
per Worker in Figure G6C. The variable of interest is the percent of employment that is resides in long
duration industries normalized to the interquartile range (IQR). These regressions correspond to those
displayed in Figure 2 with long duration industries defined at the 40% cutoff instead of 30%.

Notes: Author’s calculations using data from QCEW, Zwick and Mahon (2017), the Census Bureau,
and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This figures reports the estimates of σ by year from an estimation
where we use a control function approach that allows σ to vary by year according to interactions between
∆ρjct and a linear trend. The plot also includes 90% confidence intervals. The estimated elasticities
increase from zero in 2003 to over 1.5 by 2010. See Figure 4C for estimates from a cubic trend and
Table G14 for point estimates. See Section IV for more discussion.

Notes: This table shows the estimates from a pooled regression of equation 2 where β is not allowed to vary
by year and the DPAD variable is the only other included control. The sample for this table includes only years
2003 to 2012 to highlight the long run change in outcomes due to exposure to long duration industries. The
outcomes are employment in the first row, compensation in the second, compensation per worker in the third,
and equipment stock in the final row. Column (1) shows estimates with subsector-by-year fixed effects while
column (2), the main specification, adds state-by-year fixed effects. The following two columns show robustness
of the results to winsorizing the weights at the 5% level and to dropping county-subsectors with less than 1,000
workers in 2001. Standard errors are clustered at the county level. The primary specifications with all controls
are shown in Table 1.

Notes: This table shows the estimates from a pooled regression of equation 2 where β is not allowed to
vary by year and all controls discussed in Appendix A are included. The sample for this table includes
only years 1997 to 2000 to test the parallel trends assumption in the preperiod, which we fail to reject.
The outcomes are employment in the first row, compensation in the second, compensation per worker
in the third, and equipment stock in the final row. Column (1) shows estimates with subsector-by-year
fixed effects while column (2), the main specification, adds state-by-year fixed effects. The following

Notes: Author’s calculations using data from QCEW and Zwick and Mahon (2017). The
coefficients displayed in this table come from an event study regression of total employment
growth. The dependent variable is the percent change in total compensation relative to 2001.
The variable of interest is the percent of employment that is derived from long duration industries
normalized to the interquartile range (IQR). Standard errors clustered at the state and sector
levels are shown in parentheses. ∗ p < 0.1, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01. Column (2) is corresponds
