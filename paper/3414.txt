                                  ABSTRACT


     Our model of growth departs from both the Malthusian and neoclassical

appcoarhes by including investments in human capital. We assume, crucially,

that rates of return on human capital investments rise, rathar than, decline,

as the stock of human capital increases, until the stock becomes large. This

arises because the education sector uses human capital note tutensively than

either the capital producing sector of the goods producing sector. This

produces multiple steady scares: an undeveloped steady stare with little

human capital, low rstes of return on human capital investments and high

fertility, and a developed steady stats with higher rates of return a large,

and, perhaps, growing stock of human capital and low fertility. Multiple

steady states mean that history and luck are critical detecelnaucs of a

country's growth experience.

1. Int'oduction
            Economic growth has posed an intellectual challenge ever since the
beginning of systematic economic analysis. Adam Smith claimed that growth

was related to the division of labor, but he did not link them in a clear

way. Thomas Malthus developed a formal model of a dynamic growth process,

in which each country converged toward a stationary per capita income.

According to his model, death rates fail and fertility rises when incomes

exceed the equilibrium level, and the opposite occurs when incomes ate less

than that level. Despite the influence of the Malthusian modei on

nineteenth century economists, fertility fell rather than rose as incomes

grew during the past 15t years in the West and other parts of the world.

            The neoclassical model of growth responded to the failure of the

Malthusian model by essentially ignoring any link between population and the

economy. Adjustments in this model take place not in the population growth

rate, but In the rate of investment in physical capital. The physical

capital stock grows more slowly when per capita income exceeds its equi-

librium level, and it grows more rapidly when per capita income is below

equilibrium. I

           Neither Malthus'   nor the neoclassicists' approach to growth pays
much attention to human capital. Yet the evidence is now quite strong of a

close   link between investments in human capital and growth.   Since human

capital is embodied knowledge and skills, and economic development depends

on advenoes in technological end scientific knowledge, development

presumably depends on the accumulation of human capital.

           Evidencefor the twentieth century United States supports this
reasoning. Cross investment in schooling grew much more rapidly in the
United States between 1910 and 1950 than did gross investment in physical

 capital (Schultr fl960J). Denison [1965] found that the growth in years ci

schooling between 1929 and 1982 "explained" about 25 percent of the growth

 in per capita income during the period. The experiences of nearly one-

hundred countries since 1960 suggests that education investments in 1960 ste

an important variable explaining subsequent growth in per capita incomes

(see Barro [1989]). Considerable circumstantial evidence also indicstes

that countries grow more rapidly when educetion and other skills are sore

abundant.

            Our model of growth takes this evidence seriously, and departs

from both the Malthusian and neoclassical approaches by placing investments

in human capital at the center. Crucial to out analysis is the assumption

that rates of return on investments in human capital rise rather thsn

decline as the stock of human capital increases, at least until the stock

becomes large. The reason is that education and other sectors that produce

human capital use educated and other skilled inputs more intensively than do

sectors thet produte consumption goods and physical capital. This leads to

multiple steady states: an undeveloped steady state with little human

capital and low rates of return on investments in human capital, and a

developed steady state with much higher rates of return and a large and

perhaps growing stock of human capital,

            Our analysis contains elements of both the Malthusian end neoclas-

ethel models since fertility is endogenous and rates of return on

investments in physical capital decline as its stock increases. The en-

dogeneity of fertility also leads to multiple steady states; a "Halthusian"

undeveloped steady state with high birth rates end low levels of human
capital, and a developed steady state with much lower fertility and abundant

stocks of human and physical capital.

          Multiple steady statea mean that history and luck are critical

determinants of a country's growth experience. In our forieulaticn, initial

levels of human capital and technology and subsequent productivity and other

shocks determine whether a country grows richer over time or stagnates at

lnw income levels. Many attempts to explain why some countries and con-

tinents have had the best economic performance during the pmst several

centuries give too little attention to accidents and good fortune.

          Our approach relies on the assumption that higher fertiliry of tho

present generation increasos the discount on per capita future consumption

in the intertemporal utility functione that guide consumption and other

detieions. Therefore, higher fertility discourages investments in both

human and physical capital. Conversely, higher stocks of capital reduce the

demand for children because that raises the cost of the time spent on child

care.

          Section 2 sets our the basic assumptions of our analysis and

derives its main implications in an informal way. Section 3 provides a more

rigorous discussion of a special case without physical capital, but with

endogenous fertility and rates of return on human capital that are independ-

ent of its stock. Section 4 formally treats the case with both physical and

human capital, and the case in which the human capital sector uses educated

and other skilled inputs more intensively than other sectors.

          Section 5 discusses several broad implications of the analysis.

Among other issoes, it explains why the brain drain occurs invariably from

less developed to developed countries, whereas less developed countries
 import as well as export financial and ocher cangible capital. We also

 discuss the "cakeoff" period, in which increeses in physical and human

 capital and decreases in fertility are unusually rapid.

              Section 6 suamactres the discussion and offers a few concluding
 comnencs.



 2, jc..Properties of the Model

             This section firsc presents several basic assumptions about human

 capital and fertility and then derives in en informal way the properties of

 two stable steady-state positions, At one, human capital is negligible and

 fectilicy is high, while at the ocher, human capital is widespread and

 perhaps growing over time and fertility tends to be low.

             The production and rearing of children are very rime intensive.

This implies chat higher wage rates -       due perhaps to greater human or

physical capital per worker - -   induce   a substitution effect away from fer-
tility by raising the cost of children.

             A second assumption about fertility is more novel and comes from

recent work by Becker and Barro [1988J on dynastic families.            It states that

the discount rats applied by the present generation to the per capita con-

suispcion of subsequent generations depends negatively on the fertility of

the present generation. Becker and garro motivate the assumption with               a
utility function of parents who are altruistic toward their children. The

discount rets between generations is determined by the degree of              parental

altruism toward each child. Diminishing marginal utility implies that the

discount rate applied to the utility of each child declines as the number of
children innreases.
          A simple formulation is



                  â€”   u(c)   + a(n)nV+1 ,                                    (2.1)


with u' > 0, ii" < 0, and a' C 0; V and V41 are the utilities of parents

and each child, c is parental consumption, and n is the number of

children. The degree of altruists per child, a(n), is negatively related to

the numbec of children.

             assume that the production of human capital is human capital

intensive and uses relatively note human capital per unit of output than the

consumption, child rearing, and physical capital sectors do. By contrast,

the production of physical capital is assumed to use physical capital as

intensively as the consumption sector. The evidence does indicate that the

education sector uses much highly educated labor as teachers and research

ers, whereas the production of physical capital does not seem to use

especially large amounts of physical capital.

          In neoclassical models, the rate of return on physical capital

investments is assumed to fall as the per capita stock of physical capital

increases. A corresponding assumption for human capital is less plausible

since human capital is knowledge embodied in people.      The benefit from

embodying additional knowledge in a person may   depend   positively rather than

negatively on the knowledge he or she already has, There is a similar

assumption behind the mastery learning concept in education pedagogy, where

learning of complicated mathematics and other materials is more efficient

when the building blocks of elementary concepts are mastered (see Bloom

[l976)
                                                                                       I

          A positive   effect of the stock of human capital on investments in

human capital is also part of tho "neutrality" assumption in the literature

on the lifecycle accumulation of human   capital   (see the pionooring paper by
Ben-Porath [1967]; and also Heckman [1976] and Rosen [1976]), the relation

between parents' human capital and the learning of children (in Becker and

Tomes [1986]). and the perpetual economic growth analysis in recent growth

models (Lucas [1988], Backer and Murphy [1968. 1969], Tamura [1966, 1989]).

          The main implication of our two   assumptions   about human capital

investments is that rates of return on human capital do not ioonotically

decline as the stock of humen capital increases. Rates of return are low

when there is little human capital, and they grow at least for a while as

human capital increases, Eventually, they may begin to decline as it be-

comes incraasingly difficult to absorb more knowledge (see the discussion in

Becker and Murphy [1989]).

          To discuss the implications of these aesumptions about human

capital and fertility, consider Figurea 2.1 and 2.2. Human capital per

worker (H) is plotted along the horizontal axis - -   physical   capital is

ignored for the present. The rate of return on investments in human capi-

tal, R.11(H), rises with H and it is relatively low at the origin where H â€”       0.
The discount rate on future consumption, a(n), is high at that point because

it depends negatively on fertility (n), which tends to be high when H is low

because the time spent bearing and rearing children is then cheap,

Therefore, the discount rate on the future would exceed the rate of return

on investment when H â€”   0:


               [a(n)] >          when H â€” 0.                                  (2.2)
 This inequality is a necessary and sufficient condition for a steady state
 when H â€” 0 (at U), for it guarantees that the economy does not want to

 invest when there is no human capital. Moreover, the steidy state is lo-

 cally stable, for the inequality must continue to hold for small positive

 values of H. Hence, the econooy returns over time to H â€” C for some values

 of H > 0. As H increases, Rh also increases and a(.) falls as n falls, so

 that eventually they become equal. Then investment in H becomes pcsitive,

but the economy continues to return over time to the steady state with
H â€”    as long as the amount invested is less than the capital that wears

out.

          However, the amount inveated in human capital continues to rise as

the stock of human capital increases because the tate of return continues to

rise, and the demand for children falls as they become mote expensive.

Therefore, a steady state emerges when H is sufficiently large that it
satisfies the condition



                               â€”
                                   Rh(H*),                                    (2.3)



where n* is the steady-state fertility rate.         If rates of return eventually

fall as H gets larger, H* refers to a constant level of H, as at L in Figure

1. However, if Rn asymptotes to a constant level, then H5 refers to a

constant rate of growth in H, shown by the curve h'h' in Figure 2.2.

          The policy functions it end h'h' in Figures (2.1) and (2,2) give

human capital in period t+l as a function of the amount in t.         The steady
states at H â€”   0   and H â€”   H are   stable locally since hh and b'h' are below
the steady-state line H+i â€”
                                  H   for all H C H, and are above the steady-

state line for all H > H. The point w where H â€” H is a third steady stats

but it is unstable; negative deviations (14cR) lead over time toward H â€”          C,
and positive deviations (H>H) lead toward

          The steady state level H is nonoptimal when the program is not

globally concave. The unstable steady state H is then replaced by a

threshold human capital stock H s H. At H, a parent is indifferent between

reducing and raising the human capital of her children.

          It is easy to incorporate physical capital into the story. With

the usual assumption that the rate of return on physical capital is very

high when there is little physical capital, the equilibrium stock of physi-

cal capital is positive at the steady state with H â€”       0.   The equilibrium
rate of return on investments in physical capital equals the endogenous

discount rate



                [a(n)]1 â€”   K,5
                                  with H â€”   0, K â€”   K,                     (2.4)



where R,5 is the tate of return on investments in K.

          The per capite amount of physical capital at the steady state

with H â€” H* is likely to be larger then at the steady state with H â€” 0

because the discount rate is lower, although the equilibrium per capita

stock of physical capital depends also on the degree of oomplementarity or

substitution in production between K and H. However, if H grows at a con-

stant rate in this steady state, so too would the equilibrium stock of

physical capital.




                                                                                       4!
           The lower and upper stable steady states correspond to undeveloped

and developed economies, respectively, where the lower one has smallaer per

capita incomes, lesser amounts of both human and physical capital per

capita, and higher birth rates. Our analysis implies that rates of return

on human capital CL0) rend to be higher in developed economies, whereas

rates of return on physical tapital (K,5) may be greater or smaller in

developed economies depending on birth rates in both steady states and the

rate of growth of consumption in the developed steady states.

           An undeveloped economy is stuck there unless sufficiently big

favorable technology or other shocks raise the policy function above the

steady stare line at H â€”   0,   or increase the stock of human capital above H.

Similarly, an economy would remain developed unless war or other disasters

destroy enough human capital to lower it sufficiently below H, or reduce the

policy function below the steady state line. Even temporary shocks can

permanently jar an economy into development if it accumulatis enough human

capital (>H) before the shocks are over. Ey the same       token,    however, tem-

porary shocks could push an economy toward permanently low incomes if it

disinvasts enough human capital (Hc.H)   before   the shocks cease.

          Human capital has a more fundamental role than physical capital in

determining these steady-state equilibria because Rh rises, at least for a

while, as II increases, while      falls with K. Given the human capital

investment function, the initial level of par capita human ospital deter-

ames where the economy ends up, regardless of the initial stock-of physical

capital. Although the stock of physical capital may      affect     the rare of

return on investments in human capital, we show in section 4 that an in-

crease in physical capital could either raise or lower the return on human
                                         10                                            4

capital, depending on the degree of substitution between H and K in both

production and consumption.



3. Fertility and Growth

            The next two sections use specific models to illustrate the type

of   steady-state equilibrium and dynamics    discussed   in section 2. This

section highlights fertility, especially the time intensity of rearing

children and the effect of the number of children on the rate of discount of

future consumption. To concentrate on these properties, we ignore physical

capital and assume simple production functions in the consumption, human

capital, and fertility sectors.

            We also assume that everyone is ideniical and lives for two

periods, childhood and adulthood, works T hours as an adult, snd spends all

his or her childhood time investing in human     capital.    A person chooses to

have n children at the   beginning   of the adult period, where v hours and f

units of goods are spent rearing each child (v and f are constants) and         each
child is endowed with H0 units of productive skills. The human tapital of

children depends on the endowments and human capital (H) of their

teachers/parents, and the time (h) spent on teaching. Assuming a Cobb-

Douglas production function and HÂ° and H as perfect substitutes, we have



                                                                               (3.1)



The coefficient A measures the produttivity of investments, b gives the

number of HÂ°units that are equivalent to one unit of H, end           I measures

the effect of scale on the production of human capital.

                                                                                       .4
                                             11



              The consumption sector also has a Cobb-Douglas production func-

tion:




                   c +   fn â€” Dlt(dRÂ°+Ht)                                    (3.2)



where c is per capita adult tonsumption, D measures the productivity of this

sector,       is the time spent by each adult producing consumer goods, and 4 is

the rate of exchange between HÂ° and H. We assume that the consumption

sector has constant returns to scale in the effective amount of time,

2(dHÂ°+H). By summing over the time allocated to fertility, consumption, and

investment, we get the time budget equation:



                   T â€”      + n1(v1.h)   .
                                                                             (3.3)


              This section concentrates on the effects cf fertility by assuming

b â€” d â€”   I   to eliminate any comparative advantage from using human capital in

the human capital sector instead of in the consumption sector. Both sectors

have a comparative advantage reletive to the production of children. It is

also assumed that fi â€” 1:        the economy accumulates human capital without

running into diminishing returns.

              Psrents maximize the dynastic utility function in equation (2.1)

(or state planners maximize the intergeneration utility function in (2.1))

with respect to fertility and the time spent investing in human capitsl. We

simplify the utility function with




                   a(n) â€”   on   and u(c) -       ,                          (3.4)
                                          12




where 0 a        C 1 and O<r < 1, e is the degree of pure altruism (when nâ€”i),

and    Is the constant elasticIty of altruism per child as their number

increases.

             The arbitrage condition between per capita consumption in periods
t   and tel is


                                               1-a
                     u (ce)           1
                    a u'(c+i) â€”
                                  0
                                      n              C    bt â€”     1 +                 (35)

where rh is the rate of return on investments in human capital, and equality

holds when investments are positive. The rate of return is determined by



                       â€”
                           A(tvn+t)             1
                                                                                       (3.6)
                          A(2+1+h+jn+1) 2
                      â€”




It is not surprising that the rate of return             depends   positively on the

productivity of investments (A). Since the rate of return measures the

effect on           of increasing Ht+ii it also depends on the productivity of

greater R5+i. which depends on 1r+l' n+1 and ht+i.

             The first order condition for maximizing utility with respect tc

fertility comes from differentiating Vt in equation (2.1) with respect to




                    (le)anVt+i â€” u' (ct)[(v+ht) (HÂ° )            af] .                 (3.7)


                                                                                               .4
                                        13



The second order condition requires that + a C 1, and u C 0 (see Becker

and Barro [1988)). The left hand side of equation (3.7) gives the marginal

utility from an additional child, and the right hand side gives the sum of

time end goods costs of producing and rearing a child. Coats depend on the

endogenous time spent investing in children as well as the fixed time (v)

and goods (1) inputs.

          At the steady state with H â€” 0, equation (3.5) becomes the strict

inequality



          nE>OIA(T.vn)                                                   (3.8)




with nu being the steady state fertility rate, This inequality will hold

when parents have a sufficiently large I aisily.   The first order condition

for fertility in equation (3.7) simplifies in the steady state with

          The left hand side gives the financiel rate of return from

children in the steady state; the ratio of adult consumption to the con-

suisption foregone to produce a child. The rate of return from children is

greater when endowments are larger and the time (v) sad goods (f) spent to

produce children are smaller. Therefore, parents have teeny children when

they are cheap to produce and yet are reasonably well-endowed with earning

power. A sufficiently high race of return from hewing children would induce

parents to have enough children to discourage any investments in the

children's human capital. Then H â€” 0 would be a steady-state equilibrium.

           This steady state must be stable for some positive values of H.

Since the race of return on investments is strictly less than the discount

race when H â€”   0,   it must also be lass for some H > 0.     Then H0+1 â€” 0, and

the economy returns to the steady state in one generation. Clearly, che

the steady state is also stable for some Ht with positive investment when

H+i C H.
           An increase in the stock of human capital raises per capita in-

come, and hence has a positive income effect as well as a negative

substitution effect on the demand for children. The income effecc dominates

in economies with little human capital if components of f -         - necessities
such as food, housing, and clothing --    are   the the mein cost of rearing

children, as determined from

A positive relation between fertility end per capita income is a Malthueian

property thst helps stabilize the steady state with H â€”       0.    Higher fertility
when H > 0 raises the discount on future consumption and lowers the rate of

return on investments, both effects reduce the incentive to invest, and

help return the economy to the steady state.

           However, our analysis implies that the Malthusian assumption of a

positive relation between fertility and income is a myopic view of the

effects of development on fertility that may     hold   when countries have only a

little human capital, but does not hold when they manage       to   reach a moderate
                                                                                        4

stage of development, Even if parents do not invest   in children,   the cost

of the time input must rise as H increases, which reverses the inequality in

(3.10) when H is lsrge enough. Then the substitution effect begins to

dominate the income effect, and fertility declines with further increases in

H, Eventually, the rate of return on investment in children becomes as

large as the discount rate, and parents start investing in children (h>O).

The amount invested at first is insufficient to maintain the stock of human

capital, and the economy returns over time to the steady state (see point b

in Figure 2.2).

          Investments rise further as the stock of human capitel increases

further. If investments are sufficiently productive (A), and there are

appropriate values of v, e, and r (see equation (3.14, below), the amount

invested would exceed the initial stock for sufficiently high initial stocks

of H. Then H does not decline over time toward H â€”    0,   but instead con-

tinues to grow over time. As H grows, the endowment HÂ° becomes negligible

relative to H, and the goods coat of children, f, becomes negligible rela-

tive to time costs, (v+h)H. The economy converges to a steady-state growth

path (see Tazoura [1989] for a discussion of the stability of this path),

with a constant fertility rate (n*), a constant time (h*) spent investing in

H, and a constant rate of growth over time in both H end c

          The steady-state values n and h* are determined from the first

order conditions for n end h when f and 1j0 are negligible:

The steady-state fertility rats is found by substituting into equations

(3.5) and (3.6):

           Steady-state growth exists if the combination of A, v, r, and           on

the right hand side of equation (3.14) exceeds one. Equations (3.14) and

(3,16) show that an inorease in the productivity of investments (A) raises

both steady-state growth and fertility. Higher fixed-time coats of children

(v), or a more elastic altruism function (c) reduces nt and raises g* as

families substitute away from children when they become more expensive and

toward greater investment in each child.

           Greater altruism (o), or lower adult mortality that expands adult

time (T), both raise n* but do not affect          (see Meltzer [1989] for a
general discussion of the effects of mortality within this model). Note
                                                                                        4'

however, that the absence of any effect of a and T           g* results from the

toostant elesticity form assumed for u(c) and a(n). With other functional

forms, increases in a or T fluid either raise or lower the steady-state

growth rate.

          The analysis implies that fertility and the steady-state rate of

growth in per capita incomes could be either negatively or positively re-

lated among countries, or over time in a given country, depending on why

growth rates differed.        If gt differed mainly because the productivity of
                          *        a                                    *
invesbeants differed, n and g would be positively reletad; if g differed
mainly because the cost of children differed, g* and n* would be negatively

related; and if g* differed mainly because adult mortality or the degree of

altruism toward children differed, g and n might well be unrelated.

Studies of growth rates among countries since 1950 find that they are very

weakly negatively related to fertility rates (see Barro [l92]), This

suggests that growth rates do not differ mainly because of differences in

the productivity of investsents in human capital.

          Our analysis does imply that the jgygJ of per capita income and

fertility would be strongly related. This is easily seen by comparing nu in

equation (3.9) with n in equation (3.16): n >         n for all values of
   0. Therefore, countries with low levela of human capital that have not

undergone much    development   would have higher fertility than developed coun-

tries with much human capital. It is well known       that   the negative relation

among countries   between the fertility rate    and the level of per capita real

income is very strong (see, e.g., the evidence in Tamura [1988. 1989]).

          Since we have been assuming that the value function V is concave,

the optimal human capital in period t+l is a continuous function of the
                                        18                                            It




 human capital in t. With the steady stats at H â€” 0 stable for some H 5. 0,

 and the steady-otata growth path stable for some H, there must also be a

 steady state with a constant positive level of H and a constant n -       - in
Figure 2.2, this steady stats is at H where H â€” H, and the policy function

 intersects the line H+i â€”
                              H.   These steady-state values of H and n are

determined from the first order conditions in equation (3.15) with g â€”        0,
and a first order condition for n.

             A comparison of equation (3.16) when g â€” 0 with equation (3.8)

shows that nd < nu. Even if n and a are positively related for H near

H â€” 0, n must decline below its level at H â€” 0 before the steedy state at

H H. Horeover, equation (3.16) shows that n C nd. fertility is lower

when H is growing at a constant rate than when H is constant. The economy

substitutes away from children as humsn capital and the time coot of raising

children increases.

            When a steady stats with a â€”     0   exists, the steady state with

positive human tapital is locally and globally unstable (see temura [1958]

for a formal proof). As Figure 2.2 shows, the economy moves over tine to
H â€” 0 for all H C H. and it moves to steady-state growth for all H> H. The

instability of this steady state results from the negative relation between

fertility and human capital. The decline in fertility when H increases

above H lowers the discount rate on future constasption and also raises the

rate    of return on investments. Zoth forces raise investments and next
period's human capital relative to this period's. With HÃ·1         > H,   fertility
falls   further and th. process continues.

            Indeed, if this interaction between n and H is strong enough, the

value function becomes convex. Then the function that relates H+i to

                                                                                       I'

has a jump at some capital stock El. The lover leg lies below the steady

state line, with H+i < H for all H C H. The upper leg lies above the

steady-state line, with H+1 > H for all H > El. Although El is not a

steady-state solution to the first order conditions because this solution

does not maximize utility if V is convex, El does have the properties of an

unstable steady state.

          The policy functions become discontinuous even for "normal values

of the parameters. The discontinuous relation between HÃ·i and H at H â€”       El


is matched by a discontinuous relation between nt and H at H â€” El.    The jump

in investment when H increases slightly beyond H â€” El goes together with a

fall in fertility. Since the interaction between n and H produces the

convexity of V it is no surprise that they both are discontinuous functions

of the human capital stock. However, all the adjustment from a switch

between the decay regime and the growth regime occurs through investments

and fertility, leaving consumption unaffetted (see Tamura [1989] for a

formal proof). These results can be seen in figure 4.



4. Gomnerstive Advantese in the Production of Human Genital

          In modern economies1 the human capital sector relies on skilled

and trained labor more then the consumption sector does. The teaching

sector has highly educated employees, while many services and some goods

rely on unskilled labor. Our analysis captures this difference in a simple

way if the endowment (HÂ°) is less important in the production of human

tapiral; that is, if b < d in the production functions for H and t   in equa-
tions (3.1) and (3.2).
                                        20



          If H is small relative tc HÂ°, and if fi in equation (3.1) is close

to one rates of   return   increase as a person accumulates acre human capital.

Therefore, the economy should be more efficient with specialization in the

accumulation of human capital -   - teachers    in the human capital sector should

have more human capital than workers in the consumption setter. However,

such specialization may not be feasible if the capital aarket, especially

the market between generaticns, is undeveloped. Teachers may be unable to

borrow the resources to finance very great investments in human capital.

This paper makee the strong asaumption that because of such capital market

difficulties, specialization is not feasible and everyone has the same human

capital, even when returns inctease as a person accumulates more human

capital (Becker and Murphy [1989] analyze efficient specialization between

teachers and workers)

          We introduce physical capital into the analysis by assuming that

physical capital is accumulated consumer goods that do not wear out. The

consumption sector is assumed to use physical capital more intsn.sively than

the human capital sector, and we treat the simple case where human capital

does not use any physical capital at all. The Cobb-Douglas function in

equation (3.2) is extended to include physical capitaL



               c + fn + dK â€”   D{1(dno+H))7X17                                  (4.1)



where AX is the net (and gross) irrvastment in physical capital. The human

capital production function is still given by equation (3.1), with              1.

          If the human capital sector uses human capital much more inten-

sively than the consumption sector --   if     b is much less than d --   the   rate
                                                                                        1

 of return         on   investments in human capital would be low when H â€” C, and would

 rise for a while as H increases, even if $ <                  1.   The rate of return on H

 when H â€” 0 would be below the discount tate on future consumption even with

 moderate levels of fertility, and hence of the diacount rate. Therefore,

 the comparative advantage of the human capital aector in using human capital

 raises the likelihood of a stable steady state at H â€”                  0.

that on human capital at this steady state.

                 When H is large relative to HÂ°, h and d, the comparative advantage

of       the   human capital eector in the use of H becomes unimportant. With
     â€”   1,    the economy approaches a steady state growth path as H increases,

where fertility is constant, aod human capital, physical capital, and per

capita consumption all grow at the rate g*, given by

along the ateady state growth path when consumption depends also on physical

           Since the discount rats on future consumption depends positively

on fertility, the interest rate with steady-state growth would be less than

that in the undeveloped steady state if fertility were sufficiently lower in

the growth equilibrium to make the right hand side of equation (4.6) less

than the middle term of equation (4.2). This implies that the rate of

return en K(R,5). which equals the interest rate, could be larger or smaller

in the growth steady state compared with the undeveloped equilibrium. An

increaae in the steady-state growth rate -- due to a change in P. or another

parameter -.   could   mean a lower interest rate sod rate of return on physical

capital if fertility fell enough. These results are quite different from

those in the neoclassical model, where interest rates and rates of return on

physicel capital are positively related to the growth rate hecauee the

discount rate is assumed to be constant,

           Since h' the rate of return on human capital, equals K,5 in the

growth equilibrium, hut is less than P,5 in the undeveloped equilibrium, R1L

must increase relative to K,5 as an economy moves between these equilibria.

Indeed, P,0 must be higher in the steady-state growth equilibrium than in the
                                      23




undeveloped equilibrium even if     and    the interest rate are lower. The
reason is that    can be lower only if fertility is lower, but lower fer

tility implies that     is higher; compare the left hand side of equation

(4.6) with the right hand side of equation (4.4) when fi â€”   I and b C d.
          As H and K get larger, fertility ie encouraged by an income ef-

fect but it is discouraged by a substitution effect from the higher coot of

time. Fertility would be lower in the growth equilibrium then in the un-

developed equilibrium if the substitution effect dominates; if parents want

few children when they are expensive. Empirically, fertility is much lower

in rtcher than in poorer countries, which suggests that the substitutinn

effect dose dominate. The lower fertility in richer countries implies that

interest rates and races of return gn physical capital might also be lower

in richer countries.

          The phase diagram in Figure 4.1 helps analyze the stability of the

steedyâ€¢ state growth equilibrium and the dynamic paths of human capital and

physical capital. The point U is the steedy state with H â€”     0 and K > 0, and

the slope of the rey Op gives the ratio of K to H along the steady state

growth path. The isocline it â€” 0 is the locus of all combinations of K end H

that lead to zero investment in K; similarly, for the isocline ft â€” 0.      Since

U is a steady-state equilibrium, both isoclines go through U.

         An increase in K discourages investment in K because K,5 declines

as K increases, An increase in H has conflicting effects on the incentive

to invest in K. It entourages investment because K and H are complements

in production (see equation (4.1) and if an increase in H reduces fer-

tility. However, an increase in H would discourage investment in K if it

lowers the marginal utility of future consumption by raising investment in
                                        24



H. We assume that, on balance, an increase in H encourages investment in K,

so that the isocline k â€” C is positively sloped, as in Figure 4.1.

          An increase in K has conflicting effects on    investments   in H since

it raises the cost of the time spent investing in H, but it also raiaee the

ciarginal utility of future consumption by reducing investment in K and

perhaps by reducing fertility. For given fertility, the net effect of an

increase in K on investment in H depende on the elasticity of substitution

in production compared to that in consumption.3 Figure 4.1 assumes that on

balance, an increase in K discourages investment in H. So that Ã±       â€” C is

positively sloped since an increase in H raises      and hence investment in
H.

          The isoclines Li â€” 3 and k   â€”0 intersect not only at U but also at

an unstable steady state at H. An economy that begins to the right of the

stable manifold M through H grows over time toward the path given by Op (see

curve b in Figure 4.1), whereas an economy that begins to the left of H

declines over time toward point U with H â€” 0 (see curve a). Only economies

that begin along H end up at W. The increasing returna to H and the likely

decline in n as H increasea are what destabilize the steady state at H.

These effects could be strong enough to nake the value function V convex,

and hence the relation between n H+1, and Hi discontinuous, although the

relation between ct+l and H is continuous (Figure 4.2 gives an example).

          The curve b in Figure 4,1 shows that H grows faster than K when an

economy starts off near the steady state at H. Then the ratio of K to H

falls as the steady-state growth path Up is approached. Human capital in

the United Statea appsrencly did grow faster than physical capital since the

turn of the century (Schultz [1960]), and human capital now accounts for a
                                       25



large fraction of all tJS. capital (see the estimaces in Jorgenson and

Freusiani 1989J).

           If a war or other disaater destroys some physical capirsl, rates

of return on K and investments in K increase. Investments in H also in-

crease if the isoclines for H are positively sloped. If the economy had

been on the growth path, H as well as K would grow more rapidly over time

after the disaster than they did before. This implies that the stock of

huiean capital would be greater at any fucure year than it would have been

without the destruction of physical capital. Since the rstio of K to H

approaches the same equilibrium ratio that existed before the disaster, K

must at some future year also exceed the level it would have reached had the

disaster not occurred. Since both H and K exceed the levels they would have

had, per capita income must also eventually surpass the levels it would have

reachad!

           It might appear from this conclusion that destruction of physical

capital should be encouraged, for per capita incomes eventually exceed the

levels they would have reached. But initial declines in per capits income

dominate any eventual increase for the generation that experiences the

disaster since its dynastic utility is reduced.

           The story is quite different when a disaster destroys human capi-

tal, as when a conqueror kills off the educated class. Since investments in

both H and K are discouraged, the economy would always have lower per capita

incomes than if H had not been destroyed. Indeed, if enough human capital

is destroyed --   if the economy is moved in Figure 4.1 from point 1 on the
growth path to a point c that is to the left of the manifold N -    the
                                            25



economy never returns     to   the growth path. Instead, it sinks toward the

undeveloped steady state at 13.

            If the coefficient $ in equationS (3.1) is leaa than one, the rate

of return   on H eventually falls as H increases. Then a steady-state growth
equilibrium does not exist, but it is replaced by a stable steady state with

constant levels of H, K, and n (see point L in Figures 2.1 and 4.1). Pith

$ C 1, the slope of the isooline cI â€” 0 in Figure 4.1 begins to decrease es H

gets larger, and intersects k â€”      t   again at point L. The ratio of 1< to H is

lower at L than at W, hut is higher than along the growth path Op. The

steady state at L, like the steady-state growth path, is stable for all

initial quantities of H and K that are to the right of the manifold K.



5. Discussion

            Kalthus did not pay much attention to human capital, as he assumed

parenta were concerned only about the numbtr of children they have. his

conclusion that ebbs and flows in birth (and death) rates help maintain wage

rates   at a conatant   level is valuable in understanding long run   developments
in England and elsewhere prior to his time. But the Malthusian world was

shattered forever by the persistent growth in incomes and decline in birth

rates that began in the West during the nineteenth century.

            The undeveloped steady state in our model has }talthusisn

properties, for human capital is negligible, fertility is high, and changes

in birth rates may help the economy to return to this steady state when it

is not too far away. However, our analysis indicates that Malthusians have

a myopic view that is inappropriate when economies manage to diverge enough

from the undevelopment trap.         Economies would continue to develop and
                                             27



     diverge from that steady state if technological and other shocks either

     raise the policy functions above the steady-state line or if they raise the

     stocks of human and physical capital sufficiently, for example, if human

â€¢   capital is raised above the unstable steady state amount 11 in Figures 2.1

    and 2.2. Improved methods to uae coal, batter rail and ocean transports,
â€¢
    and decreased regulation of prices and foreign trade ara some changes that

    helped trigger the early growth of the West (see the discussion in Rosenberg

    and Birsell [1986]),

                Considerable luck is needed in the timing and magnitude of shocks

    to give a sufficiently big push to investments in human and physical capi

    tel. But very unlikely configurations of events do occur in the course of

    thousends of years of history. We believe that the West's primacy which

    began in   the   seventeenth century was partly due to a "lucky" timing of

    technological. and political changes in the West.

               Even teaporary eventa, if they are strong enough, can permanently

    wrench an economy away from undeveiopment. If temporary events lead to

    favorable initial conditions, the economy continues to grow even without the

    stimulus of major additional innovations or other events similar to those

    that got the process started. Suppose a sequence of events raised the

    policy function temporarily from h'h' in Figure 2.2 to h"h". The economy

    moves along this function, and accumulates H" units of human capital by the

    time these events cease end the policy function returns to h'h'. If new

    technologies had raised the demand for human capital, the stimulus would

    cease when these technologies were fully exploited, as long as no further

    technological advances emerge. Nevertheless, the economy continues to

    invest in human capital because it had accumulated enough for the process to
                                     28




becoae self-generating. Analytically, growth displays "stare or path"
dependence, and initial conditions count (see Arthur [1985] for a good

discussion of such path dependence in the location of 'silicon valleyc;

also sea David [l98[).

          According to our analysis, at some point in the growth process,

economies experience periods of particularly repid accumulation of human and

physical capital and declines in birth rates and family size. This happens

near the unstable steady states at W in Figures lÃ€, 2.1, and 4.1, and near

the points of discontinuity in Figure 4.2. These periods of rapid change

are reminiscent of the 'takeoff' in Roetow's theory of growth (see Rostow

[1963) for an empirical evaluation of his analysis). Takeoffs in our ap-

proaoh are driven by increasing returns to investments in human capital and

increased costs of children as capital is accumulated. An economy that

starts at point Y is posed either to take off toward sustained economic

growth or to fall back toward stagnation.

          Needham [1969] presents a well-known discussion of why the in-

dustrial revolution did not begin in medieval China, even though that

country was much more advanced technologically than medieval Europe.      lie


emphasizes the policiee of the Mandarin bureaucrats (a view criticized by

Chao [1986]; see also Jones' [1988] criticisms of Needham),   but   he also

recognizes the delicacy and instability of the prior European equilibrium:

"These many diverse discoveries and inventisns had earthshaking effects in

Europe, but in China the social order of bureaucratic feudalism was little

disturbed by them. The bniltrin instability of European society must there-

fore be contrasted with a homeostatic equilibrium in China," ([page 214]

             Cur analysis implies that rates of return   on education and other
 human   capital are   higher in developed than in undeveloped countries, both

 absolutely and relative to rates on physical capital. Rates of return on

 physical capital may be either higher or lower in developed countries,

 depending on fertility and rates of growth in consumption. Consequently, we

readily explain why the "brain drain" of educated and skilled persone almost

invariably occurs from poorer to richer countries -- such as the Indian

academics, engineers, and doctors who migrate to the United States.

Although tangible capital flows in both directions, it is not clear whether,

as implied by our analysis, physical capital goes both to rithet countries

that grow rapidly and do not have particularly low fertility and to poorer

countries that do some growing and have high fertility.

            An increased stock of human capital raises investments in develop-

ing new technologies by expanding the education-intensive research and

development induatry. Since our analysis implies that human capital grows

sharply with development, it readily explains why ayatematit research and

development activities are confined to richer countries.        -


            The rapid growth in the labor force participation of married women

is one of the more striking changes induced by economit development during

the past half century. Our formal model has only one ses, but it easily

incorporates the strong division of labor between married men and women in

undeveloped countries, where women spend most of their time bearing and

raising many   children   and doing other work that is complementary to child

care. The large decline in birth rates and riae In wage rates as countries

develop encourage married woman to spend much more of their time in the

lebor force, which greatly weakens the traditional division of labor.
                                     3t



          It has been known for a long time that recovery from wars and

other disasters is usually remarkably rapid. John Stuart Mill [184S,

page 74J remarked on "what has eo often excited wonder, the great rapidity

with which countries recover fruis a state of devastation the disappearance

in a abort time, of all traces of the mischiefs done by earthquakes, floods,

hurricanes, and the ravages of war." He erguee that recovery is rapid only

when the most of the populetion is left "with the same skill and knowledge

which they had before" (page 75]).

          Figure 4.1 shows that a wartime destructions of physical capital

in a country that starts along the growth path (op) stimulates more rapid

investment in this capital. It may well also stimulate more rapid invest-

ment in human capital; see curve d in Figure 4.1 and the discussion in

section 4. Then per capita incomes eventually exceed what they would have

been had the war not happened, although it still lowers the dynastic utility

of the generations alive at the time. This analysis can explain the rapid

recovery and then vigorous growth in Germany and Japan after World War II,

which suggested to many people the erroneous conclusions that countries

benefit from wartime destruction of their physical capital stock.

          We can alao explain Mill's proviso that knowledge and skills

survive. Countries recover from modest reductions in their knowledge, but

large-enough losses bring a cumulative decline as both physical capital and

human capital slide toward an undeveloped state. This happens in Figure 4.1

if human capital is reduced below the manifold through the unstable steady

state W (see point c). Wartime destruction of physical and human capital

have different consequences because human capital is knowledge embodied in
                                          31



people. When   too   much knowledge is destroyed, an economy loses the founda-

tion for further accumulations of knowledge - -    whether    embodied in people or

disembodied in technologies - -   which   is the essence of economic growth.



6. Concludins Remarks

          Our analysis of growth assumes endogenous fertility and a rising

rete of return on human capital as the stock of human        capital increases.
Societies can save across generations by the birth of many children, by

greet investment in each child, and by long-ten accumulation of physical

capital. When huisen capital is abundant, rates of return on human capital

investments are high relative to rates of return on children, whereas when

human capital is scarce, rates of return to human capital are low relative

to those on children. As a result, societies with limited human capita:

choose large families and invest little in each member; those with abundant

human capital do the opposite.

          This increasing incentive to invest in human capital as the amount

of human capital increases leads to two stable steady states. One has large

families and little human capital, and the other has small families and

large and perhaps growing human and physical capital. A country may switch

from the first "Malthusian" equilibrium to the second "development" equi-

librium if it has reasonably prolonged good fortune and policies that favor

investment,

          There is still only a meager understanding of tha growth process:

of why some countries and regions have grown more rapidly than others, and

why the growth leaders are not the same in different historical periods.

Our analysis appears to highlight important variables in growth and develop-
meat - -   investments   in hunan   capital,   choices over family size and birth

rates, interactions between human capital and physical capital, the exist-

ence of several stable steady state equilibria, and the crucial role of luck

and the past, Perhaps this analysts will push the understanding of growth a
few steps forward.
