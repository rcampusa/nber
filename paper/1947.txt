                       The Welfare Cost of Uncertain Tax Policy




                                      ABSTRACT




     Frequent shifts in tax policy can increase uncertainty about future

net-of-tax wages and interest income. This paper measures the impact of

uncertain tax policy on savings, labor supply, and welfare in the United

States. A vector autoregression model with six variables was estimated

which found the standard error of the one-year-ahead forecast for the wage

tax to be 1.8 percentage points, and for the interest income tax 3.3

percentage points. Furthermore, the negative correlation between

unanticipated shifts in the real interest rate and changes in the interest

income tax amplifies the variability in the real after-tax return.

     A two-period model of consumption and labor supply is developed that

measures the effect of uncertain taxes on savings, work hours, and taxpayer

welfare. Using plausible empirical parameters, it is shown that removing

all uncertainty about future tax policy can lead to a welfare gain of 0.4

percent of national income, or about 12 billion dollars in 1985.

      I. Introduction

     Traditional studies that measure the excess burden of taxation assume

that tax rates are certain and unchanging, at least until the government

decides to change them. However, recent experience in the United States has

emphasized that taxpayers are justified in treating taxes as another

unpredictable factor in an uncertain world. For example, following the

passage of the Economic Recovery Act of 1981, a number of provisions, such

as the controversial rule allowing the trading of corporate tax credits,

immediately came under attack. The threat of repeal discouraged many firms.

from taking advantage of the tax cuts; the chairman of one corporation, able

to sell benefits for less than half their estimated value, attributed the

low price to the "risk of losing the tax benefits through a change in the

tax law or other contingencies." (Clark, 1981). Currently, few agree on the

final outcome of the President's tax reform efforts, leading to considerable

uncertainty about the future marginal tax rate (which may range between 27

and 38 percent under Senate and House proposals), as well as the tax

treatment of specific investment classes.

     The potential dangers of uncertain taxes have been recognized since

Adam Smith, who observed that "The certainty of what each individual ought

to pay is, in taxation, a matter of so great importance, that a very

considerable degree of inequality, .   . . is not near so great an evil as a very



   1Quoted in Clark (1983).

small degree of uncertainty." (Smith, 1976; II: 351)2 This view suggests

that the proper role for the government is to reduce uncertainty about

future tax rates. However, there are two reasons why unexpected variations

in tax rates may increase, rather than decrease, economic welfare. First,

if the income fluctuation is positively correlated with the tax rate, the

variance of net-of-tax income may be reduced, thereby benefitting the

risk-averse taxpayer. In a progressive tax system, for example, a rise in

income is partially offset by a rise in tax rates, while a fall in income is

cushioned by a decline in tax rates. The second reason was suggested by

Stiglitz (1982) and Weiss (1976), who argued that random taxation can

increase social welfare in the presence of existing taxes. The idea is that

the tax uncertainty can cause consumers to work more and save more, thereby

increasing revenues and partly offsetting the distortion caused by the

initial labor and capital income taxation.3

     This paper measures the uncertain component of wage and interest income

taxes during the period 1929-75. Marginal tax rates calculated by Joines

(1981) are used in a vector autoregression (VAR) model   which includes

government expenditure and debt, interest rates, and earnings. The




  2Smith's concern was that the uncertainty of taxation "encourages the
  insolence and favors the corruption" of the tax collection agents.
  Currently, those who write the code, rather than those who collect
  taxes, might be more subject to lobbying efforts. See also the 1982
  Economic Report of the President, p.111.

  3Even if labor supply and savings increases, the consumer may still be
  worse off owing to the additional uncertainty introduced by the random
  taxes. The result depends on the strong convexity of the marginal
  utility function and a weak degree of risk aversion. Also see Chang
  and Wildasin (1985).

 estimated coefficients indicate that the one-year-ahead forecast error of

 the wage tax is 1.8 percentage points, and for the capital income tax 3.3

percent. While unexpected shifts in the wage rate are positively correlated

with the wage tax, unexpected shifts in the interest income tax are

negatively correlated with the interest rate. One reason for this negative

correlation is that unexpected jumps in inflation rates tend to both

decrease real ex post interest rates and increase the real tax on interest

income. The interest income tax therefore accentuates interest rate

uncertainty. Using empirical parameters in a two period model, the annual

cost of uncertain taxes is estimated to be 0.4 percent of national income,
        -   .          .         4
or 12 billion dollars 1n 1985.

     The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II

discusses recent studies of tax uncertainty and presents a simple general-

equilibrium model of consumer, government, and production sectors which

jointly determine labor supply, savings, taxes, government expenditures, and

debt. In Section III, a VAR corresponding to the reduced form of this model

is estimated. Section IV provides a numerically computable model of

individual consumption and labor supply decisions solved subject to the VAR

estimates, while Section V concludes.

     II. A Simple Model of Uncertain Tax Policy

    There has been recent interest in the implications of uncertain or

unpredictable tax policy. Judd (1984) focused on how the timing of future

tax increases affects current labor supply and consumption in a general




  4mis result is not a test of the Stiglitz-weiss hypothesis, which may
  hold for some (e.g., interternporally nonseparable) utility functions.

equilibrium model. He found that for plausible parameters, increased

uncertainty about when a future capital income tax would occur led to rising

current labor supply and savings. Auerbach and Hines (1986) emphasized the

dramatic variations in investment tax incentives during the postwar period,

leading to effective tax rates for myopic investors ranging from -19 percent

in 1982 to 61 percent in 1953. They compared optimal investment patterns of

individuals with myopic expectations and those with perfect foresight in a

model which included adjustment costs.

     Most recently, Kaplow (1986 a,b) has argued that the government should

not compensate taxpayers for unexpected changes in tax rates. Government

compensation introduces moral hazard; firms need not avoid investing in

activities which the government later wishes to discourage through taxation.

Private insurance companies are thought to be the proper institution for

spreading risk.

     In the model below, individual taxpayers form rational expectations

about future taxes, wages, and interest rates. Unlike Kaplow's analysis, it

is assumed that the unexpected tax shifts may not be justified on efficiency

grounds, but often reflect unexpected inflation, expenditures, or policy

vacilations. The general equilibrium model of wage, interest income,

taxation, saving, and labor supply is based on three sectors. The first

comprises consumers, who make labor supply and savings choices contingent on

expectations about future net-of-tax wage and interest rates. The second is

the production sector, which relates the supply of labor and capital to

gross-of-tax wage rates and interest rates. Third, the government sector

simultaneously determines expenditure, debt, and marginal tax rates
                                                5



necessary to collect tax revenue. The model is used primarly to establish

the structure of expectations that rational consumers use to predict future

net wage and interest rates.

     Utility depends on current and future leisure and consumption,

                            U U(C,) + E(U(C2,2)}                              (1)

where C. and         represent consumption and leisure, respectively, and E is

the expectations operator conditional on information at period 1. The

timing of the model is that individuals choose labor supply at the outset of

the period. At the end of the period, wages and interest rates are

realized, taxes are paid, and the consumption decision is made. Labor

supply decisions are determined before the net wage is realized to reflect

human capital investments and occupational choices made early in the life

cycle which affect subsequent work effort.5 Although there is no specific

bequest function, C2 can be thought of as combining second period

consumption and any bequests or assets retained for a later period.6 The

budget constraint is
                                                                *     e U
            C2               *         *           e         h2w2 -R(y2,y2)

                                                R(y1,y1) +           *        (2)
            (l+r2)                                               (l±r2)


  5Alternatively, labor supply could be chosen after the wage is
  realized. However, such a model leads to no uncertainty about the
  marginal tradeoff between C2 and £2.

  6For example, utility U(2,B2) can be maximized subject to C2 =                         +
                                                                                    C2

  B2 where C2 measures actual second period consumption and B2 bequests
  or assets passed to the next period. Holding the relative price of
  bequests and consumption constant, the indirect utility function
  corresponding to U would be V(C2) which could then be substituted
  into (1).

      The progressive nature of the U.S. tax system leads to a divergence

between the average and the marginal rates. Although the actual tax code is

complex and non-linear, it can be approximated as a negative income tax,

with a guaranteed lump-sum subsidy during the two periods of p > 0 and

marginal tax rates t. on wage and r. on interest income. The present value

of revenue is therefore

definition of the capital stock and of labor supply to include savings and

work choices of other generations, but such an assumption complicates the

model and will not affect the results.

       The government sector is assumed to maximize a time-specific objective

function of the form

                             V. = V. (g.,d.,t.,r.)                       (5)

where g. is the ratio of government spending to GNP, and d. the ratio of

privately held government debt to GNP.8 The restrictions on the derivatives

of V are that governments will always prefer to spend more, holding debt and

taxes constant (BV./ag. > 0) and will always be worse off for a given level

of spending with higher marginal tax rates or debt (3V/8x < 0, x

  t.,r.,d.).

approximately by the squared value of the marginal distortion, Barro (1979)

has suggested that the optimal solution of the government is to set constant

marginal rates over time, and use debt to cushion unexpected expenditures

(e.g., during wartime). The formulation presented here, however, suggests a

greater degree of variation in taxes and expenditures, as shifts in savings

and labor supply affect the "price" of expenditures, and as a new

administration leads to a potentially different objective function V1.

       From equations (1) and (4), current labor supply and savings decisions

depend on the expected value and the distribution of future net wages and

interest rates. We therefore presume that individuals making these choices

in period i-i use the information set available at that time to forecast

future net wage and interest rates in period i. Consider first the general

equilibrium solution to the vector of factor prices written as

   =   (w.,r.}'.   Factor prices will depend on the capital-labor ratio, and

hence on total debt and on labor supply and savings chosen using information

from the previous period. Thus P. can be expressed as a function of

concurrent government policy, lagged labor supply and savings decisions

(which in turn depended on lagged values of P and taxes) and an error term.

coefficients.
     The two-period formulation has often been used to characterize

"working" and "retirement" stages of the life cycle. In this model, the

second period need not correspond to retirement; the essential feature of

the prediction problem faced by consumers, however, is that they must make

current savings (and human capital) decisions which will subsequently be

affected by tax policy for a number of years in the future. Since consumers

are making decisions about future consumption and labor supply over a number

of years, their goal is to predict average taxes and factor prices (and the

variance of those averages) over the future time horizon. In particular, it

is assumed that the representative future horizon corresponds to consumption

and labor supply at ages 50-59 planned from the perspective of age 35. The

forecast relevant to the 35-year old is not simply the value (and variance)

of a tax rate in some future year, but the average tax over the entire

lO-year period.10 The next step is to show how the VAR model using annual

tax rates and factor prices 15-25 years in the future. Using q to denote the

III.    A VAR Model of Expenditure, Debt. Income, and Taxes



       The estimation of equation (9) uses yearly U.S. data between 1929 and

1975 in real 1972 dollars. The measure of privately held government debt is

from Barro (1979), while combined federal and state government expenditures

are calculated from the National Income and Product Accounts. Owing to

difficulty in measuring wages since 1929, earnings are estimated in the VAR

model and subsequently converted to wage rates for the numerical

calculations. Earnings are likely to vary more than wage rates if hours of

work are positively correlated with wages. However, average earnings will

also understate the risk of unemployment. Earnings are defined as the ratio

of employee compensation to total non-agricultural employees, while real ex

post interest rates are defined as the Moody Aaa bond rate minus the change

in the GNP deflator (Economic Report of the President, 1985).

       Joines (1981) calculated effective marginal tax rates on capital income

and labor income during 1929-75. The labor income tax is the marginal tax
                                     12



on labor income, weighted by the share of labor income in each marginal

bracket. Taxes on labor income are defined as state and local

(proportional) taxes plus federal wage, salary and social security taxes,

plus taxes on miscellaneous income (which is included as earned income).13

Capital income includes interest and dividend income plus taxable capital

gains,14 while the capital income tax is comprised of state and local

proportional taxes, corporate, dividend, interest, and other unearned income

taxation.

     There are two ways to measure marginal tax rates. The first takes an

average of the statutory marginal rates, weighted by taxable income (Barro

and Sahasakul, 1983a,b; Estrella and Fuhrer, 1983). This paper uses the

second measure of marginal taxes (Joines, 1981; Seater, 1985) which

calculates the actual (weighted) change in tax payments as income grows.
                                                     *
That is, the marginal tax is defined as (T-T )/(Y-Y ), where T and T* are
                                              *

                               *
actual   taxes paid, and Y and Y adjusted gross income, in adjacent
            15
brackets



  13Miscellaneous income was partnership income plus business income
  plus farm income. Assuming that miscellaneous income was attributed
  to capital income generally made less than 1 percentage point
  difference in the tax rate (Joines, 1981).

       alternative definition of income excluding capital gains leads to
  only slightly different tax rates. There might have been greater
  variability in tax rates if the "inflation premium" for interest and
  dividend income had been excluded from the tax base.

  15The second measure used in this paper accounts for available
  deductions and exemptions that tend to rise for higher income
  taxpayers, and would tend to make the consumer's effective marginal
  rate less than the statutory rate. It may understate the true
  marginal rate, since the tax preferred goods will be less highly
  valued at the margin. See Barro and Sahasakul (1983a) and Seater
   (1985).
                                     13




     Estimates of the VAR model are presented in Table 1. These

coefficients should be interpreted cautiously since they measure the reduced

form of the structural model. The coefficient of lagged expenditures on

current debt, 0.992 (t-statistic of 6.20), and the insignificance of lagged

debt on wage taxes or interest income taxes lends support to Barro's (1979)

hypothesis that governments meet shifts in expenditures primarly by issuing

debt rather than raising taxes. However, the negative and significant

effect of lagged debt on current expenditures also suggests that increasing

levels of debt tends to reduce expenditures. Additional lagged variables

were not generally significant.16

     The correlation coefficients for the contemporaneous residuals are also

presented in Table 1.   The interpretation of the covariance structure is

more relevant to the study of how uncertain taxes interact with other

factors. For example, the positive correlation (0.457) between earnings and

wage taxes means that an unexpected drop in earnings (or holding hours per

worker constant, wages) will lead to a lower than expected wage tax. Thus

the worker is partially "insured" by the knowledge that net wages will not

drop by the full proportional amount of the gross wage decrease. The

negative covariance between the interest income tax and real interest rates

leads to even more uncertainty in the net-of-tax rate of return;

unexpectedly low gross interest rates are associated with high taxes, and

conversely. This negative correlation may be caused by unexpected




  16The only exception was the interest rate regression, in which the
  dependent variable lagged 2 years was strongly significant. To
  preserve computational simplicity, however, a first-order lag
  structure was assumed for the entire VAR model.
                                    14




inflation, which tends to reduce ex-post real interest rates and increase

effective tax rates. The standard error of the one-year forecast is 1.8

percent for the wage tax and 3.3 percent for the interest income tax.

     The Joines data stop at 1975, so that measures of effective tax rates

from King and Fullerton (1985) are used for 1980. Weighted effective tax

rates for capital income including insurance companies and non-profit

institutions were 37.2 percent, and the tax on labor income plus the measure

of social security taxes (Barro and Sahasakul, 1983) yields 37.1 percent.

The 1980 average wage and interest rates were $5.02 and 2.7 percent,

respectively. The coefficents of W used to predict F are presented in Table

2, along with the initial (1980) variables and the predictions. Assuming

stationarity of the model, the optimal prediction is that earnings will rise

from $10,040 to $12,160 in real terms, the government will erase its debt,

the wage tax will fall to 31.7 percent (3.5 percent standard error) and the

interest income tax will rise to 44.2 percent (4.4 percent standard error).

     Correlation coefficients of , the variance-covariance matrix of F, are

also presented in Table 2. In the long run, there is virtually no

correlation between the error terms for gross wages and capital income

taxes. The positive covariance between earnings and wage taxes (0.932) and

the negative covariance between interest taxes and the interest rate

(-0.744) become more pronounced in the 20 year forecasts. The next step is

to measure how this uncertainty affects consumer's consumption, labor

supply, and utility.

         IV. A Model of Consumption and Labor Supply



        The utility function in equation (1) is specified as
        EU =
                  ((a +         + E((l+5)(a + C)))/7                                  (13)

where & is the time preference rate, and a is a parameter reflecting the

relative tradeoff between leisure and consumption in a particular year. The

leisure-consumption elasticity of substitution is                a =     l/(l-p),   while

l/(l--y)     is   the elasticity of substitution between household "output" in year
1 and in year 2.17

        Using the budget constraint from equation (4), the first order

conditions for C1 and 2 can be shown to be
                                              1+r
                       E(H11/PlCl -                                      0

where

                            [X + (8-11)w1 -
                       C2                       C1](1-+-r2) + (G-2)w2
                                                    -a



and
                                      =

                                     1  1  1




  17This utility function assumes that the intertemporal elasticity of
  substitution (a) is equal to the inverse of the Arrow-Pratt relative
  risk aversion measure. They need not be; a nionotonic transformation
  of EU could imply different values of the (inverse) Arrow Pratt
  measure and the elasticity of substitution (Hall, 1985).
  18
       In general, l is predetermined, since it was chosen at time 0.
  Assuming that it is freely chosen, as is done here, will tend to
  understate the true welfare cost of tax uncertainty.

       Equations (14a) and (14b) are highly non-linear, and can be solved

using numerical methods. Note that the consumption and labor supply

decisions depend only on wages, the interest rate r2 (which is the annual

interest rate accumulated over the n-year period), and taxes, but not on

government expenditures and debt. Writing wages as earnings divided by 1830

hours (see below), denoting the LHS of (14a) as Mc and the UIS of (l4b) as

    and assuming normal error terms, the first order conditions take the

form

       a1   a2   a3     a4
                                                            = 0   j=c,   (15)

where                 is the truncated density function of normally distributed

random variables with mean F and variance-covariance matrix given by the

corresponding 4x4 submatrix of 2 (Johnson and Kotz, 1972; p. 40). The

limits of integration given by a. prevent explosive solutions (e.g., if r2 <

-1) and reduce computational costs.

       The parameters of the utility function were chosen to be consistent

with life cycle consumption and labor choices for a representative

individual between ages 30 and 40 making decisions about labor supply and

consumption for ages 50-60. The Consumer Expenditure Survey of 1972-73 was

used to measure household consumption and work hours for both the 30-39 year

olds and the 50-59 year olds. Average consumption for the 30-39 year old

families was $9400, while gross-of-tax earnings were $12,400 and assets

(which includes the market value of the house) were $19,000, or the

potential for consuming an additional $1900 per year over the 10 year

period. Using information from the Survey on actual taxes paid, "virtual"
                                      17



 income given the linear marginal tax rates was calculated to be $6500.

Labor supply was assigned by multiplying the number of weeks worked during

the past year times 40 hours (if a full time worker), 20 hours (if part

time) or 0 hours (if reported not working). Average hours for the 30-39

year old were approximately 1830 yearly hours, while 50-59 year olds worked

an average 1680 hours.

       There is substantial evidence about the value of -y.   Friend and Blume

(1975) in their study of financial portfolio decisions suggested that        was

less than 0.5, while Ghez and Becker (1975) placed on a an upper bound of

0.28. Skinner (1985) found estimates between 0.25 and 0.5, although Hansen

and Singleton (1983) and Weber (1970,1975) found values generally exceeding

0.5.    I assume that      0.35, although the model is tested for higher and

lower elasticities.

       The evidence on the uncompensated labor supply elasticity in static

models suggests an average elasticity of approximately 0.3.19 The link

between the elasticity of substitution      and the conventional labor supply

elasticitiy is complex, since changes in the wage rate will also have an

impact on the dynamic path of labor supply. If we assume that the wage

change is foreseen, it can be shown the implied a corresponding to the 0.3

labor supply response will be approximately 0520 The time preference rate


  19
    From Killingsworth (1983; pp. 119-124), men's labor supply appears
  to be at most 0, while for women it is at least 1.0 (although there is
  considerable variability in coefficient estimates across studies).
  Weighting the two elasticities by labor force participation yields an
  average of 0.4. However, other studies of aggregate labor supply
  (Killingsworth, 1983; p. 125) report elasticities primarly less than
  0.2; thus a midpoint of 0.3 is adopted.
                                       18




S was chosen to replicate the observed level of consumption in the first

period ($9400), total time endowment 0 was set to 4000 hours, and the

leisure preference parameter a was adjusted to insure 1830 hours were spent

working in the first period.21

     Comparing a regime with taxes that have a random component and taxes

that can be forecast with compelete certainty is problematic, since

switching to certain taxes will have general equilibrium effects on the

distribution of gross wage and interest rates. However, we can pose the

following conceptual experiment -   - what   are the effects of certain taxes on

an individual given the variance-covariance structure of gross wage and

interest rates? That is, under the status quo of uncertain taxation,

consumption and labor supply are chosen which satisfy (14a) and (14b)

integrated over uncertain w2, r2, t2, r2. This outcome is compared to

certain taxation, in which savings and labor supply are chosen subject to

(14a) and (l4b) integrated over uncertain w and r, holding t2 and

constant (i.e., perfectly foreseeable) at their mean values. The government

can expect to raise equal revenue in both cases.




O The labor supply parameter can be transformed into a by solving for
   -8/8w(w/(O-) in the certainty model; the general solution for
  n-period models of this sort can be found in NBER Working Paper 819,
   an early version of Auerbach, Kotlikoff, and Skinner (1983).

  21The distribution of uncertain wages, interest rates, and taxes was
  truncated by a rectangle 2.5 standard deviations above and below the
  mean for all four variables, encompassing 96.3 percent of the normal
  distribution. The mean value of the gross interest rate used in the
  simulation, r' , was adjusted to ensure that its expected value
  E((1±r')19) was equal to the perfect certainty interest rate (LO)'
                                     19




      The first row of Table 3 presents the results of the model for the

 baseline parameters of    and a. When certain taxes are imposed, hours of

 work rise by 0.1 percent in the first period, and fall by 1.8 percent in the

 second period. The explanation for these changes is that the certain tax

 regime reduces the variance in net interest rates. Thus providing for C2 is

 more easily achieved by saving in the first period, rather than working

 extra hours in the second period; overall savings rises by a total of 0.8

 percent.

      The utility gain of certain tax policy is expressed as a proportion of

 the present value of lifetime income. As Stiglitz (1982) and Weiss (1976)

have emphasized, increased revenue from uncertain taxes can potentially

raise sufficient revenue to offset the loss in utility of risk averse

consumers. Thus the welfare change is measured as the dollar value of the

shift in ex ante utility plus the revenue gain (or loss) from certain

taxation. Column 6 indicates that for the parameters a = 0.35 and
   = 0.50,
           the welfare gain of certain tax rates is 0.4 percent of lifetime

income. Conversely, the annual loss of uncertain taxation, expressed as a

proportion of 1985 U.s. national income, is $12 billion.

     This finding is not particularly sensitive to alternative

specifications of the utility function. Rows 2-5 present results from the

numerically computable model for different values of crc and a. Row 2 uses

an intertenporal elasticity of 1.35; while savings and labor supply is more

responsive to the more certain tax policy, the welfare gain is only 0.2

percent. A high intertemporal elasticity of substitution is also equivalent
                                    20




to a low degree of risk aversion in this model; hence the reduction in

income variation is less valuable. When the labor elasticity is set to 1.5

(row 3) the results differ slightly from the baseline case in row 1; there

is a 0.4 percent welfare gain from certain taxation. The benefits of

certain taxation are 0.5 percent of income when a =   0.15, reflecting the
greater degree of risk aversion, while when the labor supply elasticity is

0.15, the efficiency gain of certain taxation is 0.8 percent. The doubling

of the welfare gain reflects the modest substitutability between

predetermined £2 and random C2.   Finally, the 6th row describes the welfare

gain of uncertain taxes when virtual income is increased from $6500 to

$8500. Because the consumer saves a larger fraction of income, and hence is

subject to greater uncertainty from the interest income tax, the gain of

certainty in tax policy rises from 0.4 percent to 0.6 percent. This

calculation provides support for the notion that the interest income tax,

both because of its greater variability, and its negative correlation with

real interest rates, causes the greatest harm to risk-averse taxpayers.

     One extension of this model would be to introduce government

expenditures explicitly into the utility function. The assumption of the

current model is that expenditures enter utility independently of private

consumption goods. However, if government expenditures (e.g. , medicare,

housing, social security) substitute for private expenditures, then

taxpayers would be partially compensated for expenditure increases

associated with tax hikes. If government expenditures did substitute for

private goods, then the welfare cost of uncertain tax policy would be

reduced.

      V. Conclusion



      The traditional analysis of uncertainty and taxation focused on the

 beneficial effects of a certain tax on the return from a risky asset

 (Stiglitz, 1969; Eaton and Rosen, 1980; Kanbur, 1983) The government, by

 collecting a fixed proportion of the return, or subsidizing a fixed

 proportion of the loss, shares the risk of the investment. This paper has

 shown that tax rates in the United States have displayed considerable

variability during the period 1929-1975, thereby eroding the potential

benefits of taxes in reducing risk. The additional excess burden of

uncertain rather than certain tax policy is estimated to be 0.4 percent of

GNP, or $12 billion in 1985. The random components of the wage and its tax

rate are positively correlated, but the random components of the real

interest rate and its tax rate are
                                     negatively correlated, suggesting that
capital income taxation increases the variability of net interest rates.

     Uncertain tax policy may also be harmful if "permanent" tax cuts are

perceived by taxpayers as random and unlikely to persist in the future.

Although the perceived temporary tax cuts may stimulate short-run

investment, the loss in revenue may not be compensated for by an increase in

long-term investment (Skinner, 1984).

     Tax policy is often unpredictable because of factors beyond the control

of the government. However, the cost of extensive tinkering with the tax

code should be recognized. Furthermore, the value of tax provisions that

are flexible to future economic conditions, such as the indexing of capital
                                    22



gains to inflation, are substantial in an uncertain environment. Neither

the government nor the taxpayer gain from tax codes which must constantly be

adjusted in light of differing rates of inflation or economic activity.

While taxes may be inevitable, they need not be as unpredictable.

percentage terms. Welfare gain is expressed as a percentage of lifetime income.

* Non-wage income is $8500 rather than $6500.
