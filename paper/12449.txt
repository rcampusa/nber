1. Introduction

       The devastation caused by hurricanes during the 2004 and 2005 seasons has been

unprecedented and is forcing the insurance industry to reevaluate the role that it can play

in dealing with future natural disasters in the United States. As shown in Table 1 the four

hurricanes that hit Florida in the fall of 2004 -- Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne---and

Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 comprised half of the top 12 disasters with respect to

insured losses between 1970 and 2005. On a related note, 18 of the 20 most costly

disasters occurred between 1990 and 2005 and 10 occurred in the 21st Century. This

context is totally different than the scale of economic loss the country has suffered from

natural disasters and other extreme events in the 20th century.

                               INSERT TABLE 1

       Hurricane Katrina is the most costly event the insurance industry has ever

experienced with estimated losses likely to be more than double that of Hurricane

Andrew. It is difficult to believe that prior to Hurricane Hugo in 1989 there was not a

single natural disaster in the United States that cost the insurance industry $1 billion.

(Kunreuther and Roth Jr. 1998 Chap. 1)

       The cause of these large losses is a product of several different forces. For one

thing, there has been increased development of structures in hazard-prone areas. Data

from the 2000 U.S. Census reveals that 53% of the U.S. population now resides along

one of the oceans or inland coastlines. From 1970 to 2000 the southeastern Atlantic coast

areas had an increase in population density of 66%, far exceeding the national average of

38%. In Florida the population has increased by 535% between 1950 and 2005, up from




                                              2
2.8 million to an estimated 17.8 million in 2005.2 The total value of insured coastal

exposure in the State of Florida was nearly $2 trillion at the end of 2004. Since financial

institutions normally require homeowners to purchase insurance coverage as a condition

for a mortgage, the amount of insurance in force has ballooned, leading to a greater

potential for catastrophic insured losses today than in previous years.

           There has also been an increase in hurricane activity in the North Atlantic basin.

During the past ten years the number of hurricanes has increased by more than 60%

relative to the low activity period between 1970-1994 and the number of category 3-5

storms have increased by more than 150% when compared with the previous 25 year

period (Risk Management Solutions 2006). The cause of this increased hurricane

activity has been actively debated by scientists, especially during the past couple of years.

MIT’s Kerry Emanuel, a leader in the field, has concluded that the changing pattern is

partially due to global warming and that future warming may lead to an upward trend in

the destructive potential of future hurricanes (Emanuel 2005).

           An appropriately designed disaster insurance program is vital for stemming the

tide of increasing losses from natural disasters while at the same time providing funds to

those suffering losses. This paper addresses the following three questions that are likely

to determine the shape of a disaster insurance program in the United States:

               •   What principles should be adhered to in developing a disaster insurance

                   program?

               •   What is the appropriate balance between private and public sector

                   participation in a disaster insurance program?

           •   Can an insurance policy that provides coverage against all natural perils be

               made attractive to homeowners and insurers as well as policymakers at

               the local, state and federal levels?

       The next section of the paper addresses the first question by outlining two

principles on which a disaster insurance program should be based. Section 3 then focuses

on the second question by analyzing the insurability of a risk and examining the

challenges facing the private sector in providing coverage against natural disasters.

Section 4 turns to the third question and delineates the opportunities and challenges of a

comprehensive disaster insurance program. Section 5 poses a set of open issues that are

currently being addressed by a research project on disaster insurance undertaken by the

Wharton Risk Center in conjunction with the Insurance Information Institute and Georgia

State University. The concluding section summarizes the key issues associated with

providing disaster insurance in the 21st century.



2. Principles of a Disaster Insurance Program

       The principles on which to base a disaster insurance program can be highlighted

by focusing on a hypothetical homeowner residing in a Gulf Coast community subject to

damaging hurricanes:

       The Baylors have a 20 year mortgage on a home along the Gulf Coast that is
       currently valued at $200,000. The bank that issued the mortgage requires them to
       purchase a homeowners’ insurance policy. The best estimate of the annual chance
       of a severe hurricane that will cause damage to the Baylors’ house is p =1 in 100.
       If the hurricane occurs it will totally destroy the Baylor home so that the loss will
       be L=$200,000.




                                              4
Principle 1: Risk-based premiums

            Insurance premiums should reflect the underlying risk associated with the events against

which coverage is provided. To illustrate this principle in the context of the Baylors’ home, the

expected loss to their property from hurricanes is estimated to be pL=$2,000. A risk-based

premium would be $2000(1+λ), where λ is a loading factor reflecting the costs to the insurer of

marketing a policy, assessing the risk, settling the claim if any, and making normal profits. If

λ = .5, then a risk-based premium for the Baylors’ home would be $3000.

           Risk-based premiums provide a clear signal to individuals and businesses of the dangers

they face when locating in hazard-prone areas and provide economic incentives to invest in cost-

effective mitigation measures. To highlight these points suppose that a state insurance regulator

restricted rates in hurricane-prone areas so that the maximum premium that an insurer could

charge the Baylors would be $1500. Assume the Baylors knew that the loading factor on an

insurance policy was λ =.5, and that if a hurricane occurred in their area it would destroy their

home. Based on the $1500 premium, the Baylors would then conclude that the chances of such a

disaster occurring would be 1/200 rather than 1/100.3 More generally, highly subsidized

premiums due to rate regulation, without clear communication on the actual risk facing the

homeowner, will encourage development of hazard-prone areas in ways that are costly to both

the individuals who locate there as well as the rest of society who are likely to incur the costs of

bailing out victims following the next disaster.

           There is an additional reason why insurance premiums can make individuals aware of the

relative risks associated with locating in different areas. Empirical studies have revealed that

individuals rarely seek out probability estimates in making their decisions, and that low

3
    They could rationally conclude that they are getting a “great deal” on their insurance.

                                                        5
probabilities are inherently difficult to comprehend. When explicit probabilities are given to

decision makers they often do not use the information. [Magat, Viscusi and Huber (1987) and

Camerer and Kunreuther (1989)]. In one study, researchers found that only 22 percent of

subjects sought out probability information when evaluating several risky managerial decisions.

When another group of respondents was given precise probability information, less than 20

percent mentioned the probability in their verbal protocols. [Huber, Wider and Huber (1997)]. In

other words, people do not deal with uncertainty in ways that would be predicted by normative

models of choice.

       People are much more likely to pay attention to dollar expenditures when making

location decisions. If they have comparative data on insurance premiums in different regions and

know that these are risk-based rates, they will be able to determine the relative safety of different

areas. In a controlled experimental study on whether individuals can distinguish between

probabilities or insurance premiums for low probability events, Kunreuther, Novemsky and

Kahneman (2000) found that it was necessary to present comparative information on high and

low risk situations for people to judge how safe an area would be with respect to its risk.

       Risk-based rates also encourage investment in risk mitigation measures that are

cost-effective. Suppose that the Baylors could reduce property damage caused by a

hurricane by bracing their roof trusses and installing straps or clips at a cost of $1500. If

the annual probability of a hurricane causing damage to their house is 1/100 and the

reduction in loss due to strengthening the roof in this manner is $50,000, then the

expected annual benefit from roof mitigation to the Baylors is $500 and a risk-based

insurance premium with λ =.5 should be reduced by $750 [i.e. $500(1.5)]. If the

Baylors were offered a 20 year home improvement loan of $1500 at a 10% annual rate of

interest to make their roof more hurricane resistant, their annual loan payment would be

                                              6
$145. The annual savings to the Baylors from investing in this mitigation measure would

thus be $605. The bank will also feel that it is now better protected against a catastrophic

loss to the property and the insurer knows that its potential loss from a major disaster is

reduced. The general public will now be less likely to have large amounts of their tax

dollars going for disaster relief. This represents a win-win-win-win situation for these

concerned stakeholders.

         Now suppose that an insurer would only be allowed to charge the Baylors $1500 for an

insurance policy due to state regulations. Then the insurer would have no economic incentive to

provide a premium discount for undertaking a mitigation measure. In fact, no insurer would want

to market coverage to the Baylors or any homeowner in the hurricane-prone area with similar

risks because in the long-run the insurer would lose money on each of these policies. More

specifically, an insurer’s annual expected loss on the Baylors home would be greater than the

$1500 they would be receiving in premiums.4

Principle 2: Affordable Insurance

         In developing an insurance program that stands any chance of being implemented it is

necessary to recognize the tension between setting premiums that reflect risk and the financial

ability of residents in hazard-prone areas to buy coverage. This was a major issue in the

development of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in 1968. There was great concern

that if flood insurance rates were risk-based, then many residents in hazard-prone areas would be

charged extremely high premiums for flood coverage and would not want to purchase it. Hence

the program was developed with two layers---a subsidized rate for residents currently residing in

hazard-prone areas and an actuarially based rate for those who built or substantially improved

4
  If the insurer were forced to provide coverage to the Baylors at a premium of $1500 then they would want
to offer a premium discount to encourage them to invest in roof mitigation since it would lower their claims
payments following a disaster.

                                                     7
their structures after the federal government provided complete risk information in the area

through flood insurance rate maps (Pasterick 1998). The subsidized rate was also designed to

maintain the property values of structures in flood prone areas.5

        There are some lessons to be learned from the experience of the NFIP that should guide

the development of a future disaster insurance program. With subsidized rates there are no

economic incentives for residents in hazard-prone areas to invest in mitigation measures because

they will not be given premium discounts. Property owners that have repeatedly suffered damage

from floods have rebuilt their property in the same location and continue to receive subsidized

insurance rates. A recent U.S General Accountability Office (GAO) (2006) study revealed that

structures receiving flood insurance payments of $1000 or more over a 10 year period constitute

less than 1 percent of the properties covered under the NFIP but involve approximately 25-30

percent of all claims under the program. To address this problem the Flood Insurance Reform

Act of 2004 provides states and local communities with an additional $40 million a year for

mitigating severe repetitive loss properties by such means as buyouts, elevation or moving the

house (King 2006).

        Based on the experience of the NFIP, one should not provide subsidized premiums to

those currently residing in hazard-prone areas. Rather either the State or Federal government

should offer some type of subsidy or grant that enables low income residents to purchase

insurance at a risk-based premium. Suppose that the Baylors had inherited their home and that

the family’s annual income was $50,000 so that they could not afford to pay $3000 for coverage

against damage from hurricanes. Rather than having state regulators set a maximum premium of

$1,500 for insuring homes like the Baylors, the family could be given an insurance voucher that

5
 The distribution of flood insurance business written in 2005 is anticipated to be 26% at subsidized rates
and 74% at risk-based rates. Those being charged a subsidized rate are estimated to pay between 35% and
40% of the risk-based premium. (Hayes and Sabada 2004).

                                                    8
must be used to buy homeowners coverage. The program could be similar in spirit to the food

stamp program. The magnitude of the voucher would be based on the income and assets of the

resident. Homeowners could also be provided with subsidies or loans to invest in cost-effective

mitigation measures and in return be charged a lower insurance premium reflecting the reduced

damage to their structure from a future disaster. Property owners purchasing new structures

would pay the risk-based insurance premium no matter what is their income level.



3. Providing Protection by the Private Sector: Insurability Issues

        Consider an insurer who would like to provide protection to individuals residing in

hazard-prone areas of the United States. What factors will be important to the insurer in

determining whether to offer coverage and if so, how much should it charge for this protection?

These questions relate to the insurability of a risk. By insurability we mean the ability of the

insurer to offer coverage to individuals at a price that generates sufficient demand for them to

cover the fixed costs of developing and offering the product.

        A set of papers from researchers associated with the Wharton Risk Center have examined

the conditions for insurability.6 Cummins (2006) and Litan (2006) have recently examined this

issue in the context of catastrophic risks. The discussion that follows utilizes concepts from these

papers by focusing on a hypothetical insurer, Naturesway, who is deciding whether or not it

wants to provide coverage to protect homeowners like the Baylors against damage to its house

and contents from future hurricanes.

Law of large numbers

       Naturesway and other insurers are likely to be concerned about the variability of profits

from the risks they insure. The ideal risk is one where the potential loss from each insured

individual is relatively small and independent of the losses from other policyholders. As the

insurer increases the number of policies (n) it issues in a year, the sample mean becomes close to

the population mean and the expected loss becomes more predictable. In other words, the law of

large numbers implies that for large n it is highly unlikely that the insurer will suffer a loss that

greatly exceeds the premiums collected.

       Fire is an example of a risk that satisfies the law of large numbers since losses are

normally independent of one another. To illustrate the application of this law, suppose that an

insurer wants to determine the accuracy of the estimated fire loss for a group of identical homes

valued at $100,000, each of which has a 1/1,000 annual chance of being completely destroyed by

fire. If one assumes that only one fire can occur to any structure during the year, the expected

annual loss for each home would be $100 (i.e. 1/1000 x $100,000). As the number of fire

insurance policies n increases, then the variance of the expected annual loss decreases in

proportion to n. Cummins (2006) considers the case where the insurer is willing to accept a low

probability of insolvency ε arising out of a catastrophic loss when insuring a book of business.

He shows that for risks which are independent and whose losses are characterized by the normal

distribution so that the central limit theorem applies, the equity capital per policy approaches

zero as the number of insured policies becomes very large.

Conditions for Insurability

       The law of large numbers is predicated on the ability of Naturesway or other insurers to

estimate the likelihood and consequences of a risk, and to be able to estimate that risk at a

reasonable cost, and for the risks to be independent of each other. The risks associated with

                                              10
large-scale natural disasters are unlikely to satisfy the law of large numbers. The following three

conditions can then determine the degree to which such a risk is insurable:

Condition 1 is the ability to identify and quantify, or estimate, the chances of the event

occurring, and the extent of losses likely to be incurred when providing different levels of

coverage.

Condition 2 is the ability to set premiums for each potential customer or class of

customers. This requires some knowledge of the customer's risk in relation to others in

the population of potential policyholders.

Condition 3 is the generation of sufficient demand and revenue from insuring this risk to

cover the development, marketing and claims costs incurred by the insurer and still yield

the firm a positive expected profit.

       I will now examine each condition and raise some questions related to the ability

of private insurers to provide coverage in the 21st century.

Condition 1: Identifying the Risk

       To satisfy this condition, estimates must be made of the frequency with which

specific events occur and the magnitude of the loss. The fire risk is relatively easy in this

regard since there are considerable past data available to determine the likelihood of

damage of different magnitudes to different type structures in certain locations (e.g.

distance from a fire hydrant).

       Due to the infrequency of natural disasters insurers have turned to scientific

studies by scientists and structural engineers to estimate the frequency of hurricanes,

earthquakes and floods of different magnitudes, as well as the damage that is likely to

occur to different structures from these disasters. New advances in information

technology have led to the development of catastrophe models (CMs) which have proven

                                             11
very useful for quantifying the likelihood of disasters of different magnitudes and the

resulting damage to properties as a function of the type of construction, location and

other variables.

          A CM combines scientific risk assessments of the hazard with historical records

to estimate these probabilities and resulting damage. The information can be presented in

the form of expected annual losses and/or through exceedance probability (EP) curves

such as the probability that in a given year Naturesway’s damage claims from hurricanes

will exceed a certain dollar amount. CMs can also be used to calculate estimated insured

losses from specific hypothesized events (e.g. a severe hurricane hitting downtown

Miami and Miami Beach in 2006).

         The occurrence of Hurricane Andrew in Florida in 1992 and the

Northridge earthquake in California in 1994 stimulated the insurance industry to

pay more attention to output from these CMs. Today these models are utilized by

individual insurers and reinsurers to determine how much coverage they should

provide, what premiums to charge, and where coverage should be offered and

restricted to increase the firm’s profitability while reducing the probability of

severe financial losses.7

         During the first half of 2006 the three leading modeling firms [AIR Worldwide,

EQECAT and Risk Management Solutions (RMS)] reevaluated their hurricane models

based on the losses from the recent hurricanes in Florida and the rest of the Gulf Coast

and new scientific studies. All three firms have revised their near-term models to




7
 For a detailed analysis of the use of catastrophe models in the context of natural disasters see Grossi and
Kunreuther (2005).

                                                     12
incorporate an increased likelihood of hurricanes in the next five years and hence higher

expected annual losses than they had predicted in 2005.

Condition 2: Setting Premiums for Specific Risks

       Once the risk has been identified, Naturesway and other insurers need to

determine what premium it can charge to make a profit while not subjecting itself to an

unacceptably high chance of insolvency or severe loss of surplus due to a catastrophic

loss. There are several factors that determine what premiums insurers would like to

charge if they are unregulated.

Ambiguity of Risk      The greater the ambiguity the probability of a specific loss and the

uncertainty of the claims payments, the higher the premium will be. In a mail survey of

professional actuaries conducted by the Casualty Actuarial Society, 463 respondents

indicated how much they would charge to cover losses against a defective product where

the probabilities of a loss was well specified at p=.001 and where they experienced

considerable uncertainty about the likelihood of a loss. The median premium values were

five times higher for the uncertain risk than for the well-specified probability when the

losses from each insurance policy were independent. This ratio increased to ten times

when the losses were perfectly correlated. (Hogarth and Kunreuther 1989).

       In another study a questionnaire was mailed to 190 randomly chosen insurance

companies of different sizes asking underwriters to specify the prices which they would

like to charge to insure a factory against property damage from a severe earthquake, to

insure an underground storage tank and to provide coverage for a neutral situation (i.e. a

risk without any context). Probabilities and losses were varied. The probability of loss

and the size of the claim were either well-specified or there was ambiguity regarding the

likelihood of the loss and/or the claim size. The underwriters wanted to charge

                                            13
considerably more for the same amount of coverage when either the probability was

ambiguous and/or the claim size was uncertain. (Kunreuther et al. 1993).8

Adverse Selection          If the insurer sets a premium based on the average probability of a

loss, using the entire population as a basis for this estimate, those at the highest risk for a

certain hazard will be the most likely to purchase coverage for that hazard. In an extreme

case, the poor risks will be the only purchasers of coverage, and the insurer will lose

money on each policy sold. This situation, referred to as adverse selection, occurs when

the insurer cannot distinguish between the probabilities of a loss for good- and poor-risk

categories, but the insured can. Given the development of catastrophe models and better

scientific data on the nature of the risks facing different parts of the country it is unlikely

that adverse selection present a major problem today for insurers providing coverage

against damage from natural disasters.9

Moral Hazard               Moral hazard refers to an increase in the probability of loss caused

by the behavior of the policyholder. For example, providing insurance protection to an

individual may lead that person to behave more carelessly than before he or she had

coverage. One way to avoid the problem of moral hazard is to introduce deductibles and

coinsurance as part of the insurance contract. A sufficiently large deductible can act as an

incentive for the insureds to continue to behave carefully after purchasing coverage

because they will be forced to cover a significant portion of their loss themselves. With


8
  Risk ambiguity does not preclude insurers from issuing an insurance policy even though the premiums
charged will be higher than if the probabilities and outcomes were well-specified. As pointed out by Jaffee
(2006) insurance was provided for telecommunication satellites from their very first launch even though
there was no historical data on the likelihood that the satellite would be destroyed. Froot and Posner
(2002) also indicate that insurance can be provided for catastrophic events even though there is
considerable parameter uncertainty with respect to these risks.
9
  The absence of adverse selection has been empirically demonstrated in several other insurance markets. In
these markets the data show that there is no positive correlation between the level of risk and the quantity
of insurance coverage. For a survey of these studies during the past ten years see Henriet and Michel-
Kerjan (2006).

                                                    14
coinsurance the insurer and the insured share the loss together. As with a deductible, this

type of risk-sharing arrangement encourages safer behavior because those insured want to

avoid having to pay for some of the losses.10

           Even with these clauses in an insurance contract, individuals may still behave

more carelessly with coverage simply because they are protected against a large portion

of the loss. For example, they may decide not to take precautionary measures that they

would have adopted had they been uninsured. The cost of adopting mitigation may now

be viewed by policyholders as too high relative to the expected dollar benefits that they

perceive with respect to this investment.

           The other type of moral hazard problem that could exist with respect to natural

hazards is illustrated by a decision to move unwanted furniture to the basement a day or

two in advance of a predicted flood or hurricane to increase the likelihood that they will

be damaged or destroyed than had they remained in their normal spots. Similarly a

homeowner may claim cracks and other damage that existed prior to the earthquake from

the disaster itself (ex post moral hazard). A sufficiently large deductible might prevent

individuals from putting contents in harms way or providing false information about the

cause of damage from a disaster, as well as having cost advantages over other methods

for dealing with build-up such as claims adjustment.

Correlated Risk              Earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and other large-scale natural

disasters produce highly correlated losses since a single event will damaged and

destroyed many homes in the affected area. Insurers who cover the risks from such

disasters may have to pay potentially large claims to policyholders before they are able to

collect sufficient premiums to cover their costs. This timing risk is an important element

associated with highly correlated risks and catastrophic losses. [Litan (2006)].

       To illustrate the nature of timing risk consider the decision by Naturesway as to

how much coverage it will want to offer and what premium it will want to charge for

damage to homes in one region of the Gulf Coast from future hurricanes. To keep the

analysis simple assume that all the structures are identical to the Baylor home. Each

home is valued at $200,000 and will be destroyed by a hurricane that has a probability of

1/100 of occurring next year. Suppose Naturesway insured 100 such homes in the area at

a risk-based premium of $3000 [i.e. (1+ λ)pL = 1.5 ($2000)] and the hurricane would

destroy all the homes (i.e. perfect correlation). Then Naturesway would collect $300,000

in premiums each year but would be forced to pay out $20 million in claims should a

damaging hurricane hit the area where the Baylors and others live. Unless Naturesway

had considerable surplus it could become insolvent from this event. Should that be the

case, and depending on which state it operates, part of the claims Naturesway is unable to

pay would be reassessed against all other insurers operating in this state, as we have seen

after the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes when several catastrophe state funds became

technically bankrupt.

       More generally, this has been also a critical issue facing countries when they set

up any type of insurance pool for covering losses from catastrophic events such as natural

disasters or terrorism. Several countries have responded by providing the pool with some

type of temporary government backstop to cover losses should the pool not have enough

reserves to pay claims from a major disaster. When this occurs the pool is responsible for

reimbursing the central government after it gets back on its feet again (e.g., Pool Re in

the UK for terrorism insurance).

                                             16
        Actuaries and underwriters both utilize heuristics that reflect this concern with

insolvency in determining how much coverage to offer in hazard-prone areas and what

premium to charge. Actuaries at Naturesway will first use their best estimates of the

likelihood of hurricanes of different intensities to determine an expected annual loss to

the property and contents of a particular residence such as the Baylor home. Underwriters

utilize the actuary’s recommended premium as a reference point and then focus first on

the impact of a major disaster on the probability of insolvency or some prespecified loss

of surplus to determine an appropriate premium to charge and the number of policies to

market. (Kunreuther 1989).

        Roy (1952) first proposed a safety-first model to characterize this type of firm

behavior. In the context of insurance, such a model explicitly concerns itself with

insolvency when determining the maximum amount of coverage the insurer should offer

and the premiums to charge. Stone (1973) formalized these concepts by suggesting that

an underwriter who wants to determine the conditions for a specific risk to be insurable

will first focus on keeping the probability of insolvency below some threshold level (q*).

Let    A = the insurer’s total assets. The underwriter is considering whether to provide

coverage for a risk at a premium z* for each policy it sells. The likelihood of a loss

occurring is p and the magnitude of the loss is L. Then a safety first model implies that

the underwriter will determine the maximum number of policies m it is willing to sell so

that

        m
        ∑ {Probability [jL > (A+mz*)]}< q*                     (1).
        j=1




                                             17
where q* is a preassigned probability that reflects the insolvency probability that the

firm is willing to tolerate (i.e. its acceptable risk of insolvency).11

         To illustrate the nature of a safety-first model for underwriters, suppose that

Naturesway had a surplus of A= $15 million and wanted to determine how many

policies to write in the hazard-prone area where the Baylors locate. Suppose the risks

were perfectly correlated and there is a probability p=1/100 of a loss of L= $200,000 to

each house that Naturesway insured against damage from hurricanes. If Naturesway

charged a risk-based premium of $3,000 per policy and q* < 1/100, then the underwriter

would not want to write more than 76 policies in order to meet the solvency constraint

given by equation (1).12 Naturesway would only want to maintain its current book of

business of 100 insured homes in the area if it could transfer some of the risk of a

catastrophic loss to others through reinsurance or financial instruments such as

catastrophe bonds.

         Rating agencies may also play a role in influencing how many policies an insurer

will want to write on risks with respect to catastrophic losses. A recent report by AM

Best focuses on the importance of the ratio of annual insured catastrophic losses as

percentage of policyholder surplus (PHS). In general, the report notes that the higher the

level of loss relative to surplus, the greater has been the financial damage to the insurance

industry (Williams and King 2006).




11
    The use of a safety-first model implies that underwriters are risk averse. Greenwald and Stiglitz (1990)
contend that managers suffer damage to their personal career prospects if their companies become insolvent
and that they cannot diversify their risk as owners of the firm can. By this logic, underwriters would focus
on the insolvency constraint where the owners of the firm would be less likely to do so.
12
   Since the risks are perfectly correlated for this example and q* < 1/100, the maximum number of policies
(m*) is determined by finding the largest value of m where mL <A+mz*. If L=$200,000, A= $15 million
and z*= $3,000 then m* =76.

                                                    18
       The AM Best report points out that insured catastrophic losses of less than 5% of

PHS has been the norm during the 88 of the past 100 years and that the damage to the

industry’s financial stability has been minimal. On the other hand, when insured

catastrophic losses are between 10% and 20% of PHS, as was the case in 1938 with the

Great New England hurricane and in 1992 with Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki, then there

was considerable financial stress placed on the industry.

       It is unclear how rating agencies treat the ratio of catastrophic losses/policyholder

surplus for individual firms. In the case of the terrorism risk, insurers are concerned with

maintaining an aggregate exposure to any terrorist attack at no more than 10 percent of its

surplus based on concerns that they might be downgraded by rating agencies if their

exposure/surplus ratio exceeded this percentage (Wharton Risk Center 2005). If one

applies the same criterion to natural disasters, then an insurer would want to limit its

coverage against catastrophic risk by reducing the number of policies that it insures

unless it could lay off a portion of its risk through reinsurance or other risk transfer

instruments. In the above example, if Naturesway had a surplus of $15 million it would

only want to write 7 homeowners policies, each for coverage of $200,000, should the

insurer believe that the losses were perfectly correlated and it wanted to keep its cat risk

potential less than 10% of its surplus (i.e. below $1.5 million).

Condition 3: Sufficient Demand for Coverage

       After examining the coverage that Naturesway believes it can offer at risk-based

rates, the company may be convinced that it cannot offer enough policies to cover the

fixed costs associated with developing a program for marketing coverage. One

alternative is to raise premiums to cover some of these costs but this would adversely

affect demand. If there are regulatory restrictions that limit the price insurers can charge

                                              19
for certain types of coverage, then Naturesway may not want to provide protection

against these risks. In addition, if Naturesway’s portfolio leaves them vulnerable to the

possibility of extremely large losses from a given disaster due to adverse selection, moral

hazard, and/or high correlation of risks, then it will want to reduce the number of policies

in force for these hazards.

       To illustrate the challenges that insurers face in this regard, suppose Naturesway

is considering marketing a new policy where the fixed costs are D dollars to develop and

administer in addition to the marginal costs associated with marketing a policy and

processing claims that comprise the loading factor λ. The fixed cost D can be spread

across the number of policies that the insurer is able to sell. To the extent that

Naturesway is restricted in selling large numbers of policies because of the impact that a

loss will have on its surplus, a higher premium will have to be charged per policy sold in

order to cover these fixed costs D. However, the higher the premium will lower the

demand for coverage. In other words, high values of D, coupled with a concern with

insolvency, may make a risk uninsurable even if there are no rate regulations. It is thus

not surprising that some insurers are reluctant to offer coverage against risks that have

catastrophic potential, particularly after suffering losses from a major disaster that causes

a large loss of surplus. Any restrictions on the rates that insurers can charge for coverage

will exacerbate the problem.

       In fact, recent experience with losses from large-scale disasters suggests

that the insurance industry will turn to the public sector for assistance. Following

Hurricane Andrew, which caused $21.5 billion in insured losses (in 2002 prices)

to property in the southern coast of Florida, some insurers felt that they could not

continue to provide coverage against wind damage in hurricane-prone areas

                                              20
within the State, especially since insurance rate regulation would prevent them

from charging the high rates required to continue writing coverage. This led to

the formation of the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund that reimburses a portion

of insurers’ losses following major hurricanes (Lecomte and Gahagan 1998).

        In the case of earthquakes, the Northridge, CA earthquake of January 1994

caused $12.5 billion in private insured losses while stimulating considerable

demand for coverage by residents in earthquake-prone areas of California.

Insurers in the state stopped selling new homeowners policies because they were

required to offer earthquake coverage to those who demanded it and were

concerned with the possibility of suffering large losses from the next severe

earthquake in California. This led to the formation of the California Earthquake

Authority (CEA) in 1996 which limited the losses that insurers can suffer from a

future earthquake (Roth, Jr. 1998).

        Given rate and coverage restrictions imposed on them, some insurers

claim that coverage for wind damage from hurricanes and earthquake losses

cannot be profitably marketed today in Florida and California.13 Insurers reached

a similar conclusion a number of years ago with respect to the flood hazard,

which led to the development of the National Flood Insurance Program in 1968.



3. Comprehensive Disaster Insurance---Advantages and Disadvantages14

        One way to deal with issues of insurability discussed above is to have insurers provide

coverage against all hazards in a single policy. Current insurance programs for residents in
13
   It should be noted that most insurance companies made large profits prior to the early 1990s by
marketing hurricane insurance in Florida and earthquake coverage in California. However, all of these
disappeared, and more, with the occurrence of Hurricane Andrew and the Northridge earthquake.
14
    This section is based on Kunreuther (2006) and Kunreuther and Pauly (in press).

                                                   21
hazard prone areas are segmented across perils. Standard homeowners and commercial

insurance policies, normally required as a condition for a mortgage, cover damage from fire,

wind, hail, lightning, winter storms and volcanic eruption. Earthquake insurance can be

purchased for an additional premium. As noted in the introduction, flood insurance for residents

and businesses is offered through the National Flood Insurance program, a public-private

partnership created by Congress in 1968.

       If one is to develop a comprehensive disaster insurance policy it should adhere to the two

principles of risk-based rates and affordability discussed in Section 2. A comprehensive

insurance policy with risk-based premiums is likely to come closer to meeting the conditions of

insurability discussed in the previous section than the current program. However, it also presents

challenges for small insurers that market policies in only a single state subject to catastrophic

losses from natural disasters. All insurers face the challenge of having to convince a

policyholder living far away from any water that he or she is not being charged a premium to

cover the losses from those at risk from flood damage.

       The idea of a comprehensive disaster insurance program where all natural disasters are

covered by a single policy is not a new one. I proposed such a program for the United States

many years ago in one of my first papers on the disaster insurance (Kunreuther 1968). In 1954

Spain formed a public corporation, the Consorcio de Compensation de Seguros (CCS) that today

provides mandatory insurance for so-called “extraordinary risks” that include natural disasters

and political and social events such as terrorism, riots and civil commotion. Such coverage is an

add-on to property insurance policies that are marketed by the private sector. CCS pays claims

only if the loss is not covered by private insurance, if low income families did not buy insurance

and/or the insurance company fails to pay because it becomes insolvent. The government




                                             22
collects the premiums and private insurers market the policies and handle claims settlements

(Freeman and Scott 2005).

       In France, a mandatory homeowners policy also covers number of different natural

disasters along with terrorism. The main difference comes at the reinsurance level which is

partially provided by a publicly owned reinsurer, the Caisse Centrale de Reassurance, for flood,

earthquakes, and droughts, and by an insurance pool, Gareat, with unlimited government

guarantee for terrorism. There is no public reinsurance for storms (Michel-Kerjan and de

Marcellis, 2006).

Advantages of Comprehensive Disaster Insurance

       Consider an insurer marketing homeowners coverage in different parts of the country.

With risk-based rates it will collect premiums that reflect the earthquake risk in California,

hurricane risk on the Gulf Coast, tornado damage in the Great Plains states and a flood risk in the

Mississippi Valley. Each of these disaster risks is independent of the others. Using the law of

large numbers discussed above, this higher premium base and the diversification of risk across

many hazards reduces the likelihood that such an insurer will suffer a loss that exceeds its

surplus in any given year for a given book of business.

       An all-hazards homeowners policy should also be attractive to both insurers and

policyholders in hurricane-prone areas because it avoids the costly process of having an adjuster

determine whether the damage was caused by wind or water. This problem of separating wind

damage from water damage was a particularly challenging one following Hurricane Katrina.

Across large portions of the coast, the only remains of buildings were foundations and steps

where it is difficult to determine the cause of damage. In these cases insurers may decide to pay

the coverage limits rather than incurring litigation costs to determine whether the damage came

from water or wind. For a house still standing, this process is somewhat easier since one knows,

                                             23
for example, that roof destruction is likely to be caused by the wind and water marks in the

living room are signs of flooding (Towers Perrin 2005). 15An all hazards policy would also deal

with the problem that insurers currently face with respect to fire damage caused by earthquakes.

Even if a homeowner has not purchased an earthquake insurance policy it will be able to collect

any damages from an earthquake due to fire. In the case of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake

most of the damage was caused by fire and insurers were on the hook to cover these losses. In

this sense homeowners insurance actually covers a portion of earthquake losses even though this

coverage is excluded from the policy

         Another reason for having an insurance policy that covers all hazards is that there will be

no ambiguity by the homeowner as to whether or not he or she has coverage. Many residing in

the Gulf Coast believed they were covered for water damage from hurricanes when purchasing

their homeowners policies. In fact, lawsuits were filed in Mississippi and Louisiana following

Katrina claiming that homeowners policies should provide protection against water damage even

though there are explicit clauses in the contract that excludes these losses (Hood 2005).

         The attractiveness of insurance that guarantees that the policyholder will have coverage

against all losses from disasters independent of cause has also been demonstrated experimentally

by Kahneman and Tversky (1979). They showed that 80 percent of their subjects preferred such

coverage to what they termed probabilistic insurance where there was some chance that a loss

was not covered. What matters to an individual is the knowledge that he or she will be covered

if her property is damaged or destroyed, not the cause of the loss. Such a policy has added

benefits to the extent that individuals are unaware that they are not covered against rising water

or earthquake damage in their current homeowners policy.


15
  If the insurance company is to set risk based premia, they may still need to unbundle the risk to build an
experience data base, as pointed out to me by Tom Russell.

                                                     24
        Another advantage of a comprehensive homeowners program is that it may address some

of the issues that currently plague the National Flood Insurance Program. As noted in a recent

GAO report (2006) only half of the properties eligible for flood insurance are covered by it.

Furthermore there were a number of properties suffering water damage from Hurricane Katrina

that were not eligible to purchase flood insurance under the NFIP. Those who did have flood

insurance and suffered large losses from the rising waters were only able to cover a portion of

their losses because the maximum coverage limit for flood insurance under the NFIP is $250,000

on building property and $100,000 on personal property (Hartwig and Wilkinson 2005).

        Naturally, an all-hazards insurance policy will be more expensive than the standard

homeowners policy because it is more comprehensive. If premiums are based on risk then

policyholders would only be charged for hazards that they face. Thus a homeowner in the Gulf

Coast would theoretically be covered for earthquake damage but would not be charged anything

for this additional protection if the area in which they reside is not a seismically active area. In

promoting this all-risk coverage one needs to highlight this point to the general public who may

otherwise feel that they are paying for risks that they do not face.

Disadvantages of Comprehensive Disaster Insurance

        The major disadvantage of a comprehensive disaster insurance program with risk-based

rates is that it will force state regulators to allow insurers to raise their rates to raise their rates to

cover the potential damage in hazard-prone areas. For example, in Florida insurance rates along

the coast subject to hurricanes are currently well below the actuarially fair premium.(Grace,

Klein and Kleindorfer 2004). If insurance commissioners allow companies to charge a rate that

reflects the risk many individuals will be forced to pay premiums that are considerably higher

than what they are currently charged. Many are likely to complain that this is highly unfair and

unanticipated.

                                                25
       A large increase in premium will be viewed by homeowners as unjustified and there will

be significant resistance to paying for this coverage. For high income residents who have second

homes on the coast there is an economic rationale for them to pay the cost of their insurance. A

step in this direction was recently discussed by the Florida legislature indicating that homes

valued at over $2 million would have to be turned down by three surplus lines carriers (whose

rates are not regulated) before they could turn to the state fund for coverage. For lower income

residents there needs to be an insurance subsidy from the state or federal government (as

discussed in Section 2) so that these homeowners can afford to purchase coverage.

       Many insurers are likely to resist a comprehensive disaster insurance program because

they may fear the possibility of even larger losses than they have suffered to date and because

their current efforts may not be geared towards underwriting and marketing all perils policies.

Some note that if both wind and water damage were to be included in a homeowners policies the

losses from Hurricane Katrina to private insurers would be considerably higher. In order for

insurers to feel comfortable with such a program they would have to be able to protect

themselves against catastrophic losses either through private risk transfer instruments (e.g.

reinsurance, catastrophe bonds), State funds or federal reinsurance.

       There will also be special needs facing small companies operating in a single state who

have smaller surplus than larger firms and are limited in their ability to diversify their risk. These

insurers may find that the variance in their losses increases by incorporating the flood and

earthquake risks as part of a homeowners policy. For example, a Louisiana insurance company

providing protection against hurricane damage might find the variance in losses to be higher than

it is today if both wind and water damage were covered under a homeowners policy. For these

companies to compete with larger firms they would have to be able to protect themselves against

catastrophic losses through either private or public-based risk transfer instruments that would not

                                             26
price them out of the market. Remark: Dwight has a recent paper on single line insurers which

may be relevant to this issue.

       These smaller firms need to be differentiated from single-state subsidiaries established by

some national insurer groups to help the parent company maintain or establish a high financial

rating. The parent company has the option to disown itself from this single state subsidiary

should it suffer a catastrophic loss (Grace, Klein and Liu 2006). There needs to be some

protection given to the policyholders in this case should the single-state subsidiary declare itself

to be insolvent.

       Insurers who market a comprehensive disaster insurance policy face an additional

challenge in trying to convince homeowners that they are only paying for risks that they actually

face. One way for them to do this is to itemize the cost of different types of coverage on the

policy itself in much the way current homeowners or automobile insurance breaks up the cost for

different types of protection. If the Baylor family knew that it would be paying $3,000 for wind

coverage, $1500 for water coverage, $500 for fire coverage and $0 for earthquake coverage, it

would not complain about covering damage from seismic risk facing California homeowners.

Such an itemized list of coverage would also highlight the magnitude of risks that the Baylors

faced by living in their home, another role that insurance can play----a signal as to how

hazardous a particular place is likely to be. Whether or not this information will convince

consumers that it is worth purchasing all-perils coverage is an open question. If the price is very

high individuals will resist purchasing a policy voluntarily even if they know it is based on risk.



4. Open Issues for Future Research

       There are a number of issues that need to be examined in order to determine whether a

comprehensive disaster insurance program has a chance of being implemented, whether an

                                             27
alternative disaster insurance program is more appropriate or whether one should maintain the

status quo. A program of research is now being undertaken by the Wharton Risk Management

and Decision Processes Center in conjunction with the Insurance Information Institute and

Georgia State University that will be exploring these issues.

Mandatory vs. Voluntary Insurance

           Should all property owners be required by the federal or state government to have

insurance coverage against natural disasters? Today, banks normally require homeowners and/or

commercial insurance as a condition for a mortgage. There will be some individuals who either

own their house outright or are not required by their bank to purchase insurance. One of the

open questions where we need better data are the number of uninsured homes in hazard prone

areas and the income distribution of those individuals who reside in them. If there are a

significant number of uninsured individuals, many of whom are in the middle and low income

brackets, the federal government is likely to provide financial 16assistance following the next

large-scale disaster. If the disaster occurs at a critical time in the political process it is almost

certainty that liberal relief will be forthcoming. One only has to look back at earlier disasters,

such as the Alaskan earthquake of March 1964 and Tropical Storm Agnes of June 1972 that

occurred during a Presidential election year, to remind oneself of the type of aid the Federal

government is capable of giving. In both disasters there were low interest loans and forgiveness

grants that actually resulted in individuals being financial better off after the disaster than before

the event. Moss (2002) documents the nature of government assistance for both natural disasters

and other risks.

           If the prevailing view is that those residing in hazard-prone areas should be responsible

for covering their own losses then a mandatory insurance program would be appropriate. Many

16
     For more details on the disaster assistance program following these two disasters see Kunreuther (1973).

                                                      28
states require automobile insurance as a condition for driving Disaster insurance could be treated

in a similar fashion by including the premium as part of a person’s property tax assessment. To

the extent that individuals misperceive the amount of assistance they will receive following a

disaster, requiring insurance may be viewed by them as a blessing should these individuals suffer

losses from a disaster. Following Hurricane Katrina uninsured victims complained about not

receiving more disaster assistance. They may not have known that under the Stafford Act, the

maximum amount of assistance to any individual or household for repairing damaged property is

$25,000 (FEMA 2006). Although the Small Business Administration (SBA) offers loans of up to

$200,000 for repairs to damaged primary residences, low income residents may not eligible for

them because of their inability to repay the loan.

Tax Write-offs for Uninsured Losses

        One factor that needs to be considered when examining whether or not to make insurance

mandatory are the income tax provisions with respect to uninsured losses. At the federal level

homeowners who have losses from a disaster that exceed 10% of their income can deduct this

loss when filing their taxes.17 Homeowners in a high tax bracket who are not required to

purchase insurance because they don’t have a mortgage may determine that it makes economic

sense to be uninsured and use the tax write-off provision to cover a significant portion of their

losses following a major disaster (Kaplow 1992). Some states may also have similar provisions

in their tax codes which would provide additional savings to these uninsured victims by reduced

state income tax payments.

                                                   29
Mitigating Losses from Natural Disasters

        To reduce losses from future disasters property owners need to protect themselves by

investing in cost-effective mitigation measures. The importance of well-enforced building codes

coupled with appropriate land use regulations cannot be overemphasized in this regard. These

measures are likely to be controversial since they limit economic development and growth in

hazard-prone areas and thus reduce the tax base for the State, and may increase housing costs.18

The construction and real estate sectors have traditionally opposed measures that increase the

price of a structure so that one needs to provide appropriate economic incentives for undertaking

these measures. Long-term loans tied to a mortgage for mitigating a structure coupled with

reduced insurance premiums are one way to make these measures financially attractive. The

example provided in Section 2 where the Baylors were far better off financially by investing in

roof shutters illustrates this point.

Providing Affordable Coverage

        One of the principles guiding any disaster insurance program is that insurance premiums

reflect the risk. State insurance departments need to give insurers freedom to charge these rates

subject to solvency regulations that prevent undercapitalized insurers from charging unduly low

premiums with the intent of declaring bankruptcy should a catastrophic disaster occur. A key

challenge facing the states and federal government would be how to provide affordable coverage

and deal with the political fallout that will undoubtedly occur when insurance rates are increased

from their current levels. This is a major political problem and needs to be discussed openly with

the concerned stakeholders. When presenting this issue one needs to highlight the importance of

risk-based rates for encouraging property owners to invest in cost-effective mitigation measures


18
  See Listokin and Hattis ( 2005) for more detail on the impact that building codes have had on housing
costs.

                                                   30
and the savings that will emerge from a reduced disaster assistance program following a

catastrophic event.

Protecting Insurers against Catastrophic Losses

        One of the reasons that some insurers are now withdrawing coverage from areas that are

subject to large-scale losses is because they are concerned with the impact that a disaster will

have on their surplus should it occur in the next few years. As shown with the illustrative

example of the Naturesway insurance company, the premiums that an insurer collects in any

given year on its homeowners policy will only pay a fraction of the claims should a large number

of their insured properties suffer severe damage from a disaster.

        An important issue that needs to be examined carefully is whether the private sector has

the ability to provide sufficient coverage against catastrophic losses or whether one needs to rely

on some type of public sector involvement at the State and/or federal level for financial

protection should a large-scale hurricane or earthquake occur. There have been a number of

recent papers that have addressed this issue in the context of natural disasters that suggest a

variety of different ways to address the problem.19 There is general agreement that one should

do everything one can to rely on the private sector to provide insurance protection but that there

may be capacity limitations which require public sector involvement.

        In order to address this issue one needs to have a clearer understanding of the availability

of risk transfer mechanisms, such as reinsurance and catastrophe bonds, and their costs to

insurers relative to public sector options such as state catastrophe funds and federal reinsurance.

Given the need for short-term funds to help replenish surplus following a disaster there may be a

role that federal loans can play as noted by Jaffee and Russell (2006) or some type of

reinsurance contracts auctioned by the federal government as proposed by Lewis and Murdock

(1997). The federal government does have an easier time raising money in times of disaster than

does the private sector and has a comparative advantage in this sense. On the other hand, the

private insurance industry has had long-term experience in marketing coverage and paying

claims needs to be taken into account when evaluating alternative disaster insurance programs.



5. Summary and Conclusions

       This paper proposes that we examine the feasibility of including earthquake and water

damage as part of a global homeowners policy for dealing with the catastrophic risk problem

from natural disasters. By undertaking such an analysis one is forced to address the question as

to who should pay for disasters and how can we encourage individuals to undertake protective

measures in advance of the event.

       Two key principles underlying any disaster insurance program is that the rates reflect the

risk and that coverage is affordable. For lower income individuals it will be impossible to satisfy

the first principle without some type of subsidy from the public sector. There are also a set of

questions as to whether the private sector has the ability to cover losses from catastrophic

disasters on their own or will need some type of public sector involvement.

       There are a set of related issues that have to be considered when developing any type of

disaster insurance program. These include the ability to assess the risk and the uncertainty of the

models, the appropriate role of regulation, balancing the concerns of the different stakeholders

concerned with this issue and the types of subsidies and back-up provision that can be offered by

the public sector. Finally we need a clear understanding of the political and social landscape as

well as how choices are actually made so as to develop a disaster insurance program as part of a

hazard management strategy that achieve its desired impacts. The challenges in this regard are

                                             32
quite different today than they were in the 20th century because of the magnitude of losses from

these disasters in the past few years.
