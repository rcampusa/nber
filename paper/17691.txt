Home bias is a perennial feature of international capital markets. We review various explanations

incorporateinternational portfolio choices in standard two-country general equilibrium models. We
refer to thisnew literature as Open Economy Financial Macroeconomics. We focus on three broad
classes of explanations:(i) hedging motives in frictionless financial markets (real exchange rate and
non-tradable income risk),(ii) asset trade costs in international financial markets (such as transaction
costs or differences in taxtreatments between national and foreign assets), (iii) informational frictions
and behavioural biases.Recent theories call for new portfolio facts beyond equity home bias. We
present new evidence oncrossborder asset holdings across different types of assets: equities, bonds
and bank lending and newmicro data on institutional holdings of equity at the fund level. These data
should inform macroeconomicmodelling of the open economy and a growing literature of models
of delegated investment.

1      Introduction
Home bias is a perennial feature of international capital markets. Nineteenth century economists called it
‚Äúthe disinclination of capital to migrate‚Äù1 . Standard finance theory predicts that investors hold a diversified
portfolio of equities across the world if capital is fully mobile across borders. Because foreign equities provide
great diversification opportunities, a point made early on in Grubel (1968), Levy and Sarnat (1970)
and Solnik (1974), falling barriers to international trade in financial assets over the last thirty-years should
have led investors across the world to re-balance their portfolio away from national assets towards foreign
assets. The process of ‚Äòfinancial globalization‚Äô fostered by capital account liberalizations, electronic trading,
increasing exchanges of information across borders and falling transaction costs has certainly led to a large
increase in cross-border asset trade (Lane and Milesi-Feretti (2003)). However, investors seem still
reluctant to reap the full benefits of international diversification and hold a disproportionate share of local
equities, a phenomenon referred to as the ‚Äòhome bias in equities‚Äô. Since the seminal paper of French and
Poterba (1991), the home bias in equities has continuously intrigued and fascinated financial economists
and international macroeconomists. Despite better financial integration, the home bias has not decreased
sizably: in 2007, US investors still hold more than 80 percent of domestic equities, a much higher proportion
than the share of US equities in the world market portfolio. Indeed, home bias in equities is still observed
in most countries and tends to be higher in emerging markets.

     Many explanations have been put forward in the literature to explain this very robust portfolio fact. We
do not intend to provide a definite answer nor choose among alternative explanations, as they probably all
contribute to part of the gap. Our goal is to review where theory has led us, provide relevant empirical facts
and take a stand at what might be the next challenges ahead. We distinguish between three broad classes
of explanations : (i) hedging motives in frictionless financial markets (real exchange rate and non-tradable
income risk), (ii) asset trade costs in international financial markets (such as transaction costs, differences
in tax treatments between national and foreign assets or differences in legal frameworks) and (iii) infor-
mational frictions and behavioural biases. We will review these explanations highlighting important recent
developments in macroeconomic modelling of the open economy, referred to as Open Economy Financial
Macroeconomics. We will also discuss asymmetric information models, including the recent literature with
endogenous information acquisition.

     We put some emphasis on recent developments in the macroeconomics literature, which has embedded
non-trivial portfolio choices in standard two country general equilibrium macro models. Explaining equity
home bias has been one of the main motivations for this literature, which has first focused on models with
equities only. But the importance of considering portfolio choices across a broader class of assets (bonds,
corporate debt, equity...) is now widely recognized. We develop a standard two country/two good DSGE
model with endogenous portfolio choice and allow for equity trade in first instance, as in the early literature,
    1 Reported   in Flandreau (2006).

and then generalize the set up to accommodate trade in bonds and equity. This allows us both to present
recent methodological developments to fully characterize portfolios in this class of models and to show the
limitations of the early literature. These new models also call for new portfolio facts. Accordingly, we present
some new evidence on international holdings across different types of assets: equities, bonds and banking
assets. We focus on portfolio investment and abstract from Foreign Direct Investment, as its determinants
may be of a different nature and are studied extensively in the trade literature. Finally, we present some new
micro data on institutional holdings of equity at the fund level. These data should inform macroeconomic
modelling of the open economy as well as models of delegated investment, which belong to a fast-growing
literature: a large share of international investment is intermediated.

    In section 2, we present the standard definition of home equity bias and some recent measures across
countries and across time. In section 3, we focus on the recent methodological developments in the macro-
economics literature. In section 4, we focus on the role of hedging motives as a source of equity home bias.
We use standard dynamic models of the Open Economy Financial Macroeconomics literature. In section 5,
we present the literature on trade costs in financial markets (transaction costs, international taxation, legal
frameworks). In section 6, we review the finance literature on information asymmetries and behavioural bi-
ases. In section 7, in line with recent theoretical work, we present some new evidence on aggregate portfolio
holdings across a wider range of assets. We also present new portfolio facts at the fund level and discuss
leads for future research. Section 8 concludes.


2     The Equity Home Bias : Definition and Measure
2.1     Definition

French and Poterba (1991) were the first to our knowledge to document domestic ownership shares
across countries. Using data for the US, Japan, UK, France and Germany, they show that investors hold a
disproportionate share of domestic assets in their equity portfolios. In 1989, 92% of the US stock market was
held by US residents. Analogous numbers for Japan, UK, France and Germany are respectively 96%, 92%,
89% and 79%. They label this lack of cross border diversification the equity home bias.2 This is a well-known
puzzle in international finance: in a world with frictionless financial markets, the most basic International
CAPM model with homogenous investors across the world would predict that the representative investor of
a given country should hold the world market portfolio. In other words, the share of his financial wealth
invested in local equities should be equal to the share of local equities in the world market portfolio, a
prediction that contradicts the most casual observation of the data on portfolio holdings. As a result, the
measure of equity home bias (EHB) that is most commonly used is the difference between actual holdings
of domestic equity and the share of domestic equity in the world market portfolio:3
   2 Bohn and Tesar (1996) estimate the share of foreign equities in the U.S. portfolio to be still very low in 1995, equal to

8 percent. Ahearne et al. (2004) estimate it to be slightly above 10% in 2000.
   3 See for instance Ahearne et al. (2004). Another commonly used measure in finance is a deviation from a benchmark

mean-variance portfolio. Benchmark portfolio weights are calculated from a mean variance optimisation problem with sample


                                                              2
                                      Share of Foreign Equities in Country i Equity Holdings
                      EHBi = 1 ‚àí                                                                                            (1)
                                      Share of Foreign Equities in the World Market Portfolio
    When the home bias measure for country i EHBi is equal to one, there is full equity home bias; when it
is equal to zero, the portfolio is optimally diversified according to the basic International CAPM.



2.2     Evidence across time and across countries

While one could argue that, at the end of the eighties, international capital markets were far from being
frictionless and this could contribute to rationalize home bias, this line of explanation seems more doubtful
today. Despite increased financial integration, the equity home bias remains a pervasive phenomenon across
countries and across time (classic surveys include Lewis (1999) and Karolyi and Stulz (2003). See
also Sercu and Vanpee (2008) for recent evidence). In figure (1), we show the evolution of home bias
measures in developed countries across regions of the world:4 it has decreased over the last twenty years
with the process of ‚Äòfinancial globalization‚Äô but remains high in most countries (see also table (1) for a recent
snapshot of home bias measures for selected countries). On average, the degree of home bias across the world
is 0.63 (lower in Europe where monetary union after 1999 seem to have had an effect).5 For the developed
world, this means that the share of foreign equities in investors portfolios is roughly a 1/3 of what it should
be if the benchmark is the basic International CAPM. In figure (2), we construct a similar indicator for
emerging markets. Emerging markets have a less diversified equity portfolios than developed countries and
do not exhibit any clear downward trend in home bias. The average degree of home bias in these countries
is 0.9 (smaller in emerging Asia and larger in Latin America) and investors in these countries hold 1/10 of
the amount of foreign equities they should be holding according to the basic International CAPM model.


    This robust stylized fact has received considerable attention from both the finance literature and the
macroeconomics literature. The main difference between these two sets of literature relies on some modelling
assumptions. To simplify, the traditional finance literature has tried to rationalize the equity home bias in
multi-country models of portfolio choice where asset prices and their second moments are given (in particular
in these models the risk-free interest rate is exogenously given). The macro literature has tried to integrate
international portfolio decisions in otherwise standard Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE)
models of the international economy. These models have a fully general equilibrium structure and asset
prices and their second moments are endogenously determined.6 The motivation is however the same:
estimates of the means and variance-covaraince matrix of returns. The main issue in the existing literature adopting the finance
approach are how to measure returns and covariance matrices. Papers differ in the extent to which they use real or nominal
returns, how they estimate expected returns and how they deal with structural breaks and nonstationarity. As a result, there
is a degree of heterogeneity in the estimates of expected returns and second moments.

cross-border equity diversification.
    6 The dichotomy, which historically seems relevant, appears increasingly artificial as more papers bridge the two strands of

literature.

3       Open Economy Financial Macroeconomics
The theoretical macroeconomic literature points towards potential gains from international diversification
to hedge national production risk. In the presence of imperfectly correlated productivity shocks or output
shocks across countries, owning foreign equity could help to smooth consumption. This is most obvious in
the context of a two country model with one single tradable good, as e.g. in Lucas (1982): in such a world,
domestic and foreign investors hold an identical portfolio of claims to output (equities), the market portfolio,
thus diversifying optimally national output risks. As in the textbook finance portfolio theory, in such a
world the home bias in equities is seen as a failure of the standard diversification motive. However, one
should be cautious: investors across the world would hold the same portfolio, only if they were homogeneous.
In reality, heterogeneity across investors from different countries leads to departure from the world market
portfolio and potentially a bias towards national assets. Various sources of heterogeneity leading to equity
home bias have been explored in the macro literature. They fall in two broad classes of explanations : (i)
hedging motives (real exchange rate risk and non-tradable income risk), (ii) asset trade costs in international
financial markets (such as transaction costs, differences in tax treatments, in legal framework and other
policy induced barriers to foreign investment).
   7 The finance literature tends to focus on the diversification gains looking at asset price data and to evaluate how an increase

in the share of foreign equities would improve the portfolio performance based on some criteria. The macro-finance literature
tends to use consumption data to measure the potential welfare gains from international risk-sharing. See section (6) for a
discussion.




                                                                        5
   We will review in details these two explanations in sections (4) and (5). We now present how recent
methodological developments in Open Economy Financial Macroeconomics allow us to solve for (non-
trivial) portfolio decisions in DSGE models.


3.1    Methodological Breakthrough

Until recently, most macroeconomic models of the international economy relied mostly on the following asset
structures: either one non-contingent bond traded internationally or complete asset markets through Arrow-
Debreu securities. None of these models could say anything about gross foreign asset holdings and the extent
to which tradable assets could be used to share risks internationally. Recent methodological advances have
allowed a much richer structure of asset trade to be examined.
   Building on perturbation methods (see Judd (1998)), Devereux and Sutherland (2008a) develop
a solution method that allows standard linear solution techniques for macroeconomic models to be adapted
to solve for models with portfolio choice. Standard linear solution techniques cannot directly be applied
since these methods rely on a first-order approximation around a deterministic steady state: to a first order
approximation, assets are perfect substitutes, as they deliver the same expected return, so portfolio choice
is not pinned down. Devereux and Sutherland‚Äôs work relies on several insights. Firstly, building on earlier
work by Judd and Guu (2001) and Samuelson (1970), they show that the steady state portfolio can
be derived as the portfolio in a noisy environment and letting the noise go to zero. Secondly, they show
that in order for the steady state portfolio to be well defined, a second order approximation of the portfolio
equations (Euler equations) needs to be considered, while only the first order dynamics of the other equations
of the model are required to pin down steady state portfolios (also called zero order portfolio). Finally, the
authors show that the first order dynamics of the model only depends on the steady-state portfolio. In
addition to these conceptual insights, Devereux and Sutherland (2008a) also provides a formula which
can be used to compute portfolios analytically in a fairly general class of models. In a companion paper,
Devereux and Sutherland (2010), the authors show that in order to solve for the first order dynamics
of the portfolio, a second order approximation of the non portfolio equations of the model is needed, while
the portfolio equations need to be approximated to the third order. Portfolio changes (around the steady
state portfolios) are driven by changes in second moments (third-order terms) which determine changes in
expected returns across assets. It is then also true that the second order dynamics of the model depends
on the first order dynamics of portfolios. The authors show that approximate portfolios can be computed
analytically in many cases.
   In simultaneous work, Tille and van Wincoop (2008) develop a solution technique that is analogous
to the one presented in Devereux and Sutherland (2008a). The main difference is that Tille and van
Wincoop (2008) rely on numerical iterations to solve for portfolios. This requires more computational
effort, but also implies that their solution method can be applied to a wider class of models. To compute
steady state portfolios, they linearize non-portfolio equations up to the first-order for a given portfolio. They



                                                       6
then solve for the endogenous portfolio as a fixed-point in a second-order approximation of the portfolio
(Euler) equations. As in Devereux and Sutherland (2010), they show how going one order further in
the approximation allows to investigate portfolio dynamics. They apply their method to a two country/two
good model with one stock in each country and show how portfolio dynamics relates to the time variation
of expected returns and second moments. In particular, they investigate the predicted capital outflows and
inflows, relate them to portfolio growth and portfolio reallocation8 and assess the performance of the model
looking at balance of payments statistics on capital flows. Other recent work that tackles the challenge of
solving for portfolio choice are Evans and Hnatkovska (2006a and 2008) and Judd et al. (2002). The
methods developed in Evans and Hnatkovska (2008) and Judd et al. (2002) can be applied to very general
classes of models, but are quite complex and present significant departures from standard DSGE solution
methods.


3.2       Shortcomings and extensions

The main advantage of the perturbation methods developed by Devereux and Sutherland (2008a) and
Tille and van Wincoop (2008) are: (1) they are very easy to implement as they are close to standard
approximation methods used in DSGE models; (2) they can be applied to broad range of environments
(complete and incomplete markets models, potentially large number of shocks and/or securities) (3) they
provide (approximate) closed-form expressions for portfolios in many cases. These methods face however
some limitations as they rely on local approximations around the deterministic steady-state: as any local
methods, they are valid around the point of approximation, which is problematic when there are large
deviations away from this point. This can arise for instance in presence of large shocks (such as disaster
risks, see e.g. in Barro (2006)) or when the problem is non-stationary. For example, in incomplete
markets models, the distribution of wealth across countries may have a unit-root and therefore the solution
may wander away from the approximation point. Since the methods are mainly based on first and second
order approximations, they may also be inaccurate in models that exhibit strong non-linearities, such as
models with borrowing constraints. Lastly, the approximation of the decision rules in these methods is made
around the deterministic steady-state. However, the deterministic steady-state might not be the stationary
steady-state of the model in presence of risk. Coeurdacier, Rey and Winant (2010) uses perturbation
methods around the ‚Äúrisky steady-state‚Äù, defined as the point where agents choose to stay at a given date
if the realization of shocks is 0 at this date but if they expect future risk.9 The welfare implications for
risk-sharing can be quite different from the standard ones around the risky steady state since uncertainty
directly affects steady-state variables. While still local, such a method should be more accurate when decision
rules in presence of risk are significantly different from the ones obtained when risk goes towards zero (as in
Devereux and Sutherland (2008a)). The question of accuracy of these solution methods is not easily
  8 seealso Kraay and Ventura (2000,2003) for a similar terminology.
  9 For early work on the risky steady state see Juillard and Kamenik (2005). For another application of the risky steady state
concept in a different context see Gertler, Kyiotaki and Queralto (2011).




                                                              7
tackled however as for most models for which they are implemented, one cannot provide exact numerical
methods. Exceptions of two-country/two goods models where solutions can be found without approximations
are models with log-linear preferences as in Pavlova and Rigobon (2007, 2010a,b).10

    Ultimately, one should expect the development of ‚Äúglobal methods‚Äù to emerge in order to solve portfolio
choice models with multiple agents, multiple goods and multiple securities. Developing global methods would
be useful as they would potentially be adequate in environments where standard perturbation methods fail
and they could also provide insights on the accuracy of perturbation methods. Recent work in that direction
includes Dumas and Lyasoff (2010) in finite-horizons models and Chien, Cole and Lustig (2011) in
a one-good closed economy model with multiple agents. Extending these methods to standard international
macro models is a next important step.

    Despite their limitations, perturbation methods constitute a major improvement which makes it possible
to incorporate non-trivial portfolio choice in models of the open macroeconomy. These methodological
improvements have given a new life to the literature investigating the origins of portfolio biases. A first
generation of models of Open Financial Macroeconomics has looked at the hedging of real exchange rate
risk and non-tradable income risk as a source of portfolio biases in models with equities only. A second
generation of models has emphasized the importance of describing portfolios with a richer menu of assets
and has developed models with multiple asset classes (bonds and equities). We review these two strands of
literature sequentially in the next section.


4     Hedging motives in Open Economy Financial Macroeconomics
Hedging motives lead to departure from the benchmark model of Lucas (1982) where homogeneous investors
across the world hold identical portfolios. By hedging, we mean choosing financial claims that help insulate
investors from sources of risk affecting their income streams. The sources of risk developed in the literature
are the following:
    - Real exchange rate risk: the prices of investors‚Äô consumption goods fluctuate and this affects the
purchasing power of their income.
    - Non-tradable income risk: investors receive a part of their income (wages in particular) that cannot be
traded in financial markets.11
    In other words, because investors in different countries have different exposure to real exchange rate risk
and/or to non-tradable income risk, they will hold different equity portfolios in equilibrium. It is important
to understand that in these cases, equity portfolio ‚Äùbiases‚Äù are neither inefficient nor the consequence of some
frictions in financial markets. The hedging of domestic sources of risks leads to different optimal portfolios
across borders but perfect (or almost perfect) risk-sharing is preserved.
  10 See also Devereux and Saito (2005). As Pavlova and Rigobon (2007, 2010ab), Devereux and Saito (2005) use

a continuous time framework which allows some analytical solutions to be derived, but it can only be applied to a restricted
class of models.
  11 The presence of government spending shocks can also generate a source of non-tradable income risk due to tax changes.




                                                             8
   In order to analyze how these hedging motives affect equity portfolios, we present a benchmark two-
country/two good model where the only traded assets are equities of both countries. We show how log-
linearization techniques can be used to derive (zero-order) steady-state portfolios. We also revisit some of
the results of the literature regarding the hedging of real exchange rate risk and non-tradable income risk
in an equity only model. In particular, we show the difficulties to rationalize the equity home bias in such a
framework. In section (4.2), we will show how a multiple asset class model provides an answer to most of
these difficulties.

4.1.1    Set-up and First Order Conditions

There are two symmetric countries, Home (H) and Foreign (F ), each with a representative household.
Country i = H, F produces one good using labor and capital. We assume that capital is fixed for now and
will allow for endogenous capital accumulation in the subsequent section (4.2). All markets are perfectly
competitive.

   The welfare based consumer price index that corresponds to these preferences is:

where pi,t is the price of good i.

  12 This ‚Äùconsumption home bias‚Äù is assumed exogenously. It has been extensively studied in the trade literature since the

classic paper of Mc Callum (1995).

   There is a (representative) firm in country i that hires local labor and produces output, using technology

the country i wage incomes are:

4.1.2   Zero-order equilibrium portfolios

                                                  i        i
Equilibrium portfolio holdings chosen at date t (Si,t+1 , Sj,t+1 ) are functions of state variables at date
t. Devereux and Sutherland (2008a) show how to compute Taylor expansion of the portfolio decision
rules, in the neighborhood of the deterministic steady state. In this Section, we provide closed form solutions
for ‚Äòzero-order portfolios‚Äô (denoted by variables without time subscripts) Sii , Sji , i.e. portfolio decision rules
evaluated at steady state values of state variables. These portfolios can be determined by linearizing the
model around its deterministic steady state. We show that the asset structure (two assets with two exogenous
shocks) is ‚Äúlocally-complete‚Äù in the sense that up to a first order linear approximation, the consumption
allocation is efficient (in other words there is perfect risk sharing up to a first-order approximation of the
model). The method we use to solve for portfolios is then slightly different from Devereux and Sutherland
(2008a) as it does not require a second-order expansion of the Euler equations (equation ((10)). We simply
derive the portfolio that replicates the efficient allocation up to a first-order approximation of the non-
portfolio equations. This method is simpler but less general than Devereux and Sutherland (2008a) as
theirs can also be applied in models with incomplete financial markets.

   Log-linearization of the model

   In what follows, zt ‚â°   zF,t   denotes the ratio of Home over Foreign variables; zt ‚â° (zt ‚àí z)/z denotes the
relative deviation of a variable zt from its steady state value z.
                                                                    PH,t
   The Home country‚Äôs CPI-based real exchange is RERt ‚â°             PF,t .   Linearizing this expression gives (using

                                                                                                              1
where qt ‚â° pH,t /pF,t denotes the country H terms of trade. Due to consumption home bias (a >                 2 ),   an
improvement of Home terms of trade generates an appreciation of the Home real exchange rate (without
home bias in consumption, the real exchange rate is constant).
   In an equilibrium with ‚Äúlocally-complete‚Äù markets, the ratio of Home and Foreign marginal utilities of
aggregate consumption is proportional to the consumption-based real exchange rate (Backus and Smith
(1993), Kollmann (1995)). Linearization of this risk sharing condition gives:

                                          ‚àíœÉ(CH,t ‚àí CF,t ) = (2a ‚àí 1) qt .                                      (14)

can show that when (14) holds, relative world consumption demand is given by yt = yH,t /yF,t ‚â° (cH

Home goods increases as Foreign goods are scarcer.

country‚Äôs holdings of local stock.
   We will show that there exists a unique portfolio S, which, for consumptions consistent with the linearized
risk sharing condition (14), satisfies the following ‚Äòstatic‚Äô budget constraint:

                              Pi,t Ci,t = wi,t li,t + Sdi,t + (1 ‚àí S)dj,t , for i = H, F.                     (16)

Up to the first order, country i‚Ä≤ s efficient consumption spending at date t equals date t wage income, wi,t li,t ,
plus the financial income generated by the equity portfolio S.14
   Subtracting the ‚Äòstatic‚Äô budget constraint of country F from that of country H and using the risk-sharing
condition (14) yields the following log-linearized ‚Äòstatic‚Äô budget constraint:

   This expression shows the changes in country H income (relative to the income of F ) necessary to finance
the changes in consumption consistent with efficient risk-sharing (up to first order).

   Partial equilibrium zero-order portfolios

   The ‚Äòstatic‚Äô budget constraint is useful to derive the equilibrium portfolio as a function of variance/covariance
ratios. Taking the covariance with dt in (17) gives the following portfolio (we implicitly assume that the
equity portfolio supports efficient risk-sharing up to a first-order, which is verified below):

                                                                               dt )

                           S=     ‚àí                          +                                                (18)

   This expression holds in many classes of models (with equity only) as we only need the budget constraints
and generic first order conditions to derive it. It is the departure of many empirical studies. The same
expression also holds in terms of returns instead of income flows.
 13 See  Coeurdacier (2009) and Coeurdacier, Kollmann, Martin (2007) for similar expressions.
 14 Kollmann     (2006b) and Coeurdacier, Kollmann and Martin (2010) shows that if this ‚Äòstatic‚Äô budget constraint
holds, then the present value budget constraint of country i is likewise satisfied, up to a first order.

   The portfolio departs from the fully diversified one with weights 1/2 in both equities (as in Lucas (1982))
in presence of labor income risk and/or real exchange rate risk. It indicates that investors would favor local
equity if:

                                                                                              
                                                                                          cov(w      
                                                                                               t lt ,dt )
   (i) Relative dividends covary negatively with (relative) labor income (term                            ).   This term is
                                                                                            var(dt )
referred as the hedging of non-tradable income risk.
   As labor income accounts for more than 2/3 of total income, this term might lead to potentially large
                                                                1‚àíŒ±
portfolio biases, the covariance term being multiplied by        Œ± .   Households cannot trade financial claims on
their labor incomes and will use existing financial assets to hedge this non-tradable income risk. Intuitively,
households want to insure themselves against a fall in their labor incomes and in the returns to their human
wealth by holding financial assets that pay more in these bad states. If local equities have higher returns
(than abroad) when local returns to non-tradable wealth are lower (than abroad), households will bias their
portfolio towards local equities.

                                                                                                          dt )
                                                                                                     cov(RER,
   (ii) Relative dividends covary positively with the real exchange rate if œÉ > 1 (term                 var(dt )
                                                                                                                  ).   This
term is referred as the hedging of real exchange rate risk.
   The optimal hedging of real exchange rate risk depends on two forces going in opposite direction: when
local goods are more expensive, consumers need to generate more income in order to stabilize their purchasing
power. On the other hand, since local goods are more expensive, households could be better off consuming
when goods are cheaper. The dominating effect depends on how much households want to smooth their
consumption across states. For consumers sufficiently risk-averse (œÉ > 1), the former effect dominates and
households want to increase their income when their consumption goods are more expensive. Thus, they build
their portfolio by choosing assets with a high pay-off when local goods are expensive. For the log-investor
(œÉ = 1), the two effects cancel out and the hedging term disappears.

   General equilibrium zero-order portfolios

   Note that equation (18) is a partial equilibrium expression. In general equilibrium macro models, the
above variance/covariance terms can be expressed as a function of the underlying parameters of the model.
Since labor income and dividends are a constant share of output ((6) and (7)), relative labor income (wt lt )
and dividends (dt ) are equal and given by: wt lt = dt = qt + yt .
   Substituting into (17) and using (15) gives:

                    1
             (1 ‚àí     ) (2a ‚àí 1) qt = {(1 ‚àí Œ±) + Œ± (2S ‚àí 1)} (qt + yt ) = {(1 ‚àí Œ±) + Œ± (2S ‚àí 1)} (1 ‚àí Œª)qt             (19)
                    œÉ

The asset structure supports full risk sharing, up to first-order, if (19) holds for all realizations of the (relative)
exogenous productivity shocks (Œ∏t ) (or equivalently all realizations of the terms-of-trade qt ). The following




                                                           13
portfolio S ensures that (19) holds for arbitrary realizations of qt :

                                            1 1 (1 ‚àí Œ±) 1    1 (2a ‚àí 1)

   The equilibrium portfolio is the sum of three terms:
                        1
  (i) The first term    2   is a pure diversification term. It would prevail if there were no hedging motives as in
      Lucas (1982). In the absence of heterogeneity across investors, there is full diversification of national
      output risk. We derive the Lucas portfolio when Œ± ‚Üí 1 (no human capital risk) and when a = 1/2 (no
      real exchange rate risk).

 (ii) The second term ‚àí 21 (1‚àíŒ±)
                             Œ±   is the hedging of non-tradable income risk (as in Baxter and Jermann
      (1997)): changes in output driven by productivity shocks are shared in constant proportion (Cobb-
      Douglas production). This leads to a perfect correlation between labor incomes and capital incomes:
      households should short the local stock to hedge human capital risk. Note that in the present model,
      the portfolio is exactly the one of Baxter and Jermann (1997) in the absence of real exchange rate
      risk (a = 1/2).
                                    (2a‚àí1)
(iii) The third term ‚àí 21 (1 ‚àí œÉ1 ) Œ±(Œª‚àí1) is the hedging of real exchange rate risk. This term is the same as
      the one derived in Coeurdacier (2009) and Kollmann (2006b) in the absence of human capital
      risk (Œ± ‚Üí 1). This term cancels out for a log-investor (œÉ = 1). As explained above (see equation
      (18)), investors bias their portfolio towards equities that have high returns when local goods are more
      expensive (if œÉ > 1). The appropriate portfolio depends on the value of Œª i.e on the elasticity of
      substitution œÜ. Three different cases emerge:

       (a) Œª > 1 (i.e. an elasticity of substitution œÜ roughly above unity): the hedging of real exchange rate
           risk generates a Foreign equity bias. The reason is the following: a (relative) fall in local output
           driven by a bad productivity shock triggers a moderate increase in the Home terms-of-trade, a
           moderate appreciation of the Home real exchange rate together with a decrease in Home equity
           returns: Foreign equities are more valuable since they have higher (relative) returns despite the
           Home real exchange rate appreciation.
      (b) Œª < 1 (i.e. elasticity of substitution œÜ, roughly below unity): a (relative) fall in local output
           triggers a stronger improvement of the Home terms-of-trade and a stronger appreciation of the
           Home real exchange rate. As the relative price response is stronger, Home equity excess returns
           increase. Home investors exhibit Home equity bias as Home equity have higher returns when the
           Home real exchange rate appreciates. This is the case emphasized by Kollmann (2006b).

       (c) Œª = 1:       Any increase in local output is perfectly offset by a fall in the terms-of-trade. Both
           equities are perfect substitutes and there is portfolio indeterminacy. This is an extension of Cole
           and Obstfeld (1991)‚Äôs result.

Hedging real exchange rate risk

   As appears clearly in the previous model, optimal portfolios are structured to hedge the risk arising from
real exchange rate fluctuations. This is at the heart of the potential divergence of portfolios across investors
in the partial equilibrium portfolio choice models with real exchange rate risk. The key issue is whether
local equities are a good hedge against relative price (real exchange rate) fluctuations, i.e. whether local
equities have higher returns when local goods are (relatively) more expensive. If this is the case, then local
investors should favor local equities. Early examples of this hypothesis are Solnik (1974), Adler and
Dumas (1983), Krugman (1981), de Macedo (1983), de Macedo et al. (1985) and Stulz (1981).
Cooper and Kaplanis (1994) start with the premise that for equity home bias to be rooted in a desire to
hedge against relative inflation, equity returns need to be positively correlated with inflation. They test for
such a correlation and reject it for all countries considered. These early papers take relative prices (and the
real exchange rate) and asset returns as given while in the present model and, more generally in the recent
Open Economy Financial Macroeconomics, the dynamics of goods prices and asset returns is endogenous,
as is the covariance between the two.

   In the more recent literature, some contributions focus on the hedging of the relative price of tradables
(terms-of-trade, as in the present model) and some focus on the hedging of the relative price of non-tradable
goods.    In their influential contribution, Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) argue that trade costs in goods
markets help to solve the equity home bias puzzle. The above model (in line with Coeurdacier (2009))15
shows the opposite result for most parameter values (in particular for œÜ and œÉ above unity). Indeed, in
Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000), the coefficient of risk aversion is below unity (and equal to the inverse of
the elasticity of substitution between the two goods), which allows to solve the model in closed-form. With
such preferences, agents prefer to hold local equities which pay less when local consumption is expensive. A
similar point is made by Uppal (1993) in a two country/one good model in continuous time with trade
costs: he shows that home bias only arises for the coefficient of relative risk aversion smaller than one. One
can potentially restore the argument of Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) in the present model if œÉ is above 1
but the elasticity of substitution between goods œÜ is below unity. In that case, a fall in Home supply triggers
a very large increase in the Home terms-of-trade such that Home equity returns are high when prices of Home
goods are high. Hence, investors would rather hold local equities (see Kollmann (2006b)). In this class of
models, equity home bias relies on the response of relative prices, i.e. on the elasticity of substitution between
local and foreign products. While time series macro data estimating the response of trade to exchange rate
changes suggests a low elasticity of substitution, between 0.5 and 1.5 (see Hooper and Marques (1995),
Backus, Kehoe and Kydland (1994) and Heathcote and Perri (2002)), bilateral sectoral trade data
suggests a large elasticity, -above 5 for most sectors (see Harrigan (1993), Hummels (2001) and Baier
 15 The model presented features home bias in preferences instead of trade costs. A functional transformation of trade costs
would however make the two types of models isomorphic.

and Bergstrand (2001) among others)-.16 The parameter uncertainty makes it hard to get a conclusive
answer from this class of models. It is also important to note that output fluctuations in all these classes
of models are driven by supply shocks. In the presence of demand shocks, equilibrium portfolios could turn
out to be different: when local demand is high, both prices of local goods and payoffs of local firms increase.
Hence, demand shocks can generate positive co-movements between local equity returns and the price of
local goods (see Pavlova and Rigobon (2007)). In order to be able to consume when demand is high,
local investors would prefer local equities.

    Similarly, the presence of nontradable consumption exposes domestic agents to real exchange rate risk
(driven by fluctuations in the relative price of non-tradable goods). Stockman and Dellas (1989) develops
a two country model with endowment economies. Each country has random endowments of a (single) traded
good and a nontraded good. There is trade in equities of tradable and nontradable goods firm. With utility
separable in tradable and nontradable consumption, optimal portfolios imply that domestic agents hold all of
the equity of domestic nontradable firms. By holding all of the equity of nontraded goods, domestic agents
hold an asset whose return is perfectly correlated with their expenditure on nontraded goods. Domestic
agents hold the same share of Home and Foreign equity of tradable firms, implying perfect diversification
in the tradable sector as in Lucas (1982). Thus, this model generates home bias in equity positions,
and the home bias increases in the share of nontradable consumption in total output. Various papers have
extended this framework to more general preferences, investigating in particular the non-separability between
tradable and non-tradable consumption together with multiple tradable goods (see Baxter et al (1998),
Serrat (2001),17 Obstfeld (2007), Matsumoto (2007), Collard et al. (2007)).18 In these papers,
the presence of nontradable consumption interacts with tradable consumption and some degree of home
bias in nontradable equities obtains. The precise structure of portfolios is strongly dependent on preference
parameters, in particular the substitution elasticities between tradable and nontradable goods (and also
between domestic and foreign tradable goods). The mechanism at the heart of the home bias towards non-
tradable equity is however essentially similar to the one described in the previous model: investors want
to hold equities whose payoff is high when the real exchange rate appreciates, i.e when the consumption of
non-tradable goods is expensive. It turns out that for a sufficiently low elasticity of substitution between
tradable and nontradable goods (roughly below unity as found in the empirical literature),19 a fall in local
non-tradable output implies a strong increase in the relative price of non-tradable goods together with an
  16 Imbs and Mejean (2009) claims that the discrepancy between macro and micro estimates comes from an aggregation

bias; correcting for this bias, they find an elasticity of up to 7.
  17 See also Kollmann (2006a) for a comment.
  18 In earlier work, Eldor et al. (1988) in a general equilibrium model studies n countries, each producing a nontradable

good and the single tradable good that is consumed in all countries. The assets traded are ‚Äùreal equities‚Äù for the tradable
and nontradable good. Tradable equities pay one unit of the traded good in each state of the world, while nontradable equity
pays out Œ∏ units of the nontradable good, where Œ∏ is state contingent nontradable output. They point out that for home bias
to arise the returns of nontraded equities have to be positively correlated with the price of the nontradable good and derive
conditions for the risk aversion parameter, the price elasticity of demand for tradable goods and the income elasticity of demand
for tradable goods such that it would be the case.
  19 Typical values used for the elasticity of substitution between tradable and non-tradable goods are: 0.44 (Stockman and

Tesar (1995)), 0.74 (Mendoza (1995)), from 0.6 to 0.8 (Serrat (2001)). Ostry and Reinhart (1992) provides estimates
for developing countries in the range of 0.6 to 1.4. See Matsumoto (2007) for a more detailed discussion.


                                                               16
increase in local non-tradable equity returns: hence, local non-tradable equity returns comove positively with
the price of non-tradable goods (and the real exchange rate), leading to local equity bias in that sector.
   On the empirical front, Pesenti and van Wincoop (2002) derive an expression that relates home
bias to the correlation between equity returns and nontradable consumption growth20 and using data on 14
OECD countries from 1970 to 1993, they find that, on average, nontradable consumption growth is positively
correlated with the return on domestic capital. This would imply that home bias would arise if tradables
and nontradable goods are complementary. The authors find, however, that even in those cases, hedging
nontradable consumption could at best explain a relatively small fraction of the home bias observed in the
data. Overall, there are two empirical difficulties with an explanation of the equity home bias relying on
the presence of a non-tradable sector. The first one is that the structure of portfolios is strongly dependent
on preference parameters, which are not easy to estimate. The second one is that the home bias result
relies on the ability of investors to hold separate claims on tradable and non-tradable output: as most
products contain both tradable and non-tradable components, shares of firms automatically involve joint
claims on tradables and non-tradables. This difficulty is made all the more relevant by the fact that, when
agents are allowed to trade separate claims on tradable and non-tradable output, optimal equity positions
are very different across the two sectors. This different structure of portfolios across traded and non-traded
sectors seems ‚Äúinconsistent with casual empiricism‚Äù as argued by Lewis (1999). More broadly, empirical
analysis of this channel is also hindered by the difficulty to identify precisely nontradable consumption and
tradable/nontradable equity.
   There is yet another major empirical issue faced by this explanation of home bias. The hedging of real
exchange rate risk leads to equity home bias if local equities have higher returns (than abroad) when local
prices are higher (than abroad). In other words, equity home bias appears if excess local equity returns
                                                                               cov(
                                                                                   RER,dt )
(over foreign) increase when the real exchange rate appreciates (the term         var(dt )
                                                                                               in equation (18)). As
shown by van Wincoop and Warnock (2008), the empirical correlation between excess equity returns
and the real exchange rate is very low, too low to explain observed equity home bias. Furthermore, most of
the fluctuations in the real exchange rate represent fluctuations in the nominal exchange rate: as explained
in section (4.2), these could be hedged using positions in the forward currency market or the currency bond
market. In other words, equities do not seem empirically to be an appropriate asset to insure investors
against real exchange rate fluctuations. Hence, while these models are theoretically appealing, it is doubtful
that the hedging of real exchange rate risk can account empirically for the equity home bias.

   Hedging non-tradable income risk

   In our model (see equation (18)), hedging non-tradable income risk implies picking stocks which have
higher payoffs when labour income is low. The focus of the literature has been twofold: first, from a
theoretical perspective, it has discussed the conditions under which standard macroeconomic models imply
a negative or positive correlation between local equity returns and returns to non-tradable wealth. Second,
 20 Their   model also includes leisure which drives another hedging motive.


                                                              17
from an empirical perspective, a series of papers have provided estimates of the covariance between relative
equity returns and relative returns to human wealth which is the key empirical counterpart of portfolio biases
in this class of models.

   The most influential contribution on these matters is Baxter and Jermann (1997), who argue that the
presence of non-tradable income risk worsens the equity home bias puzzle. Their argument goes as follows:
in a standard multi-country real business cycle model with a single tradable good and a Cobb-Douglas
production function, changes in output are shared in constant proportion between capital and labor. Hence,
labor and capital incomes are perfectly correlated. As investors are already strongly exposed to domestic risk
due to their labor income, they should not hold local capital. Due to the relatively large labour share in all
countries, the effects of hedging domestic human capital dominates the benefits of diversification: investors
should short-sell local equities (term ‚àí 12 1‚àíŒ±
                                             Œ± in equation (20)). Hence, the equity home bias puzzle is worse

than we think! The authors estimate a vector error correction model that allows the correlation between
labour and capital returns to vary over time and be imperfect, while maintaining the assumption that the
ratio of labour to capital income is stationary. Using data from the OECD National Accounts (1994) for
Japan, UK, Germany, and US for 1960-1993, they find that within countries, labour and capital returns
are highly correlated, while the correlation between domestic labour returns and foreign equity returns is
quite low. Using the observed correlations, the authors then construct diversified portfolios and find that
the optimal position in domestic equity is negative in all the countries considered.
   Their empirical findings have been challenged by a series of papers : Bottazzi et al (1996) use a
continuous time VAR model of portfolio choice and data on a large set of OECD countries and find that
returns to domestic capital and human capital are negatively correlated for most countries but the US and
this can explain a fraction of equity home bias in these countries. Julliard (2002) argues that the Baxter
and Jermann (1997)‚Äôs empirical findings are due to an econometric misspecification : the correlation
between returns to human capital and local equity returns is overstated because they implicitly assume
that innovations to capital and labor incomes are independent across countries. Once the misspecification
is corrected, considering human capital risk does not unequivocally worsen the home bias puzzle. Using
micro-level data, Massa and Simonov (2006) show that non-financial income is uncorrelated with the
market portfolio of financial assets, but actual investors‚Äô portfolios (which differ from the market portfolio)
are more positively correlated with non-financial income than the market portfolio is. Thus, the authors cast
doubt on the rationality of investors and on their desire to hedge non-tradable income risk.

   From a theoretical perspective, Heathcote and Perri (2008) shows that Baxter and Jermann
(1997)‚Äôs result relies on very strong assumptions: one single and perfectly tradable good and a fixed capital
stock. Relaxing those assumptions (in a two-country/two-good international real business cycle model aÃÄ la
Backus, Kehoe and Kydland (1994)) and introducing differentiated product across countries together
with consumption/investment home bias changes drastically the picture and helps solve the equity home bias
puzzle. Their result relies on two key elements: endogenous capital accumulation and a strong adjustment

                                                      18
of relative prices.21 The main intuition is the following. Suppose a positive (persistent) productivity shock
hits the Home economy. This leads to:
    (i) a fall in the relative price of Home goods (Foreign goods are scarcer).
    (ii) an increase in Home investment (more than abroad) as Home investment uses more intensively cheaper
Home goods (due to home bias in investment spending).
    (iii) an increase in Home wages (more than abroad) and in the Home returns to non-tradable wealth.
    (iv) a decrease in the returns on Home capital (relative to Foreign) if the (relative) price response of
Home goods is strong enough.
    The main difference with Baxter and Jermann (1997) is the last point (iv): if the market price of
Home goods falls sufficiently and Home investment is increasing, dividends distributed by Home firms (which
are net of investment) are lower than abroad, and so are Home returns to capital. Hence the model generates
negative co-movements between Home (excess) returns to human wealth and Home (excess) returns to capital:
hedging non-tradable income risk implies home equity bias. Home bias in investment/consumption spending
is important as it triggers a stronger response of investment at Home, thus a larger fall of Home dividends
and a larger increase of Home wages. Importantly, the model generates a positive link between consumption
home bias and equity home bias as found in the data.22 Note that Heathcote and Perri (2008) focus
on log-utility and unitary elasticity of substitution between Home and Foreign goods. Increasing the level
of risk aversion introduces a real exchange rate risk motive as in Coeurdacier (2009) and Kollmann
(2006b). Increasing the elasticity of substitution reduces the response of relative prices and makes the
portfolio converge towards the one of Baxter and Jermann (1997).


4.2     Hedging motives in a benchmark model with multiple asset classes (bonds
        and equities)
4.2.1    Hedging with bond and equities: the role of ‚Äùconditional risk‚Äù

The first generation of papers presented above focus on equity positions to rationalize home bias. However,
equities are only part of financial assets traded internationally. Debt securities (nominal bonds in different
currencies, corporate bonds, bank deposits,...) are instruments that can also be used to share risks inter-
nationally (see section (7)). They should not be excluded from our models, first for realism, since they
constitute a large share of international asset flows but above all because there might be substitution across
asset classes. Hence, equity positions derived in equity only models might be sensitive to the presence of
other financial assets. Recent models with portfolio decisions have incorporated multiple assets (equities and
bonds) to have more robust and realistic predictions.23 Nominal bond returns differentials across countries
   21 Endogenous capital accumulation is crucial: despite multiple goods, Baxter and Jermann (1997)‚Äôs results would survive

if capital is fixed.
   22 Lane (2000), Aizenman and Noy (2004), Heathcote and Perri (2008) among others show a positive relationship

between trade openness and foreign equity holdings looking at a cross section of countries. Portes and Rey (2005), Aviat
and Coeurdacier (2007) and Lane and Milesi-Feretti (2008) show that country equity portfolios are strongly biased
towards trading partners.
   23 As described in section (4.2.5), recent contributions with multiple asset classes include Engel and Matsumoto (2008a,b),

Coeurdacier, Kollmann and Martin (2007 and 2010), Coeurdacier and Gourinchas (2010), Berriel and Bhattarai


                                                             19
are (almost) perfectly correlated with the real exchange rate (in developed countries, fluctuations in the nom-
inal exchange rate account for most of the fluctuations in the real exchange rate). Hence, bonds are better
suited than equities to hedge real exchange rate risk. But this is not the end of the story. The presence of
bonds also affects the hedging properties of equities for non-tradable income risk. Equities are used to hedge
sources of risks that cannot be hedged through the bond positions, in particular the part of non-tradable
income risk that is orthogonal to bond returns. In this new literature, the optimal equity position depends
therefore on the correlation of returns on equity with returns on non-tradable income, conditional on bond
returns.

4.2.2      Set-up of the Model

We use a similar set up as in section (4.1) but we add two important ingredients to formalize our above
discussion on hedging motives: endogenous capital accumulation and trade in real bonds. They allow us to
overcome the limitations of the model presented in (4.1): first, endogenous investment in a two-good model
breaks the perfect link between returns on physical capital and returns on human capital; second, bond
trading modifies the hedging properties of equities. Bonds will be used to hedge fluctuations in the real
exchange rate. Equities will be used to hedge non-tradable income risk, conditionally on bond returns.
This model is similar Coeurdacier, Kollmann and Martin (2010) which extends Heathcote and Perri
(2008) to multiple asset classes (bonds and equities).

    In presence of productivity shocks only, we would face a portfolio indeterminacy in a first-order ap-
proximation of the non-portfolio equations since the number of available assets (bonds and equities in each
country) would exceed the exogenous sources of uncertainty. We have to add an additional source of uncer-
tainty. We choose to add shocks to the disutility of leisure for simplicity. As explained in Coeurdacier,
Kollmann and Martin (2010) and Coeurdacier and Gourinchas (2010), the nature of the additional
shock used to alleviate portfolio indeterminacy is irrelevant for the portfolio and results would survive with
other shocks commonly used (shocks to investment aÃÄ la Greenwood, Hercowitz and Huffman (1988),
depreciation shocks, shocks to capacity utilization...).24
    Hence, preferences are now defined by:
                                                                    1‚àíœÉ         1+œâ

    Technologies and capital accumulation

    As before, production in each country uses capital and labor with a Cobb-Douglas production function:

                                                                            Œ±

(2008), Devereux and Sutherland (2007 and 2008b).
  24 Obviously, a different shock will have different business cycles implications but we are presently not interested in those.




                                                                       20
The law of motion of the capital stock is:

where 0 < Œ¥ < 1 is the depreciation rate of capital. Ii,t is gross investment in country i at date t. In both
countries, gross investment is generated using Home and Foreign inputs:

where iij,t is the amount of good j used for investment in country i. We assume local bias for investment

same as for consumption Pi,t (see equation (4)).

    Firms‚Äô decisions

    A share 1 ‚àí Œ± of output at market prices is paid to workers as in equation (6). A share Œ± of country i
output, net of physical investment spending is paid as a dividend di,t to shareholders:

                                                          di,t = Œ±pi,t yi,t ‚àí Pi,t Ii,t                                    (25)

    The firm chose Ii,t to equate the expected future marginal gain of investment to the marginal cost. This
implies the following first-order condition:26

                                                                           Œ±‚àí1 1‚àíŒ±

The firm chooses the Home and Foreign investment inputs iii,t , iij,t that minimize the cost of generating Ii,t .
This leads to the following intratemporal allocation for investment goods:

    Financial markets and instantaneous budget constraint:

    There is now international trade in stocks and (real) bonds. Stocks in country i represents a claim to
its stream of dividends {di,t }. There is a bond denominated in the Home good, and a bond denominated

is different from the bias in consumption spending.

country i. This assumption is however irrelevant here since up-to the degree of the approximation, the intertemporal marginal
rate of substitution of the country i household and the country j household are the same.

As in section (4.1), equilibrium portfolio holdings (Si,t+1 , Sj,t+1 , Bi,t+1 , Bj,t+1 ) can be determined by lin-
earizing the model around its deterministic steady state. With the asset structure here (four assets with four
exogenous shocks), efficient risk sharing can be replicated up to the first-order (‚Äúlocally-complete‚Äù markets).

   Linearization of the model

   We use the same notation as in section (4.1). Equations (13) and (14) still hold.

where It ‚â° IH,t /IF,t is relative real aggregate investment. Holding constant the terms of trade, the relative
demand for Home investment goods, yI,t , increases with relative real investment in the Home country, It ,
since Home aggregate investment is biased towards the Home good (a > 21 ).




                                                              22
   The relative demand for consumption yC,t is still defined by (from (15)):

   The market clearing condition for goods (30), together with (32) and (33) implies:

                                   (1 ‚àí sI )yC,t + sI yI,t = ‚àí¬µqt + sI (2aI ‚àí 1)It = yt                                  (34)

ratio.
   Not surprisingly, Home terms of trade worsen when the relative supply of Home goods increases, for a
given amount of relative Home country investment. Home terms of trade improve when Home investment
rises (due to home bias in investment spending), for a given value of the relative Home/Foreign output.

   Ex-ante symmetry implies that the zero-order portfolios have to satisfy the following conditions: S ‚â°
 H
SH = SFF = 1 ‚àí SH
                F
                  = 1 ‚àí SFH ;                    H

                                                   = BFF = ‚àíBH = ‚àíBFH . The pair (S; B) thus describes the
(zero-order) equilibrium portfolio. B denotes a country holdings of bonds denominated in its local good.
B > 0 means that a country is long in local-good bonds (and short in foreign good bonds).
   As before there exists a unique portfolio (S; B) that satisfies the following ‚Äòstatic‚Äô budget constraint, for
consumptions that are consistent with the linearized risk sharing condition (14):

                        Pi,t Ci,t = wi,t li,t + Sdi,t + (1 ‚àí S)dj,t + B(pi,t ‚àí pj,t ), for i = H, F.                     (35)

Country i‚Ä≤ s efficient consumption spending at date t equals date t wage income, wi,t li,t , plus the financial
income generated by the portfolio (S; B)
   Subtracting the ‚Äòstatic‚Äô budget constraint of country F from that of country H and linearizing gives:27

   Partial equilibrium zero-order portfolios

   Like in the previous model, one can derive from the ‚Äòstatic‚Äô budget constraint (36) a partial equilibrium
portfolio that expresses the hedging terms in terms of covariance-variance ratios. This expression holds in a
large class of models with bonds and equities.

   Projection of (36) on dt and qt gives the following expression for the portfolio of bonds and equities (S,

exploit covariances of the assets payoffs with the two sources of risk. However, there is a key difference with
the previous model with equities: the covariance of asset payments with the real exchange rate risk and
labor income risk is conditional on payments of the other assets. This finding has two main implications.
      First real exchange rate hedging is done via the bond position since bond return differentials across
countries are almost perfectly correlated with the real exchange rate (see Coeurdacier and Gourinchas
(2010)). In the present model with real bonds, the correlation is perfect and the real exchange rate hedging

term on the equity position Covq(RER
      Second, while the covariance of local equity returns with returns on non-tradable wealth can be positive
(as in Baxter and Jermann (1997)), this has no implication for the equity portfolio, only the covariance
conditional on bond returns matters. As discussed below, it turns out that the latter tends to be negative
in the data.

      General equilibrium zero-order portfolios

      We now turn to the zero-order portfolio as a function of the model parameters. Relative labor income
(wt lt ) is still given by: wt lt = qt + yt . Due to the presence of endogenous investment, relative dividends (dt )
are now given by (using (25)):

               Œ±                   sI                                Œ±                   sI

Hence, using (34), we can re-express (36) as follows:

          1
(1‚àísI )(1‚àí ) (2a ‚àí 1) qt = [(1‚àíŒ±)+Œ± (2S ‚àí 1)]((1‚àí¬µ)qt +sI (2a‚àí1)It )‚àísI (2S ‚àí 1) [(2a ‚àí 1) qt + It ]+2bqt

The asset structure supports full risk sharing, up to first-order, if (40) holds for all realizations of the two
(relative) exogenous shocks (Œ∏t , œát ). To solve for that portfolio, we do not have to solve for output and
investment, as a unique pair of terms of trade and relative real investment (qt , It ) is associated with each

   The equity portfolio features home bias and is the sum of two terms only. The hedging-term for the real
exchange rate is indeed zero in this model since relative price movements are fully hedged by the appropriate
(real) bond position (cross-country differentials in bond payments are perfectly correlated with the real
exchange rate).

                         1
  (i) The first term     2   is still the Lucas (1982) term which prevails in the absence of non-tradable income
      risk (Œ± ‚Üí 1)

                             (2a‚àí1)(1‚àíŒ±)
 (ii) The second term         1‚àí(2a‚àí1)Œ±    is the hedging of non-tradable income risk conditionally on bond pay-
      ments: this term is unambiguously positive and drives home equity bias in the model. To understand
      this term, assume a combination of shocks (Œ∏t , œát ) such that relative investment It increases but leaves
      the terms-of-trade (bond payments differential) qt unchanged. Such a combination of shocks will in-
      crease labor demand and labor incomes since investment spending is using more intensively local goods
      (a > 1/2).28 In the mean time, dividends net of investment spending are falling. This generates nega-
      tive comovements between labor income and dividends holding relative prices constant (or equivalently
      conditional on bond payments differentials).

   The equity portfolio is the same as in Heathcote and Perri (2008)29 but holds for all values of the
preference parameters. In their benchmark case, parameters are such that œÉ = œÜ = ¬µ = 1. In that case,
only fluctuations in investment matters for the equity portfolio, for two reasons: (i) fluctuations in output
are hedged through terms-of-trade movements (as in Cole and Obstfeld (1991)) due to ¬µ = 1; (ii) œÉ = 1
cancels out any real exchange rate hedging term. As a consequence, the equity portfolio is the same as in
the present model. In contrast to the equities-only model, the equity portfolio in our model with bonds
and equity is remarkably stable to changes in preference parameters (see Coeurdacier and Gourinchas
(2010)).

   The bond portfolio b is also the sum of two terms:

  (i) The first term 21 (1 ‚àí sI )(1 ‚àí œÉ1 ) (2a ‚àí 1) is the hedging of real exchange rate risk. This is the desired
      exposure to real exchange rate in the absence of non-tradable income risk (Œ± ‚Üí 1). This term is
      unambiguously positive since local bonds have higher payoffs when local goods are more expensive.
  28 Note that with a = 1/2, this term is equal to zero since increases in domestic investment changes do not increase more

domestic demand than foreign. Wages increase as much in both countries.
  29 They consider the same model but with equities and productivity shocks only.

                            (1‚àíŒ±)[¬µ‚àí1+sI (2aI ‚àí1)2 ]
 (ii) The second term             1‚àí(2a‚àí1)Œ±            is the hedging of non-tradable income risk conditionally on
         relative dividend payments: this term can be positive or negative. Roughly speaking, it is negative if
         relative wages are positively (resp. negatively) correlated with the terms-of-trade, which happens for
         low values of ¬µ, i.e. low elasticity of substitution œÜ (resp. for high values of ¬µ, i.e. high elasticity of
         substitution œÜ).



4.2.4      Empirical evidence on the hedging of non-tradable income risk

In order to show the relevance of conditioning for bond returns, we now present some empirical evidence on
the hedging of non-tradable risk (see Coeurdacier, Kollmann and Martin (2010) for similar evidence30 ).
The evidence is based on the expression of the portfolio in terms of variance/covariance ratio (equation (37))
  We use national accounts data for G7 countries to compute the conditional covariance-variance ratio
                              
 Covq(wt lt , dt )/V arq(dt ) for each country. Data are quarterly over the period 1980Q1-2008Q3. Data are
taken from OECD National Accounts Data and from the IFS for exchange rates and price indices (see
Coeurdacier and Gourinchas (2010) for a precise description of the data). We compute relative labor
income deviations wt lt and relative dividend deviations dt for each country with respect to the other six
countries (wages are computed for each country as the share of output going to labor and dividends are
computed as the share of output going to capital net of investment spending).31 Deviations are either first-
difference of the variables or HP-filtered data (smoothing parameter 1600). We compute bond payments
differentials q using the (trade-weighted) real exchange rate of one country with respect to the other six. Note
that results are virtually the same when using nominal exchange rate instead of the real exchange rate (i.e.
considering nominal bonds instead of real bonds). We also report the unconditional covariance-variance
                               
ratio Cov(wt lt , dt )/V ar(dt ) , the one that matter in an equity-only model (see equation (18)). As shown in
table (2), conditioning for exchange rate movements has a strong impact on the hedging properties of equities
for non-tradable income risk: unconditionally (lines (1) and (3)), wages and dividends comove positively
for all countries, which would lead to a large foreign equity bias in the equity-only model of section (4.1).
Conditionally (lines (2) and (4), wages and dividends comove negatively for all countries, which lead to a
home equity bias in our equity-bond model. The presence of bonds makes the international diversification
puzzle better than you think, both in the model and in the data!
 30 In a revised version, Heathcote and Perri (2009) also provides similar empirical evidence.
 31 We  follow Gollin (2002) to allocate mixed-incomes from the national accounts to labor or capital. We assume that the
share of mixed income going to labor is equal to the share of labor income in value added.

4.2.5   Related literature

Coeurdacier and Gourinchas (2010) show in a two country, two good, two period endowment economy
with trade in equities and bonds how bond trading cast doubt on earlier findings of equities only models. They
show that in many theoretical environments, bonds are an excellent hedge for real exchange rate fluctuations.
They provide evidence in line with table (2) based on returns data. Using data on G7 countries, they show
that the unconditional correlation between returns on equity and returns on non-tradable wealth is very
different from the conditional one: while the former is positive for all countries (as in Baxter and Jermann
(1997)), the latter is negative (or non-significant) for all countries, rationalizing the degree of home bias
observed in G7 countries. Their findings echo the empirical results of van Wincoop and Warnock (2008)
who show that equities are a very poor hedge for real exchange risk, and even more so when trade in nominal
bonds (currency forwards) is allowed.
   A similar theoretical point is made in Engel and Matsumoto (2009a) in the specific case of a two
country/two good DSGE model with monopolistic competition and sticky prices. Assets traded are domestic
and foreign equity and positions in currency forward markets (which are equivalent to nominal bonds).
Uncertainty is driven by productivity shocks and money supply shocks. Due to price rigidity, nominal
exchange rate fluctuations are related to real exchange rate fluctuations and the forward positions are used to
hedge the nominal exchange rate changes, leaving only a part of the relative price risk to be hedged by equity
positions. The authors show that sufficient degrees of price rigidity can generate substantial home bias in
equity positions, as domestic returns to human wealth and domestic equity returns are negatively correlated,
conditional on nominal exchange rate changes. With monopolistic competition and price rigidities, output
is partly demand determined in the short run. Following a local positive productivity shock, labour demand
falls. Wages also fall, leading to a fall in domestic labour income. Mark-ups and profits increase, as, for
the same level of production, labour costs go down. As price rigidities become smaller, we have two effects
lowering home bias. Firstly, prices fall more following a positive productivity shock, increasing output and
pushing up labour demand and wages. Secondly, the nominal and the real exchange rate become less closely


                                                                 27
related, making forward contracts less able to hedge fluctuations in relative prices. In the extreme case of
full price flexibility, we go back to Baxter and Jermann (1997): labor incomes and profits are perfectly
correlated and investors do not take any forward position as they do not want any exposure to purely
nominal risk. Engel and Matsumoto (2009b) generalise the results above to the cases of local bias in
consumption, producer currency pricing and wage rigidity.
   Rabhari (2009) develops a two-country DSGE model with price stickiness, endogenous capital accu-
mulation, trade in nominal bonds and equities and endogenous monetary policy. In his setting, equity home
bias is again driven by the motive to hedge human capital risk. Real exchange rate risk is mainly hedged
through bond positions due to price stickiness. He also shows that the combination of price stickiness and
endogenous capital accumulation can produce relative equity returns that are unconditionally positively cor-
related with human capital returns, but conditionally negatively correlated (controlling for bond returns).
This correlation pattern is confirmed using US data.
   Devereux and Sutherland (2007, 2008b) develops a two country, two good DSGE model with
nominal rigidities aÃÄ la Calvo, producer currency pricing and endogenous monetary policy. The monetary
authority sets the nominal interest rate in response to changes in producer price inflation. There is no local
bias in consumption and productivity shocks are assumed to be persistent. The authors consider different
asset market structures (portfolio autarky, trade in nominal bonds and trade in nominal bonds and equity).
They can generate home bias in equities for the same reason as Engel and Matsumoto (2008a). They
also find that monetary policy assumes an additional role in these models. By changing the returns on
nominal bonds, monetary policy affects portfolios and thus risk sharing. Interestingly, they find that while
monetary policy has no impact on portfolios with trading in nominal bonds and equities, in the case of bond
trading only, there is an additional motive for price stability. With price stability, cross-country nominal
bonds returns differentials become more correlated with the real exchange rate, which improves international
risk sharing.
   Lastly, Berriel and Bhattarai (2008) solves for equity and nominal bonds portfolios in a standard two-
country general equilibrium model in presence of government spending shocks and nominal shocks (shocks
to the price level): they investigate a new source of non-tradable income risk, namely tax changes. In order
to hedge fluctuations in taxes, households exhibit home bias towards local (government) nominal bonds and
local equities. The main mechanism goes as follows: price level shocks at home (increase in home inflation)
lowers the value of home government debt and the government can lower taxes (while still satisfying its
intertemporal constraint). Hence, returns on domestic nominal bonds and local taxes comove positively and
the household prefers to hold local nominal bonds. Government spending shocks lead to an increase in taxes.
In the mean time, as government expenditures are biased towards local goods, the relative price of locally
produced goods increase and so does the pay-off of the claim to local output (local equity). Hence, returns
on local equity and taxes comove positively and households will optimally bias their portfolio towards local
equity.

4.3     Extensions and shortcomings
4.3.1   Other assets?

The recent literature has shown the importance of extending existing models to a larger menu of assets. Due
to substitution across asset classes, the hedging role of an asset is modified by the presence of other available
types of assets. Thus, an important issue is why we should restrict our attention to bonds and equities
instead of considering an even larger set of assets. There is no simple answer to this question: potentially
any asset that is traded publicly could affect the equity portfolio if it has some hedging properties in addition
to what bonds and equities can achieve. Note that the empirical tests of these hedging properties based
on covariance-variance ratios could be potentially extended to a larger menu of assets, one just needs to
condition for returns on these other assets. In particular, including housing as an additional asset seems a
natural extension of existing work.

   A related question is the role of corporate debt in these models. We have ignored debt as a way to raise
capital for firms and have focused on firms that are fully financed through equity. Coeurdacier, Kollmann
and Martin (2010) tackle this issue by allowing for an exogenous financial structure of firms in a world
of ‚Äòlocally complete‚Äô markets. They show that in an environment where the financial structure is irrelevant
for the value of the firm (when the Modigliani-Miller theorem applies), the presence of corporate debt has
no impact on investment decisions and the equilibrium consumption allocation (up to the first order) since
markets are complete. Moreover, the equilibrium equity portfolio is also not affected by the presence of
corporate debt. They show that domestic investors will hold a fraction of the corporate debt issued by
domestic firms that is equal to the fraction of stocks of the same firms that they hold. Hence, if the model
delivers home bias in equity, it will also deliver home bias in corporate debt in the same proportion. The
reason is simple: when the Modigliani-Miller theorem applies, investors want a certain exposure to the total
value of the firm, which is independent of its financial structure. In particular, the fraction of the value
of the firm they hold optimally is pinned down in the case where firms are fully financed through equity.
When firms are partially financed through debt, holding the same fraction of debt and equity guarantees that
investors have their optimal exposure to the value of the firm. One shortcoming though is that such a result
might not hold if the Modigliani-Miller theorem does not apply or if financial markets are incomplete. We
are not aware of any models that pins down international portfolios in a world where the financial structure
of firm, optimal or not, affects the value of the firm and matters for the real allocation.

4.3.2   Exchange Rates and Asset Prices

While the models described above can claim some success in replicating some features of aggregate portfolio
data, they cannot replicate realistic moments of asset prices and exchange rates (see Lewis (2011) for
a recent survey on international asset pricing puzzles). They do not solve the standard puzzles in the
finance literature regarding the equity premium and the volatility of asset prices and exchange rates. This
is an important limitation since portfolios should be the mirror of asset prices as both are determined

                                                       29
in equilibrium. This does not mean that the mechanisms highlighted would not survive in more general
environments able to generate realistic asset prices but this remains to be seen. First attempts in that
direction include Stathopoulos (2008,2009) who introduces habit formation and Benigno and Nistico
(2009) who model ambiguity aversion. Interestingly, Benigno and Nistico (2009) show that, taking into
account long run consumption risk, which is correlated with the real exchange rate, changes the properties
of the pricing kernel and rationalizes home bias. We believe that explaining asset prices moments should
help disentangling across the different potential channels generating portfolio biases.

   An important related shortcoming of this class of models with endogenous portfolio decisions is that the
allocation under perfect risk-sharing is replicated, or at least up to the degree of the approximation. This
implies an equality between the ratio of marginal utilities of consumption and the real exchange rate in all
states of nature. With standard CRRA preferences, this leads to a perfect correlation between real exchange
rate changes and relative consumption growth (Home relative consumption falls when Home relative prices
are higher; see equation (14) in the previous models). In the data, this is strongly rejected, the correlation is
close to zero and if anything Home relative consumption increases when Home relative prices are higher: this
is the famous consumption-real exchange rate anomaly (Kollmann-Backus-Smith puzzle; see Backus and
Smith (1993) and Kollmann (1995)). In the previous models, the asset structure and the dimension of
uncertainty are such that one can replicate the efficient allocation (up to first order). One could believe that
adding additional sources of uncertainty such that markets are incomplete even locally would help to solve
the consumption-real exchange rate anomaly. It turns out to be extremely hard to lower the correlation
between relative consumption and the real exchange rate in models with endogenous portfolio decisions
despite imperfect spanning of risks (see Coeurdacier, Kollmann and Martin (2007) and Benigno
and Kucuk-Tuger (2009)). In most existing models with endogenous portfolio choice, international risk-
sharing is still far above what consumption data suggests and this remains an important challenge for future
work.

4.3.3   Dispersion of home bias across time, countries and assets

Data on home bias exhibit substantial variations across time and across countries (see Figures (1) and (2)
and Table (1)). Most of the work has been dedicated to match the average degree of home bias observed in
developed countries (Collard et al. (2007) and Heathcote and Perri (2008) are notable exceptions:
in line with model predictions, they match the degree of equity bias to the degree of trade openness of
countries). Since more data on aggregate foreign asset holdings are now available, both in the time series
and in the cross-section, it seems natural to extend theories to heterogeneous countries. This would provide
more accurate tests of the different theories available. Exploiting the bilateral dimension of the data using a
multi-country framework could also help in that matter. Indeed, using the CPIS data provided by the IMF
since 2001, one can now observe equity holdings between country pairs. Most of the theoretical literature
has so far limited its attention to models with two symmetric countries, which does not allow to exploit the


                                                       30
bilateral and cross-sectional variations of the data.
    A similar point can be made regarding the currency exposure of international portfolios. As shown by
Lane and Shambaugh (2009ab), the currency denomination of foreign assets and liabilities are very
heterogeneous across countries. While, on average, the advanced countries are (in net terms) borrowing
in foreign-currency, some major countries have very large negative domestic-currency debt positions (most
notably the US). Models including bond positions denominated in different currencies should be also tested
against such data. In section (7), we also provide some evidence on the cross sectional dispersion of home
bias for other asset classes (bonds and banking assets).


5     Asset trade costs in international financial markets
So far, we have focused on hedging motives as a source of heterogeneity in portfolios assuming frictionless
financial markets. Another strand of the macroeconomics literature considers frictions in financial markets
as the main source of heterogeneity across investors. Portfolio home bias is the natural outcome of these
frictions. Such frictions could include fixed or proportional transaction costs in foreign portfolio invest-
ments, difference of tax treatments across domestic and foreign portfolio incomes and other policy induced
restrictions on foreign investments (such as limits to foreign investment, capital controls, differences in legal
frameworks) (see French and Poterba (1991), Lewis (1999), Stulz et al. (2003)). Other important
frictions to international investments are informational frictions. The role of information has been exten-
sively investigated in the finance literature but less so in the Open Financial Macroeconomics literature
(Hatchondo (2008), Tille and van Wincoop (2009) and Dumas et al. (2011) are recent notable
exceptions). For this reason, we will review the literature on informational frictions (and behavioural biases)
in a separate section (see section (6)).


5.1    Transaction costs would need to be very large to explain equity home bias...

There is a wide debate on the importance of transaction costs to explain international portfolio decisions.
French and Poterba (1991) initially argue in a mean-variance framework that these costs must be much
larger than the one typically observed if one want to rationalize equity home bias. Using stock returns
data from 1975 to 1989 for the US, Japan, UK, France, Germany, Canada, the authors use estimates of a
covariance matrix of returns together with an optimal portfolio rule that is implied by constant relative risk
aversion in order to back out the differences in expected returns needed to explain actual portfolio shares
for these countries. The implicit excess return on domestic equity implied by observed portfolio holdings
is then interpreted as a measure of the cost of international asset trading needed to generate the observed
home bias: they find an order of magnitude for these costs of several hundred basis points, too big to
be true! Numerous subsequent studies have provided such indirect estimates of the costs. Jeske (2001)
calculates the implicit costs on foreign assets necessary to skew the portfolio allocation away from the optimal
(based on a mean variance model) toward the observed allocation. These costs are very large ranging from


                                                        31
150 to 700 basis points across countries. Most studies are in line with French and Poterba (1991)‚Äôs
results and argue that costs need to be very large to explain portfolio holdings (see Cooper and Kaplanis
(1994) among others). A notable exception is Sercu and Vanpee (2008) who find that, once they control
for many factors (currency risk, inflation hedging, fixed-interest investments, round-tripping and omitted
countries) and allow for time varying covariances, the implicit inward investment costs are much lower than
in earlier studies in developed markets (in the order of magnitude of 0.10-0.20 percent per annum). It is
however important to note that the associated costs estimated from stock returns data suffer from potential
statistical uncertainty: due to the high volatility of stock returns, estimates of expected returns based on
past data are imprecise. Hence, when testing whether optimal portfolios weights are statistically different
from the observed ones, results have been quite inconclusive (see Bekaert and Urias (1996), Gorman
and Jorgensen (2002), Britten-Jones (1999), Lewis (1999) among others). In other words, estimated
costs to rationalize portfolio allocations have large standard errors and in many cases one cannot reject that
the observed home biased portfolio allocation is not statistically different from the optimal one.32

    Another piece of evidence pointing that transaction costs cannot rationalize portfolio holdings is Tesar
and Werner (1995): transaction costs based explanation of the equity home bias should in general imply
that turnover should be lower for foreign equity holdings than for domestic ones (unless they apply only to
dividend repatriation). Tesar and Werner (1995) find that turnover is in fact higher for foreign holdings.33


5.2     ...Unless diversification benefits are very small

As stated above, transaction costs are often assumed to be small although direct measures of these costs
do not often exist (see below). However, as shown by Martin and Rey (2004) and Coeurdacier and
Guibaud (2009), even small transaction costs may lead to sizable home bias when Home and Foreign
stocks are close substitutes: any small transaction cost is amplified if the benefits of diversification provided
by foreign assets are small.

    Indeed, small diversification benefits is a crucial ingredient for the transaction costs based story to
work. A key contribution in this literature is Cole and Obstfeld (1991) who show in the context of
a two country/two good model that gains from international risk sharing are probably quite small, as
changes in the terms of trade help to share risk internationally even with portfolio autarky. The intuition
is simple. Assuming Cobb Douglas preferences over the consumption of the two good, an increase in local
output triggers an equivalent fall their relative prices as local goods are now more abundant (terms-of-
trade adjustment). In this economy portfolio autarky implies perfect correlation of marginal utilities - the
complete market outcome. It is worth noting however, that this argument implies that portfolio would be
  32 Pastor (2000) goes one step ahead and examines whether an investor that updates his views on the distribution of domestic

and foreign returns in a Bayesian fashion may choose a strongly home biased portfolio. This will be true if the investor hold a
strong biased prior towards the domestic asset. But greater uncertainty on foreign stock returns can induce him to pay more
attention to the data and move away from this prior.
  33 Rowland (1999) and Amadi and Bergin (2008) construct models that can generate higher turnover for foreign asset holdings

than for domestic ones, in the former case with proportional trading costs, while the latter use fixed trading costs.


                                                              32
indeterminate if trade in equities were possible since home and foreign stocks would be perfect substitutes.
Cole and Obstfeld (1991) show that the equivalence between portfolio autarky and complete markets also
obtains in a setting with investment under the following assumptions: i) unitary elasticity of substitution
between the two goods, ii) unitary elasticity of intertemporal substitution, iii) full depreciation. For the
no-investment case, the authors calculate welfare gains of moving from autarky to perfect international risk-
sharing. They find small welfare gains for a broad range of values of the elasticity of substitution between
the two goods. Since the seminal paper of Cole and Obstfeld (1991), a large number of papers using
consumption data have computed welfare gains from international risk sharing with quite a lot of variation
across studies. Van Wincoop (1999) documents the extent to which the results are strongly sensitive
to assumptions about preferences (the coefficient of relative risk-aversion and the elasticity of substitution
between traded and nontraded goods), the assumed ‚Äòautarky‚Äô consumption process, the implicitly chosen
risk-free interest rate and the horizon of calculations. Without closing the debate, he tries to narrow the
range of reasonable estimates and does find significant gains from risk sharing among OECD countries over
a long horizon: 1.1 to 3.5% of permanent consumption for a 50 year horizon, and 2.5 to 7.5% for a 100 year
horizon.
   Overall though, explicit consumption based calculations of the welfare cost of underdiversification tend
to imply low costs. These results are very often driven by the low variability of consumption in the data.
In contrast, costs of underdiversification based on stock returns data are usually much larger, due to the
much larger volatility of stock returns. This point is clearly made by Lewis (2000): she finds that moving
from portfolio equity autarky towards an optimally diversified portfolio (efficient frontier in a mean-variance
framework with a relative risk aversion of 2 leads to a gain of 10 to 30% of current wealth while moving from
autarky consumption to perfect international risk-sharing leads to an increase in permanent consumption of
less than a percent. The gap between the two metrics remains an open question; one will need to reconcile
risk-sharing gains using consumption and asset prices data to fully evaluate the impact of transaction costs
on international portfolios.

   Finally, another argument in the literature has been that domestic multinationals already provide benefits
of diversification by being active in many countries, reducing the gains from international diversification.
However, Lewis (1999) and Tesar and Rowland (2004) argue that the correlation between the returns
of multinational and their national stock indices is quite high, thus limiting the diversification benefits they
can actually offer.


5.3    Direct measures of the costs?

It is important to note that most existing work provides indirect measures of transaction costs using stock
returns data and observed portfolio allocation (as in French and Poterba (1991)). There are no papers we
are aware of that presents an extensive measure of actual costs in investing in foreign assets. While directly
observed transaction costs on the stock markets are typically very low, they might not be the appropriate


                                                      33
measure for these asset trade costs. For instance, most households go through financial intermediaries to
invest in stock markets (pension funds, mutual funds...) but there is so far very little empirical evidence
investigating the difference in fees collected for foreign investments compared to domestic ones.

    The question of the role of international taxation also remains opened. For simplicity, we abstract from
taxation issues within multinationals and the effects on international taxation on Foreign Direct Investment
and focus on the taxation of portfolio incomes. When considering the rules of international taxation, one could
expect some large impact on home portfolio biases. First, dividends when repatriated are subject to non-
negligible withholding taxes (of a magnitude of roughly 10% in developed countries). Even if many bilateral
tax treaties lead to some exemptions of these withholding taxes (through tax credits schemes), this is not true
for all investors and these exemptions are often subject to some ceilings. Second, most developed countries
have dividend imputation schemes: capital incomes (profits) are indeed taxed twice in most countries, at
the corporate tax level and at the income tax level (when profits are distributed to shareholders). To avoid
this double-taxation, shareholders receive a tax rebate. The tax rebate is such that, on net, investors end up
paying the income tax only. Such dividend imputation schemes do not apply to foreign asset holdings. This
drives an additional significant differential in the taxation of capital incomes coming from domestic or foreign
firms (see Gordon and Hines (2002) and the chapter 10 of the Mirlees Review (2009) for excellent
surveys). However, as argued by Gordon and Hines (2002), these tax differentials might not be effective
in practice since this is very difficult for governments to enforce the taxation on foreign asset incomes. Tax
evasion on income from foreign securities through foreign financial intermediaries (in tax havens in particular)
might be an issue if one wants to measure exactly the costs associated to international taxation. Hence,
while most papers tend to argue that taxation differentials between domestic and foreign asset incomes
cannot fully account for the size of portfolio biases, it remains very hard to provide a quantitative estimate
of their impact on portfolio decisions. Studying optimal taxation of capital in a model where home bias is
endogenous would be a very natural extension of the literature. Gaspar and Gordon (2001) provides an
interesting treatment of optimal tax policies in a partial equilibrium model where home bias in equity or
bonds is endogenously generated.


6       Informational Frictions and Behavioural Biases
6.1     Informational frictions
6.1.1    Exogenous information sets

The impact of informational asymmetries on portfolio decisions has been first studied in the finance liter-
ature.34 In this literature, domestic and foreign investors differ on their (exogenously given) information
sets regarding future domestic and foreign stock returns. Gehrig (1993) and Brennan and Cao (1997)
  34 Contrary to the standard DSGE macro models, the finance literature described here relies on some partial equilibrium

assumptions: stock returns characteristics (risk and expected returns) are exogenously given and the risk-free asset is in infinite
supply.



                                                                34
develop a simple two country noisy rational expectations model with one stock per country. They assume
that agents in each country receive a signal on the future performance of each stock but the signal on the
foreign asset is less precise. Hence, domestic investors perceive the foreign stock as riskier and reduce their
foreign stock holdings, which leads to equity home bias. Moreover, Brennan and Cao (1997) show that
less well informed foreign investors respond more strongly to public signals on domestic stocks conveyed by
stock prices. Hence foreign investors buy more of the domestic stocks when the domestic market performs
well. The authors find evidence for this ‚Äôreturn chasing‚Äô effect in the data. Brennan and Cao (2005)
extend their initial work by developing a noisy expectations model where investors receive public and private
information signals. The private signal is less precise for foreign investors. The authors show that there is a
link between information disadvantages and the expectations (degree of bullishness) about a market: foreign
investors tend to become more bullish about a certain market following a positive return on that market.
Glassman and Riddick (2001) quantify what should be the perceived riskiness of foreign assets (due
to lower information quality) in order to generate the observed home bias of US investors. They find that
investors would have to scale up standard deviations of returns by a factor from 2 to 5 depending on risk
aversion and conclude that these scaling factors are implausibly high. Albuquerque et al. (2006) solve for
international equity flows when a set of home and foreign investors have superior information. They argue
that this informational heterogeneity within the foreign set of investors is more important than informational
heterogeneity across countries to explain international equity trades. In line with the data, the model ex-
plains why (i) U.S. investors trade in waves, with simultaneous buying and selling; (ii) U.S. investors change
their foreign equity positions gradually; and (iii) U.S. investors increase their equity position in a country
following a raise in its stock price.
   The finance literature described above had a recent impact on more standard general equilibrium macro
models along the lines of the Open Economy Financial Macroeconomics approach. Hatchondo (2008)
builds a single good two country model and two assets per country with two departures from standard
models. Firstly, he assumes that only local investors receive informative signals about local assets. This
informational advantage induces agents to invest in the ‚Äúgood‚Äù local asset. Secondly, engaging in short
selling is assumed to be costly. When the signal is sufficiently informative and short selling costs are high
enough, agents do not sell the ‚Äúbad‚Äù local asset short in order to invest more in the ‚Äúgood‚Äù local asset but
rather reduce their holdings of foreign assets. This leads to equity home bias in equilibrium. Bovenverg
and Gordon (1996), present a small open economy model where home bias results from information
asymmetries, which decrease the return home investors get on their foreign capital investment. In such a set
up, subsidizing capital imports is optimal. Razin et al. (1999) assume that domestic investors can observe
the productivity of domestic firms before making their loan decisions, while foreign investors cannot. This
results in foreign underinvestment and domestic oversaving. Building on a similar asymmetric information
set up but adding the possibility of liquidity shocks, Goldstein and Razin (2006) study the trade-off
between FDI and portfolio investment, the latter being more liquid than the former.



                                                      35
   Tille and van Wincoop (2009) applies the noisy rational expectations framework from the finance
literature to a standard two country/one good DSGE model. They depart from standard open macro models
by introducing information dispersion across investors. Each investor receives a private signal on the future
fundamentals (productivity) of domestic and foreign stock, the signal on its own stock being more precise (as
in Gehrig (1993) and Brennan and Cao (1997)). The noise is introduced in the form of (unobserved)
stochastic transaction costs to invest abroad which generates portfolio shifts towards or away from foreign
assets. This makes sure that stock prices cannot fully aggregate private signals in equilibrium. These
transaction costs generate equity home bias in equilibrium but this is not the purpose of the paper. They
show that dispersed private information disconnects stock prices from the currently observed fundamental
values but also international capital flows (gross and net). Moreover, capital flows should help forecast future
fundamentals. They find some empirical support for their results.

6.1.2   Endogenous information acquisition

The early noisy rational expectations literature when applied to international portfolio choice relies on
exogenous information structures. A recent challenge has been to extend it by allowing for endogenous
information acquisition. In this line of research, information is a tool to reduce the conditional variance of
the asset payoffs. Using a model of rational inattention introduced by Sims (2001), Van Nieuwerburg
and Veldkamp (2009) build a model where a tiny information advantage is enough to generate significant
home bias if investors have a limited capacity to process information. In this model, agents are endowed with
a small informational advantage on the local asset, which lowers its perceived riskiness. Thus, the investor will
tend to hold more of the local asset. However, this effect is amplified as the more of an asset the agent owns,
the more attractive it becomes to learn about the asset. Endogenous and costly acquisition of information
amplifies the initial small informational advantage and leads to specialization in local stocks. Learning turns
out to amplify information asymmetries instead of reducing them. In their set up, countries which are learnt
about a lot by investors should have lower returns compared to the prediction of a standard CAPM model,
as lower uncertainty goes hand in hand with a lower return. Van Nieuwerburg and Veldkamp (2010)
apply variations of their rational inattention model to explain investment strategies of investors, varying the
specification of the preferences or of the information constraint that they face. Depending on the convexity
of the objective function of investors, they can rationalize concentrated or diversified portfolios. Mondria
(2010) allows rationally inattentive investors to decide not only on the precision but also on the structure of
the information they process. In equilibrium, agents choose to learn not only about individual assets but also
about linear combination of assets, i.e. indices. Such a learning strategy makes sense as the structure of the
signal the agents choose in equilibrium depends on their objective function. Since investors will choose to hold
a somewhat diversified portfolio in equilibrium, they choose to process information about combinations of
assets (they are interested not only in the volatility of each asset but also in their covariance). Mondria and
Wu (2010) use a similar framework to explain the time series of home bias. When financial liberalization
takes place in the developed economies in the 1980s, investors start to be able to diversify their portfolios


                                                       36
and home bias decreases but only gradually as investors have an initial information advantage on domestic
assets. The authors show that persistence of asset pay-offs and increases in information processing capacity
tends to magnify home bias. By looking at the interaction of capital openness and learning strategies, they
are able to reproduce the time series of home bias35 .

6.1.3      Empirical evidence on informational frictions

A number of papers regress portfolio holdings or measures of home bias directly on factors that proxy for
information asymmetries. Portes and Rey (2005) shows that physical distance affects international equity
flows and holdings very significantly: doubling the distance reduces cross-border equity flows by half. Coval
and Moskowitz (1999) find that U.S. mutual fund managers prefer to invest in nearby firms even within
a country. Ahearne et al. (2004) find that U.S. holdings of foreign equities are significantly biased
towards countries that have a higher share of their stock market listed on U.S. stock exchanges. Chan
et al. (2005) find that stock market development and familiarity variables have a significant impact on
home bias for a sample of mutual funds spanning 26 developed and developing markets. They aggregate the
investments of these funds at the country level. Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001) emphasizes the key role
of distance, language and cultural similarities in international asset allocation. Aviat and Coeurdacier
(2007) revisits the impact of distance on cross-border equity holdings (and bank loans). They find that the
impact of distance is drastically reduced once we control for bilateral goods trade: countries portfolios are
strongly biased towards trading partners (see also Lane and Milesi Ferretti (2008)). Using instrumental
variables, they show that the causality goes essentially one-way: reducing barriers to trade in goods enhances
cross-border asset holdings. However, one cannot reject the role of goods trade in fostering information flows
across borders. Since a lot of information on stocks come through the accounts of firms, it is to be expected
that different accounting standards would act as information barriers. Bradshaw, Bushee, and Miller
(2004) find that firms exhibiting higher levels (changes) of U.S. GAAP conformity have greater levels
(changes) of U.S. institutional ownership. This positive relation holds regardless of a firm‚Äôs visibility to
U.S. investors (e.g., American Depositary Receipt listing, stock index membership, analyst following, firm
size). Finally, using survey data on Italian investors, Guiso and Japelli (2006) find that investors who
spend more time to acquire information also tend to hold less diversified portfolios as implied by models of
endogenous information acquisition.
   Most models of information asymmetries though also imply that domestic investors should earn a higher
return than foreign investors. However, the empirical evidence on this matter is mixed. Coval and
Moskowitz (1999), Hau (2001), Dvorak (2005) and Choe et al (2005) find that domestic investors
do in fact earn higher returns, while Grinblatt and Keloharju (2000) and Huang and Shiu (2006)
find the opposite.

                                                                37
6.2    Behavioural biases

Some recent papers have put forward a behavioral explanation for the equity home bias. Using departures
from rational expectations and maximization of standard von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions used
in standard macro literature, this literature has highlighted some behavioural biases consistent with the data
on international portfolio allocation. The seminal paper of French and Poterba (1991) already consid-
ers overconfidence towards local assets as a potential explanation: if investors systematically have higher
expectations of relative returns for domestic equities, this difference in expected returns, while inconsistent,
can overturn any perceived diversification gains. In the same vein, Shiller et al. (1991) document large
differences in expected returns of Japanese and U.S. investors for the same stockmarkets. They find that
Japanese investors tend to expect relatively higher returns for Japanese stocks, while U.S. investors expect
higher returns on U.S. equity. A similar argument can be applied to estimated variances (either the standard
deviation of domestic equity is systematically believed to be lower or correlations with foreign equities are
overestimated). Studies by Huberman (2001), Benartzi (2001) and Karlsson and Norden (2007)
(see also Barberis and Thaler (2003) for a survey) suggest that ‚Äòfamiliarity‚Äô might be the main determi-
nant of portfolio choice: investors choose ‚Äòfamiliar‚Äô assets while ignoring the principles of portfolio theory.
Graham, Harvey and Huang (2009) investigates the role of self-assessed trading competences on port-
folio home bias. They show how home bias can emerge when investor feels incompetent in understanding the
benefits and the risks of investing in foreign assets. However, it remains difficult to disentangle empirically
informational frictions linked to distance and/or institutional differences from behavioural biases such as
‚Äòfamiliarity‚Äô and/or ‚Äòcompetence‚Äô effects. Solnik (2006) explains the equity home bias by the Regret The-
ory: investors use the domestic portfolio as a benchmark and feel the pain when their foreign investments
underperform. Finally, Morse and Shive (2006) find that home bias is empirically related to measures of
patriotism.
   To our knowledge, building on Dumas, Kurshev and Uppal (2007), Dumas, Lewis and Osambela
(2009) are the first ones to develop a standard two-country general equilibrium model (in continuous time)
where investors exhibit behavioural biases in the form of differences in their beliefs. Investors have access
to the same information set (no asymmetric information) but differ in their beliefs about the information
contained in economic public signals: local investors trust more the information contained in local signals
and incorrectly believe that the information in the foreign signal is partly noise. These asymmetric beliefs
help the authors to solve for some anomalies at the international level: investors exhibit home equity bias,
asset prices are the combination of a local CAPM and an international CAPM (in line with the empirical
evidence of Bekaert and Harvey (1995)) and as in models of asymmetric information (see Brennan and
Cao (2005)), capital flows towards a country covary positively with returns in that country. Their model
with differences in beliefs is indeed observationally equivalent to existing models of segmented markets due
to asymmetric information.

7       New Portfolio Facts
7.1       Aggregate Data on Portfolio Holdings

The Open Economy Financial Macroeconomics models have implications for international bond holdings
as well as international equity holdings. Hence, we provide some measure of the extent of risk-sharing
through international bonds holdings (public and private) for a large cross section of countries by using
data on cross-border bond holdings. For completeness we also present some data on international bank
lending, as we expect that the Open Economy Financial Macroeconomics will soon incorporate formally
bank intermediation in their models. For these data, we rely on CPIS and IFS data from the IMF and the
data from the BIS (see appendix for a detailed description of the data).

7.1.1     Cross-Border Bond Holdings

We use data form IFS and BIS to compute international bond holdings for selected countries. Unfortunately,
available data do not allow to disaggregate data of foreign bond holdings across types of bonds (corporate
versus public, across maturities, across currency denomination)36 and we had to focus on bond holdings
aggregates.
    To measure the degree of international diversification of bond portfolios, we compute a measure of home
bias in bond holdings similar to the one we computed for equity holdings. Hence, our measure of Bond Home
Bias for country i (BHBi ) is defined as follows:

                                    Share of Foreign Bonds in Country i Bond Holdings
                  BHBi = 1 ‚àí                                                                                     (43)
                                Share of Foreign Bonds in the World Bond Market Portfolio


    In figure (3), we show the evolution of bond home bias measures in developed countries across regions
of the world: it has decreased over the last twenty years with the process of ‚Äòfinancial globalization‚Äô but
remains still very high in all countries. Portfolios exhibit a home bias in bond holdings of a slightly larger
magnitude than the one documented for equity in section (2). On average, the degree of home bias across the
world is 0.75 (just like for equities it is lower in Europe where monetary union seemed to have had an effect
but higher in other countries),37 meaning that the share of foreign bonds in investors portfolios is roughly
a 1/4 of what investors would hold if they were holding the world bond market portfolio. Despite a large
degree of home bias, these data indicates that some international risk-sharing occurs through bond holdings
and it seems necessary to incorporate cross-border bond holdings in the theoretical portfolios model we are
using. In figure (4), we show the degree of bond home bias for emerging markets: emerging markets have
even much less diversified bond portfolios than developed countries and it has barely decreased over the last
decade. Like for equities, there is a significant dispersion of bond home bias across countries (and across
time) that could be helpful to guide future theoretical work.

on cross-border bond diversification.

7.1.2    Cross-Border Bank Loans

We use data from the BIS and the OECD to compute cross-border banking assets for selected countries.
Like for bonds, available data do not allow to disaggregate data of foreign bank loans across types of loans
and we had to focus on aggregate foreign asset holdings by banks.
    To measure the degree of international diversification of banks‚Äô portfolios, we compute a measure of home
bias in bank loans comparable to the one used for equities and bonds. Hence, our measure of Home Bias in
Loans for country i (LHBi ) is defined as follows:

                                Share of Foreign Banking Assets in Country i Banking Assets
             LHBi = 1 ‚àí                                                                                                   (44)
                            Foreign Banking Assets as a share of Total Foreign Outstanding Loans
    In figure (5), we show the evolution of home bias in bank loans measures across OECD countries using
OECD data. Figure (6) shows the same statistic but using BIS statistics (available for a larger number
of countries but over a shorter time period; see appendix for a detailed description of the data). Despite
an increased diversification, banking portfolios still exhibit a very strong home bias. The magnitude of the
home bias in banking assets is similar to the one observed for equity holdings. Like for equities and bonds,
the degree of Home Bias is the smallest in Europe (potentially due to the EMU) and the largest in emerging
markets (here Latin America).


7.2     Institutional Investors Home Bias Data

An increasing share of capital flows are intermediated through institutional investors. For example, using the
Survey of Consumer Finance, Polkovnichenko (2004) documents that in 2001, 62% of all equity holdings
by US households were indirect holdings. Information asymmetries explanations of the home bias seem
more plausible for households than for fund managers, who can devote a substantial amount of resources
to gather relevant information. Also, if home bias can be explained by the degree of sophistication of
investors regarding their investment strategies, one would expect that professional investors would be fully
aware of the theoretical benefits of diversification. Furthermore, with delegated investment comes an agency
problem and the incentives of the final investor and of the fund manager are not necessarily well aligned. It
should therefore be informative to look at portfolio allocations at the fund level to understand better the
determinants of home bias. Hau and Rey (2008) provides some descriptive statistics on domestic and
foreign holdings of mutual funds in 4 countries. We use the same data set - data of global equity holdings
from Thomson Financial Securities (TFS)- to estimate home bias at the fund level on a larger cross section of
countries. The data document individual mutual funds holdings at the stock level. TFS was created by the
merger of The Investext Group, Security Data Company and CDA/Spectrum. The data cover the five year
period 1997 to 2002 and has an interesting cross sectional and time series dimension.38 The TFS holding data
comprise fund number, fund name, management company name, country code of the fund incorporation,
  38 Chan et al. (2005) used a similar dataset -albeit only for one year. They aggregated the data across all funds to document

home bias at the country level.

stock identifier, country code of the stock, stock position (number of stocks held), reporting dates for which
holding data is available, security price on the reporting date and the security price on the closest previous
days in case the reporting date had no price information on the security, total return index (including
dividend reinvestments) in local currency, and daily dollar exchange rates for all investment destinations.
Most funds report only with a frequency of 6 months. Reporting dates differ somewhat, but more than 90
percent of the reporting occurs in the last 30 days of each half-year. A limitation of the data is that they
do not include any information on cash holdings, financial leverage, investments in fixed income instruments
or investments in derivative contracts. The portfolio characteristics we calculate therefore concern only the
equity proportion of a fund‚Äôs investment. Table 1 gives the breakdown of the average market capitalization
over the sample in billions of dollars by country of fund origin. Table 2 gives the breakdown of the average
number of funds also by country of fund origin.
   Graph 1 present the percentage of mutual funds based in a given country whose shares of domestic
holdings in total asset holdings is 0%, strictly larger than 0% but smaller than 10%, between 10 and 20%,
.., between 90 and 100% (but strictly below 100%) and equal to 100%. The numbers are averages for the
1997-2002 period. To simplify, we call these different shares of domestic holdings in total holdings ‚Äùdifferent
degrees of home bias‚Äù. For each country, the percentages are based on number of funds in a given home bias
category out of the total number of funds for that country and on the share of the market capitalization of
funds in a given category relative to the total market capitalization of funds of that country. Thus, funds
may change from one home bias category to another over the course of the sample.
   The most striking stylized fact may be that there is a great deal of heterogeneity both across countries
and within country in the extent of domestic holdings in total holdings. For most countries, the distribution
usually exhibits peaks at 0% and 100% (or between 0 and 10% and between 90 and 100%) indicating sub-
stantial specialization of funds into either (close to) fully domestic or (close to) fully international investment.
But, interestingly, there is a non negligible part of the distribution lying in between those two extremes,
indicating a great deal of heterogeneity in diversification choices by the fund managers even within country.
Thus one conjecture is that the observed investment pattern at the fund level reflects both some increasing
returns in the information technology leading to some concentration in stock holdings of either domestic or
foreign countries and a particular market structure inducing product differentiation at the fund level. As
mentioned in Hau and Rey (2008), there is a positive correlation between the number of sectors and the
number of countries funds invest in, suggesting that more diversified funds diversify both across sectors of
activity and across countries. Larger funds tend also to be the most diversified. The role of fund mandates in
the observed asset holdings is of course of great interest. We find that for example, in 2002, 701 funds out of
our 1,291 US funds had some kind of explicit mandates, which could range from ‚Äùinvesting in world equities‚Äù
to ‚Äùprimarily small cap north American companies‚Äù or ‚Äùat least 80% in Latin American companies‚Äù. These
mandates seem to exhibit considerable variations across countries and are clearly not exogenous. They too
result from the optimizing behaviour of financial companies. Explaining home bias or indeed investment

strategies at the fund level thus probably requires a theory of fund mandates.



8     Conclusions and leads for future research
Our view is that the home bias puzzle is now less of a puzzle. From the literature we labeled ‚ÄúOpen Economy
Financial Macroeconomics‚Äù to the rational inattention models featuring endogenous information acquisition,
notable progress has been made to understand the determinants of portfolio allocations. We may now be
at a stage where we should be studying a broad array of implications of these new models rather than
focusing only on the stylized fact of equity home bias. Confronting their predictions with a large set of other
stylized facts on portfolio holdings will surely lead us to refine them further and ultimately assess their true
explanatory power.
    The Open Economy Financial Macroeconomics literature has an interesting set of predictions on the
holdings of a broad menu of financial assets. It should be very fruitful to introduce in that literature some
more detailed models of the capital structure of firms and to get finer empirical implications for equities and
corporate/banking debt in particular. Applying corporate finance theory to model the capital structure of
firms seems a natural extension of these models, all the more so since it has been shown to matter empirically
to explain the home bias (see Dahlquist, Pinkowitz, Stulz, and Williamson (2003)). One major issue
going forward will also be the modelling of the official sector. Introducing an optimal monetary or fiscal
policy and modelling their interactions with endogenous portfolio choices of the private sector is a major
challenge. It is likely that as a first step focusing on realistic but not necessarily optimal monetary policy
or fiscal rules will be the way to go. It is an important goal to have realistic and workable macroeconomic
models of the open economy with endogenous portfolio choice, as large cross border holdings of assets (see
Gourinchas and Rey (2007a)) are likely to affect the channels of transmission of monetary and fiscal
policy. Understanding the short run dynamics of the exchange rate, a formidable but crucial task, is also
intimately linked to agents portfolio choices and gross external positions as shown in Gourinchas and
Rey (2007b) and Della Corte et al. (2009). Furthermore, a closer look at the maximization problems
faced by Central Banks when they decide on their reserve holdings and by sovereign wealth funds would be
warranted as both actors now account for a non trivial share of international capital flows. The portfolio
choice of the official sector is also an important determinant of the international use of a currency. The dollar
market share in world transactions and the ‚Äùexorbitant privilege‚Äù of the United States may be challenged by
the new portfolio diversification strategies of emerging markets in general and China in particular. We have
few models which can tackle these issues in a general equilibrium set up with a rich asset structure. The
role of international currencies and their importance in determining portfolios and asset price movements is
an area of active research (see Devereux and Shi (2009) or Gourinchas et al. (2010)).
    As more detailed survey data on households become available, one will also be better able to test at the
microeconomic level the empirical relevance of various hedging motives underlying the mechanism of these



                                                       44
Open Economy Financial Macroeconomic models. Estimating the correlation of labour income risk with
various asset returns at a disaggregated level - for instance according to levels of wealth- would probably
enhance our understanding of the plausibility of the mechanisms. Importantly, introducing models with
heterogeneous agents in an international economics set up seems a priority to understand better some of the
most stubborn puzzles of international economics such as the Consumption-Real Exchange Rate anomaly
(Kollmann-Backus-Smith puzzle). Limited participation in asset markets is a promising way to help resolve
some asset pricing puzzle as shown in particular in the context of a closed economy by Guvenen (2009).
Some steps have been taken by Kollmann (2009) and by Coeurdacier et al. (2010) in particular to
introduce limited participation in an open economy set up. Furthermore, much like the closed economy
macroeconomics literature, the modeling of financial intermediaries is a key missing building bloc in our
current DSGE models of the open economy. As the literature stands, we have nothing interesting to say
about leveraged intermediaries for example and their role in the international transmission of shocks.
   If we want to take a more detailed microeconomic view of the home bias, we have to recognize the large
heterogeneity of investment strategies both at the household level and at the fund manager level. A large
share of household investment is not direct portfolio holdings but intermediated. In the US, according to
the Survey of Consumer Finance (see Polkovnichenko (2004)), the share of equity held indirectly by
households through mutual funds, pension funds or other investment vehicles has risen from about 46% in
1989 to close to 62% in 2001. The Federal Reserve Bulletin (2009) indicates that between 2004 and
2007, the fraction of families holding publicly traded stocks rose to 51.1 percent. Among families that held
equity, either directly or indirectly, in 2007, ownership through a tax-deferred retirement account was most
common (84% of families), followed by direct holdings of stocks (35% of families), direct holdings of pooled
investment funds (21% of families), and managed investment accounts (8% of families). If we take a different
angle and look at the total amount of equity, 37.8 percent was held in tax-deferred retirement accounts, 33.6
percent as directly held stocks, 22.1 percent as directly held pooled investment funds, and 6.5 percent as
other managed assets. Strikingly if we look at the families holding stocks directly 36% of them hold only
1 stock and 48% hold between 2 and 9 stocks. The typical portfolio of households who participate in the
financial market is therefore very dichotomic: it contains a very small number of stocks, which are directly
held and a more diversified stock portfolio, which is usually managed by a third party. It is still a major
challenge for the existing literature to reproduce such a dual investment strategy at the household level. It
is even more of a challenge to reproduce it together with the great heterogeneity in investment strategies
at the fund level that we documented in Graph 1. The endogenous information acquisition literature (see
Van Nieuwerburg and Veldkamp (2010)) seems promising since in the presence of increasing returns
to information acquisition, it is possible to generate concentrated portfolios, a prediction which accords well
with the directly held portion of household equities. It should however probably be enriched with a model
making explicit delegated portfolio management strategies. A first step in this direction has been taken
by Mondria and Dziuda (2010). In their paper, asymmetrically informed households delegate their



                                                      45
investment decisions to fund managers of stochastic abilities. Since domestic households know more about
home country assets, they are better able to evaluate the performance of managers investing in home assets.
Hence more highly skilled managers, who benefit from transparency, are more likely to operate in domestic
markets. Therefore a small information asymmetry at the household level is able to generate home bias due
to the endogenous decision of skilled fund managers to operate in the domestic market. This framework
however cannot generate the heterogeneous distribution of investment strategies observed at the fund level.
It also does not have anything to say regarding the determinants of funds mandates and benchmarks. It
would be interesting to explain the determinants of the distribution of funds mandates across countries for
example, as it seems to exhibit considerable heterogeneity. It is likely that the literature on endogenous
information acquisition and delegated investment still misses an important component of the incentives of
fund managers, which could be marketing and product differentiation. Some more data on the number
and type of distinct funds owned by each households would be necessary to fully understand the trade-offs.
As pointed out in Veldkamp (2010) (p101), investors may want to concentrate their portfolios with one
fund manager if efficient pricing of investmnet services lead to quantity discount as in Admati Pfleiderer
(1990). There is little doubt however that understanding better delegated investment strategies and the
constraints and incentives of fund managers would be an important step to study the extent and time series
variation of international risk sharing, the international transmission of financial shocks and the propagation
of crises. Recent work by Pavlova and Rigobon (2009) is a first step in that direction: they show
how regulatory constraints and investment mandates can generate financial contagion through cross-border
portfolio decisions. More generally, a promising avenue of research would be to study optimal regulatory or
taxation policies in environment featuring endogenous asymmetric information or principal agent problems
due to delegated investment.
