                                              ABSTRACT

The growth of the private equity industry has spurred concerns about its potential impact on the economy
more generally. This analysis looks across nations and industries to assess the impact of private equity
on industry performance. Industries where PE funds have invested in the past five years have grown
more quickly in terms of productivity and employment. There are few significant differences between
industries with limited and high private equity activity. It is hard to find support for claims that economic
activity in industries with private equity backing is more exposed to aggregate shocks. The results
using lagged private equity investments suggest that the results are not driven by reverse causality.
These patterns are not driven solely by common law nations such as the United Kingdom and United
States, but also hold in Continental Europe.

    1. INTRODUCTION


        In response to the global financial crisis that began in 2007, governments worldwide are

rethinking their approach to regulating financial institutions. Among the financial institutions

that have fallen under the gaze of regulators have been private equity (PE) funds (see, for

instance, European Commission [2009]). There are many open questions regarding the economic

impact of PE funds, many of which cannot be definitively answered until the aftermath of the

buyout boom of the mid-2000s can be fully assessed.


        This paper addresses one of these open questions, by examining the impact of PE

investments across 20 industries in 26 major nations between 1991 and 2007. We focus on

whether PE investments in an industry affect aggregate growth and cyclicality. In particular, we

look at the relationship between the presence of PE investments and the growth rates of

productivity, employment and capital formation. For our productivity and employment measures,

we find that PE investments are associated with faster growth. One natural concern is that this

growth may have come at the expense of greater cyclicality in the industry, which would

translate into greater risks for investors and stakeholders. Thus, we also examine whether

economic fluctuations are exacerbated by the presence of PE investments, but we find little

evidence that this is the case.


        Throughout our analysis we measure the growth rate in a particular industry relative to

the average growth rate across countries in the same year. In addition, we use country and

industry fixed effects, so that the impact of PE activity is measured relative to the average

performance in a given country, industry, and year. For instance, if the Swedish steel industry

has more PE investment than the Finnish one, we examine whether the steel industry in these
                                               1
two countries performs better or worse over time relative to the average performance of the steel

industry across all countries in our sample, and whether the variations in performance over the

industry cycles are more or less dramatic.


       Overall, we are unable to find evidence supporting the detrimental effects of PE

investments on industries:


   •   Industries where PE funds have been active in the past five years grow more rapidly than

       other sectors, whether measured using total production, value added, or employment. In

       industries with PE investments, there are few significant differences between industries

       with a low and high level of PE activity.

   •   Activity in industries with PE backing appears to be no more volatile in the face of

       industry cycles than in other industries, and sometimes less so. The reduced volatility is

       particularly apparent in employment.

   •   These patterns continue to hold when we focus on the impact of private equity in

       continental Europe, where concerns about these investments have been most often

       expressed.

   •   We believe it is unlikely that these results are driven by reverse causality, i.e. PE funds

       selecting to invest in industries that are growing faster and/or are less volatile. The results

       are essentially unchanged if we only consider the impact of PE investments made

       between five and two years earlier on industry performance.


       It is important to note that there are a number of limitations to this analysis. First, the

question of economic growth and volatility is only one of many questions that regulators must

grapple with when assessing the impact of PE investment. Second, we hope to deal more fully
                                                   2
with the question of reverse causality in subsequent versions of the study. Finally, it is still too

early to assess the consequences of the economic conditions in 2008 and 2009, a period where

the decrease of investment and absolute volume of distressed private equity-backed assets was

far greater than in earlier cycles.


        The plan of this study is as follows: In the second section, we develop the hypotheses to

be tested. The third section describes the construction of the dataset and the results are presented

in Section 4. The final section concludes.


    2. INDUSTRY PERFORMANCE AND PRIVATE EQUITY


        There are several alternative perspectives that can be offered as to how PE investments

can affect the prospects of an industry. In this section, we begin by reviewing the suggestions

about changes regarding overall performance; we then turn to hypotheses regarding the

interaction between economic cycles and PE investments.


    A. The impact of PE investments on industry performance


        Our initial examination focuses on the performance of industries where PE funds have

been active relative to industries where these investors have not been active.


        A central hypothesis since Jensen [1989] has been that private equity has the ability to

improve the operations of firms. By closely monitoring managers, restricting free cash flow

through the use of leverage and incentivizing managers with equity, it is argued, private equity-

backed firms are able to improve operations in the firms they back. In this article, Jensen

suggested that these leveraged buyouts (LBOs) may not only affect the bought-out firm itself but


                                                 3
may also increase competitive pressure and force competitors to improve their own operations.

John et al. [1992] present supporting empirical evidence that the threat of takeover serves as a

spur for firms to voluntarily undertake restructurings.


          The claim that private equity-backed firms have improved operations has been supported

by a number of empirical studies, which focus on the effects on the individual private equity-

backed companies. Kaplan [1989] examines changes in accounting performance for 76 large

management buyouts of public companies between 1980 and 1986. He shows that in the three

years after the transaction operating income, cash flow and market value all increase. He argues

that these increases reflect the impact of improved incentives rather than layoffs. (Looking at

more recent deals on US public-to-private transactions, however, Guo et al. [2009] find only

weak evidence that gains in operating performance of bought-out firms exceed those of their

peers.)    Muscarella and Vetsuypens [1990] examine 72 “reverse LBOs” (RLBOs), that is,

companies taken private which went public once again. These firms experienced a dramatic

increase in profitability, which they argue is a reflection of cost reductions.


          More recent studies have used large samples and a variety of performance measures to

more directly assess whether private equity makes a difference in the management of the firms in

which they invest. Bloom et al. [2009] survey over 4,000 firms in Asia, Europe and the US to

assess their management practices. They show that private equity-backed firms are on average

the best-managed ownership group in the sample, though they cannot rule out the possibility

these firms were better managed before the PE transaction. Davis et al. [2009] compare all US-

based manufacturing establishments that received PE investments between 1980 and 2005 with




                                                  4
similar establishments that did not receive PE investments. 1 They show that private equity-

backed firms experienced a substantial productivity growth advantage (about two percentage

points) in the two years following the transaction. About two-thirds of this differential is due to

improved productivity among continuing establishments of the firms. Cao and Lerner [2009]

examine the three- and five-year stock performance of 496 RLBOs between 1980 and 2002.

RLBOs appear to consistently outperform other IPOs and the stock market as a whole. Large

RLBOs that are backed by PE firms with more capital under management perform better, while

quick flips – when PE firms sell off an investment soon after acquisition – underperform.


       These findings might suggest that we would see superior performance for PE firms,

regardless of the economic conditions. Moreover, if PE firms represent a significant fraction of

the activity in certain industries (and tabulations in several countries, including the US and UK,

suggest that this is the case), there may also be a positive effect at the industry level.

Investigating the industry level also allows us to capture the ‘contagion’ effects arising if

improvements in bought-out firms spur their competitors to improve. This effect is not captured

by studies focusing on the individual portfolio companies.


       While there has been little systematic evidence regarding the deleterious effects of private

equity on firms and industries, critics have pointed to case studies that illustrate negative

consequences of transactions. For instance, Rasmussen [2008] points to the buyout of Britain’s

Automobile Association, which led to large-scale layoffs and service disruptions while

generating substantial profits for the transaction’s sponsor, Permira. The Service Employees

International Union has prepared a series of studies (for example, 2007, 2008) showing the

                                                  5
deleterious effect that excessive leverage, cost-cutting and poor managerial decisions by PE

groups can have on firms and industries through case studies such as Hawaiian Telecom, Intelsat,

KB Toys and TDC. These cases suggest that the impact of private equity on industries may be

more negative than suggested by the previous studies.


   B. The impact of economic cycles


       Numerous practitioner accounts over the years have suggested that the PE industry is

highly cyclical, with periods of easy financing availability (often in response to the successes of

earlier transactions) leading to an acceleration of deal volume, greater use of leverage, higher

valuations, and ultimately more troubled investments (akin to the well-known ‘corn-hog cycle’

in agricultural economics).


       This pattern is corroborated in several academic studies. Axelson et al. [2009] document

the cyclical use of leverage in buyouts. Using a sample of 1,157 transactions completed by major

groups worldwide between 1985 and 2008, they show that the level of leverage is driven by the

cost of debt, rather than the more industry- and firm-specific factors that affect leverage in

publicly traded firms. The availability of leverage is also strongly associated with higher

valuation levels. Kaplan and Stein [1993] documented that the 1980s buyout boom saw an

increase in valuations, reliance on public debt and incentive problems (for example, parties

cashing out at the time of transaction). Moreover, in the transactions done at the market peak, the

outcomes were disappointing: of the 66 largest buyouts completed between 1986 and 1988, 38%

experienced financial distress, which they define as default or an actual or attempted

restructuring of debt obligations due to difficulties in making payments. 27% actually did default

on debt repayments, often in conjunction with a Chapter 11 filing. Kaplan and Schoar [2005] and
                                                6
other papers provide indirect supporting evidence, showing that the performance of funds is

negatively correlated with inflows into these funds. Private equity funds raised during periods of

high capital inflows – which are typically associated with market peaks – perform far worse than

their peers.


        These findings corroborate the suggestions that availability of financing impacts booms

and busts in the PE market. If firms completing buyouts at market peaks employ leverage

excessively, we may expect industries with heavy buyout activity to experience more intense

subsequent downturns. Moreover, the effects of this overinvestment would be exacerbated if PE

investments drive rivals, not backed by private equity, to aggressively invest and leverage

themselves. Chevalier [1995] shows that in regions with supermarkets receiving PE investments,

rivals responded by adding and expanding stores.


        An alternative perspective is suggested by some recent events in the PE industry, even

though it has not been articulated by economic theorists or explored empirically. This suggestion

is that private equity-backed firms may do better during downturns because their investors

constitute a concentrated shareholder base, which can continue to provide equity financing in a

way that might be difficult to arrange for other companies during downturns. To cite two recent

examples of ‘equity cures,’ Terra Firma made a number of investments in EMI, while Kraton

Polymers’ equity investors (Ripplewood and CCMP) did likewise during the recent recession. 2

This perspective would imply that private equity-backed companies may actually outperform

their peers during downturns, as they have access to equity financing that other firms did not

have. The presence of liquid PE funds as shareholders may lead to fewer failures in difficult

economic conditions.


       A related argument, originally proposed by Jensen [1989], is that the high levels of debt

in PE transactions force firms to respond earlier and more forcefully to negative shocks to their

business. As a result, private equity-backed firms may be forced to adjust their operations more

rapidly at the beginning of an industry downturn, enabling them to better weather a recession.

Even if some private equity-backed firms eventually end up in financial distress, their underlying

operations may thus be in better shape than their peers. This facilitates an efficient restructuring

of their capital structure and lowers the deadweight costs on the economy. Consistent with this

argument, Andrade and Kaplan [1998] study 31 distressed leveraged buyouts from the 1980s that

subsequently became financially distressed, and found that the value of the firms post-distress

was slightly higher than the value before the buyout, suggesting that even the leveraged buyouts

that were hit most severely by adverse shocks added some economic value.


       Finally, the structural differences between PE funds and other financial institutions may

make them less susceptible to industry shocks. A major source of concern for financial

institutions is the so-called ‘run on the bank’ phenomenon. Runs occur when holders of short-

term liabilities, for example, depositors or repo counterparties, simultaneously refuse to provide

additional financing and demand their money back. Other versions of this phenomenon arise

when companies simultaneously draw down lines of credit, hedge fund investors simultaneously

ask for redemptions of their investments, or a freeze in the market for commercial paper prevents

structured investment vehicles (SIVs) from rolling over short-term commercial paper. It is

unlikely that PE investments create dangers through this mechanism. Private equity funds are


                                                 8
typically prevented from borrowing themselves, and the funds’ only claimants are their limited

partners (LPs), which are typically bound by 10-year lock-up agreements. Hence, the funds have

no short-term creditors that can run. By way of contrast, extensive loans are provided to the

individual portfolio companies. However, these loans are typically made by a concentrated set of

lenders, and are without recourse to other portfolio companies or the fund generally. Hence, an

individual creditor’s ability to be repaid is largely unaffected by the actions of other creditors,

mitigating the incentive to run.


   3. DATA SOURCES AND SAMPLE CONSTRUCTION


       To analyze how PE investments affect industries, we combine two datasets, one

containing information about PE investments compiled by Capital IQ, and another with industry

activity and performance across the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development

(OECD) member countries included in the OECD’s Structural Analysis Database (STAN).


       PE investment sample: We use the Capital IQ database to construct a base sample of PE

transactions. The base sample contains all private placements and M&A transactions in Capital

IQ where the list of acquirers includes (at least) one investment firm that has a reported

investment interest in one of the following stages: Seed/startup, Early venture, Emerging growth,

Growth capital, Bridge, Turnaround, Middle market, Mature, Buyout, Mid-venture, Late venture,

Industry consolidation, Mezzanine/subdebt, Incubation, Recapitalization, or PIPES.


       From the base sample, we select all M&A transactions classified as ‘leveraged buyout,’

‘management buyout,’ or ‘going private’ that were announced between January 1986 and

December 2007 and where the target company is located in an OECD country included in the


                                                9
STAN database. We exclude transactions that were announced but not yet completed as well as

transactions that did not involve a financial investor (for example, a buyout led and executed by

the management team itself was excluded).


        This results in a sample of about 14,300 transactions, involving 13,100 distinct firms.

Since we only have information about the deal size for 50% of our transactions (though more of

the larger transactions), we impute missing deal sizes by constructing fitted values from a

regression of deal size on fixed effects for country, investment year and target industry. Using

the imputed transaction sizes, we generate aggregate country-year-industry measures of PE

volume in the form of summed deal sizes.


        Industry data: The STAN database provides industry data across OECD countries

compiled from national statistics offices. It contains economic information at the country, year

and industry level. Thus, a typical observation would be the German transport equipment

industry in 1999. STAN includes measures of productivity, employment and capital formation,

as described in Table 1. Throughout this paper, we focus on the following measures of industry

activity:


    •   Production (gross output), the value of goods and/or services produced in a year, whether

        sold or stocked, in current prices.

    •   Value added represents the industry’s contribution to national GDP, i.e. output net of

        materials purchased. While the methodology for constructing this measure differs across

        nations, our focus here is on differences across time, which should reduce the effect of

        national differences in the measure.



                                               10
   •   Labor costs, which comprise wages and salaries of employees paid by producers as well

       as supplements such as contributions to social security, private pensions, health

       insurance, life insurance and similar schemes.

   •   Number of employees, which is the traditional measure of employment, excluding self-

       employed and unpaid family members working in the business.

   •   Gross capital formation is acquisitions, less disposals, of new tangible assets, as well as

       such intangible assets as mineral exploration and computer software. This variable is the

       closest aggregate to capital expenditures. The two capital stock measures are indicators of

       the value of all capital equipment held. The gross stock measure does not factor in

       depreciation, while the net stock does reflect write-downs.

   •   Consumption of fixed capital measures the reduction in the value of fixed assets used in

       production resulting from physical deterioration or normal obsolescence.


       Mapping Capital IQ and STAN industries: Industries in the STAN database are classified

by the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) code. To link these data to the

industry-aggregated PE activity, we matched the ISIC codes with Capital IQ’s industry

classifications. We used the existing mapping from Capital IQ industry classification into SIC

codes, and then used the existing matching between SIC and ISIC industries. The mapping of

Capital IQ industry classifications to SIC codes includes only matches for the most detailed

levels of the Capital IQ classifications. This poses a problem for more aggregated industries for

which Capital IQ does not provide a match to a SIC and ultimately to ISIC. When the Capital IQ

target industry is at a more aggregated industry level, we mapped all four-digit SIC codes that

belong to the sub-categories of the industry classification of Capital IQ. In these cases, we had

multiple four-digit SIC codes for a single Capital IQ industry. In some of the transactions all of
                                               11
the four-digit SICs corresponded to the same ISIC industry classification, creating a one-to-one

mapping. In cases where the four-digit SIC codes corresponded to different industries in the ISIC

scheme, we considered the particular deals and selected the most suitable industry. In 390

transactions, we were not able to determine with certainty the appropriate match in ISIC, and

those transactions were dropped, leaving us with 13,910 PE transactions with ISIC

classifications. Finally, we grouped ISIC sub-industries to balance PE activity across industries.

Table 2 presents the distribution of deals across industries.


       This results in a sample of 11,135 country-industry-year observations during the years

1986 to 2007. For each country, industry and year, we measure PE activity as the volume of PE

deals occurring in this country and industry during the previous five years. In particular, an

observation is a PE industry if it had at least one PE investment in one of those five years. (This

definition was motivated by holding periods reported by Strömberg [2008]).              With this

definition, we can only compare activity during 1991 to 2007, leaving us with 8,596 country-

industry-year observations.


       Tables 2, 3 and 4 present the distribution of deals across industries, years and countries.

In each table, we first present the number of observations (an observation is a country-industry-

year pair) and the number of those that were PE industries, as defined above. We then present

the number of deals, transaction volume and the transaction volume including the imputed sizes

of deals with missing information.


       Several patterns are visible from Tables 2 through 4:




                                                 12
    •   The heavy representation of buyouts as a share of economic activity in traditional

        industries, such as ‘Textiles, textile products, leather,’ ‘Machinery and equipment,’ ‘Pulp,

        paper, paper products, printing,’ ‘Electrical and optical equipment,’ and ‘Chemical,

        rubber, plastics and fuel products’.

    •   The acceleration in buyout activity, first modestly during the late 1980s and then

        especially in the mid-2000s.

    •   The greater level of activity in a handful of traditional hubs for PE funds, including the

        United States, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. 3


        In Table 5, we compare the changes in the industry measures over time for PE and non-

PE industries. The PE industries grow more quickly in terms of output and value added, as well

in terms of employment. But for gross fixed capital formation, the PE industries have a slower

growth rate.


    4. ANALYSIS


        A. Industry performance


        We begin by examining the relationship between various industry characteristics and the

role of private equity in the industry. In each case, we use the industry-country-year as an

observation, and the explanatory variable is the relative growth rate along a given dimension (for

example, employment). This adjusted rate is computed by subtracting the growth rate

experienced in that industry, country and year from the average growth rate across countries in

to domicile there for tax reasons, even though the bulk of their operations are elsewhere. As a
result, we omit Luxembourg from the analyses below.
                                                13
that same industry and year. Demeaning the growth rate in this way is largely equivalent to

including year-industry fixed effects, but it allows for an easier interpretation of the estimated

parameters.


       We employ several specifications. First, we look at specifications that include controls

for each year, industry and country. For the exogenous variable, we include an indicator which

denotes whether the industry is a PE industry or not, using the definition above. This definition

does not use the imputed deal values, since it only depends on the presence of PE deals. Second,

we use two indicators to capture whether an industry is a low or high PE industry. A low PE

industry (PE Low) is a PE industry where the fraction of total imputed PE investments divided

by total production (both normalized to 2008 USD) is smaller than the median (conditional on

having a non-zero level of PE investment). Empirically, this median is 0.61%. Correspondingly,

a high PE industry (PE High) is one where the fraction is greater than 0.61%. We also perform

the analysis dividing PE activity into quartiles to better measure the differential effects of

different activity levels. Third, we include dummies that are interactions between countries and

industries (Co-Ind FE). These controls allow us to more precisely capture national differences in

the industry dynamics: if there is any effect from a PE investment, it is because the growth rate is

fast during that specific period.


       The results in Table 6 indicate that industries with PE deals have significantly higher

growth rates of production and value added. For instance, in the first regression, the coefficient

of 0.906 implies that the total production of an average PE industry grows at an annual rate that

is 0.906% higher than a non-PE industry. (Table 5 reports that the mean growth rate is 5.9%.)

We report the significance of a statistical test for differences between high and low PE industries


                                                14
and differences between the four quartiles of PE activity (all reported as PEL = PEH). We find

few differences in total production between high and low PE industries, although the

specification using quartiles suggests that the positive effect may be particularly strong for

industries with an intermediate level of PE activity. Value added for an industry appears to be

increasing in the amount of PE activity, with the differences between high and low PE industries

being statistically and economically significant.


       One concern is the direction of causality. It is possible that PE investors pick industries

that are about to start growing and our results may reflect this industry choice rather than the

causal effect of the investments on the industry. To mitigate this concern, we change our

definition of the PE industry measure to only include investments during the period from two to

five years prior to the observation, called the twice-lagged measure (the original PE measure

included all five years prior to the observation). The results are reported in Table 7. We find that

the results are very similar, indicating that the effect that we find is unlikely to be driven by PE

investors entering countries and industries where they expect stronger immediate growth.


       Table 8 considers measures of employment. PE industries appear to grow significantly

faster in terms of labor costs and the number of employees. The annual growth rate of total labor

cost is 0.5 to 1.4 percentage points greater for PE industries, and the number of employees grows

at an annual rate that is 0.4 to 1.0 percentage points greater. These findings are particularly

surprising, since a common concern is that PE investors act aggressively to reduce costs with

little concern for employees. This concern is not necessarily inconsistent with our results.

Despite initial employment reductions at private equity-backed firms, the greater subsequent

growth in total production, observed in Table 6, may lead to subsequent employment growth in


                                                15
the industry overall. Considering the specifications with PE activity quartiles, industries with

more PE activity appear to have more rapid growth of total labor costs, but the growth rate of the

number of employees is fastest in industries with more moderate levels of PE activity.

Regardless of the level of PE activity, however, the PE industries’ growth rates of labor costs and

employment always exceed the rates for non-PE industries.


       As above, we are concerned about the direction of causality, and Table 9 repeats the

analysis using the twice-lagged PE measure. The magnitudes in Tables 8 and 9 are largely

similar, suggesting that the effect we find is not mainly driven by PE investors picking industries

with expectations of immediate employment growth.


       Finally, in Table 10 we examine measures of fixed capital formation and consumption of

fixed capital. These measures appear much more volatile than the production and employment

measures, making it difficult to discern any relationship between PE investments and capital

formation.


       B. Cyclical patterns


       We next turn to analyzing how private equity relates to industry cycles. For each industry

and year, we calculate the average growth by averaging the growth rate of the productivity and

employment measures across countries. This measures the annual aggregate shock in these

variables (for example, production output in the steel industry fell by 2% on average in 2002

across the nations in our sample). We then investigate whether PE industries are more or less

exposed to this shock by including the PE measure interacted with this average growth measure

in the regressions. If PE industries are more sensitive to economic conditions, the coefficient on


                                                16
the interaction term is positive: during upturns, these industries grow faster and during

downturns they decline faster. A negative coefficient indicates a lower exposure to the aggregate

shock than industries without PE investments. Once again, we use country and industry fixed

effects, as well as country-industry fixed effect interactions.


       In Tables 11 and 12, we examine the impact on production and employment. In the first

table, the interaction terms are negative, which implies that PE industries are less sensitive to

industry shocks. To interpret the coefficients, using the estimates in the first regression in Table

12, if an industry on average experiences a 5% increase in total labor costs in a given year (the

aggregate shock), a PE industry will experience, on average, a 5.576% increase (5% + 1.591% +

5% x -0.203 = 5.576%). Conversely, following a 5% decrease in the wage bill, a PE industry will

only experience, on average, a 2.394% decline (–5% + 1.591% + (–5%) x –0.203 = –2.394%).

Hence, an aggregate swing from +5% to –5% (10% total difference) in aggregate growth rates

translates into a swing from 5.6% to –2.4% (8% total difference) in the growth rates for PE

industries. Both for the productivity and employment analyses, the coefficients are significantly

negative in the simple specification and most of the coefficients in the employment analysis

remain statistically significant when high and low PE industries are included separately. Overall,

it appears that some PE activity translates into an industry whose employment changes less than

average, but industries with a larger amount of PE activity may follow a growth pattern that is

closer to that of the industry as a whole.


       C. Geographic patterns


       One concern is that the impact of private equity is different in continental Europe than in

the United States and United Kingdom. Not only is the level of PE activity higher in the US and
                                                  17
UK than in most other nations, but the industry is more established, having begun in these two

nations. We thus repeat the analysis, looking at US and UK versus Continental Europe

(investments in Japan and South Korea are excluded from these analyses).


        We report the results in Tables 13 and 14, which repeat the base specifications reported in

Tables 6 and 8. All the main effects remain largely unchanged for the Continental Europe

sample. The coefficients in the US and UK sample are generally not statistically significant but

they are not statistically different from the coefficients for the Continental Europe sample either.

This probably reflects the small size of the US and UK sample and the resulting large standard

errors: for productivity, value added and labor costs the coefficients are smaller than in

Continental Europe; for total employment the coefficient is larger.


        D. Addressing causality concerns


        One natural concern relates to the interpretation of these results. While it appears that

private equity is associated with more rapid growth at an industry level in our analyses, it is

natural to wonder which way the causation runs. Does the presence of private equity lead to

better performance, or do PE investors invest where they (correctly) anticipate industries will

grow?


        We respond to this question in several ways. First, we look at PE investments during the

five years before the measured growth. Second, as discussed above, we have also narrowed our

measure to only include deals in the second through fifth year prior to the investment. If our

effects are due to PE investors anticipating growth, they would have to be quite prescient.




                                                18
       In subsequent versions of this paper, we will also attempt to address this concern using an

instrumental variables technique. To identify exogenous variation, we may use the size of the

private pension pool in the nation and year, expressed as a percentage of GDP. This is similar in

spirit to other papers in the venture capital literature, such as Kortum and Lerner [2000] and

Mollica and Zingales [2007]. In the nations with larger pension pools, domestic PE funds are

more likely to raise capital and invest it locally. This is an attractive instrumental variable,

because pension policy is typically driven by broader socio-economic considerations, and not by

the relative health of the local PE industry.


   5. CONCLUSIONS


       The growth of the PE industry has spurred concerns about its potential impact on the

economy more generally. In this analysis, we look across nations and industries to assess the

impact of private equity on industry performance.


       The key results are, first, that industries where PE funds have invested in the past five

years have grown more quickly, using a variety of measures. There are few significant

differences between industries with limited and high PE activity. Second, it is hard to find

support for claims that economic activity in industries with PE backing is more exposed to

aggregate shocks. The results using lagged PE investments suggest that the results are not driven

by reverse causality. Finally, these patterns are not driven solely by common law nations such as

the United Kingdom and United States, but also hold in Continental Europe.


       These findings suggest a number of avenues for future research. First, it would be

interesting to look at finer data on certain critical aspects of industry performance, such as the


                                                19
rates of layoffs, plant closings and openings, and product and process innovations. Second, it is

important to better understand the mechanisms by which the presence of private equity-backed

firms affects their peers. While Chevalier’s [1995] study of the supermarket industry during the

1980s was an important first step, much more remains to be explored here. Finally, we are only

able to look backwards in this analysis. The buyout boom of the mid 2000s was so massive, and

the subsequent crash in activity so dramatic, that the consequences may have been substantially

different from other economic cycles (see Kosman [2009]). The impact of the recent cycle will

be an important issue to explore in the years to come.

Table 4: Distribution of deals by country The sample consists of 8,596 country-industry-year
observations of OECD countries between 1991 and 2007. Observations is the number of observations in
each country. PE industries contains the number of observations classified as PE industries. An industry
is a PE industry if it had at least one PE investment during the previous five years. Deals is the number of
deals, and Deal volume is the combined size of the deals (normalized to 2008 US$ billions). Imputed deal
volume imputes the size for deals with missing size information.

Table 5: Industry growth variables The sample consists of 8,596 country-industry-year observations of OECD countries between 1991 and
2007. An industry is considered as a PE industry if it had at least a single PE deal in the previous five years. P-value provides the p-value of a test
of equality of the means of PE and non-PE industries. See Table 1 for variable definitions.

Table 6: PE activity and growth rate of productivity The table contains OLS regression coefficients. An observation is a country-industry-year
pair. The endogenous variable is the deviation of the annual growth rate of production or value added (as defined by OECD) relative to the average
rate in the same industry and year. The exogenous variables are an indicator for positive PE activity over the previous five years at the country-
industry level (PE), indicators for whether the measured PE activity is below or above the median activity level (PE Low and PE High), and
indicators for quartiles. The omitted base category is no PE activity over the previous five years. The regressions contain industry, country, and
country-industry (Co-Ind) fixed effects as indicated. Standard errors are calculated with clustering at the country-year level and presented in
parenthesis. PEL = PEH contains the significance level of a Wald test of equality of the PE Low and PE High coefficients or the quartile
coefficients. Statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels are indicated by ***, ** and *, respectively.

Table 7: Twice-lagged PE activity and growth rate of productivity The table contains OLS regression coefficients. An observation is a
country-industry-year pair. The endogenous variable is the deviation of the annual growth rate of production or value added (as defined by OECD)
relative to the average rate in the same industry and year. The exogenous variables are an indicator for positive PE activity over the previous four
years -2 to -5, i.e. not including the year previous to the year where the growth in the endogenous variable is measured (PE), indicators for whether
the measured PE activity is below or above the median activity level (PE Low and PE High) and indicators for quartiles. The omitted base
category is no PE activity. The regressions contain industry, country and country-industry (Co-Ind) fixed effects as indicated. Standard errors are
calculated with clustering at the country-year level and presented in parenthesis. PEL = PEH contains the significance level of a Wald test of
equality of the PE Low and PE High coefficients or the quartile coefficients. Statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels are indicated by

Table 10: PE activity and growth rate of capital formation The table contains OLS regression coefficients. An observation is a country-
industry-year pair. The endogenous variable is the deviation of the annual growth rate of gross fixed capital formation or consumption of fixed
capital (as defined by OECD) relative to the average rate in the same industry and year. The exogenous variables are an indicator for positive PE
activity over the previous four years -2 to -5, i.e. not including the year previous to the year where the growth in the endogenous variable is
measured (PE), indicators for whether the measured PE activity is below or above the median activity level (PE Low and PE High) and indicators
for quartiles. The omitted base category is no PE activity. The regressions contain industry, country and country-industry (Co-Ind) fixed effects as
indicated. Standard errors are calculated with clustering at the country-year level and presented in parenthesis. PEL = PEH contains the
significance level of a Wald test of equality of the PE Low and PE High coefficients or the quartile coefficients. Statistical significance at the 1%,
5% and 10% levels are indicated by ***, ** and *, respectively.

Table 13: International PE activity and productivity The table contains OLS regression coefficients. An observation is the annual growth rate
of the indicated productivity measure (subtracting its average growth rate across countries) at the country-industry-year level, separating US/UK
and Continental European countries. The exogenous variables are an indicator for positive PE activity over the previous five years at the country-
industry level (PE), and indicators for whether the measured PE activity is below or above the median activity level (PE Low and PE High). The
omitted base category is no PE activity over the previous five years. The regressions contain industry and country fixed effects as indicated.
Standard errors are robust and presented in parenthesis. PEL = PEH contains the significance level of a Wald test of equality of the PE Low and PE
High coefficients, and PEUS = PECON contains the significance level of a t-test of equality of the coefficients PE for US/UK and PE for Continental
Europe. Statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels are indicated by ***, ** and *, respectively.
