                                        ABSTRACT


        For an economic system not to exhibit debt neutrality it must be

        that changes in the time profile of lump—sum taxes redistributes

 rosources between heterogeneous        consumers.   OLD models have age heterogeneity

 necause of a positive birth rate.         Unless a bequest motive or child—to—parent

 gift motive is operative, a positive birth rate is sufficient for absence

 ji   debt   neutrality.    Uncertain   lifetimes are neither necessary   nor sufficient

 ,or absence of debt neutrality, with or without efficient           life insurance

 ,narkets.    Heterogeneous     survival probabilities   are a sufficient condition.

1.    Introduction

      The teacher—pupil     relationship between Jim Tobin and me by no means

came to an end after I          obtned   my Ph.D in 1975.        Like so many who

experienced his influence, I have tried to internalise his insistence that

we practice economics       as if it mattered beyond the narrow confines of the

profession.      No matter how formal and abstract our analyses may have to be

in order to answer certain complex substantive questions, our subject is

not an intellectual     game or a branch of pure logic.      It is a potentially

powerful tool for understanding and influencing the real world and the

lives   of many who may not even be aware       of the existence of an academic

discipline called economics and its practitioners.

      At the methodological level, I have become convinced more and more of

the   correctness of his view that representative agent models make for

uninteresting economics.       Robinson Crusoe didn't need much economic theory

before Friday arrived,        After that he needed game theory.         No economic

policy issue of any significance can be addressed satisfactorily without

introducing some measure of heterogeneity among (depending on the issue>

consumers,     producers, workers, employers     or investors.      This poses a

serious problem for macroeconomics,      which approaches economic policy issues

using highly agggregative sequential general equilibrium models,           How much

disaggregation and        heterogeneity is    possible before     the   virtues   of

simplicity,     transparency and analytical tractability are lost completely?

      Many    potentially important kinds of      heterogeneity come      to   mind.

Consumers      can   have   heterogeneous    endowments   (including abilities),

etc.)    cc information         sets.      Producers      can    have different technologies,

tastes      cc    -information     sets.       In    this       paper    I   shall   ccnsider the

ccnsequences cf fcur kinds cf              ccnsujr.er    hetsrcgeneity for debt neutrality.
An economic system exhibits debt neutrality                     if,   given a program fot public

spending on goods andservices over time, the equilibrium of the economy is
not affected by a change in the pattern over time of lump—sum taxes, If
there is debt neutrality, e.g. the substitution of government borrowing
today for          taxation today (followed by such further changes in the
                 lump—sum

path of future lump—sum taxes as may be required to maintain the solvency
of the public sector) does not affact current and future private
consumption,           capital formation    and.    interest rates,           The four kinds     of
consumer heterogeneity ace age,                 life     expectancy,         time preference and
elasticity        of    intectemporal   substitution.             The    overlapping generations

(PLC)   model is the natural vehicle for this kind of modeling as it is

designed spetifcally to handle the "entry" and "exit" of consumers,

      The issue of debt neutrality is central to an understanding both of the

short—run cyclical stabilization role of fiscal policy and of the long—run

effect of fiscal and finamcial              policy on the path of the capital stock,

(See e.g.    the contributions in Ferguson (1964) and Modigliani (1961),)                        It

therefore comes as no surprise that Jim Tobin studied this subject early in

his   career (Tobin (1952)) and returned co it time and again (e.g. Tobin

(1976, 1979,1980)),            1 was fortunate to be involved in two collaborations

with him on this subject matter (Buiter and Tobin (1979), Tobin and Butter

(1980)).

      There is no better way to introduce the key issue than by quoting from

one of Jim's key writings on the subject.
                                                       —3—


       'How is it possible that society merely by the device of incurring a

       debt to itself can deceive itself into believing that it is wealthier?

       Do nor the additional taxes which are necessary to carry the interest

       charges reduce the value of other components of private wealth?                               There


       certainly must be effects in this direction." (Tobin (1952), p.11?).

       The       central    issue    can be phrased as follows:                 when does,     (at   given

prices and interest rates)              ,     s:poning       lump—sum taxation while maintaining

public sector solvency change binding constraints faced by consumers1 alive

today in such a way that aggregate consumption changes? The answer is that

postponing lump—sum taxation must achieve                        one    or both of the following.

First,       it   redistributes       (lifetime)   resources         among "isolated" heterogeneous

survivors,          i.e.   among households alive in the period when the taxes are

cut.     Second,         it redistributes       (lifetime)     resources between survivors            (who

may be           homogeneous) and overlapping new entrants                       from whom they are

"isolated"         (and who may also be homogeneous),                 i.e. households that are born

after the period during which taxes are cut but whose lifespan overlapa

with that of households alive when the taxes are cut.                                "Isolation"     here

means        a    situation without           interior solutions          for    gifts    or bequests,

intertemporal            or a—temporal.         This can either be         the    result of egoistic

utility functions            (only own       liftime   consumption yields utility) or of zero

gift or bequest corner solutions despite altruistic utility functions.

       Absence of debt neutrality therefore requires that postponing lump—sum

taxation causes redistribution among heterogeneous households.

       The plan of the              remainder    of the paper is as follows.                  Section 2

reviews           some     important        features    of     the     2—period     OLG      model   with

intergenerational gift and bequest motives.                          It draws heavily on the recent

work of Kimball (l987a, b),                   which contains the first             (to my knowledge)

complete solution of the two—sided                     intergenerational         caring problem with
                                                   —4—


population growth and parthogenesis.                 This model has a positive birth rate

(the representative household born in any given period is assursed to have

at least one ohilf) and a finite (in this oass a 2—period)                    lifetime,        i.e. a

zero probability of death at the end of the first period and a lCD per rent

probability of death             at the   end of the aerond period.           Debt reutrality

ooours       for      (small)   changes   in the     pattern of borrowing and             lump—sun
taxation when           the equilibrium is one with an operative intergenerational
gift or        bequest motive (i.e.          with positive bequest or child—to—parent

gift)   .    If the      intergenerational    gift and bequest motives are non—operative

there       is no debt neucrslity as long as there            is a positive birth rste.           If

thete       is a zero birth rate,         we are of course bath in the repoeeantative

000suner model.            The representative oonsumer has a finite horizon, but this

doesnt mean she'll benefit from postponing                    taxes   as   there    are   no     new

antrents" (succeeding generations)                to whom (part of) the tax burden ran be

shiftef.

    If       th.ere    is a positive birth rate          the presence of debt neutrality

despiteheterogeneity when there is an operative intergeneoacional gift or
bequest motive can be attributed to the failure to achieve
intergenerational redistribution by postponing                 lump—sum    taxes,    Changes      in
official       involuntary      intergenerational transfers ars offset by rhanges                 in

private voluntary intergenerational               transfers   in the opposite direction,          as

long as the legal constraints that gifts and bequests cannot go negative do

not become binding.             Alternatively, the sequence of altruistically linked

successive            generations   can      be    interpreted   as    a    single        dynastic

representative consumer.            Absence of heterogeneity is the reason for debt

neutrality in this view.

Abel (l95), Weil (1987) and especially Kimball (1987a,b).

      Section      3   considers an OLG model without intergenerational                   gift and

bequest mot,'ies         but with       potentially infinite—lived consumers,             The birth

rate is       non—negative and there                 is   a   common age and time—independent

                         death     which can be           zero.    when there   is    a    positive
probability of

                        da:h, an efficient competitive life             insurance    or annuities
probability

market is assumed to exist.                'hen the utility function is time additive and

the   single period         :t:lity       function has constant elasticity of marginal

utility,      it   can be    shown        that   a   positive birth rate     is necessary and

sufficient for           absence        of debt neutrality.          Uncertain lifetimes         (or

productivity growth)             do not     destroy debt neutrality when there             is zero

birth rate.            Note that    in this model with its uniform death rate,                  and

productivity growth rate,2 age is the only form of household heterogeneity.

A zero birth rate destroys this one form of heterogeneity.                           This section

draws on the work of Yaari                (1965), 8lanchard (1985), 'Jeil (1985), Frenkel

and Razin (1986), Abel (1987) and Buiter (1988a,b).

      In Section 4 the perfect capital market assumption is relaxed.                        I first

consider the case of a complete absence of life insurance markets.                          As long

as    there    is no       consumer heterogeneity, however,              this capital market

imperfection is no independent               source of absence of debt neutrality.               (In

quite   a different context               a similar point has         been made by Yotsuzuka

(1987))

      When there is heterogeneity in death races, there will be absence of

debt neutrality even with a zero birth rate and perfect annuities markets.

Postponing         taxes    will        redistribute lifetime         resources      towards     the

households with the higher death rate (assuming                      the current     tax cuts and

later tax increases              fall    equally on all households alive at the                time,

independently of their              death rates).             These households have a higher
                                               —6—


marginal propenaity to           spend out      of   lifetime    resources.       Postponing

lump—sum    taxes therefore redistributes wealth from high savers to low
savers, boosting aggregate ronsumption.               Note   that heterogeneity through
different    time preference rates does not oause absence of debt neutrality

when there is a      corrcoon death   rate and a zero birth rate,           The reason is of

oourse that postponing uniform lump—sum taxes (i.e. taxes                    falling   equally

on    all
       alive, regardless of time preferente rates) does not redistribute
income between high and low time preference households as both kinds have

the same      life   expectancy.       Redistribution and heterogeneity are both
necessary for      absence of debt neutrality.

2,lns'er'sroblem
      The utility function of a representative member of the generation born

in period t is given by equation (1)             .
                                                     Utility     is additively separable

intergenerationally.

A    member of generation t derives utility directly from his own lifetime

consumption.       This is captured by    ug0u(c,c).            I shall refer to       ug0    as

the    egoistic utility of a member of generation t and to Wt as her total

utility.     Where there is no ambiguity the superscript and subscripts will

be omitted.     Each consumer lives for 2 periods.              Labour—leisure choice is

omitted,3      u     is    strictly concave,     increasing,     and twice continuously

differentiable.       It satisfies the Inada conditions.           Note that equation (I)

exhibits     direct       two—sided   intergenerational         altruism:     a   member      of

generation t cares          directly both sbout his parent1' and about his l+n

children.             For most of this section we consider the case of one or more

children,            ia. nt.      p is the discount rate applied to parental utility and

  that          appiJed to the utility of one's               children.         There are no crucial

modifications to the model if the consumer lives for N>2 periods and cares

directly about the 2(N—l) generations with whom he overlapa.5 All members

of all generations have identical egoistic and total utility functions.

      In the case of one—sided ntergenerational caring,                          ö>0 is required for

boundedness of the                utility functional        when the parent—to—child bequest

motive is the only one ((l+pyt                —   0) and      there    is no "last generation" in

finite time'             p>O is required for boundedness of the utility functional

when the child—to—parent gift motive is the                           only one     ((1+6)—i- —   0)   and

there     is no "first generation"          a finite number of periods in the past.                    As

shown in Carmichael (1979)                 and Buiter (1980)            and     recently in Kimball

(l987a,b),            stronger conditions    that p>O and ó>0 are required to obtain a

sensible objective functional with two—sided caring.

      t+l        is to be         interpreted as the average total               utility of the       n-s-I


children of the member of generation t,                     je.

is,     however,          consistent with         a    "the    more,      the     merrier"   view      of

intergenerational caring by reinterpreting l-s-& in the way suggested below:

       A member     of generation 0              is assumed not      to care directly about                 her n

siblings.        She    will of oourse oare indirectly about her siblings (and about
more     distant       relatives         of the saae generation)                ro       the   extent that her

parent (and through them aore remote ancestors)                         do.

      Kimball      (l987a, Appendix D), in an argument that is both ingenious                                 and

involved for the case of more than one child                           (n>O)         ,   shows how the total

utility of a member of generation                    t,    W can be     expressed as a function of
the    egoistic utilities                of all    relatives      (contemporaries,               ancestors and

descendants).                        is the egoistic utility of the                      ith relative of type

Restriction            (c) is a necessary condition for dynamic         consistency of choice

across generations. Restriction (b) is necessary e.g. to rule out forms of

dynamic       inconsistency        in models with more than two overlapping generations

in which          grandparents overlap with their grandchildren.              Restrictions (d)

and (e) assert that the indirect concern for very distant ancestors and

descendants should vanish.

    These restrictions imply that

    If    óp,          this implies the need for an intergenerational discount rate of

over 100 per cent!                Equation (4) is equivalent to op>l,            the conditions

given in Buiter (1980) for well—behaved steady—state utility.

          is the total bequest left in the second period of his life by the

th   member of generation t to his l+n children.                  The bequest is assumed to

be shared equally among the children.                   G÷1    is the gift given by the      th
child (j—O,l,.., l+n)      born       in period t+l to his parent.           Wt   is    the real


wage earned while young.          Each worker—consumer only works during the first

period of his life and suppfi           s    labour inelastically during that period.           A

lump sum    per   capita tax or transfer is paid (received)             during one's youth,

r,      and during old age,                 rt÷l is the one—period real interest rate

established in period      t.    Equation (7) will hold as a strict equality,

     Note that equation         (7)   does not include gifts to siblings,               to more

distant lateral relatives (cousins,              etc.)     or to more distant (non—lineal)

relatives in generations t—l and t+l.               Kimball (1987a) shows      (see equation

(5b))     that while with n>l          one    will always care        indirectly for      one's

siblings,    etc.   (because one's parent does)            one will always (when all agents

of a given generation have the same egoistic utility levels)                        care less

about a sibling than about oneself.                Similarly,     siblings will carry more

weight than more distant lateral               relatives      and non—lineal, relatives will

carry less weight than lir,ear relatives                 of the same age cohort,         No—one

will,    when all agents of a given generation have the same egoistic utility,

ever give anything to a sibling or to a non—lineal relative.

     The consumer maximizes (1) by optimally choosing                   c, c,     S,,   and Gt,

subject to the constraint (7) and

        The Insda conditions               ensure     that (Ba)       is    satisfied as long as the

consumer has positive lifetime resources.                           Equations      (8b and        (Sc) reflect

legal       restrictions that rule out he possibility of a private individual

 taxing his parenrs or children.

        The consumer is competitive               in the labour and capital markets and rakes

taxes       to be exogenous.         It is also         assumed that all relatives                 of a given

type     (j ,k) have the      same     egoistic utilities and behave in the                     same manner,
       To    obtain a well-'defined unique solution,                       many    further restrictions
must be imposed on            the "games'         the household plays             with rembers         of other

generations.           The following       assumptions        are made.

(Al) j       erenelational Nash behaviour

       A member of generation t                 takes   8t.l and G,3, ,jO,l,          ..   .   ,i+n,   as given

(i.e. as independent of his choices                     of   o, c,     B and Cr).              Note that this

is not trivial,         as the bequest 8tl is left in period t simultaneously with

r and G, while the gifts G÷g, jO                                l+n, are given in period r÷l after

c and G. and simultaneously with o                        and    B.    This intergenerational Nash

assumption is by no means                   ovenhelmingly plausible,                but simplifies         the

analysis greatly.

       Further strategic conjectures                  are required as regards the behaviour of

one's       siblfngs,    f    there is more than one child (see Abel (1985) and

Kimball (1987a,b)),           (n)O).       I'll consider the following three.

       This means that the siblings of the ith child born in generation t                                  are
assumed not to change their gift behaviour when the itb child changes its

consumption,       gift or bequest behaviour:

Abel (1985) favours this assumption.

(A2') Co—operative sibling gift behaviour

       Kimball (1987b, p.316) proposes a co—operative solution among siblings

in which each sibling agrees to give exactly the same amount that each of

the others         gives while one of them decides the                      total      amount to be given.

The agent who decides the total amount to be given to the common parent

simply maximises her own                    tot. 1   utility and therefore effectively values the

egoistic utility loss of each of his n siblings only /[(l+a)XJ as much as

her own egoistic utility loss (see equation (5b) with j—O and k—O (own

utility) vs. j—O and k—i (sibling utility)).                               This kind of behaviour is

probably better characterised as imitative rather than as co—operative,

       Let i be the "leader, then:

siblings are affected by the choices of the current generation only if the

latter directly affect their budget constraints.                                Formally we assume that:

     Any stationary state                      in    which a       bequest motive          is operative is

dynamically efficient, ie. the interest rate,                             r,    exceeds the population

    Note that if there                ia only the bequest motive        ((l_p)L0)       equation

(12) redutes        to (l+r)/(1+n)l+a.

    Neil       (1987) shows          that dynamit ineffitienty of the         economy   without
bequest    motive is sufficient to rule out operative bequests in the economy

vith a bequest motive9 both for an endowment economy and in the Diamond

(1965) production economy.

    Similarly,              in   a     stationary        equilibrium   with
                                                                  operative    an

Proposifion 4:

    Any steady state in which a child—to—parent gift motive is operative is

dynamically inefficient              (r<n).

    Note that if there is only the gift motive ((l+o)—O), equation (l3a)

becomes        l+r—(l+p)-,           equation   (13b)     becomes    (1÷r)/(l+n)—(l÷p1      and

ote        that with a, the elasticity of marginal utility, greater than 1, a

sufficiently large per—capita income growth rate (high value of                               )     will

ensure dynamic efficiency (l+r>(l+n)(l+)) in a steady state with operative

gifts.        al    will ensure inefficiency of a steady state with operative gifts

if    ir>0.


       It might appear from (l5a) that with                     >0   and n<1 we might get dynamic

inefficiency (l+r<(l+n)(l+)) with an operative bequest motive.                             As pointed

out       in Kimball (l987a,b),                this is not in fact the case,           since (l5a) no

longer characterises a privately optimal plan if l+r<(l+n)(liw).                            The total

utility functional no longer converges and even the overtaking criterion

cannot be used to rank feasible paths.

single     homogeneous durable commodity              is   ptoduoed by    a   well—behaved

neoclassical production function which is linear homogeneous in capital and

labour.        Productivity growth! is omitted for simplicity.

Output market equilibrium is given by equation (19) where Et denotes total

From the public sector budget identity given in (20)                     it follows that

equation (19) can be replaced by the equivalent equation (21).                 Dt denotes

the stock of public debt outstanding at the end of period t—1.                 Debt has a

fixed face value of unity and a maturity of one period.

Equation (21) states that the savings                         of the young in period t have to

equal the sum         of      the capital stock and the public debt stock in period t+l.

the    lowest possible stationary interest rate is always above                         the golden

strictly concave towards the origin.                     For more general constant returns to

      Adding gifts and bequests but still omitting government spending,

and taxes modifies the statinary competitive consumption possibility locus

as    in Figure 2.               It is assumed that <n/(l+2n)              and that there     existS a

(the     condition for G>O).                 In that case there certainly exists a feasible

value of k,         k    say, such that B>O, i.e.

ote       that      bequests           and    child—to—parent gifts             cannot   be   positive

simultaneously in steady state.

      The stationary competitive consumption possibility locus with bequests

and      gifts      is       obtained by        deleting from        the    stationary competitive

consumption possibility locus                     without bequests and gifts the               segment

corresponding to capital—labour ratios above k8 (i.e.the dotted segment

0122)    and the segment corresponding to capital—labour ratios above kG (i.e.

the dotted segment               124121).


      From C2 to A3 the straight line segment with slope —(l+n) gives the

locus     where bequests are                 positive.      With k    given,      ac1/3—l/(l+n)       and

Larger bequests correspond to movements towards the south—east along 02A3.

      From Qi       to    A2 the straight line segment with slope —(l+n) gives the

     The substitution of (30) into the steady state private life—time                 budget

Outside the steady state, the fiscal policy parameters r2, d and e can                   be

governed by any rules that are consistent with convergence to the steady

state.     We consider three policy experiments:            (1) an increase in the debt

stock, financial        with taxes on the young or on the young and the old; (2) a

balanced budget increase in unfunded social security payments to the old

financed by higher taxes on the young;            (3)   an increase in exhaustive public

spending financed by a tax            on the      young.    The last experiment isn't

concerned      with debt neutrality,      as exhaustive public spending is varied,

but is interesting in its own         right.
24   Steady state comparative statics of debt neutrality

     From equations          (31)   and   (32),    note    that,    holding   k   constant,

ac1/ad——(l÷f')        and ac2/ad—(l+f')(l+n).      Again therefore, ac2/acL_(l+n).           A

larger stock of public debt financed               with taxes      on the young (with    l
increasing if f'>n and decreasing if f'<n) acts just like a reduction in

benefits (when        >0)   or an increase in child—to—parentgifts (when G>0).           In

general,    it shifts the stationary competitive consumption possibility locus

in Figure 3 from A32fl1fl4A2 up and to the left to

     A larger stock of public debt financed in steady state with higher

while young and while old on the locus: oct/Pd__Klan); Oc2/8d(l+n)2, so

again    Oct/OcU_Can).
     A balanced budget increase in            and reduction in 02, i.e. an increase

in   the   scale of an unfunded social security retirement scheme has                    the

following    effect on the locus at given k: —0c1/0r2——l/(l+n) and —8c°/Pr°l.

Like a      larger soock of debt,          it therefore shifts     the     locus   to    the

North—West.

     At given   k,   an increase in public consumption financed with taxes on

che young simply shifts        the   consumption possibility locus          to the      left

one—for—one:    3ct/8e_l    and Sc°/8e0.

increases financed by taxing the young, propositions (Sa.b,c) hold.
Prcposition Sc:
     When the bequest motive is operative          (3>0 and r>n)   a larger stock of

public debt financed with higher taxes             on the young will be offset by

larger bequests;     dB—((l+r)/(l+n))dd; c1, c2, and k will be unaffected.                A

smaller stock of public debt financed with lower taxes on the young will be

offset by smaller bequests as long as —((l+r)/(l÷n))dd does not exceed the

initial bequest and the 3)0 constraint does not become binding.

Proposition Sb:

     When the gift motive is operative (0>0 and ron)          ,    a larger stotk of

public debt "financed"      with higher transfer payments to the young13, will

be offset by reduced child—to—parent gifts            as long as (l+r)dd does not

exceed the initial      child—to—parent gift and the 0)0 constraint does not

become binding; dG——(l+r)dd.         A   smaller stock of public debt financed with

higher taxes    on the young will be offset by increased child—to—parent

gifts.

       If neither the bequest motive nor the gift motive is operative      (—O   and

initially,           in the new steady state and during the    adjustment process,

Proposition Sc: (Diamond, 1965)

      When neither the bequest motive nor the gift motive is operative,          the

long run effect of a higher public debt stock of (financed with taxes               ott

      ak -      l+4n÷(l—c)r] (l+nY'
      —                                                                      (34)
      ad        (c—l)f'(k+d)—(l+n+f"c)


      If the model is locally stable when d is kept constant throughout, with

r     varying endogenously to keep the budget balanced,         if both goods    are

normal      (Q<c,,<l)   and if a higher interest rate does not raise consumption in

period 1         (cO),    then the denominator of (34) is negative and if r,n>O

ak/ad<O:        public debt crowds out private capital.

      For       public debt increases financed by taxing the old,     propositions

(6a,b,c) hold.

Proposition 6a:

      When the bequest motive is operative (8>0 and r>n) a larger stock of

public debt financed with higher taxes on the old will be offset by larger

bequests E—(l+n)2d.           A smaller stock of public debt "financed' with lower

Proposition 65:

       When the    child—to—parent   gift   motive      is operative (4>0   and   rcn)   a

larger stock of public debt financed with highec transfer payments to the

old, will be offset by reduced child—to—parent gifts;             dG—(l+n)dd as     long

as (l+n)Od does not exceed the initial child—to—parent gift.

       A smaller stock of public debt financed with higher taxes            on the old

will be offset by increased child—to—parent gifts.

Proposition 6c:

       When neither the bequest motive nor the gift motive are operative,            the

effect on the long—run rapital—labour ratio of an increase in public debt

financed with taxes on the old is given by:


                (lrn) (l+cn+(l-c)r) (l+r)1
                         —                                                        (35)14
       Od
               [(c-l)k4c+n)d]f"-(l+n+cf")


local stability when d is constant implies




                                                   <1
        [(c_l)k÷4(l÷n)d]f8(l÷n+cfflrl


Even    with    0<c<l and okO,       this does not suffice to ensure that the
denominator      of (35) is negative as (o—l)k+(c/((l+r)—1(l+n)d))            could be

positive.       It is clear that the smaller        4    and the smaller d, the more

likely it is that ak/Bd<O but the opposite outcome cannot be ruled out in

the present case.

       When equal taxes are levied on the old and the young (rLr2) a higher

level       of public debt when the bequest motive is operative leads             to an

increase in bequests given by A3((2+r)/(2+n))dd.              When the gift motive is
                                              —27—


operative gifts         are   cut     (if   they     are      large     enough      initially)     by

G——(l+n)(2÷r)/(2+n)5d.              When neither altruistic motive                  is   operative,

crowding out         of private capital by public debt again follows                          under

conditions that are more restrictive               than when only the young were taxed

and less restrictive than when only the old were taxed.

     An increase in taxes on the young                (ri-)    with r2 lowered to maintain

budget balance continuously          cts    exactly     like    an increase in public debt

with r1 endogenously maintaining budget balance.                      When the bequest motive

is operative, bequests are increased by zB—(l-+-n)dr1,                      When the gift motive

is   operative,       gifts   are    cut    (assuming      they       are    sufficiently large

initially)      by   G——r1.   When neither motive is operative,                the effect of the

increase in the scale of the unfunded social security retirement scheme is

(assuming      for simplicity that d—O)



     —
     ak    —
               [L+c,n±(l—c)rJ (l+r)
                                                                                            (36)
     dr1       (c—l)kf'—il+n+cf']


Again local stability,        a non—positive effect of r on c1, normality of c1

and r,n>O are sufficient to guarantee              a lower      capital—labour ratio          as a

result of higher social security taxes and retirement benefits.

2.5 Debt neutrality outside         the steady state

     It is easily checked that all the neutrality propositions (such as

Propositions (5a,b), (Ga,b)) that apply to stationary equilibria extend to

non—steady state responses as long as the policy action or other exogenous

shock does not alter the "regimes"            (the gift or bequest constraints that

are binding and which may vary from generation to generation), for current

and future generations.        Consider an unexpected immediate permanent change

in d (financed with an increase in r1) in period t.                           The   intertemporal

consistency of child—to—parent gift and bequest behaviour (see Burbridge
                                               —28—


(1983) and Buiter and Carmichael (1984)) rules out the possibility of any

two generations airulcaneously wishing to make voluntary transfers             to each

ocher,       i.e.   C>C   *   Et_O;   Bt_l>O • C—O:   c>   • Gt,iO and C41>O •

Any given generation,           t say, ray of course wish both to rake a gift to its

parent and to leave a bequest to its children if, absent the gift and

bequest,       the walfaca of parent and children would be very different from

ita cum (raflecting say differences            in endowments taxes or factor prices).

That ia. Ct>C may ha consistent with S>O.                  In a stationary equilibrium

thia ia ruled out; equations (12) and (13a)            (or (13b) or (13c)) cannot hold

a imultaneoualy.

      When in any given period         c,   the gift and bequest motives of generation

t,    the   bequeat motive of generation t—i and the gift motive of generation

t+1    are    non—operative (before         and after a policy change or shock)   the

dynamic analysis of the Diamond (1965) model is applicable for that period.

E.g. when d is raised in period t (financed             with a tax on the young), the

response of the capital attck is given by


      ak+1          (l+cn÷(—4)rj (1+n)1
       ad


      This is negative if 0<4<1,            cjc0 and r,n>O so public debt crowds out

the private capital stock in the short run as well.

2.6 Debt neutrality
                  and_exhaustive              public spending

      The    presence or absence       of debt neutrality has implications for the

analysis of fiscal policy experiments             other than those involving   public

debt and iump—sum taxes.

      In steady state, when the bequest motive is operative, the successive

generations         of consumers are in many respects equivalent to the standard

model of a single representative infinite—lived consumer with an exogenous
                                                   —29—


pure     rate   of       time preference who             discounts his    future      utility of

consurnttion.        One          of the    key similarities is      that the long—run real

interest        rate              is       fixed    by      policy—invariant          parameters:

l+r—(l+n)(l/(l+ir))l/u in the OLG model with an operative bequest motive;

l+r(l+&1)(l/(+,r)Y° in the representative agent model with a pure rate of

time preference          &.
     In steady state              the gif' motive is operative,      the aggregate behaviour

of   the successive                generations is     equivalent to       that   of    a   single

representative infinite—lived consumer with an exogenous rate of negative

time preference,          ic. one who discoumts           his   past utility of consumption.

For the positive analysis of changes                  in exhaustive public spending it         is
immaterial that with 0>0 we have the equivalent of standard representative

consumer standing on his head.                  All that matters   is that the real interest

rate is      again fixed by                policy—invariant parameters when        sibling gift

tehaviour is operative, i.e.

     When neither the gift motive nor the bequest motive are operative,                         a


higher level of exhaustive public spending financed,                   say, with taxes on the

young,    will lead to a lower                 long—run capital stock and a higher real

interest rate if the model is locally stable.

horiroorally to the left by the amount of the increase in a and in 01,                                    The

equilibrium has              positive bequests              (as   at     131    on   the   private budget

unchanged intertemporal relative price,                           the     lower after—tax income is

reflented only in lower period I consumption.                              Bequests will increase and

rove the private budget constraint to the right.                               The new equilibrium is at

a position such as             133   on the private budget nor,straint 8383 with both c'

      When the gift motive              s    operative      as at          on the private budget line

BjBj, higher exhaustive public spending will,                           following the same reasoning,

lead to a new equilibrium such as 12 on the private budget line                                 EBi   with

both ct and c2 lower than at                 flj.    Child—to—parent gifts will be lower in               O

exhaustive public spending has a higher real interest rate. f2 on                                   B3B   is

    Equation (40) reflects the assumption of the existence of an efficient

competitive annuity or            life   insurance    market.         r   is       the   riskfree

single—period real rate of interest.           Each agent alive today contracts with

a life insurance company to receive a gross rate of return (l+r(t÷1)) an

his non—human wealth a       as long as he    survives.        If he dies all of a accrues

to the    inaurance    company.     If i is negative,          the   consumer pays a gross

premium rate       as long as he survives with the debt cancelled when he dies.

The insurance market is competitive with risk—neutral firms and free entry.

Each age     cohort is assumed to consist            of a large       number of identical

agents.    y is not only the individual's            probability of surviving for one

period but also the fraction of each cohort (and therefore of the total

population)   which survives each period.            It follows that           —   l/y W   is the

individual's wage and ? the lump—sum tax he pays.

    We define the market present value factor R as:

Corresponding to any individual agent's stock or flow variable V(t—s,t) we

was   sufficient for          absence   of debt neutrality in 010 models without an

operative baqusat motive.                 In    Buiter      1988a)    I      show    that     in   the

Yaari—Blanchard—Well 014            model,     a positive birtn rate           is necessary for

absence     of debt neutrality as well.                In the original Blanchard model, a

constant popu.ation was assumed,                i.e.    (l+8)y1.          Only the death rate

appeared explicitly in the model, doing "double duty".                       When the birth rate

and death rate are disentangled,             it is clear that a positive probability of

death in a Yaari—Blanchard model with a zero birth rate does not cause

absence    of debt rautraiity,          With    —0,    all surviving agents are identical.


Postponing Uor.p-sjm taxes therefore does not redistribute income or wealth

between ceterogeneous consumers.               While the probability of surviving to pay

the future taxes declines exponentially as                  yLt,     i>t;    the per       capita tax

burden of the survivors             increases       exponentially as      yt,       i>t.     The two

effects cancel each other out exactly.

      This suggests the following proposition:

ProposItion 7:

      In the Yaeri—Blanchard—Weilmodel, a zero birth rate is both necessary

and sufficient for debt neutrality.

Corollary     1:       When   the   birth      rate    is   zero,    uncertain lifetimes or

productivity growth do not generate absence of debt neutrality.

Corollary 2: When the birth rate is positive,                 infinite individual lifetimes

do not generate debt neutrality.

       It is easy, once we specify the initial value of the public debt and

the behaviour of         taxes,        to be more precise about the nature of the

non—neutrality.        In the example discussed earlier, let d'(t)>d(t).                 From

the government's solvency constraint (51)                  it is apparent that the higher

initial       debt in scenario    I    could be serviced by a strictly higher path of

future taxes in scenario          I,    i.e.   r1(i)>r(i) for    all i)t and   r'(i)>r(i)
fcr some i>t.        From (54) this implies that c'(t)>c1'(t):           higher government
debt "crowds out" private saving.

       Mote that in the OLD model of Section 2, a zero birth rate gives us a

representative consumer model with a finite (two period horizon)                   .     Debt

neutrality obviously prevails again.

       survival rates and discount rates

6.1 The complete absence of life insurance or annuity markets

       Now consider the case where there are no markets for insuring
                                                                     against
the    risks    associated with an unexpected death.             The individual's budget

constraint (40) is affected in two ways.                First he now earns the riskless

rate    l+r(c+l)     rather than (1+r(t+l)]Y on his                                       he
                                                                   savings.    Second,

receives (or pays)        an amount X(t—s,t),           reflecting the fact that other
consumers will be dying (unexpectedly)              in debt or with positive non—human

assets.        Without bequest or gift motive, these "involuntary bequests" are

assumed to accrue to the state and to be returned by it to the surviving

agents.       For the moment all that matters is that the individual agent takes

X(t—s,t)      as exogenous.   Specifically,       he does not see it as an additional

return on his non—human assets (t—s,t).

      The individual consumer's budget identity now is:
     (t—s,t+l) (1+r(t--l)) t—s,t)+(t--s,t)—(t—st)

                                                                                 (55)

(t—st) is         lump—sumtaxes net of transfers excluding payments or receipts
associated     with   invontary bequests. The terminal condition is

X(t)    is    the   sum   of    the   involuntary bequests per consumer measured in

efficiency units.         It follows that:

Note that we have assumed that X(s,t)_X(t)(l1)t for all                 s,   i.e.    each

consumer gets the same share of the aggregate involuntary bequests.

 permits     the government to redistribute income between

capital market imperfection,          the imperfection does not generate absence of

 debt neutrality.        We sumrnarise this as Proposition 8.

Proposition 8:

        In the Yaari—Slanchard—Weilmodel with uncertain lifetimes             and no life

insurance markets, a zero birth rate remains necessary and sufficient for

debt neutrality if involuntary            bequests are distributed in a lump—sum

manner among the survivors.

Corollary:     Under the conditions of Proposition 8, when the birth rate               is

zero,     the absence of life insurente markets does not cause absence of debt

witn a low death rate                  (high probability of survival) to          those with a high

death rate (low probability of survival).                    The   higher   death rate consumers

have the higher marginal propensity to consume out of wealth,

    This suggests the following                 proposition.
Proposition      9:

    Heterogeneous survival probabiltes cause absence of debt neutrality

even with perfect life insurance markets.                        Cet.par. postponing lump—sum

taxation will raise aggregate consumption.

    It follows immediately from equation (69) that:

Proposition 10:

    When survival probabilities are the same heterogeneous time preference

rates or heterogeneous elasticities of marginal utility do not not cause

absence of debt neutrality.

   The intuition behind Proposition (10) is that while                        i         or

imply     (cet.par.)             'n      2'    postponing      lump—sum     taxation      does     not

redistribute income when 71 — 72

     Finally, a little tedious algebra establishes the following.

Proposiriorz 11:

     Propositions (9) and (10) hold also when there is a complete absence of

life insurance markets.

     It can be shown the Propositions (9) and (10) go through even when the

following more reslistic insurance               market      imperfection exists,           Tne

insurance    companies      cannot identify the survival probability of individual

agents but know the two possible values of                   and their frequency in the

population.         In a pooling equilibrium          they consequently charge the same

insurance    premium (pay the same annuity rate of return)              to all consumers.

The competitive gross         rate of return on non—human assets is therefore


       l+r(t+l)
     71C1+72(lC1)


where        is the fraction of consumers         with survival probability 71'            The

length of this paper is, however,              adequately excessive without working

through this example.




5.   Conclusion

     Heterogeneity and redistribution are             necessary and sufficient for
absence     of debt neutrality.            Capital market imperfections are neither
necessary nor       sufficient,      although differential incidence of capital market

imperfections        may     well,     empirically,     be   an    important source  of
heterogeneity and a further reason              why    intertemporal redistributions of
lump—sum    taxes    may   not be neutral.
