                     Tied Wage—Hours Offers and the
                           Endogeneity of Wages


                                ABSTRACT



     In the standard model of labor supply, each worker is a price taker,

where the relevant price is an hourly wage rate which is fixed in the

short run, and which does not depend upon the number of hours supplied.

With this basic assumption, the wage can be regarded as exogenous for the

purpose of estimating a labor supply function. This paper proposes and

implements a pair of tests for the exogeneity of wages in a longitudinal

labor supply model, and for the particular failure of exogeneity associated

with jobs that offer wage—hour packages.

     The first test is very simple——it amounts to a test of whether hours

Granger—cause wages at the individual level. The second test involves a

simultaneous estimation of labor supply and wage offer equations. Both

tests indicate that the offered wage is related to hours worked, though the

offer locus is, for this sample, very flat. The principal conclusion is

that labor supply equations cannot properly be estimated in isolation from

the process generating wages, even when long time series are available

on a sample of individuals.

I. Introduction



     In the standard model of labor supply, each worker is a price taker. The

relevant price for each individual is an hourly wage rate which is fixed in

the short run, and which does not depend upon the number of hours supplied.

With this basic assumption, the wage can be regarded as exogenous for the

purpose of estimating a labor supply function, and the process by which wages

are determined need not be specified. This paper proposes and implements a

test for the exogeneity of wages, and for the particular failure of exogeneity

associated with jobs that offer wage—hour packages.

    With cross—sectional data, wage exogeneity is not a plausible assumption

and is seldom invoked as such. In the long run, individuals may influence

their own earning power via investment in human capital. Thus the wage in a

cross—section labor supply equation is likely to be correlated with the

stochastic term due to unobserved tastes and abilities which have helped to

determine the wage, as well as current labor supply. A longitudinal analysis,

in which wages and hours are observed for the same sample over a number of

time periods, can avoid the resulting simultaneity bias by eliminating

individual coustants in the labor supply equation. As long as wages are

exogenous to the individual in the short run, we can proceed to estimate labor

supply functions using the "within" variation in wages and hours.

    This requirement may not be met if the wage is part of a 'package deal'

associated with a particular job. Most jobs appear to permit very limited
                                      2



variation in hours worked at the discretion of the employee (though

absenteeism may generate some short—run flexibility). This suggests that

fixed hours per week may be part of a package which includes the wage rate and

other working conditions, but labor supply analysis need not change as long as

there is no systematic relationship between hours and wages. If a continuum

of hours are offered by firms, each worker simply chooses a job which imposes

desired hours. However, if market equilibrium generates a locus of wage/hours

combinations representing different jobs, each individual must optimize

subject to this constratht, and the wage will be endogenous. At present we

have little evidence regarding the existence, or the shape, of such a locus.

Previous studies have relied upon cross—section wage equations, in which the

simultaneity of wages and hours is likely to be a problem if preferences are

                 1
heterogeneous.

     The manner in which such a choice set may be established will not be

analyzed here. Suffice it to say that employers may wish to make tied offers

of hourly wage and work week if production or other costs vary with shift

length or with days worked. Such cost differences could arise from fixed

costs of shift changeover, hiring and training, or from a non—constant

marginal product as an individual worker puts in more hours per week.2 The

wage will be endogenous whenever the slope of the wage—hours offer locus is

non—zero.



1 H. Rosen (1976) estimated a sizable positive relationship between wages and
hours for married women, while Abowd and Ashenfelter (1981) found that wages
are negatively related to expected hours per year for stably employed white
men. Ehrenberg and Schumann (1981) conclude that, on average, workers do not
receive higher straight—time wages for mandatory overtime.

2 Market equilibria in which jobs have multiple characteristics are analyzed
by S. Rosen (1974) and by Lewis (1969), who suggested that a "market
equalizing wage curve" is likely to be associated with variation in hours
worked. Also see Penman for a survey of work on the standard 40—hour week.

        This paper devises a pair of tests for a non—horizontal wage—hours offer

locus using monthly longitudinal data on a sample of married men. The first

test is very simple —     it amounts to a test of whether hours Granger—cause
wages at the individual level. The second test involves a simultaneous

estimation of labor supply and wage offer equations, with all variables

expressed as deviations from individual means of a three—year time series.

Both tests provide evidence for the existence of tied wage—hours offers,

though the second indicates that the offer locus is, for this sample, very

flat.

II. Labor Supply and Wage Offers for an Individual



      Let each individual i solve in period t the following maximization

problem:



      max Ui(YjujXj) subject to              WjHi

where Y is income, W is the hourly wage rate, and H is hours worked. X is a

vector of exogenous variables which affect the supply price of labor, such as

age and number of children. If the wage is exogenous, we can specify a labor

supply function Hit                         where aj is an individual effect which
                        h(a.
is constant over time.3 Since a is unobservable and is likely to be

correlated with W, longitudinal data is required to estimate this labor

supply function. With a simple linear specification of h(.), we can take

deviations from individual means, and the fixed effect a1 will drop out.

      To introduce tied wage—hours offers, we assume that the wage faced by

person I in period t Is generated by:



(1)        Wit = d1 +     + uit



The wage is a linear function of hours worked, a fixed individual effect, and

a random shift parameter. Corresponding to the wage offer schedule is a

"marginal wage income" schedule with slope 2f, as shown in Figure 1. This

shows the effective tradeoff between leisure and income faced by the worker,


  A similar labor supply function would result from an intertemporal problem
in which the individual faces a lifetime budget constraint. Additive
intertemporal preferences must be assumed, however, since there is no direct
dependence of labor supply on wages in other periods, except as they enter
through ai.

 and is analogous to the marginal revenue function of the monopolist.

      This is clearly a spot—market specification of hours and wages; multi—

 period employment contracts introduce a significant complication. In the

extreme case where the wage is simply "an installment payment on the firm's

long—term obligation to the worker" (Hall, 1980), the current wage need not

respond to current hours at all.4

     With tied offers, hours worked will be a function of the parameters of

the wage—hours offer locus. Assume, for simplicity, that the marginal rate of

substitution between income and leisure (MRS in Figure 1) is linear in hours

worked. A worker who may choose any wage—hours package from the offer locus

will set hours so that marginal wage income is equal to the marginal rate of


      Kennan (1983) includes a "wage smoothing" specification in his analysis
of aggregate employment—wage movements. Abowd and Card (1983) interpret
individual wage—hours variations in the context of a similar model.

substitution. Solving for equilibrium hours as a function of the shift in the

offer locus, we have

where        incorporates d, as well as differences in preferences and lifetime

budget constraints,           is the coefficient on hours in the MRS and all other

parameters may also be functions of f. An individual equilibrium at finite

hours requires that the slope of the MRS be greater than the slope of the

marginal wage income schedule, or            > 2f

Equation (5) is the "hours function" in Figure 2, which traces out equilibrium

wage—hours packages as the offer locus shifts over time.

Some obvious generalizations of this hours equation and their implications for

the identification of the model will be discussed in section 4. The linearity

assumption, however, will be maintained throughout.

     The absence of tied wage—hours offers corresponds to the restriction

f=O. If hours do not enter the wage equation, then the individual faces a

perfectly elastic demand curve for hours worked and (5) is an ordinary labor

supply equation. In this case, the parameter b is equal to 1/s, and a

consistent estimate can be acquired without estimation of the wage offer

equation.

     If the restriction f = 0 holds, can we say that wages are exogenous?

Employing the concept of weak exogeneity set Out by Engle, Hendry, and Richard

(1983), wages are weakly exogenous to hours with respect to the parameter b

only if b can be estimated consistently and efficiently without reference to
                                                8



the wage equation. Wage exogeneity, in this sense, is more restrictive than

the absence of tied offers, since consistency requires that the shocks eit and

Uit be uncorrelated as well as f           0.

      Estimation of the wage—offer equation (4) depends upon the vector x.

Candidates for exogenous shifters of the labor supply schedule are somewhat

limited, since all characteristics which do not vary for an individual over

the sample period will have been included in the fixed effect. In most

samples, income from non—labor sources and number of children are the only

observable possibilities for x.

      In fact, however, the behavior of the errors e and u provides an

alternative method of identification. Both h and w exhibit strong serial

correlation, a pattern which can be interpreted as the result of shocks to the

individual's supply price, or to their offered wage schedule, which are

autocorrelated. As an illustration, first order autocorrelation of the form,



          e = pet_i+


          ut =   qu...1 +


yields a system,



(6)       hit =   bwit +    p(hj_i   —
                                         it—l +

          Wit   = fhit +    q(wj_1 —     fhjt_i)    +



It is assumed, for the remainder of the paper, that e and u are not causally

related, though the innovations c and i may be correlated.
                                         9




 III. Do Hours Cause Wages?



      Equations (6—7) suggest a very simple and very general test for tied

wage—hours offers. The reduced form of the wage equation is,



     w1 = f(bwit + p(hi_i — bwft i +e) + q(w11 —
                                                           fhi1)   +



If f=O, then the current wage depends only upon past wages and the innovation

       If f    0 ,    then past hours should help to predict the current wage.

Thus the presence of tied offers implies that hours cause wages, where

causality is of the type described by Granger (1969).


    "...We say that        is causing X if we are better able to
    predict X using all available [past] information than if the
    information apart from [past] Y had been used" (p. 428),


     The tests reported here are similar to those employed by Sargent

(1976). The restriction f = 0 implies that E(wjtwi...i)
                                                             E(witIwjt_i,hi_i),
which must hold if hours do not Granger—cause wages. A failure of the

necessary condition for non—causality will thus imply the presence of tied

offers in this case. This result will generalize to higher order

autocorrelation of the demand and supply shocks, so an ordinary least squares

regression of wages on lagged hours and lagged wages provides the basis of the

first test. Note that the validity of this test does not depend at all upon

the specification of the labor supply function.

     This regression employed 48 months of wage and hours data from a

longitudinal sample of low—income married men in the control group of the

Denver Income Maintenance Experiment. From the set of 580 who reported
                                     10




employment information for the duration of the experiment, a subsample was

chosen who reported positive hours worked in each month. This left 204 men

between the ages of 18 and 58, who earned an average hourly wage below $4.00

(1972 dollars) but experienced reasonably stable employment. Deviations from

individual means were calculated for monthly hours adjusted for seasonal

variations, and for the straight—time hourly wage deflated by the Denver CPI

and seasonally adjusted. The last 36 months of data were employed to allow

for 12 monthly lags.5

     Lagged hours are highly significant in the wage equations for both the

full sample and the subsample of job changers. We can thus reject the

exclusion of lagged hours, and reject Granger non—causality of wages by

hours. This test provides some evidence that tied wage—hours offers are being

faced by the men in this sample. A symmetric test for wages causing hours

leads to the expected conclusion that lagged wages do help to predict current

hours •
          6




   This lag length was chosen arbitrarily. A four month lag was attempted
later, but this did not affect the results. It was hoped that 12 months would
be sufficiently long that no omitted lags would be included in the error term.
In fact, there is no evidence of autocorrelation in the residuals. Estimation
of partial correlation functions (for up to six lags) yields no significant
coefficients, and the Q statistic from the sample autocovariances for lags one
through six is 6.26, which is x(6) and insignificant.

6 An alternative test for Granger—causalitY has been employed by Sims (1972)
and others. In this context, it consists of regressing hours on past,
current, and future values of the wage, and testing for the significance of
future wages. This test was also implemented, using eight past and four
future lags. Future wages were significant in the hours equation, confirming
the above result that hours Grangercause wages.

     It is perhaps worth noting that this causality test would fail if the

innovations in the wage—offer and hours equations followed very similar serial

correlation patterns. If p = q, then lagged hours will have a coefficient of

zero in the wage equation even if    f * 0.

LV.   Simultaneous   Estimation



      Since the presence of tied wage—hours offers cannot be dismissed on the

basis of a causality test, we now investigate the slope of the offer locus

through a simultaneous estimation of the wage and hours equation. In OLS

regressions similar to those reported in the previous section, variables which

were expected to affect the supply price of labor only and thus identify the

wage offer equation, such as non—labor income, did not have a significant

impact on hours. Similarly, the unemployment rate in Denver should have been

included in the offer equation, but displayed very little variation over the

sample period (1972—1974).

      However, with first order autocorrelation specified for both e and u, the

system (6—7) is just identified — the four reduced form parameters can be

translated into the four structural parameters through non—linear

restrictions. Unfortunately, the supply and demand equations are symmetric

and, as Kennan (1983) notes with respect to a similar structure in an

aggregate model, we cannot tell which parameters belong to the wage offer

locus and which to the labor supply function, though all are identified.

However, we can assume a priori that the slope of the offer locus is less than

the slope of the labor supply function, since this is implied by the

restriction that the slope of the marginal wage income schedule be less than

the slope of the MRS.

      In practice, a fourth order autocorrelation scheme is specified for both

equations,   so that the system is overidentified. Full—information maximum

likelihood was used to estimate the parameters of the two equations. This

method will generate consistent and efficient estimates if the innovations
                                             13




 c and i are normally distributed.7 Fourth order autocorrelation of the

 errors e and u cannot be rejected as a restriction on a twelfth order process,

 so only results from the former are reported. The wage data are in dollars

 per hour and represent the regular straight—time wages only, not overtime

 payments. Hours are hours per month, adjusted for seasonal variations. All

observations are again deviations from individual means, and 36 observations

for each individual in the sample are used. The standard deviation of monthly

hours is 20.5 hours, and of wages, $0.51 per hour.

     The final results, with standard errors in parentheses, follow.

The estimated slope8 of both the labor supply function and the wage offer

locus are positive and significantly different from zero. In particular, the

estimate of f (the coefficient on hours in the wage offer equation) is very

precisely estimated, though very small. These results suggest that

individuals face, in the short run, a slightly upward—sloping choice locus of

wage—hours combinations, even when overtime rates are ignored.

     The labor supply response is similar to that found in other longitudinal

studies (see, for example, MaCurdy).8 One dollar per hour yields

approximately 4.5 extra hours of work per week, a mean elasticity of about

O.4O. The offer curve, however, is extremely flat; the same 4.5 extra hours

per week will yield only 4.6 cents per hour, give or take .4 cents. The

random components of the supply and demand curves have a contemporary

covariance which is significantly negative.

     Since the model estimated here is overidentif led, it may be useful to

consider which of the many possible generalizations will still permit

identification of the wage—hours offer locus. The current restrictions placed

on the labor supply function are perhaps most difficult to justify. With

intertemporal substitution of leisure, a direct dependence of current hours on

lagged hours would be introduced and, if expectations regarding lifetime




8 Recall that the hours equation is not a proper labor supply function. From
equation (5), the coefficient on wages is b —     , where   is the labor

supply response to a shift in the wage offer locus.    Since the estimated value

of f is so small, however, b is very close to 4.

income respond to realized wages, current hours may   depend   upon lagged
innovations in the offer locus as well. With a labor supply function of the

form:




        hj biwj +   b2w1   + b3h1   1   + ej

the parameters b1—b3 will not be identified.   However, if the simple structure
of the wage—offer locus is maintained, its serial

well as the parameter f which indicated the presence of tied offers, will be

identified. The type of test performed in this section, therefore, will be

valid for more general specifications of labor supply.

V. Conclusion



    The two tests reported in this paper decisively reject the proposition

that wage rates available to an individual in the short run are exogenous with

respect to hours worked. Both indicate that the offered wage is related to

hours worked —   this   Is interpreted here as evidence of job "packages" in

which wage and hours are tied together. The second test indicates that the

two are positively related, even when overtime rates are not included, but

that most of the positive covariance between hours and wages is due to supply

response, not to tied offers.

     The principal conclusion is that labor supply equations cannot properly

be estimated in isolation from the process generating wages, even in the ideal

situation where long time series are available on a sample of individuals.

The negative correlation between innovations in the demand and supply

equations and the presence of tied wage—hours offers insures that an estimate

of the wage elasticity of labor supply will fail to be unbiased. The

quantitative results, particularly the size of the straight—time wage premium

f or extra hours, should be regarded as representative of this sample only.

Both tests, however, can be easily applied to longitudinal data on other types

of workers.
