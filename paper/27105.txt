                                        ABSTRACT

We develop and calibrate a search-theoretic model of the labor market in order to forecast the
evolution of the aggregate US labor market during and after the coronavirus pandemic. The
model is designed to capture the heterogeneity of the transitions of individual workers across
states of unemployment, employment and across different employers. The model is also designed
to capture the trade-offs in the choice between temporary and permanent layoffs. Under
reasonable parametrizations of the model, the lockdown instituted to prevent the spread of the
novel coronavirus is shown to have long-lasting negative effects on unemployment. This is so
because the lockdown disproportionately disrupts the employment of workers who need years to
find stable jobs.

1     Introduction
In March 2020, the US entered a “lockdown” so as to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. The
vast majority of residents of the United States have been ordered to stay at home. Most retail businesses
have been ordered to shut down. Most workers have been ordered to stay away from their place of work.
Not surprisingly, during March and April of 2020, the number of claims for unemployment benefits has
sky-rocketed, exceeding in two months only the total from the entirety of the Great Recession. Is the
enormous number of workers entering unemployment going to flow back into the ranks of the employed
once the lockdown restrictions are lifted? Or are these workers going to remain unemployed long after the
lockdown is removed? In this paper, we develop and quantify a framework to analyze and forecast the
evolution of the labor market during and after the coronavirus pandemic. We find that, under reasonable
parametrizations of the model, even a 3-month long lockdown is going to have long-lasting negative effects
on unemployment.
    Our framework is a search-theoretic model of the labor market in the spirit of Pissarides (1985) and
Mortensen and Pissarides (1994). Workers endogenously transition across states of employment and un-
employment, as well as from one employer to another. Workers search for jobs when they are unemployed.
Workers search for more productive jobs when they are employed, albeit with a lower intensity. Workers
move from employment into unemployment when their productivity falls below some threshold. If the
productivity is low for transitory reasons, some workers and firms may suspend production but maintain
the option of resuming it, albeit at some cost and imperfectly. As in Gregory, Menzio and Wiczer (2020),
workers are ex-ante heterogeneous with respect to their baseline productivity, the distribution of the com-
ponent of productivity that is idiosyncratic to their match with a particular employer, and with respect
to their ability to search the labor market. The search process that brings workers and vacant jobs into
contact is directed by wages, as in Moen (1997) and Menzio and Shi (2011).
   According to our model, the lockdown—which we describe as a temporary decline in labor productivity—
causes some employment relationships to be terminated, some to be suspended, and others to continue.
Intuitively, terminated relationships are those in which the surplus becomes negative because of the lock-
down. Continuing and suspended relationships are those in which the surplus remains positive in spite of
the lockdown. A relationship is suspended rather than continued if its productivity during the lockdown is
low enough that the firm and the worker prefer collecting unemployment benefits rather than continuing
production and maintaining strong ties.
    Once the lockdown is lifted, the speed of the recovery, depends on three factors: (i) the fraction of
workers who, at the beginning of the lockdown, enter unemployment while maintaining a relationship with
their employer; (ii) the rate at which inactive relationships dissolve during the lockdown; (iii) the rate at
which workers who, at the end of the lockdown, are not recalled by their previous employer can find new,
stable jobs. In turn, factors (i) and (ii) depend on the costs associated with maintaining and reactivating a
temporarily inactive relationship, on the ability of the employer to survive the lockdown without revenues,
and on the rate of decay in the quality of a temporarily inactive relationship. Factor (iii) depends on the
job-finding rate of the non-randomly selected group of workers who are permanently laid off during the
lockdown.
    Depending on parameters, the model can generate either a V-shaped recession—one in which the

                                                     1
unemployment rate quickly returns to its baseline level once the lockdown restrictions are lifted—or an
L-shaped recession—one in which the unemployment rate takes several years to return to its pre-lockdown
level. As a matter of theory, a V-shaped recession occurs if: (a) workers who enter unemployment are in
a suspended relationship with their previous employer and maintain it throughout the lockdown; or (b)
workers who, by the end of the lockdown, have no relationship to their previous employer can quickly find
a new, stable job. In contrast, an L-shaped recession occurs if: (a) many workers flow into unemployment
without maintaining ties to their previous employer; and (b) these workers cannot quickly find a new,
stable job.
    We calibrate the model using data from the Longitudinal Employer and Household Dynamics (LEHD)
and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to capture three features of the labor market:
(i) the fact that workers differ systematically with respect to the duration of their unemployment spells,
and with respect to the tenure length of their jobs; (ii) the prevalence of different types of workers in
different industries; (iii) the increase in unemployment across industries in March and April 2020. We
find 3 distinct types of workers. At one extreme, there are ”stable” workers with high productivity, short
unemployment spells, and a high probability of staying on a job for more than 2 years. At the other
extreme, there are ”fickle” workers with low productivity, long unemployment spells, and a low probability
of staying on a job for more than 2 years. We find that the prevalence of “fickle” workers varies a lot across
industries and happens to be concentrated in some of the industries hit hardest by the lockdown.
    Using the calibrated framework, we measure the shape of the pandemic recession. We model the reces-
sion as 3-months lockdown—which affects differently the productivity of workers in different industries—
followed by a 12-month period of uncertainty—during which productivity is back to normal but there is a
risk of a second lockdown. Throughout the lockdown and uncertainty phases, unemployment benefits are
augmented by special federal programs. We find that the recession has an L-shape. The finding is easy to
explain. First, even when the cost of maintaining and reactivating a suspended employment relationship
is fairly small—in the order of less than a month of the worker’s value added—the fraction of workers
whose employment relationship is permanently terminated is about 35%. This is consistent with survey
evidence, which finds that between 40 and 50% of the workers who have entered unemployment during the
first month of the lockdown have no expectation of being recalled to their previous job (see, Adams-Prassl
et al. 2020 and Bick and Blandin 2020). Second, the workers who are permanently laid-off are dispro-
portionately of the ”fickle” type, who need to search for several years in order to find a long-lasting job.
Interestingly, increasing the length of the lockdown from 3 to 6 months does not significantly affect the
behavior of unemployment 4 years out.
     We believe that our simulation represents a lower bound on the effect of the pandemic on unemploy-
ment. Indeed, we abstract from several important channels that are likely to slow down the recovery of
unemployment. First, it is unlikely that the lockdown will be entirely lifted after 3 months and that, once
lifted, productivity will immediately return to its normal level. Second, even employment relationships
that are kept active throughout the lockdown are likely to break down at a rate higher than normal due
to bankruptcies. Third, contractual frictions may cause some viable employment relationships to break
down during the lockdown. A leading example of contractual frictions are rigid wages (see, e.g., Hall 2005,
Gertler and Trigari 2009, or Menzio and Moen 2010), minimum wages, or costs to renegotiate contracts in
the face of unforeseen contingencies.

     The paper contributes to recent work on the economic consequences of the pandemic. A non-exhaustive
list of this line of work is Alvarez, Argente and Lippi (2020), Atkeson (2020), Berger, Herkenhoff and Mon-
gey (2020), Eichenbaum, Rebelo and Tradandt (2020), Fernandez-Villaverde and Jones (2020), Garibaldi,
Moen and Pissarides (2020), Glover et al. (2020), Guerrieri et al. (2020), Kapicka and Rupert (2020),
Kaplan, Moll and Violante (2020), Jones, Philippon and Venkateswaran (2020). Compared with this lit-
erature, the focus of our paper is on forecasting the aggregate dynamics of the labor market starting from
the disaggregate and heterogeneous dynamics of individual workers. Compared with this literature, we
are also silent about optimal policy. We believe that a derivation of the “optimal” unemployment rate
during a pandemic would require calculations that, while surely important, fall well outside the scope of
our expertise.


2     Environment and Equilibrium
In this section, we present our model of the labor market. The basic structure of the model is the
same as in Menzio and Shi (2010, 2011). Firms and workers come together in the labor market through
a search process directed by the terms of employment contracts. Firms search the market by posting
employment contracts for their vacancies. Workers search the market by seeking vacancies offering the
desired employment contract. Matches between firms and workers are heterogeneous with respect to their
quality, which gives employed workers a motive for searching not only off but also on the job. We add
two new ingredients to this basic structure. First, we allow for the possibility that workers are ex-ante
heterogeneous. In particular, different types of workers are heterogeneous with respect to their productivity,
the distribution of match quality from which they sample, and their ability to search. As documented in
Ahn and Hamilton (2019), Morchio (2020), Kudlyak and Hall (2019) and Gregory, Menzio and Wiczer
(2020), there are systematic differences across workers in their UE (unemployment to employment), EU
(employment to unemployment) and EE (employer to employer) rates. Second, we allow for the possibility
that workers and firms might temporarily deactivate their match, while retaining the option of resuming
production at a later date. As documented in Fujita and Moscarini (2017), workers frequently return to
their previous job after a spell of unemployment. As we shall see, these two new ingredients are critical to
understand the aggregate dynamics of the labor market.


2.1    Environment
The labor market is populated by a positive measure of workers and firms. Workers are ex-ante heteroge-
neous with respect to their type i = 1, 2, ...I, which affects their productivity, unemployment income, and
their search and learning processes. A worker of type i maximizes the present value of income, discounted
at the factor β ∈ (0, 1). A worker of type i earns some income bi when he is unemployed, and some income
wi when he is employed. The unemployment income bi is a combination of unemployment benefits, trans-
fers, and income value of leisure. The employment income wi is determined by the worker’s employment
contract. The measure of workers of type i is µi ≥ 0 and the total measure of workers is 1.
   Firms are ex-ante homogeneous. A firm maximizes the present value of profits, discounted at the factor
β. A firm operates a constant returns to scale technology which turns the labor supply of a worker of type

                                                      3
i into yi z units of output, where yi is a component that is common to all pairs of firms and workers of type
i, and z ∈ Z is a component that is specific to a particular firm-worker pair. The first component is the
source of persistent differences in the productivity of different types of workers. The second component is
the source of worker’s job mobility. We refer to the second component of productivity as the quality of a
firm-worker match.
    The labor market is organized in a continuum of submarkets indexed by the vector x = {v, i}, where
v ∈ R denotes the lifetime utility promised by firms to workers hired in submarket x, and i ∈ {1, 2, ...I}
denotes the type of workers hired by firms in submarket x.1 Associated with each submarket, there is an
endogenous vacancy-to-applicant ratio θi (v) ∈ R+ . If a worker searches in submarket x = {v, i}, he finds a
vacancy with probability p(θi (v)), where p is a strictly increasing, strictly concave function with p(0) = 0
and p(∞) = 1. A vacancy in submarket x = {v, i} meets an applicant with probability q(θi (v)), where q
is a strictly decreasing function with q(θ) = p(θ)/θ, q(0) = 1 and q(∞) = 0.
    The state of the economy is described by some exogenous state s ∈ S and by the endogenous distribution
of workers across employment states. The exogenous state s evolves stochastically, and its realization may
affects the type-specific productivity yi and the type-specific unemployment income bi . To understand
the endogenous distribution of workers across employment states, note that a worker may be unemployed
without the option to recall its old job, unemployed with the option to recall a match of unknown quality,
unemployed with the option to recall a match of known quality, employed in a match of unknown quality,
or employed in a match of known quality. Let ui be the measure of unemployed workers without the option
to recall their old job, mi the measure of unemployed workers with the option to recall a job with unknown
quality. qi (z) the measure of unemployed workers with the option to recall a job with known quality z, ni
the measure of employed workers in a match of uknown quality, and gi (z) the measure of employed workers
in a match of known quality z. Overall, the state of the economy is described by ψ ≡ {s, ui , mi , qi , ni ,gi }.
    Every period comprises six stages: learning, separation, recall, search, matching and production. In
the first stage, a worker of type i who is employed in a match with an unknown idiosyncratic component of
productivity discovers the quality of the match with probability φi ∈ [0, 1]. The idiosyncratic component of
productivity z is a random draw from a probability density function fi : Z → R+ with a mean normalized
to 1.
   In the second stage, an employed worker of type i becomes unemployed with probability de ∈ [δ, 1].
The probability de is specified by the worker’s employment contract. The lower bound δ represents the
probability that the worker has to leave the match for exogenous reasons (e.g., worker relocation). Similarly,
an unemployed worker with a recall option loses contact from his old employer with probability dq ∈ [δq , 1],
where dq is specified by the worker’s employment contract. The lower bound δq represents the probability
that the worker and the firm lose contact for exogenous reasons (e.g., firm bankruptcy, decline in the
quality of the match while inactive, loss of contact while phisycally separated, etc...).
    In the third stage, an employed worker of type i becomes unemployed with a recall option with proba-
    1
      We assume that a worker knows his own type and so does the market. The second part of the assumption may appear
unrealistic to some readers, but it does greatly simplify the model. In particular, the assumption allows us to abstract from
issues of signaling—the worker distorting his behavior so as to convince the market that his type is better than what it
actually is—as well as from issues of inference—the firms trying to assess the probability distribution of a worker’s type by
examining his employment history and performance on the job.


                                                             4
bility ` ∈ [0, 1], where ` is specified by the worker’s contract. Similarly, an unemployed worker with a recall
option returns to his old job with probability h ∈ [0, 1], where again h is a prescription of the employment
contract. When a worker recalls his old job, he and his employer have to pay a fixed cost Ci ≥ 0, which
captures the physical costs of resuming production.
    In the fourth stage, a worker gets the opportunity to search the labor market with a probability that
depends on his type and on his employment status. If a worker of type i is unemployed without a recall
option, he gets to search with probability λiu ∈ [0, 1]. If the worker is unemployed with a recall option, he
gets to search with probability λiq ∈ [0, λiu ]. If the worker is employed, he gets to search with probability
λie ∈ [0, λiu ]. Whenever the worker gets to search, he chooses which submarket x to visit. In the same
stage, firms choose how many vacancies to open in submarket x = {v, i} at the unit cost ki > 0.
    In the fifth stage, workers and firms searching in submarket x = {v, i} meet bilaterally. When a firm
and a worker of type i meet in submarket x, the firm offers to the worker an employment contract that
is worth v in lifetime utility. If the worker accepts the offer, he becomes employed by the firm under the
rules of the contract. If the worker rejects the offer–which is an off-equilibrium event–he returns to his
previous employment status. When a firm and a worker of type different from i meet in submarket x, the
firm does not offer an employment contract to the worker.
    In the last stage, an unemployed worker without a recall option enjoys an income of bi units of output.
An unemployed worker with a recall option enjoys an income of bi units of output, while the worker’s
old employer pays a cost ci to maintain the recall option alive. The flow cost ci is meant to capture the
overhead expenditures that the firm has to incur in order to keep the job available to the worker. A worker
of type i employed in a match of unknown quality produces, in expectation, yi units of output. A worker
of type i employed in a match of known quality z produces yi z units of output. The worker’s consumption
is wi , which is determined by the employment contract. After production and consumption take place,
next period’s state, ŝ, is drawn from the probability density function h : S × S → R+ with h(ŝ, s) denoting
the probability density of ŝ conditional on s.
    We assume that employment contracts maximize the joint value of a firm-worker match, i.e. the sum of
the worker’s lifetime utility and the firm’s present value of profits generated by the worker. We also assume
that the domain of the employment contract includes not only the employment relationship proper, but
also the time during which a worker is unemployed with the option of reactivating the relationship.2 As
discussed in Menzio and Shi (2011), there are many contractual environments with the property that the
contract that maximizes the profit of the firm subject to providing the worker any given lifetime utility
also maximizes the joint value of the match. We abstract from contractual incompleteness caused by either
wage rigities or missing contingencies.


2.2     Equilibrium
To define equilibrium, we need to introduce some additional pieces of notation. Let Ui (ψ) denote the value
of unemployment without recall for a worker of type i. Let Q̃i (ψ) denote the joint value to the worker
   2
    It is straightforward to develop a version of the model in which the firm and the worker do not act cooperatively during
a temporary separation. In keeping with the “contractual efficient” spirit of the paper, though, we decided to assume that
an employment contract regulates also this phase of the firm-worker relationship.


                                                             5
and the firm from a temporarily inactive match (i.e. the worker is unemployed with the option to recall).
Similarly, Qi (z, ψ) denotes the joint value to the worker and the firm from a temporarily inactive match
of known quality z. Lastly, Let Ṽi (ψ) and Vi (z, ψ) denote, respectively, the joint value of an active match
of unknown quality and quality z. All value functions are evaluated at the beginning of the production
stage.
   In what follows, we will suppress the dependece of the value functions from i and ψ in order to keep
the notation light. The value for an unemployed worker without a recall option is
                                           n                             o
                                                  i
                            U = b(s) + βEψ̂ U + λu max {p(θ(v))(v − U )} .                          (1)
                                                          v

In the current period, the worker’s income is b(s). In the next period, the worker gets an opportunity to
search with probability λu . If the worker searches in submarket v, he meets a firm with probability p(θ(v)),
in which case his continuation lifetime utility is v. If the worker does not get the opportunity to search,
or if the search is unsuccessful, his continuation value is U .
   The joint value of an active match of quality z between a worker and a firm is

         V (z) = y(s)z+
              n     n             n               h                                  iooo                 (2)

In the current period, the sum of the worker’s income and firm’s profit is y(s)z. In the next separation
stage, the worker moves into unemployment with probability d. In this case, the worker’s continuation
value is U and the firm’s continuation profit is zero. In the next recall stage, the worker and the firm
deactivate the match with probability `, in which case their joint continuation value is Q(z). The worker
and the firm keep the match active with probability 1 − `. In this case, the worker gets an opportunity to
search with probability λe . If the worker searches in submarket v, he meets a new employer with probability
p(θ(v)). In this case, the worker’s continuation value is v and the firm’s continuation value is 0. If the
worker does not get to search or if the search is unsuccessful, the joint continuation value is V (z). Note
that, since employment contracts are bilaterally efficient, d, ` and v are chosen so as to maximize the joint
value of the match.
   The joint value of an active match of unknown quality is

In the current period, the joint income of the match is y(s) (in expectation). With probability 1 − φ, the
firm and the worker do not discover the quality of the match. With probability φ, the firm and the worker
discover the quality z of the match, where z is drawn from the f distribution. Conditional on discovering
or nor discovering the match quality, the firm and the worker choose d, ` and v to maximize the joint
value.

In the current period, the sum of the worker’s income and firm’s profit is b(s) − c. In the next separation
stage, the worker moves into permanent unemployment with probability d. In this case, the worker’s
continuation value is U and the firm’s continuation profit is zero. If the next recall stage, the worker and
the firm reactivate the match with probability h, in which case their joint continuation value is V (z) − c.
The worker and the firm keep the match inactive with probability 1 − h. In this case, the worker gets an
opportunity to search with probability λq . If the worker searches in submarket v, he meets a new employer
with probability p(θ(v)). In this case, the worker’s continuation value is v and the firm’s continuation
value is 0. If the worker does not get to search or if the search is unsuccessful, the joint continuation value
is Q(z).
   The joint value of a temporarily inactive match of unknown quality is

          Q̃ = b(s) − c+

The expression above is analogous to (4) and requires no comment.
   The tightness θ(v) of submarket v is such that
                                                            h   i
                                               k ≥ q(θ(v)) Ṽ − v ,                                        (6)

and θ(v) ≥ 0, with the two inequalities holding with complementary slackness. The left-hand side of (6)
is the cost to a firm from opening a vacancy in submarket v. The right-hand side is the benefit to the
firm from opening a vacancy in submarket v. The benefit is the probability that the firm fills its vacancy,
q(θ(v)), times the firm’s value from filling a vacancy, Ṽ − v, i.e. the joint value of a match between the
firm and a worker net of the lifetime utility promised by the firm to the worker.
   We can easily characterize the solution of the search problems in (1)-(5). These problems have the
common structure
                                          max p(θ(v))(v − r),                                     (7)
                                                 v

where r denotes the value of the worker’s current employment status. For any v such that θ(v) > 0, (6)
implies that v is equal to −kθ(v) + p(θ(v))Ṽ . For any v such that θ(v) = 0, p(θ(v)) is equal to zero. From
these observations, it follows that (7) can be written as

                                       max −kθ(v) + p(θ(v))(Ṽ − r).                                       (8)
                                           v

Now, notice that, for all θ ≥ 0, there exists a v such that θ(v) = θ. Thus, by changing the choice variable
from v to θ in (8), we do not enlarge the choice set. Conversely, for all v, there exists a θ ≥ 0 such that
θ = θ(v). Thus, by changing the choice variable from v to θ in (8), we do not shrink the choice set. From


                                                        7
these observations, it follows that (8) can be written as

                                          max −kθ + p(θ)(Ṽ − r).                                       (9)
                                           θ≥0

From the above formulation, it follows immediately that a worker employed in a match of unknown quality
has no reason to actively search.
    To formulate the laws of motion for the distribution of workers across employment states, we need
some notation describing the policy functions. We denote as de (z) and dq (z) the optimal probability that
a worker employed in an active or inactive match of quality z moves into unemployment. We denote as
de (∅) and dq (∅) denote that probability for a worker employed in an active or inactive match of uknown
quality. We denote as `(z) and `(∅) the optimal probability that an active match of known or unknown
quality becomes inactive. We denote as h(z) and h(∅) the optimal probability that an inactive match of
known or unknown quality becomes active. We denote as θu , θq (z), θe (z) the optimal search strategy for
an unemployed worker without a recall option, an unemployed worker with an option to recall a match of
quality z, and an employed worker in a match of quality z.
   The law of motion for the measure of unemployed workers without recall is
                                                    P
                             û = u(1 − λu p(θu )) + z de (z) [g(z) + nφf (z)]
                                    P                                                                  (10)
                                  + z dq (z)q(z) + n(1 − φ)de (∅) + mdq (∅)

The law of motion for the measure of workers employed in an active match of uknown quality is
                                    P
                   n̂ = uλu p(θu ) + z (1 − de (z))(1 − `(z))λe p(θe (z)) [g(z) + nφf (z)]
                          P
                        + z (1 − dq (z))(1 − h(z))λq p(θq (z))q(z)
                                                                                                       (11)

                         +m(1 − dq (∅)) [h(∅) + (1 − h(∅))λq p(θq (∅))]

The law of motion for the measure of workers employed in an active match of known quality z is

                       ĝ(z) = [g(z) + nφf (z)] (1 − de (z))(1 − `(z))(1 − λe p(θe (z)))
                                                                                                       (12)
                            +q(z)(1 − dq (z))h(z)

The law of motion for the measure of unemployed workers with the option to recall a match of quality z is

                             q̂(z) = q(z)(1 − dq (z))(1 − h(z))(1 − λq p(θq (z)))
                                                                                                       (13)
                                  + [g(z) + nφf (z)] (1 − de (z))`(z)

Lastly, the law of motion for the measure of unemployed workers with the option to recall a match of
unknown quality is
                              m̂ = m(1 − dq (∅))(1 − h(∅))(1 − λq p(θq (∅)))
                                                                                                (14)
                                  +n(1 − φ)(1 − de (∅))`(∅)
All of the above expressions are easy to understand.
   A Recursive Equilibrium (RE) is such that: (i) the value functions {U, Ṽ , V, Q̃, Q} satisfy the Bellman


                                                       8
Equations (1)-(5); (ii) the policy functions {de , dq , θu , θe , θq , `, h} satisfy the optimality conditions in (1)-(5);
the distribution of workers across employment states {u, m, n, q, g} follows the laws of motion (10)-(14).
A Block Recursive Equilibrium (BRE) is a RE such that the value and policy functions depends on the
aggregate state of the economy ψ only through the exogenous state s, and not through the endogenous
distribution of workers across employment states. A Block Recursive Equilibrium is much easier to solve,
as it requires solving a system of functional equations with the one-dimensional state s as an aggregate
state variable. As proved in Menzio and Shi (2011) in the context of a similar model, there exists a BRE,
the BRE is unique, and there exists no other equilibrium that is not block-recursive.


3       Calibration
Using data from the Longitudinal Employer and Household Dynamics (LEHD) over the period 1997-2014,
we apply a k-mean algorithm to group workers based on to their similarity with respect to the frequency
and duration of unemployment spells and the number and length of jobs.3 The algorithm identifies 3 types
of workers, which we shall refer to as α, β and γ. About 55% of workers are of type α. For a worker of type
α, the duration of a job is less than a year with probability 30%, and more than 2 years with probability
50%. For a worker of type α, unemployment spells are short. About 25% of workers are of type β. For a
worker of type β, the duration of a job is less than a year with probability 40%, and more than 2 years
with probability 40%. For a worker of type β, unemployment spells are longer than for α-workers. About
20% of the workers are of type γ. For a worker of type γ, the duration of a job is less than a year with
probability 65%, and more than 2 years with probability 15%. These workers have the longest duration
of unemployment. Workers of different types also have different average earnings. Specifically, the average
earnings for β-workers are 70% compared to the average earnings for α-workers. The average earnings
for γ-workers are about 50% compared to the earnings for α-workers. The worker type characteristics
described above are the key calibration targets4
    Let us review the parameters that describe the non-stochastic steady state of the model. These pa-
rameters are summarized in Table 1. Preferences are described by the discount factor, β, and by the flow
unemployment income, bi . Production is described by the type-specific component of productivity, yi , and
by the distribution of the match-specific component of productivity, fi . We specialize the distribution fi
to be a Weibull distribution with shape αi and scale σi , shifted to have a mean of 1. Learning is described
by the probability φi with which a worker and a firm discover the component of productivity that is
idiosyncratic to their match.
   Search is described by the probability that a worker can search the labor market when unemployed
without a recall option, λiu and when employed, λie . Further, search depends on the vacancy cost, ki , and
on the job-finding probability function, p(θ). We normalize λiu to 1. We specialize p(θ) to have the form
min{θγ , 1}, where γ is the elasticity of the job-finding probability with respect to tightness.
    3
     In the LEHD, we cannot distinguish between unemployment and non-employment. We identify unemployment as a spell
without earnings that lasts less than 2 years. In the LEHD, we only have quarterly observations and, thus, we cannot directly
measure short unemployment spells. We impute an unemployment spell between two jobs by comparing earnings in the first
job and earnings in the second job. If, during the transition from the first to the second job, there is a quarter in which
earnings are lower than the minimum of the typical earnings in the two jobs, we impute an unemployment spell.

                                         Table 1: Model Parameters


   The recall process is characterized by the parameters λq , the probability that an unemployed worker
with a recall option can search the labor market, δq , the probability that an unemployed worker loses his
recall option, and by ci and Ci , the flow cost of maintaining the recall option and the fixed cost of exercising
the recall option. None of these parameters affect the non-stochastic steady-state, because absent aggregate
shocks, there are no firm-worker matches that are temporarily inactive. We shall discuss our choice of the
parameters describing the recall process in a few pages.
    Now, let us describe our calibration strategy in broad strokes. We use the empirical duration of
unemployment spells to calibrate ki . We use the empirical distribution of job durations to calibrate αi , σi
and φi . We normalize yα = 1 and choose yβ and yγ to match the difference in avearge earning between
different types of workers. As suggested by Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008) and Hall and Milgrom (2009),
the proper interpretation of bi is the sum of an unemployment benefit, ζi , and the income value of leisure,
`. We choose the unemployment benefit for workers of type i to be equal to 40% of the average labor
income for workers of type i, which is the typical replacement rate of unemployment insurance in the US.
We choose the value of leisure, `, so that, in the average of the whole population of workers, the flow value
of unemployment is equal to 65% of labor income, a percentage that Hall and Milgrom (2008) argue is
reasonable for the US economy. We tentatively set δ to 0.5% per month. We tentatively set γ to 0.5.
Neither of these parameters has much of an effect on our simulation results.


4     Simulating the Pandemic Recession
To describe and simulate the pandemic recession, we stratify the model by 2-digit industry. Using data
from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we compute the distribution of job durations
industry by industry. We choose the fraction of workers of type α, β and γ in industry j to minimize the
distance between the distribution of job durations in industry j in the data and in the model. We carry
out the minimization subject to a constraint requiring that the sum of workers of type α, β and γ across

all industries is equal with the fraction of workers of type α, β and γ in the LEHD. Figure 1 shows the
distribution of types by industry.
    To describe the pandemic recession, we assume that the economy can be in one of three states: lockdown
(sL ), uncertainty (sU ), or recovery (sR ). Intuitively, the lockdown state is meant to capture the current
phase of severe restrictions on economic activity. The uncertainty state is meant to capture a phase in which
restrictions on economic activities are lifted, but there is a risk of returning to the lockdown state (because
of, say, a second wave of infections). The recovery state is meant to capture a permanent return to normalcy
(because of, say, an effective vaccine is discovered). The three states differ with respect to productivity
and unemployment income. In the lockdown state, the productivity yi of i-workers employed in industry
j is multiplied by some factor AL,j , which is typically smaller than 1 and captures the (industry-specific)
effect of restrictions on economic activity. The unemployment income is multiplied by some factor BL > 1,
which captures the increase in unemployment benefits granted by the CARES Act. In the uncertainty
state, the productivity of i-workers employed in industry j returns to its normal value, i.e. AU,j = 1. The
unemployment income, however, is still multiplied by some factor BU > 1 to capture the idea that the
increase in the generosity of unemployment benefits may outlast the lockdown. In the recovery state, both
productivity and unemployment income return to their normal values, i.e. AR,j = 1 and BR = 1. When
the aggregate state is sL , the probability of moving to sU is 75% per month and the probability of moving
to sR is zero. When the aggregate state is sU , the probability of returning to sL is 13% per month, and
the probability of moving to sR is 6.5%. The sR state is absorbing.
   There are several parameters that have yet to be chosen in order to simulate the recession. We cali-
brate the vector of productivity shocks AL,j so that: (a) the aggregate unemployment rate increases by
19 percentage points during the lockdown—which we take it to be a sensible guess based on the num-
ber of unemployment insurance claims during March and April 2020; and (b) the relative increase in
the unemployment rate across industries matches the relative flow of new unemployment claims across
industry—which we measure for the states of Washington, Texas, Ohio and Nebraska. We set the unem-

ployment income shock BL to 1.3 or, equivalently, 1, 000 US$ per month. This is less than what offered
by the CARES act because we want to capture, albeit crudely, the fact that not all unemployed workers
will be awarded the additional benefits. In the baseline, we set BU to 1.3, but we present results for other
values as well.
     The parameters describing the process of recall require some guesswork. We assume that unemployed
workers with the option to recall their old job have the same probability of searching the labor market as
unemployed workers without such an option, i.e. λiq = λiu . We assume that the rate at which a firm-worker
match exogenously breaks down when it is temporarily inactive is 10% per month, i.e. δq = 0.1. The
particular values chosen for λq and δq do not have a significant impact on the simulation of the pandemic.
In contrast, the cost of maintaining the option of recall, ci , and the cost of exercising the recall option,
Ci , play an important role. Intuitively, both costs affect the trade-off between permanently terminating
or temporarily deactivating a firm-worker match when its productivity is depressed by the lockdown. The
relative magnitude of the two costs affects the trade-off between recalling a temporarily deactivated match
as soon as the lockdown is lifted or only when the risk of a lockdown is eliminated. Indeed, if Ci = 0, the
match can be activated and deactivated at no cost and, thus, the decision will be essentially determined
by a static comparison between b(s) − c and y(s)z. If, in contrast, Ci > 0, the firm and the worker are
discouraged from deactivating and reactivating their match often.
    Figure 2 illustrates the simulation of the pandemic recession under our baseline calibration. For the
purposes of the simulation, we assume that the economy is in the lockdown state for 3 months, in the
uncertainty state for 12 months, and in the recovery state afterwards. Panel (a) plots the unemployment
rate, measured in deviation from the steady-state. Panel (b) plots the fraction of workers who are unem-
ployed without a recall option (permanently laid-off), measured in deviation from the steady state. Panel
(c) plots the fraction of workers who are unemployed with a recall option (temporarily laid-off), measured
in deviation from the steady state. The dashed lines in the three panels show the decomposition of the
aggregates by type of worker.
   As the economy enters the lockdown, the unemployment rate increases by 19 percentage points. About
13 percentage points of the increase are due to temporary separations between workers and firms, the

                                                               12
remaining 6 percentage points are due to permanent separations. As the economy exits the lockdown,
approximately half of the workers on temporary layoff are recalled by their previous employer. Moreover,
the UE rate increases and the unemployed workers on permanent layoff start flowing back into employment.
Overall, during the 12 months between the exit from the lockdown state and the entry into the recovery
state, the unemployment rate falls by about 5 percentage points. As the economy enters the recovery state,
all remaining workers on temporary layoffs are recalled. Moreover, the UE rate returns to its pre-lockdown
level. Thus, the unemployment rate starts its descent towards its old steady-state level.
    Even though the lockdown lasts for as little as 3 months, the unemployment rate is still about 5
percentage points above its steady-state level 30 months after the beginning of the pandemic. Similarly,
the unemployment rate is still about 2.5 percentage points above its steady-state level 50 months after the
beginning of the pandemic. A recession with this kind of slow recovery is sometimes dubbed an “L-shaped”
recession. The slow pace of the recovery is caused by the ex-ante heterogeneity of workers. As can be seen
from Panel (a), the excess unemployment for α-workers subsides fairly quickly. This is because α-workers
have a high UE rate and, once they find a job, they are likely to keep it for a long time. The excess
unemployment for the γ-workers, however, subsides much more slowly. This is because γ-workers have a
low UE rate and, once they find a job, they are unlikely to keep it for a long time. Thus, the increase in
unemployment among γ-workers takes years to be reabsorbed as many of them go through multiple cycles
of unemployment and short-term employment.
    It is worth noting that γ-workers are the largest contributor to the initial increase in aggregate un-
employment, even though they are the smallest group in the overall population. In contrast, α-workers
are the smallest contributor to the initial increase in aggregate unemployment, even though they are the
largest group in the overall population. Intuitively, γ-workers have the smallest gains from trade in the
labor market and, hence, their employment is most susceptible to a negative productivity shock and to an
increase in the generosity of unemployment benefits. In contrast, α-workers have the largest gains from
trade in the labor market and, hence, their employment is least susceptible to the lockdown. Moreover, as
one can see from Figure 1 and Table 2, γ-workers are overrepresented in some of the industries that are
hit hardest by the lockdown. Indeed, the average productivity shock for a γ-worker is 10% larger than for
α-workers.
   It is also worth pointing out that the share of temporary layoffs is highest for γ-workers (approximately
75%) and lowest for α-workers (approximately 35%). There is a clear intuition behind this result. It
takes a long time for an unemployed γ-worker to find a “stable” match, i.e. a match with an idiosyncratic
component of productivity that is high enough to make the worker stop searching for something better.
Thus, a firm and a γ-worker in a “stable” match prefer to remain in contact (at the costs c and C) rather
than to permanently separate. In contrast, it takes a relative short time for an unemployed α-worker to find
a new “stable” match. Thus, a firm and an α-worker prefer to permanently terminate their relationship
rather than to remain in contact.
   The role played by the ex-ante heterogeneity of workers in shaping the recovery can be seen in the
dynamics of the unemployment rate in different industries. Panel (a) in Figure 3 shows the excess unem-
ployment rate in construction—an industry with a large fraction of γ-workers. Panel (b) shows the excess
unemployment rate in manufacturing—an industry with a large fraction of α-workers. Even though the

initial increase in unemployment is higher in manufacturing, the recovery is much faster because α-workers
are more likely to find stable employment after the lockdown is lifted. In the Appendix, we present the
behavior of the unemployment rate in every industry.
    Table 2 shows the industry-specific productivity shocks that we infer from our calibration. The cali-
brated shocks depend on the composition of workers in the industry—which we estimate from the SIPP—
and on the magnitude of the increase in unemployment benefit claims—which we observe for March and
April 2020 for several states. As a sanity check, we compare our calibrated productivity shocks with two
measures of the exposure of an industry to the lockdown. The first measure is the fraction of workers in
industry j that can work remotely. This measure is constructed from the occupational index of “teleworka-
bility” constructed by Dingel and Neiman (2020) using the ONET and then projected on industry j based
on its occupational composition. The second measure is a definition of “essential work” for the state of
Pennsylvania, where essential workers are those exempted from the lockdown.5
    Figure 4 contains a scatter plot of the calibrated productivity shock and the fraction of “teleworkable”
labor (panel a) and the scatter plot of the calibrated productivity shock and the fraction of “essential” labor
(panel b) across 2-digit industries. As one would have hoped, both relationships are negative. Also note
that the employment-weighted average productivity shock in the model is about 35%. The employment-
weighted average of the fraction of labor that cannot be done remotely is 45%. The employment-weighted
average of the fraction of labor that is both non-essential and cannot be done remotely is 27%. We find
it reassuring that our model generates an average shock that is in the same order of magnitude as the
fraction of labor that is susceptible to the lockdown.
    As mentioned earlier, the recall costs ci and Ci determine the fraction of workers in permanent and
temporary layoffs. Thus, for a given increase in the unemployment rate, the recall costs affect the speed
of the recovery. Specifically, the higher are the recall costs, the lower is the fraction of temporary layoffs
and the slower is the recovery. It is then important to build some confidence in our choice of ci and Ci .
In our baseline calibration, we set ci = 0.05 · yi and Ci = 0.25 · yi and found that 65% of the increase
in unemployment during the lockdown was due to temporary layoffs and 35% to permanent layoffs. This

      There is nothing special about Pennsylvania. The list of essential work in other states is quite similar.

finding is in line with the survey evidence on layoffs during the early stages of the pandemic. Adams-
Prassl et al. (2020) survey a representative sample of individuals in the US, conducting multiple waves of
interviews during the first weeks of the pandemic. Individuals could report whether they had lost their
job in a permanent way or been furloughed, implying the expectation of being called back. As of the
Apr 23 data, the ratio of temporary to permanent lay-offs was 3 : 2. Bick and Blandin (2020) conduct
a similar survey, again asking whether individuals who separated from their employer expected the layoff
to be temporary. They found approximately 50% of separations were expected to be temporary. Overall,
our calibration of ci and Ci is conservative, in the sense that our model generates more temporary lay-offs
than what found in these surveys.
     The ratio between the cost of exercising the recall option, Ci , and the cost of maintaining the recall
option, ci , affects the time at which temporarily deactivated relationships are recalled. Figure 5 shows the
simulation of the recession for ci = 0.15 · yi and Ci = 0, rather than for ci = 0.05 · yi and Ci = 0.25 · yi . By
lowering the cost of exercising the recall option while increasing the cost of maintaining the recall option,
the fraction of layoffs that are temporary and permanent does not change by much (it goes from 65 : 35%
to about 50 : 50%). For this reason, the medium-term effects of the lockdown do not change by much
either (the excess unemployment rate 50 months out is still about 2.5%). However, the timing of recalls
does change. In particular, most of temporarily laid-off workers are recalled as soon as the lockdown is
lifted.
    From the perspective of policy, it is interesting to see the effect of extending the lockdown. Figure
6 below illustrates the results of the simulated recession when the economy is kept under lockdown for
6 months rather than 3, and the period of uncertainty lasts 9 rather than 12 months. Because of the
extended lockdown, the unemployment rate remains close to its peak for a longer period of time. Yet,
once the economy enters the recovery state, the unemployment rate is essentially the same as in the
baseline calibration. In this sense, extending the lockdown does not seem to have nefarious effects on
unemployment in the medium-run. We urge our readers, however, to take this finding with a grain of salt,
as it may depend on our conservative assumptions about the effect of the lockdown on the survival rate of
temporarily deactivated relationships.

    Lastly, we want to point out that the model can also generate a “V-shaped” recession, i.e. a recession
in which the initial increase in unemployment is quickly reabsorbed after the end of the lockdown. The
model generates a V-shaped recession when the initial increase in unemployment is almost entirely driven by
temporary layoffs and, as soon as the lockdown is over, firms find it optimal to recall all of the temporarily
laid-off workers.6 Hence, the model generates a V-shaped recession when ci and Ci are small and BU is
close to 1.
    Figure 7 illustrates the simulation of the pandemic recession with ci = Ci = 0 and BU = 1. As
the economy enters the lockdown, the unemployment rate increases by 19 percentage points. About 18
percentage points of this increase are due to temporary separations between workers and firms, while the
remaining 1 percentage point is due to permanent separations. As the economy exits the lockdown, nearly
all of the workers on temporary layoff are recalled by their employers, and the unemployment rate returns
   6
    In principle, the model could also generate a V-shaped recession if the vast majority of workers entering unemployment
during the lockdown were of type α. However, our calibration of the type distribution across industries and of the shock
distribution across industries rules out this possibility.


                                                                17
within 1 percentage point of its steady-state level.
    While the model can generate a V-shaped recession, it does so by producing some implausible outcomes.
First, 95% the initial increase in the unemployment rate is due to temporary layoffs and only 5% is due to
permanent layoffs. In the recent surveys of Adams-Prassl et al. (2020) and Bick and Blandin (2020), at
least 40% of workers who became unemployed at the beginning of the recession state to have no expectation
of being recalled by their previous employer. Second, when the costs associated with temporary layoffs
are low, it takes a smaller productivity shock to generate the same increase in unemployment during the
lockdown. Indeed, the employment-weighted productivity shock required to generate a 19 percentage point
increase in unemployment is only 1.4%. This is an order of magnitude lower than the employment-weighted
average of work that cannot be done remotely (45%), and much lower than the employment-weighted
average of the fraction of work that is both non-essential and cannot be done remotely (27%).
   Let us conclude by pointing out that underneath the results presented in this section—results that are
aggregated either at the economy level or at the industry level—there is a wealth of additional results
about individual workers, including the size of their earnings losses during the lockdown and the speed
at which these losses are recouped.7 We decided not to report these disaggregated results not because we
deem them uninteresting, but for the sake of conciseness.

   Let us just say that our model does an excellent job at reproducing the size of earnings losses documented in Jacobson,
LaLonde and Sullivan (1993) and Davis and von Wachter (2011).
