      There is now substantial evidence that high employment protection leads
to a sclerotic labor market, with low separation rates but long unemploy-
ment duration.1 While this sclerosis may not lead to high unemployment|
because of the opposite eÂ®ects of low Â°ows and high duration on the unem-
ployment rate|it is likely to lead to both lower productivity, lower output,
and lower welfare.
      Broad reductions in employment protection run however into strong po-
litical opposition. The reason is simple: Those who are currently protected
see themselves as having more to lose than to gain from such a reduction.
For this reason, governments have either done little, or have tried to reform
at the margin, allowing for reduced protection, but only for (some) new con-
tracts. In France for example, Â¯rms now can, under some conditions, hire
workers for a Â¯xed duration, at the end of which separation occurs with low
separation costs. If workers are kept beyond this Â¯xed duration however,
later separation becomes subject to normal Â¯ring costs.
      Are such partial reforms better than none? The motivation for this
paper was our suspicion that the answer might actually be negative, that
the eÂ®ects of such a partial reform might be perverse, leading to higher
unemployment, lower output, and lower welfare for workers. Our intuition
was as follows:


      Â² Think of Â¯rms as hiring workers in entry-level jobs, Â¯nding out how
        good the matches are, and then deciding whether or not to keep the
        workers in higher productivity, regular, jobs.

      Â² Now think of reform as lowering Â¯ring costs for entry-level jobs while
        keeping them the same for regular jobs. This will have two eÂ®ects: It
        will make Â¯rms more willing to hire new workers, and see how they

  1
      See OECD [1999], and Blanchard and Portugal [2001].
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                                    3


         perform. But, second, it will make Â¯rms more reluctant to keep them
         in regular jobs: Even if a match turns out to be quite productive, a
         Â¯rm may still prefer to Â¯re the worker while the Â¯ring cost is low, and
         take a chance with a new worker.

       Â² One may therefore worry that the result of such a reform may be more
         low productivity entry-level jobs, fewer regular jobs, and so lower over-
         all productivity and output. Higher turnover in entry-level jobs may
         lead to higher, not lower, unemployment. And, even if unemployment
         comes down, workers may actually be worse oÂ®, going through many
         spells of unemployment and low productivity entry-level jobs, before
         obtaining a regular job.2


       Our purpose in this paper is to explore this argument, both theoretically
and empirically. Our interest is broader than just the eÂ®ects of Â¯xed duration
contracts in France. We see our paper as shedding some light on two larger
issues. First, the eÂ®ect of labor market institutions on the nature of the
labor market|a popular but often fuzzy theme. Second, the pitfalls of
partial labor market reforms.
       Our paper is organized as follows: We develop a formal model in Section
1. We solve it analytically in Section 2. We further explore its properties
by use of simulations in Section 3. The model makes clear that partial re-
form can indeed be perverse, increasing unemployment as well as decreasing
welfare. We then turn to the empirical evidence, looking at the eÂ®ects of
the introduction of Â¯xed duration contracts in France since the early 1980s.

   2
       The French have a word for such a succession of unemployment spells and low-

productivity jobs: They call this \precaritÂ¶e". There does not seem to be an equivalent

English expression|although there is an adjective, \precarious". \Insecurity" may come

close.
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                                         4


Section 4 shows the basic evolutions. Section 5 focuses on labor market
evolutions for 20-24 year olds, the group most aÂ®ected by the increase in
Â¯xed-duration contracts. The section looks at the evolution of transitions
between entry-level jobs, regular jobs, and unemployment, and also looks at
wages by contract type. The reforms appear to have substantially increased
turnover, without a substantial reduction in unemployment duration. If
anything, their eÂ®ect on welfare of young workers appears to have been
negative. Section 6 concludes.3


1       A simple model

In formalizing the labor market, we think of it as a market in which match-
idiosyncratic productivity shocks lead to separations and new hires. In that
context, we think of employment protection as layoÂ® costs, aÂ®ecting both
the layoÂ® decision and the nature of bargaining between workers and Â¯rms.
        In this section, we describe the model, derive the Bellman equations, and
characterize the equilibrium conditions.


1.1 Assumptions

The economy has a labor force of mass 1. There is a constant Â°ow of en-
trants equal to s, and each individual retires with instantaneous probability
(Poisson parameter) s, so the Â°ow of retirements is equal to the Â°ow of
entrants.

    3
        Throughout, our focus is on the economic eÂ®ects of the introduction of Â¯xed duration

contracts, not on their political economy implications. These political economy issues,

which are highly relevant to the design of employment protection reforms, have been

studied by Gilles Saint-Paul in a series of contributions, in particular Saint-Paul [1996]

and Saint-Paul [2000].
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                                          5


         Firms are risk neutral value maximizers. They can create a position
at cost k, and then operate it forever.4 They can always Â¯ll the position
instantaneously, by hiring a worker from the pool of unemployed. In other
words, the matching technology has \workers waiting at the gate".5 The
number of positions in the economy is determined by free entry, and thus
by the condition that there is zero net proÂ¯t. The interest rate is equal to
r.
         New matches all start with productivity equal to y0 . Productivity then
changes with instantaneous probability Â¸. The new level of productivity y
is drawn from a distribution with cumulative distribution function F (y) and
expected value Ey. y is then constant until the worker retires.
         Nothing in the algebra depends on it, but it is natural to think of y0
as smaller than Ey. This captures the idea that workers start in low pro-
ductivity, \entry-level" jobs, and, if they are not laid oÂ®, move on to higher
productivity, \regular" jobs. The assumption that, after the Â¯rst draw, pro-
ductivity is constant until the worker retires, is also inessential but captures
in the simplest way the notion that regular jobs are likely to last much longer
than entry-level jobs.
         When productivity changes from y0 to y, the Â¯rm can decide either
to lay oÂ® the worker|and hire a new worker in an entry-level job with
productivity y0 |or keep him in a regular job, with productivity y (until the
worker retires, at which point the Â¯rm hires a new worker with productivity
y0 .)
         At the center of our model and crucial to the Â¯rm's decisions are state-
imposed Â¯ring costs. We take them to be pure waste (think administrative

     4
         Allowing Poisson stochastic depreciation for positions would introduce an additional

parameter, but not change anything of substance.
     5
         The eÂ®ects of matching frictions on the equilibrium are well understood. Leaving

them out makes it easier to focus on the distortions implied by employment protection.
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                                       6


and legal costs) rather than transfers.6 The Â¯ring cost associated with an
entry-level job (i.e. up to and including the time at which the productivity
level changes from y0 to y) is c0 . The Â¯ring cost associated with a regular
job (i.e. starting just after the change in productivity from y0 to y) is c.
Separations due to retirement are not subject to Â¯ring costs.

       We can look at the same labor market from the point of view of the work-
ers. Workers are risk neutral, with discount rate equal to r, and they retire
with instantaneous probability s. By normalization, the Â°ow utility of being
unemployed is equal to 0. New workers enter the labor market unemployed.
They look for an entry-level job, which they Â¯nd with probability x, where
x = h=u, with h being the Â°ow of hires, and u being the unemployment rate.
Their entry-level job comes to an end with instantaneous probability Â¸, at
which time they are either laid oÂ®, or retained in a regular job. If they are
laid oÂ®, they become unemployed, and look for another entry-level job. The
model therefore generates a work life-cycle, in which young workers typically
go through a succession of unemployment spells and entry-level jobs until
they obtain a regular job, which they keep until they retire.
       The Â°ow into unemployment is composed of new entrants and of those
workers who are laid oÂ® at the end of their entry-level job. The Â°ow out of
unemployment is equal to the number of workers hired in new entry-level
jobs. All regular jobs are Â¯lled from within, and all regular jobs end with
retirement.

       The only element of the model left to specify is wage determination.

   6
       What we need is that at least some component of Â¯ring costs be waste. The implica-

tions of thinking about Â¯ring costs as waste or as transfers, and the scope for bonding to

cancel the eÂ®ects of the transfer component, are well understood. See for example Lazear

[1990]. We think that there is enough evidence of waste and limited bonding to warrant

our assumption.
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                                      7


We assume that wages, both in entry-level and in regular jobs, are set by
symmetric Nash bargaining, with continuous renegotiation. All entry-level
jobs have the same level of productivity y0 and thus pay the same wage w0 .
Regular jobs have diÂ®erent levels of productivity; the wage in a regular job
with productivity y is denoted w(y).
       Given the way we have set up the model, distortions in this economy
come only from the presence of the two Â¯ring costs, c and c0 . Our focus in
this paper will be on the eÂ®ects of a decrease in c0 given c, i.e. of a decrease
in the Â¯ring costs associated with entry-level jobs, keeping unchanged the
Â¯ring costs associated with regular jobs.7


1.2 Bellman equations

Consider Â¯rst the Bellman equations characterizing the Â¯rm. Let V0 be
the expected present value of proÂ¯ts from a position currently Â¯lled as an
entry-level job (the value of an entry-level job for short), a job with cur-
rent productivity equal to y0 . Let V (y) be the value of a regular job with
productivity equal to y. Let y Â¤ be the threshold level of productivity above
which the Â¯rm keeps a worker, and below which it lays him oÂ®.
       V0 is given by:
                                                     Z   1
               rV0 = (y0 Â¡ w0 ) Â¡ c0 Â¸F (y Â¤ ) + Â¸           (V (y) Â¡ V0 )dF (y)
                                                     yÂ¤

       The Â¯rst term on the right gives Â°ow proÂ¯t. The second gives the Â¯ring
cost associated with terminating the entry-level job, times the probability

   7
       Note that our assumption that regular jobs are not subject to productivity shocks

implies that the only role of c, the Â¯ring cost associated with regular jobs, is to aÂ®ect

wage bargaining in regular jobs, not layoÂ®s from regular jobs. Allowing for productivity

shocks to regular jobs would complicate the algebra, generate a richer structure of Â°ows,

but not change anything of substance.
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                                      8


that the worker is laid oÂ®|itself equal to the probability of a productivity
change, times the probability that y is less than the threshold value y Â¤ . The
third term reÂ°ects the expected change in the value of the job if the worker is
kept in a regular job. (Note the absence of a term reÂ°ecting the probability
that the worker retires. If the worker retires while in an entry-level job, the
Â¯rm can replace him instantaneously at no cost by a worker with the same
productivity, so this term is equal to s(V0 Â¡ V0 ) = 0.) The sum of these
three terms must be equal to the annuity value of an entry level job, rV0
   V (y) is given in turn by:


                      rV (y) = (y Â¡ w(y)) + s(V0 Â¡ V (y))

   The Â¯rst term on the right gives Â°ow proÂ¯t if productivity is equal to y.
The second term reÂ°ects the change in value if the worker retires and the
Â¯rm must hire a new worker at productivity level y0 . The sum of the two
must be equal to the annuity value of a regular job, rV (y).

   Turn to the Bellman equations for a worker. Let V0e denote the expected
present value of utility for a worker currently in an entry-level job (the value
of being in an entry-level job for short), V u the present value of utility for a
worker currently unemployed (the value of being unemployed for short), and
V e (w(y)) is the value of being employed in a regular job with productivity y.
Note that V u is also the expected lifetime utility of an entrant in the labor
market; for this reason, it is a natural measure of welfare in this model.
   V0e is given by:


                                                   Z   1
    rV0e = w0 + Â¸F (y Â¤ )(V u Â¡ V0e ) Â¡ sV0e + Â¸           (V e (w(y)) Â¡ V0e )dF (y)
                                                   yÂ¤


   The Â¯rst term on the right is the wage for an entry-level job. The second
is the probability that the job ends, times the change in value from going
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                             9


from employment to unemployment. The third reÂ°ects the loss in value from
retirement. The fourth reÂ°ects the expected change in value if the worker
is retained in a regular job. The sum of these terms is equal to the annuity
value of the value of being in an entry-level job.
      V e (w(y)) is given by:


                         rV e (w(y)) = w(y) Â¡ sV e (w(y))

      The worker receives the wage associated with productivity level y, until
he retires, in which case he loses the value of being employed in a regular
job. The sum of these terms is equal to the annuity value of being employed
in a regular job.
      Finally, V u is given by:


                            rV u = x(V0e Â¡ V u ) Â¡ sV u

      The Â¯rst term is equal to the probability of being hired in an entry-level
job, the second the probability of retiring while unemployed, times the loss
in value from retirement. The sum of these terms must be equal to the
annuity value of being unemployed.


1.3 Equilibrium conditions

The model imposes four equilibrium conditions. The Â¯rst is the free entry
condition, that the value of a new position be equal to the cost of creating
it:


                                      V0 = k                               (1:1)

      The second is that, at the threshold level of productivity, the Â¯rm be
indiÂ®erent between keeping the worker, or laying him oÂ®, paying the Â¯ring
cost, and hiring a new worker:
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                            10




                               V (y Â¤ ) = V0 Â¡ c0                          (1:2)

    The third is the Nash bargaining condition for entry-level jobs. A worker
who loses an entry-level job loses V0e Â¡ V u . A Â¯rm which lays oÂ® a worker
in an entry-level job loses V0 Â¡ V0 + c0 = c0 . This implies:


                                V0e Â¡ V u = c0                             (1:3)

    The fourth is the Nash bargaining condition for regular jobs. A worker
who loses a regular job loses V e (w(y)) Â¡ V u . A Â¯rm which lays oÂ® a worker
in a regular job loses V (y) Â¡ V0 + c. The Nash condition therefore takes the
form:


                       V e (w(y)) Â¡ V u = V (y) Â¡ V0 + c                   (1:4)

    We now turn to a characterization of the equilibrium.


2   The equilibrium

The equilibrium is easiest to characterize by focusing on two variables, V u ,
the value of being unemployed, and y Â¤ , the threshold level of productivity
below which workers are laid-oÂ®.
    One can then think of the equilibrium in terms of two relations. The
Â¯rst, which we shall call the \layoÂ® relation", gives threshold productivity y Â¤
as a function of labor market conditions, summarized by V u , and of the two
Â¯ring costs c and c0 . The second, which we shall call the \hiring relation"
gives V u , the value of being unemployed as a function of yÂ¤ and the two
Â¯ring costs c and c0 . Together the two relations determine V u and yÂ¤ . Once
this is done, all other variables can easily be derived, and so can the eÂ®ects
of changes in Â¯ring costs.

2.1 The layoÂ® relation

The condition determining the choice of the threshold productivity value y Â¤
by the Â¯rm is given by (1.2). Using equation (1.4), it can be rewritten as:


                  (V (y Â¤ ) Â¡ V0 + c0 ) + (V e (w(y Â¤ )) Â¡ V u ) = c Â¡ c0     (2:1)

     Note that the right side gives the total surplus (i.e the surplus to the
Â¯rm and the surplus to the worker from staying together rather than sepa-
rating) from a match with productivity y Â¤ . Were the choice of the threshold
productivity level privately eÂ±cient, the threshold productivity level would
be chosen so that the total surplus was equal to zero. As (2.1) shows, unless
c Â¡ c0 is equal to zero, this is not the case here. If c exceeds c0 , so c Â¡ c0
is positive, some workers will be laid-oÂ® despite the fact that keeping them
would yield a positive total surplus. The source of the distortion is clear: If
c is higher than c0 , the worker, if kept in a regular job, will be in a stronger
bargaining position and thus be able to extract a higher wage. Anticipating
this, the Â¯rm will only keep jobs where the surplus is suÂ±ciently large to
oÂ®set this increase in the worker's bargaining power.
     Using the Bellman equations to derive V (y Â¤ ) + V (w(yÂ¤ )), together with
the free entry condition V0 = k, gives the Â¯rst relation between y Â¤ and V u :

                         y Â¤ + sk
                                  Â¡ V u Â¡ k = Â¡c0 + (c Â¡ c0 )                 (2:2)
                           r+s

     We shall refer to this relation as the \layoÂ® relation" between yÂ¤ and
V   u.   The left side gives the total gross surplus (i.e. ignoring Â¯ring costs) of
a match of productivity y Â¤ . The Â¯rst term is the expected value of output.
The next two terms subtract the outside options of workers and Â¯rms.
     The two terms on the right side show the two roles of c0 in determining
y Â¤ . If the layoÂ® decision were privately eÂ±cient, only the Â¯rst term would
be present: The Â¯rm would choose y Â¤ so that the net surplus on a job with
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                            12


productivity y Â¤ was equal to zero. The second term reÂ°ects the private
distortion due to bargaining. It implies that, if c is higher than c0 , then y Â¤
will be (privately) ineÂ±ciently high.
   We can now look at the eÂ®ects of Vu , c and c0 on y Â¤ . The derivatives
are as follows:

                                dy Â¤
                                     = (r + s)
                                dV u
   The higher the value of being unemployed V u , the higher must be the
productivity of the marginal match.

                               dy Â¤
                                    = Â¡2(r + s)
                               dc0
   The lower the Â¯ring cost for entry-level jobs, c0 , the higher the threshold
(and also the larger the deviation of the threshold y Â¤ from its privately
eÂ±cient level, thus the larger the overdestruction).


2.2 The hiring relation

The derivation of the second relation between V u and y Â¤ starts with the
Nash bargaining condition for entry-level jobs, equation (1.3). Adding and
subtracting V0 , this equation can be rewritten as:


                         (V0e + V0 ) Â¡ (V0 + V u ) = c0

   Note that the right side is equal to the surplus from a new match. The
Â¯rst term in parentheses is the expected value of output from the match.
The second term in parentheses is equal to the sum of the outside option of
the worker and the Â¯rm. Note that, again, this condition is not (privately)
eÂ±cient. Firms should hire workers until the surplus from a match was equal
to zero. This is not the case here: The surplus is only driven down to c0 ,
not to zero. Just as before, this distortion reÂ°ects the increased bargaining
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                               13


power of workers coming from renegotiation in the presence of Â¯ring costs.
   Using the Bellman equations to replace V0e + V0 , together with the free
entry condition V0 = k gives:


                Z   1   y + sk
  y0 + sk + Â¸                  dF (y) Â¡ (r + s + Â¸(1 Â¡ F (y Â¤ )))(V u + k) =
                   yÂ¤    r+s
                                                  Â¸F (y Â¤ )c0 + (r + s + Â¸)c0 (2.3)

   This gives the second relation between V u , y Â¤ , and c0 (c does not appear
here). In eÂ®ect, it gives the value of being unemployed such that the wages
set in bargaining, and by implication, the present value of proÂ¯ts associated
with a new position just cover the cost of creating that position and hiring
the worker. We shall call it the \hiring relation".
   Up to a discount factor (r + s + Â¸), the left side gives the total gross
surplus from creating a new job and hiring a worker (gross of the Â¯ring cost
which may have to be paid if the productivity shock turns out to be lower
than the threshold).
   Turning to the right side, note that there are two terms in c0 . Were
hiring privately eÂ±cient, then only the Â¯rst term on the right side would
be present. Hiring would take place until the total gross surplus was equal
to the expected Â¯ring cost (the probability that Â¯ring takes place times the
Â¯ring cost). The second term reÂ°ects the distortion coming from the eÂ®ect
of c0 on the bargaining position of workers.
   We can now look at the eÂ®ects of y Â¤ and c0 on V u . The eÂ®ect of y Â¤ on
V u is given by:


                                   dV u                            yÂ¤ + sk
       (r + s + Â¸(1 Â¡ F (y Â¤ )))        = Â¸f (y Â¤
                                                  )(V u
                                                        + k Â¡ c0 Â¡         )
                                   dyÂ¤                              r+s

   The sign of the derivative appears ambiguous: An increase in y Â¤ leads
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                                   14


both to a higher expected output in continuing jobs, but also to a higher
probability that jobs are terminated. But, in fact, we can say more, and
this will be important later on:
       At the equilibrium (i.e. at the intersection with the Â¯rst relation, (2.2)),
the derivative is given by:

                                            dV u
                (r + s + Â¸(1 Â¡ F (y Â¤ )))        = Â¡Â¸f(y Â¤ )(c Â¡ c0 ) Â· 0
                                            dy Â¤
       If both (c Â¡ c0 ) and the density function f(y Â¤ ) are diÂ®erent from zero,
then an increase in y Â¤ leads to a decrease in V u . If either c = c0 or f(yÂ¤ ) = 0,
then V u is independent of y Â¤ . The intuition is as follows: As we saw earlier,
if c = c0 , the layoÂ® decision is privately eÂ±cient, so a small change in y Â¤
has no eÂ®ect on the surplus and thus no eÂ®ect on the feasible Vu . If c > c0
however, the marginal regular job generates a positive surplus, so an increase
in y Â¤ , if it leads to an increase in the layoÂ® rate (i.e. if f(y Â¤ ) > 0) leads to
a smaller total surplus, requiring a decrease in the feasible Vu .
       Now consider the eÂ®ect of c0 on Vu (given y Â¤ ). From (2.3):

                                         dV u
             (r + s + Â¸(1 Â¡ F (y Â¤ )))        = Â¡(r + s + Â¸) Â¡ Â¸F (y Â¤ ) < 0
                                         dc0
       An increase in c0 decreases the feasible value of being unemployed, V u .
There are two separate eÂ®ects at work here. The Â¯rst, captured by Â¡Â¸F (y Â¤ ),
is a direct cost eÂ®ect: An increase in c0 increases Â¯ring costs actually paid
by Â¯rms, and therefore increases waste, leading to a decrease in the feasible
value of V u . The second, captured by (r + s + Â¸), reÂ°ects the eÂ®ects of Â¯ring
costs through bargaining. Both eÂ®ects require new matches to generate a
larger surplus. In equilibrium, this is achieved through a lower value of V u .8

   8
       This is a familiar result from bargaining or eÂ±ciency wage models, (for example

Shapiro and Stiglitz [1984], or more recently Caballero and Hammour [1996]), that, in

equilibrium, unemployment plays the role of a market \discipline device". In these mod-
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                                        15


2.3 The equilibrium

The two relations we have just derived are drawn in Figure 1. The Â¯rst
relation, (2.2), the \layoÂ® relation", is upward sloping: The higher V u , the
higher the threshold y Â¤ . The second relation, the \hiring relation", is either
Â°at or downward sloping (it is drawn as downward sloping here), at least
around the equilibrium: V u is either invariant to, or a decreasing function
of, y Â¤ . Together the two relations determine the threshold productivity level
and the value of being unemployed. The equilibrium is given by point A.
    The eÂ®ects of a partial reform of employment protection, i.e. the eÂ®ects
of a decrease in c0 on y Â¤ and on V u , keeping c constant, are then easy
to derive. The layoÂ® relation shifts to the right: For given V u , the lower
value of c0 makes it more attractive to layoÂ® entry-level workers, and thus
increases y Â¤ . The hiring relation condition shifts up: For given y Â¤ , lower c0
leads to a higher value of V u , both because of the reduction in costs, and
because of the decrease in the bargaining power of entry-level workers.
    The new equilibrium is given by point B. It is clear that, while y Â¤
unambiguously increases, the eÂ®ect on V u is ambiguous. This is because
there are two distortions at work, and they work in opposite directions.

    Â² On the one hand, the decrease in c0 leads to an increase in (c Â¡ c0 )
       and thus to an increase in the distortion aÂ®ecting the layoÂ® relation
       (a distortion which depends on the bargaining power in regular jobs
       relative to entry-level jobs). This tends to decrease V u .

    Â² On the other hand, the decrease in c0 leads to a decrease in the dis-
       tortion aÂ®ecting the hiring relation (a distortion which depends on
       the bargaining power of workers in entry-level jobs). This tends to
       increase V u .

els, the zero proÂ¯t condition ties down the wage. Any factor which increases the wage

given reservation utility requires, in equilibrium, a decrease in reservation utility.

    To see the two eÂ®ects more clearly, suppose Â¯rst that (c Â¡ c0 ) is equal
to zero to start. In this case the Â¯rst distortion is absent and, as we saw,
small changes in y Â¤ have no eÂ®ect on V u in the hiring relation. Thus, the
only eÂ®ect of a decrease in c0 on V u is through its direct eÂ®ect in the hiring
relation relation: By both decreasing waste and decreasing the bargaining
power of entry-level workers, the decrease in c0 leads to an unambiguous
increase in V u .
    This case is represented in Figure 2. We know from above that, if (c Â¡
c0 ) = 0, the hiring relation is Â°at at the equilibrium. The decrease in c0 shifts
the hiring relation condition up: Lower costs and lower bargaining power by
entry-level workers lead to a higher equilibrium value of V u . The decrease
in c0 shifts the layoÂ® relation to the right: For given V u , a decrease in c0
makes layoÂ®s more attractive, leading to an increase in y Â¤ . The equilibrium
moves from A to B, with higher V u , and a higher threshold, y Â¤ .

    When (c Â¡ c0 ) is positive instead, the eÂ®ect of the decrease in c0 on
the Â¯rst distortion becomes relevant. The decrease in (c Â¡ c0 ) leads to an
increase in the Â¯rst distortion, and thus, other things equal, to a decrease
in V u . The strength of this eÂ®ect is proportional to (c Â¡ c0 )f (y Â¤ ) and is
thus increasing in the density evaluated at the equilibrium{in the number
of entry-level jobs which are (ineÂ±ciently) terminated as a result of the
increase in y Â¤ . If either (c Â¡ c0 ) or f(yÂ¤ ) are suÂ±ciently large, this adverse
eÂ®ect can dominate. Figure 3 is drawn on the assumption that f(y) is very
large around y = y Â¤ , so the hiring relation is (nearly) vertical. In this case,
a decrease in c0 does not shift the hiring relation. But, as before, it shifts
the layoÂ® relation to the right: For given V u , a decrease in c0 makes layoÂ®s
more attractive, leading to an increase in y Â¤ . The equilibrium moves from
                              0
A to B, with lower value V u , and an unchanged threshold, yÂ¤ .
    To summarize, we have a Â¯rst answer to our initial question. If (c Â¡ c0 )
or/and f (y Â¤ ) are suÂ±ciently large, a partial reform may indeed lead to an

increase in excess turnover, and, by implication, to a decrease in the value
of being unemployed.9


2.4 Other wage setting assumptions

We have assumed symmetric Nash bargaining. It is easy to extend the
analysis to allow for diÂ®erential bargaining power, both between Â¯rms and
workers, and between workers in entry-level and in regular jobs. The results
of this extension are straightforward. The higher the bargaining power of
workers in regular jobs relative to that of workers in entry-level jobs, the
stronger the eÂ®ect of a decrease in c0 on the Â¯rst distortion, the more likely
it is that partial reform leads to a decrease rather than an increase in welfare.
       We have also examined the eÂ®ects of a minimum wage constraint. As we
shall discuss and explain below when presenting simulations, under the Nash
bargaining assumptions, decreases in V u are associated with an increase in
w0 . Thus, a constraint which prevents the wage from decreasing, such as a
minimum wage constraint, will not be binding, and will not rule out perverse
eÂ®ects of partial reform on welfare (A constraint which prevents the wage
from increasing will increase welfare; but this does not seem to be the right
representation of a minimum wage constraint.)

2.5 Other implications

Given the equilibrium values of y Â¤ and V u , it is straightforward to derive
the other variables of the model. For example:

       Â² The layoÂ® rate is given by Â¸F (y Â¤ ), so a decrease in c0 , which, as we
         have seen, unambiguously increases y Â¤ , unambiguously increases the

   9
       Note that, for values of the parameters that give rise to this eÂ®ect, the value of c0 that

maximizes V u will be less than c but positive. Thus, this can be seen as an argument for

partial \partial reform" (i.e. some decrease in c0 from c, but not all the way to zero)...
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                           18


      layoÂ® rate.

    Â² Using the condition that (V0e Â¡ V u ) = c0 , the hiring rate from unem-
      ployment x is given by x = (r + s)V u =c0 . Thus, if reform is welfare
      improving|if V u increases when c0 decreases|we know that x in-
      creases, equivalently, unemployment duration decreases. But the eÂ®ect
      is ambiguous in general.

    Â² The unemployment rate is given by u(x + s Â¡ (Â¸F (yÂ¤ )x)=(Â¸ + s)) =
      s. Even if unemployment duration decreases (x increases), higher
      turnover (F (y Â¤ ) increases) implies an ambiguous eÂ®ect on the unem-
      ployment rate.

    Â² From the Nash bargaining conditions, the values of being employed in
      an entry-level job, of being employed in a regular job with productivity
      equal to the threshold, and of being unemployed, are related by V0e Â¡
      V u = c0 and V e (w(y Â¤ )) Â¡ V0e = c Â¡ 2c0 . Thus, a decrease in c0 makes
      entry-level jobs more like unemployment (decreasing c0 ), and entry-
      level jobs less like regular jobs (increasing c Â¡ 2c0 ). In this sense, a
      reduction in c0 leads to increased dualism in the labor market.

    To fully characterize the eÂ®ects of the decrease in c0 on the diÂ®erent
dimensions of our economy, it is more convenient to turn to simulations.
This is what we do in the next section.


3   Simulations

Our goal in this section is to show the eÂ®ects of partial reform both on the
work life-cycle of an individual worker, as well as on macro aggregates, from
unemployment to GDP.
    We think of the unit time period as one month, and choose the param-
eters as follows:
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                        19


   Â² We normalize the level of output on an entry-level job, y0 to be equal
     to 1.

   Â² We take k to be equal to 24, implying a ratio of capital to annual
     output on an entry-level job of 2.

   Â² We take the monthly real interest rate, r, to be equal to 1%. Together
     with the two previous assumptions, this implies a share of labor in
     output on entry-level jobs, of (1-.01*24) = 76%.

   Â² We take the monthly probability of exogenous separation (\retire-
     ment") s, to be equal to 1.5%.

   Â² We take the monthly probability of a productivity change on an entry-
     level job, Â¸ to be equal to 10%. This implies an expected duration of
     an entry-level job of about a year.

   Â² We take the distribution of productivity on regular jobs to be uniform,
     distributed on [m Â¡ 1=2f; m + 1=2f ], thus with mean m, and density
     f. The use of a uniform distribution makes particularly transparent
     the inÂ°uence of the density f on the eÂ®ects of partial reform.

   Â² To capture the notion that regular jobs are more productive, we set
     the mean m equal to 1.4. (Because jobs below the threshold are ter-
     minated, the mean of the observed distribution will be higher.)

   Â² Because our theoretical analysis in the previous section showed that
     the density function plays a crucial role in determining the outcome,
     we look at the eÂ®ects of reform for diÂ®erent values of f . The graphs
     below show the results of reform for values of f varying from 1 to 6.

   Â² We choose the Â¯ring cost on regular jobs, c, equal to 24|which, in
     most simulations, represent about a year and a half of average output.

      We shall discuss the legal and empirical evidence for France in the
      next section; we believe this to be a reasonable estimate.

   Our simulations then focus on the eÂ®ects of a decrease in c0 . If c0 is
either too large or too small, the equilibrium may be at a corner, i.e. at
a point where yÂ¤ lies outside the support of the productivity distribution
for regular jobs. In those cases, changes in c0 have no eÂ®ect on the layoÂ®
rate; their eÂ®ect takes place only through bargaining. While these corner
equilibria are interesting, we limit the presentation of results to the range
where there is an interior solution, so changes in y Â¤ aÂ®ect the layoÂ® rate.
The results below are presented for the range where c0 decreases from 6 to
2 months of output. The results are presented in Figures 4a, 4b, and 5.

   Figures 4a and 4b show the eÂ®ects of partial reform on diÂ®erent aspects
of a worker's individual experience. Figure 4a plots V u , the value of being
unemployed, F (y Â¤ ), the probability that the worker is laid-oÂ® at the end of
an entry-level job, x the monthly hiring rate from unemployment, and Tu ,
the expected time to a regular job starting from unemployment. Figure 4b
gives the behavior of wages in entry-level and regular jobs. These wages are
given by w(y) = a + 0:5y and w0 = a0 + 0:5y0 respectively. Figure 4b plots
the two constant terms a and a0 |which give the levels of wages for a given
level of productivity.
   For each 3D box, the Â¯ring cost c0 is plotted on the y axis, decreasing
as one goes away from the origin. The density function f is plotted on the
x axis, with the density decreasing as one goes away from the origin. The
variable of interest is plotted on the vertical axis.
   Start with V u in Figure 4a. For low density|low f|a decrease in c0
increases V u . But, for high density f , it decreases V u . The basic intuition
was given in the previous section. When f is low, the adverse eÂ®ects of
reform on excess turnover are small, and workers are better oÂ®. When f is
high, the adverse eÂ®ects of excess turnover dominate.

       This intuition is conÂ¯rmed by looking at x and F (y Â¤ ). While the eÂ®ect
of reform on x is theoretically ambiguous, in our simulation reform always
increases x, and thus decreases unemployment duration. It also increases
the probability that an entry-level job will lead to a layoÂ® (this eÂ®ect is
theoretically unambiguous). This second eÂ®ect is stronger when density is
high. For f = 6, the probability increases from 0.3 to 0.8; for f = 1, the
probability increases from 0.45 to 0.75.
       The last box in Figure 4a shows that reform increases the average time
it takes a new entrant to get a regular job. The eÂ®ect is stronger when the
density is high. For f = 6, the expected time increases from two years to
nearly six years.

       Figure 4b gives the behavior of wages for regular and entry-level jobs for
a given level of productivity. The relative level of the two wages Â¯ts one's
prior: Higher Â¯ring costs lead to higher bargaining power and thus a higher
wage for regular jobs. But the eÂ®ect of a decrease in c0 is less intuitive at
Â¯rst:

       Â² One might have guessed (i.e we had guessed) that the decrease in the
         relative bargaining power of entry-level workers would lead to a de-
         crease in their wage relative to that of workers in regular jobs. This is
         not necessarily the case: In general equilibrium, the duration of unem-
         ployment changes, with diÂ®erential eÂ®ects on the two wages. Figure
         4b shows that the eÂ®ect of reforms on the wage in regular jobs has the
         same sign as the eÂ®ect on V u : Like V u , the wage may go up or down;
         this reÂ°ects the tight link between reservation utility and the wage set
         in Nash bargaining for regular jobs.10

  10
       It can be shown analytically that, in regions where reform is perverse|where V u goes

down when c0 goes down|w0 decreases with c0 .
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                                    22


       Â² Perhaps even more surprisingly, the wage for entry level jobs goes up
         as c0 goes down|the more so the higher the density. The way to
         understand this is in terms of bonding. The higher the density, the
         more a decrease in c0 decreases the probability of being kept in a
         regular job. Thus, the lower the \bond" workers in entry-level jobs
         are willing to pay in the form of low wages, or equivalently, the higher
         the wage they require to take an entry-level job.11 There is another
         countervailing eÂ®ect at work, lower bargaining power for workers in
         entry-level jobs, which leads to a decrease in the wage; but in our
         simulation, this eÂ®ect is dominated by the Â¯rst.


       Figure 5 shows what happens to the macroeconomic aggregates. The
Â¯rst box repeats the graph for V u in Figure 4. We can think here of V u
not as the value of being unemployed, but as average lifetime utility for a
worker in the economy, thus as a measure of welfare.
       The second box shows the eÂ®ects of reform on the unemployment rate,
and shows these eÂ®ects to be ambiguous. For low density, the combined
eÂ®ects of lower duration and only slightly higher turnover lead to a decrease
in unemployment. For high density, the eÂ®ect is ambiguous. Unemployment
Â¯rst goes up as c0 decreases, then goes down a bit. (This is a warning, if
there was a need, that what happens to utility and to unemployment need
not have the same sign. For high density, utility goes down strongly while
unemployment goes up and then down.)
       The third box plots the proportion of workers who are either unemployed
or employed in entry-level jobs. The idea is to get at the idea of \precarite",
the idea that the decrease in unemployment, if any, may come with a large
increase in low productivity jobs. This proportion increases with reform, for

I took a CDD was to have a shot at a real job later on." Liberation [2000].

all values of f. Again, it is stronger when f is high. In this sense, reform
indeed increases precarite.
         The last graph gives the value of GDP. For low density, the decrease
in the unemployment rate, together with the limited increase in low pro-
ductivity entry-level jobs, leads to an increase in output. For high density,
the larger increase in the proportion of entry-level jobs, and the roughly
constant unemployment rate, combine to lead to a decline in output|by
nearly 5% under our parameter assumptions. Another warning is therefore
in order here: What happens to output, to unemployment, and to utility,
can all be quite diÂ®erent.


4        The development of CDDs in France: Basic facts and evo-
         lutions

In France, regular contracts, called \Contrats a duree indeterminÂ¶ee", or
\CDI" for short, are subject to employment protection rules. Firms can
layoÂ® workers for one of two reasons: For \personal reasons", in which case
they have to show that the worker cannot do the job he or she was hired
for, or for \economic reasons", in which case, the Â¯rm must prove that it
needs to reduce its employment.12
         Barring serious negligence on the part of the worker, the Â¯rm must give
both a notice period and a severance payment to the worker. The notice pe-
riod is relatively short, 1 or 2 months depending on seniority. In the absence
of a speciÂ¯c contract between unions and Â¯rms, the amount of severance pay
set by law is also modest, typically 1/10 of a month per year of work, plus
1/15 of a month for years above 10 years. But Â¯rms perceive the costs to
be much higher, because of the administrative and legal steps required to
go through the process. The monetary equivalent of these costs (which are

    12
         A useful source on French labor legislation is the Lamy [2000].
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                                24


indeed waste from the point of view of Â¯rms and workers) is hard to assess,
but severance packages oÂ®ered by Â¯rms in exchange for a quick resolution
are typically much more generous than the legal minimum.13
      Since the late 1970s, successive governments have tried to reduce these
costs by introducing Â¯xed-duration contracts, called \Contrats Âµa durÂ¶ee de-
terminÂ¶ee", or CDDs. These contracts still require a severance payment, but
eliminate the need for a costly administrative and legal process.14


4.1 The history and the current rules

A brief history of CDDs goes as follows: CDDs were introduced in 1979.
With the election of a socialist government in 1981 and the passage of a
law in 1982, their scope was reduced: A list of 12 conditions was drawn,
and only under those conditions could Â¯rms use Â¯xed-duration contracts. In
1986, the 12 conditions were replaced by a general rule: CDDs should not
be used to Â¯ll a permanent position in the Â¯rm. The current architecture
dates for the most part to an agreement signed in March 1990.
      Under this agreement, CDDs can be oÂ®ered by Â¯rms for only one of
four reasons: (1) The replacement of an employee on leave (2) Temporary
increases in activity (3) Seasonal activities (4) Special contracts, aimed at
facilitating employment for targeted groups, from the young to the long term
unemployed. The list of special contracts has grown in the 1990s, as each
government has tried to improve labor market outcomes for one group or
another; some of these contracts require the Â¯rm to provide training, and
many come with subsidies to Â¯rms.
      CDDs are subject to a very short trial period, typically one month.
They have a Â¯xed duration, from 6 to 24 months depending on the speciÂ¯c

 13
      For a comparison of France with other OECD countries, see OECD [1999].
 14
      Poulain [1994] gives a detailed description of the rules governing CDDs.
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                                25


contract type. Mean duration is roughly one year. They typically cannot
be renewed, and, in any case, cannot be renewed beyond 24 months. If the
worker is kept, he or she must then be hired on a regular contract. If the
worker is not kept, he or she receives a severance payment equal to 6% of the
total salary received during the life of the contract (a law currently under
consideration would raise this amount to 10%).
      Two other dimensions of these contracts are relevant here:
      First, the law states that the wage paid to a worker under a CDD should
be the same as the wage which would be paid to a worker doing the same
job under a CDI. This is obviously diÂ±cult to verify and enforce, and, as we
shall see, it appears not to be satisÂ¯ed in practice.
      Second, at the end of a CDD, workers qualify for unemployment bene-
Â¯ts. Unemployment beneÂ¯ts start at either 40% of the previous gross salary,
plus a Â¯xed sum, or 57.4% of previous gross salary, whichever is more ad-
vantageous. The beneÂ¯ts then decrease over time; the decrease is faster the
younger the worker, and the shorter the work experience. For example, a
worker who has been working for 4 out of the previous 8 months, gets ben-
eÂ¯ts for 4 months; a worker who has been working for 6 out of the previous
12 months gets 4 months with full beneÂ¯ts, then 3 months at 85%, then
nothing, and so on for workers with longer employment histories. In short,
workers can alternate between CDDs and unemployment spells, and receive
beneÂ¯ts while unemployed.
      For our purposes, the history and the speciÂ¯c set of rules regulating
CDDs has two main implications:

      Â² One should think of what has happened since the 1980s primarily as
        an increase in Â¯xed-duration contracts at the extensive margin (an
        increase in the number of eligible workers and jobs), rather than as an
        increase in the intensive margin (a decrease in c0 ).15

       Â² The rather stringent rules governing CDDs (conditions, duration, non
          renewal) imply that, while the proportion of workers under CDDs has
          increased over time, it has not reached|and, unless rules are changed,
          will not reach|the levels observed in some other European countries,
          in particular Spain.16


4.2 Data sources

Our data, here and in the next section, come from \Enquetes Emploi", a
survey of about 1/300th of the French population, conducted annually by
INSEE, the French National Statistical Institute.
       Questions about CDI versus CDD status are only available from 1983 on,
so we only look at the evidence from 1983 to 2000. The design of the survey
and the wording of some of the questions were changed in 1990, leading to
discontinuities in some of the series in 1990; these discontinuities appear
clearly in some of the Â¯gures below.
       We use the \Enquetes Emploi" to look at the evolution of both stocks
and Â°ows. Measures of Â°ows can be constructed in two ways:

       Â² The 3-year panel data structure of the survey allows to follow two
          thirds of individuals across consecutive surveys, and so to measure
          their annual transitions. Panel-based transition probabilities (\panel
          transitions" for short) can be constructed from every year since 1984
          on, with one exception: Changes in survey design in 1990 make it
          impossible to compute transitions for 1990.


which shares some of the features of our model (but was developed independently), is

given in Cahuc and Postel-Vinay [2000].
  16
       For a description of the nature and the scope of Â¯xed-duration contracts in Spain, and

in Italy, see for example Guell-Rotllan and Petrongolo [2000], and Adam and Canziani

[1998].
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                                     27


       Â² In addition, from 1990 on, the survey includes a question asking for
         status 12 months earlier. Thus, except for 1999 when the answer
         to the question has not yet been tabulated, we can also construct
         retrospective transition probabilities (\retrospective transitions" for
         short) for each year since 1990.17

       For our purposes, namely assessing the evolutions (rather than the levels)
of transition probabilities over time, it is not clear which approach domi-
nates. As documented by many researchers, transitions based on retro-
spective information are subject to systematic memory biases.18 But these
memory biases are likely to be fairly stable over time. Panel based transi-
tion probabilities suÂ®er instead from some attrition bias. This bias, while
smaller, is more likely to change over time: An increase in the proportion
of workers with short duration jobs may well lead to an increase in attri-
tion. We therefore remain agnostic and present both the numbers for panel
based transitions from 1984 to 2000, and for retrospective information based
transitions for 1991 to 2000.


4.3 Basic evolutions

As a start, Figure 6 plots the evolution of CDD employment as a proportion
of total (salaried) employment, since 1983. It shows how this proportion
has increased from 1.4% of salaried employment in 1983 to 10.8% in 2000.

  17
       The question actually asks for status during each of the previous 12 months, thus

allowing for the construction of monthly probabilities|which are closer conceptually to

the instantaneous probabilities in the theoretical model. Because of well known issues

such as rounding up by respondents, these monthly probabilities are very noisy, and we

have not explored these data further.
  18
       For more on the diÂ®erences between the two sets of transition probabilities in the

context of Enquetes Emploi, see Magnac and Visser [1999], and Philippon [2000].

At the same time, the graph makes clear that the speciÂ¯c conditions under
which Â¯rms can oÂ®er CDDs have limited their scope; by contrast, in Spain
today, more than 30% of salaried employment is in the form of Â¯xed-duration
contracts.
   While the proportion of CDDs in total employment remains limited, the
introduction and development of CDDs have completely changed the nature
of the labor market for the young. Figure 7 shows the evolution of the
proportions of individuals, age 20-24, who are either employed under a CDI,
employed under a CDD, or unemployed, or students, from 1983 to 2000.
The Â¯gure yields a number of conclusions:

   Â² The proportion of students in this age group has increased dramati-
     cally, from 21% in 1983 to 49% in 2000. This increase is due in large
     part to a deliberate policy aimed at increasing the proportion of chil-
     dren taking and passing the baccalaureat (the exam at the end of high
     school); this proportion has increased over the same period from 28%
     to 59%. But it is also a reÂ°ection of the poor labor market prospects
     faced by the young; indeed, as unemployment has decreased since the
     mid-1990s, so has the proportion of students. This indicates that, for
     this age group, unemployment numbers should be interpreted with
     caution.

   Â² The proportion of unemployed in a given 5-year cohort has remained
     roughly constant, from 15% in 1983 to 16% in 1999, and down to 12%
     in 2000 (although, because of the steady decrease in participation, the
     unemployment rate has increased from 20% in 1983 to 32% in 1999,
     and 24% in 2000).

   Â² Most relevant for our purposes, the proportion of CDIs has sharply
     dropped while the proportion of CDDs has sharply increased. In 1983,
     60% of a cohort (equivalently 95% of those employed) were employed
     under CDIs; in 2000, the proportion was down to 21% (54% of those

           employed). And during the same period, the proportion of those em-
           ployed under CDDs went from 3.0% (5% of employment) to 17% (46%
           of employment).

         The same qualitative evolution is visible in other age groups, but its
quantitative eÂ®ect decreases across cohorts. The proportion of CDDs has
increased from 1.6% in 1983 to 10% in 2000 for the 25-29 cohort, from 1.1%
in 1983 to 6% in 2000 for the 30-34 cohort, and so on. For this reason, it
makes good sense to focus on market evolutions for the 20-24 cohort, and
this is what we do in the next section.19


5        Transitions, wages, and utility

We now look at labor market evolutions for 20-24 year olds, for the period
1983-2000, with the goal of learning something about the eÂ®ects of CDDs
on the labor market. Our approach is descriptive, and its limits are obvious:
         First, there has been many other institutional changes in the labor mar-
ket during that period, from the introduction of a minimum income Â°oor
(the RMI), to the reduction in social contributions on low wage workers, to
a number of other programs aimed at speciÂ¯c groups in the labor market.20
We believe however that, for the group we focus on below, the 20-24 age
group, the increase in the proportion of CDDs is indeed the dominant de-
velopment.

    19
         We have focused here at diÂ®erences by age group; one can take other cuts, such as

education. One might have expected the proportion of CDDs to decrease with the level

of education. This is not the case. In 2000, the proportion of CDDs was roughly the

same across education levels, probably reÂ°ecting the restrictions under which CDDs can

be used by Â¯rms.
    20
         For a description of some of the programs aimed at the youth, look for example at

Fougere et al. [2000].
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                           30


   Second, much of the evolution of unemployment during the period, either
for the 20-24 year olds or for the population at large, has been due not so
much to institutional changes but to macroeconomic factors. Until recently,
this would have raised a very serious identiÂ¯cation issue: From the early
1980s to the late 1990s, macroeconomic factors had led to a trend increase
in unemployment, making it very diÂ±cult to disentangle the eÂ®ects of that
trend from those of the trend increase in CDDs. Fortunately (both for
France, and for us), unemployment has started decreasing, so there is now
hope of disentangling the two. To see why and how, we start this section by
looking at aggregate evolutions.


5.1 Aggregate evolutions

The top panel of Figure 8 plots the evolution of the aggregate unemployment
rate in France since 1983. The triangles give the evolution of the oÂ±cial
unemployment rate (which conforms to the BIT deÂ¯nition); the squares give
the evolution of the unemployment rate obtained from Enquetes Emploi. For
our purposes, the relevant series (in the sense of a series consistent with the
other series we look at below) is that from Enquetes Emploi. That series
gives a more pessimistic assessment of the evolution of the labor market in
France than the series for the oÂ±cial rate. In 2000, the series implies an
unemployment rate of 11.7%, compared to an oÂ±cial rate of 9.7%. The
general picture is of a trend increase from 1983 to the mid-1990s, and of a
limited decrease since then.
   What is relevant to a worker in the labor market is not however the
unemployment rate per se, but the probabilities of becoming unemployed if
he is currently employed, or of becoming employed if he is currently unem-
ployed. The evolutions of these two transition probabilities are given in the
two bottom panels of Figure 8. For each panel, the series with squares gives

panel transitions, the series with triangles gives retrospective transitions.21
We draw two main conclusions from these two panels:

       Â² The 1980s appear diÂ®erent from the 1990s. In the 1980s, the transition
         probability from employment to unemployment barely increased, and
         the transition probability from unemployment to employment actually
         increased. By contrast, in the 1990s, the Â¯rst transition increased, and
         the second decreased: The labor market clearly became worse in both
         dimensions. This worsening surely had a strong eÂ®ect on the labor
         market for the 20-24 year olds we focus on below.

       Â² The panel transition from employment to unemployment was lower in
         2000 than in any previous year in the sample. The panel transition
         from unemployment to employment in 2000 was one of the highest in
         the sample. In other words, despite the fact that the unemployment
         rate was still high, labor market prospects were, from the point of
         view of an individual in the labor market, arguably the best since
         1984. Thus a comparison of endpoints|1984 with 2000|can help us
         separate out the role of cyclical and structural components. We shall
         us this below.

  21
       We discussed earlier why 1990 is missing for panel transitions, and why 1999 is missing

for retrospective transitions. Note that 1995 is also missing for panel transitions in Figure

8: The reason is that transitions computed from Enquetes Emploi are very diÂ®erent

from those in other years. Most of this is due to a program introduced in that year

which subsidized the reemployment of the older long-term unemployed, leading to a very

diÂ®erent pattern of Â°ows in 1995. Part of it appears to be due to other problems with the

data. We decided to exclude this year here and in most of the graphs below.

5.2 Transition probabilities for the 20-24 year olds

Figure 9 gives the evolution of transition probabilities between CDD em-
ployment, CDI employment, and unemployment, for 20-24 year olds, from
1984 to 1998. Each of the nine panels plots two series. The Â¯rst, in black,
give panel transitions; the second in grey gives retrospective transitions.
Transitions for year t refer to the change in status from March of year t Â¡ 1
to March of year t.
       We draw three main conclusions from this Â¯gure:

       Â² The three left panels show the transition probabilities from
         unemployment.22

         The probability of getting a CDI decreases in both subperiods (the
         1980s and the 1990s). The probability of getting a CDD increases
         in both subperiods. Both movements are clearly consistent with the
         theory.

         While the eÂ®ect is theoretically ambiguous, we saw that the dura-
         tion of unemployment was likely to decrease as the scope of CDDs
         increased. The probability of remaining unemployed indeed decreases
         in the 1980s. But there is no evidence of a further decrease in the
         1990s. (Note that the retrospective measure is much higher than the
         panel measure, but shows the same evolution). In other words, during
         the 1990s, the higher likelihood of getting a CDD rather than a CDI
         did not come with an overall increase in the probability of getting a
         job.

       Â² The three center panels show the transition probabilities from CDD
         employment.

  22
       The transition probabilities sum to less than one, as we do not report transitions to

self employment, internships, military status, student status, and other non participation.

     The probability of moving from a CDD to a CDI decreases in each of
     the two subperiods. The probability of remaining on a CDD (the same
     or another one) increases throughout the period, nearly doubling in
     each of the two subperiods (Recall that the level shifts between 1989
     to 1991, which are often large in the Â¯gure, reÂ°ect largely diÂ®erences
     in measurement.) Note, again, that while panel and retrospective
     transitions have rather diÂ®erent levels, their evolution is largely similar
     over time.
     The probability of becoming unemployed decreases steadily in the
     1980s. As we look at year-to-year transitions, this presumably re-
     Â°ects the higher probability of Â¯nding another job when the current
     CDD comes to an end. But, again, there appears to be a diÂ®erence
     across the two decades. In the 1990s, the transition probability does
     not exhibit much of a trend.

   Â² The three right panels of Figure 9 show transition probabilities from
     CDI employment. They are less central to our discussion (indeed in
     our formal model, these three transition probabilities were all equal
     to zero, by assumption). One evolution is however worth mentioning.
     One might have expected that allowing Â¯rms to use CDDs would have
     reduced the Â°ows from CDI employment. The top panel show that this
     has not been the case: The probability of keeping a CDI has decreased,
     not increased. This suggests that other factors than changes in Â¯ring
     costs have played a role in determining general trends in separations.

   One can construct similar tables for the other age groups. The qualita-
tive features are the same, but the evolutions are more muted the older the
age group. We do not report them here.
   To summarize: The transition probabilities give a picture of a labor
market for 20-24 year olds where the probability of getting a CDD has
steadily increased, the probability of getting a CDI has decreased, and the
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                           34


probability of staying or becoming unemployed shows no clear trend. In
this last dimension, there appears to be a diÂ®erence across the two decades.
The probabilities of becoming unemployed when on a CDD, or remaining
unemployed, both decrease in the 1980s, but show no further trend in the
1990s.


5.3 Expected time to a CDI

One way of summarizing the information from the transition matrices is to
compute the expected time to a CDI starting from diÂ®erent labor market
positions.
   To compute these expected times, we use, for each year, the estimated
transition matrix obtained using either panel data or retrospective informa-
tion, based on eight diÂ®erent states (CDI, CDD, unemployed, self employed,
student, intern, army, other non participation), for 20-24 year olds. Note
that this computation assumes static expectations in two dimensions. First
it assumes that future transition probabilities for 20-24 year olds will be the
same as this year's. Second, it ignores the fact that, as those currently 20
to 24 become older, the relevant transition probabilities will become those
relevant for the 25 to 29 year olds, and so on. This second bias leads to
an overestimation of the level of expected times to a CDI. But what we
care about here are changes over time, and this simple approach is likely to
capture them.
   The evolution of expected times for the 20-24 age group, starting either
from a CDD or from unemployment, is plotted in Figure 10.
   Starting from a CDD, the expected time to a CDI appears roughly con-
stant in the 1980s. Starting from unemployment, the expected time de-
creases slightly. This is the result of two oÂ®setting changes: On the one
hand, a decreased probability of getting a CDI starting either from unem-
ployment or from a CDD, leading to an increase in the expected time. On

the other, an increased probability of getting a CDD when unemployed, to-
gether with a higher probability of getting a CDI starting from a CDD than
starting from unemployment. In the 1980s, the two eÂ®ects roughly cancel
each other.
   The picture is diÂ®erent in the 1990s, where the expected time increases
signiÂ¯cantly until the late 1990s, declining partially thereafter. While the
expected time based on retrospective information is higher than the expected
time based on panel data, both series go up during the period. The expected
time from unemployment based on retrospective information increases from
4.8 years in 1990 to 8.2 years in 1996, to decline to 6.5 years in 2000; its
panel data counterpart goes from 4.0 to 6.0, down to 4.7 years in 2000.


5.4 Wages

A complete picture requires looking also at wages. To do so, we run a
standard wage regression, regressing for each year, from 1983 to 2000, the
logarithm of the monthly net wage on a set of controls|education (15 cat-
egories), age (10 categories) and a dummy equal to 1 if the worker is on a
CDD, 0 if on a CDI. Thus, we run, for each year:


                          log wi = Xi Â¯ + bD + Â²i

   Figure 11 plots the time series of estimated b's, from estimation of the
wage equation for each year from 1983 to 1998. Given age and education,
CDDs appear to pay about 20% less than CDIs. The evidence suggests also
that the gap between the two wages has increased over time, from 12% in
1983 to 29% in 1993, and to 22.5% in 2000.
   How should we interpret this decrease in the relative wage over time? In
our model, partial reform has two eÂ®ects on the wage of CDDs relative to
CDIs: The Â¯rst is a decrease in the bargaining power of CDDs, leading to
a decline in their wage. The second is a decline in bonding, in how low a

wage entry-level workers are willing to accept in order to have a chance at a
regular job. In our model also, a decrease in the relative wage for entry-level
jobs, is necessarily associated with an increase in V u . The intuition for this
is that if the wage goes down, the decline in bonding is small, the eÂ®ect
of reform on actual and excess turnover is limited, so the reform increases
welfare.
   Thus, if the economy conformed to our model, the Â¯nding that the wage
has decreased would be prima facie evidence that partial reform has been
welfare improving. There is however one important diÂ®erence between our
model and reality: In our model, all entry-level jobs have the same produc-
tivity. This is not the case in reality, and there is a plausible argument that
what has happened over time is the extension of the use of CDDs to jobs or
to workers with lower productivity. If this is the case, the decrease in the
wage we observe in the data may be due neither to bonding or bargaining,
but to a change in the nature of CDD jobs or CDD workers over time. We
expand on this point in the conclusion.


5.5 Values

In our model, the welfare eÂ®ects of partial reform are captured by what hap-
pens to V u , the expected present value of utility if currently unemployed. It
is tempting to construct an empirical counterpart and see how it has evolved
over time. This is what we do in this last subsection. More speciÂ¯cally, be-
cause not all entrants enter as unemployed, we construct not V u , but the
average value VÂ¹ , the average expected present value of utility for a 20-24
year old, and look at its evolution over time.
   The results of this exercise must obviously be interpreted with more than
a grain of salt: There are many assumptions and many steps involved in the
construction of VÂ¹ , all likely to imply substantial measurement error. Nev-
ertheless, we think this provides a rather transparent way of summarizing
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                                         37


what we have seen about the evolutions of transition probabilities and wages
in a single statistic.
       To compute V i , the expected present value of utility if currently in state
i, we proceed as follows. Let V i be the expected present value of utility
conditional on being in state i today. We consider Â¯ve states in our com-
putation (CDI, CDD, unemployed, intern, self employed).23 Let V be the
associated vector of utilities associated with the diÂ®erent states. Let A be
the transition matrix associated with these diÂ®erent states. Let w be the
vector of wages or wage equivalents associated with each state. Then, we
construct V as:

                                                 1
                                    V =w+           AV
                                                1+r
       Or equivalently,

                                                1    Â¡1
                                  V = (I Â¡         A) w
                                               1+r
       VÂ¹ is then constructed as:

                                               X
                                        VÂ¹ =       pi Vi

       where the pi are the proportions of individuals in state i, and sum to
one, and Vi are the elements of V .
       We focus on the 20-24 age group. For A, we use for each year the es-

  23
       Note that we exclude three states: student, army, and out of the labor force. If these

states were included, our results would be much stronger (i.e show a larger decline in VÂ¹ .)

This is because, if the Â°ow utility of being a student is assumed to be low relative to the

wage, the increase in the proportion of students would dominate the series, and lead to a

large downward trend in VÂ¹ . This trend however would be largely unrelated to the issue

at hand, namely the role of CDDs.

timated transition matrix obtained using either panel data or retrospective
information. Just as for the construction of expected times earlier, this com-
putation assumes static expectations in two dimensions, i.e. an unchanged
value of the matrix for a given age group over time, and an unchanged
transition matrix as individuals in the group get older. The justiÂ¯cation is
simplicity, and our belief that, as evolutions are qualitatively similar across
age groups, this should capture the relevant trends.
       For w, we normalize the CDI wage to 1 (i.e. we ignore general wage
growth over time). We take the CDD wage to be equal to 1 minus the
discount shown in Figure 11 for each year. Based on unemployment ben-
eÂ¯t rules, we use a value of 0.5 for the wage equivalent when unemployed.
Because the transition probabilities to other states are small, the other el-
ements of w play little role in the results; we assume a value of 1 for self
employment income, a value equal to the CDD wage for internships. We use
an annual interest rate of 12%.

    The results are presented in the top panel of Figure 12. The black line
gives the series for VÂ¹ using panel transitions, the grey line gives the series
using retrospective transitions.
       The general impression is one of little change in the 1980s, followed by
a steady worsening until the late 1990s, and a partial improvement at the
end. According to this measure, (and leaving aside the general increase in
real wages over time), the average welfare of the 20-24 year old is slightly
lower in 2000 than it was either in 1984, or (and this comparison is safer
given the changes in the survey in 1990) than in 1991.24
       Can we conclude from this that the eÂ®ects of CDDs have been perverse?
The answer is obviously not. Many other factors have been relevant during

  24
       Another Â¯nding, not reported here, is how much closer VCDD is to VU than to VCDI .

In that sense, the French labor market has become increasingly dual.

that period, and attributing all the change in VÂ¹ to the introduction of CDDs
would obviously be wrong. But we can make some progress:
   Clearly much of the decrease in VÂ¹ , especially in the 1990s, must have
been due to macroeconomic factors, rather than to the increase in the pro-
portion of CDDs. But here, the evidence from year 2000 is helpful. As we
saw earlier, in terms of aggregate transition probabilities, 2000 is arguably
the best year of the sample. Yet, in that year VÂ¹ is still lower than it was in
either 1984, or 1991. In short, the lower value of VÂ¹ in 2000 cannot easily be
attributed to macroeconomic factors.
   We can actually go one step further. Some of the changes in VÂ¹ are likely
to reÂ°ect structural changes in the labor market other than CDDs, changes
which might aÂ®ect all cohorts. In that case, attributing the decline in VÂ¹
over the sample to the introduction of CDDs would clearly be wrong. This
suggests looking not at the evolution of the average value VÂ¹ for the 20-24
age group, but rather at the evolution of this average value relative to the
average value for the whole labor force|which is much less aÂ®ected by the
introduction of CDDs.
   With this motivation, we plot the evolution of the ratio of the average
value for the 20-24 age group to the average value for the 20-59 age group
in the bottom panel of Figure 12 (We use the same wages for both groups,
thus not taking into account the age proÂ¯le of wages in computing the two
values. This would change the level, but not the evolution, of the ratio over
time). The graph has two main characteristics. First, a nearly continuous
decline in the relative value from 1984 to 1997. Then an increase, but to a
lower level than at the start of the sample.
   This suggests to us two conclusions. First, much of the evolution of
the relative value for the 20-24 age group reÂ°ects aggregate evolutions, the
long worsening and the recent improvement in the labor market: The young
suÂ®er more in a depressed labor market. Second, the fact that the value
remains lower in 2000 suggests that more has been at work. The extension of
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                            40


CDDs, which disproportionately aÂ®ects that group, is a plausible candidate
explanation for this underlying deterioration. Put more conservatively, there
is no evidence that the introduction and development of CDDs has improved
the relative welfare of those most aÂ®ected by it, namely the young.


6   Conclusions

We have looked at the eÂ®ects of the introduction of Â¯xed-duration contracts.
    On the theoretical side, we argued that the eÂ®ects of such partial reform
may be perverse, leading to higher turnover, and possibly lower welfare:
The excess turnover induced by the forced coexistence of Â¯xed-duration and
regular contracts can be high enough to oÂ®set the eÂ±ciency gains of improved
Â°exibility.
    On the empirical side, we looked at the evolution of labor market evo-
lutions for young workers in France since 1983. We found strong evidence
of increased turnover, and argued that, if anything, the eÂ®ect of the Â¯xed
duration contracts on the welfare of young workers appears to have been
negative.
    If our theoretical and empirical conclusions are valid, this suggests that,
at least from an economic viewpoint (i.e leaving aside political economy
implications), such partial reform may be a very poor substitute for broader
reform, i.e. an across the board reduction in Â¯ring costs for all workers.
    Many questions remain open for future research. To us, the most im-
portant may be how such a reform aÂ®ects the nature of the jobs oÂ®ered to
workers. We have assumed in our model that contracts had no impact on the
nature of the jobs created by Â¯rms. There are good theoretical and empirical
reasons to think they may. There are two potential eÂ®ects at work (which
parallel the two eÂ®ects at work on Â¯rms' decisions in our model). On the one
hand, lower costs on Â¯xed-duration contracts give more incentives for Â¯rms
to take more risks, design jobs which, associated with the right worker, lead
Perverse eÂ®ects of partial reform                                      41


to high productivity. On the other, lower costs on Â¯xed-duration contracts
may instead induce Â¯rms to design routine, low productivity jobs, which
they can Â¯ll through the use of Â¯xed-duration contracts. The wage evidence
we reviewed in our paper suggests that this second eÂ®ect might indeed be
at work.
