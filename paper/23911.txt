                                            ABSTRACT

We use sharp, massive and unexpected price increases of oral contraceptives—product of a
documented case of collusion among pharmaceutical retailers in Chile—as a natural experiment
to estimate the impact of access to the Pill on fertility and newborn health. Our empirical strategy
combines multiple sources of information and takes into account the seasonality of conceptions
and the general trends of fertility, as well as the dynamics that arise after interrupting Pill's intake.
Our estimates suggest that due to the price hike, the weekly birth rate increased by 4%. We show
large effects on the number of children born to unmarried mothers, from mothers in their early
20's, and to primiparae women. Moreover, we find evidence of significant deterioration of
newborn health as measured by the incidence of low birthweight and infant mortality. We suggest
that the “extra” conceptions faced dire conditions during gestation as a result of mothers'
unhealthy behaviors. In addition, we document a disproportional increase of 27% in the weekly
miscarriage and stillbirth rates, which we interpret as manifestations of active efforts of
termination in a country where abortion was illegal. As the “extra” children reached school age,
we find lower school enrollment rates and higher participation in programs for students with
special needs. Our results suggest that access to contraceptives may prevent conceptions that will
turn out to be in relatively poor health, and thereby may improve the average health of children
conceived.

1     Introduction

The introduction of the contraceptive pill was one of the most significant technological innovations

in the twentieth century as it provided a practical and reliable tool to avoid unintended pregnancies,

giving women and families greater control over the timing of the pregnancies and the number of

children they would bear (Bailey, 2006, 2010). An extensive literature has shown that having more

control over fertility decisions allowed women and families to alter their life choices more freely. For

instance, marriage and first births were delayed, and women’s human capital accumulation, labor

force participation and hours worked increased (Goldin and Katz, 2002; Bailey, 2006). However,

few studies have examined the extent to which the Pill’s availability affects the average health of

the conceived children by avoiding pregnancies that are more likely to be unintended, and therefore

less likely to receive adequate biological, economic, and emotional resources.1

    In this article, we examine the Pill’s role in avoiding the conception of potentially less healthy

children, therefore improving the average health of infants. In the process, we extend the scarce

literature on the relationship between contraceptive prices and fertility. We develop a model that

provides foundations for the empirical strategy we use. It relates contraceptive prices to health

outcomes of the conceived. It predicts that the direction in which changes in contraceptive prices

affect newborn health is ambiguous, and depends on parental characteristics, their taste for having

children at the time, and their price elasticity of demand for contraceptives. We use a sharp,

unexpected, and overnight increase in the price of contraceptives to analyze changes in their use

and the consequent impact on the number of children conceived and on fetal, newborn, and infant

health. We also identify factors that make women more vulnerable to contraceptives’ price shocks.

    Our empirical strategy exploits an exogenous variation in contraceptive prices, resulting from

a massive collusion case involving the three largest pharmaceutical retailers in Chile—together

they hold a market share of 92 percent. Between December 2007 and April 2008 they strategically

increased the prices of 222 medicines. Oral contraceptives were included in this group, experiencing

price increases ranging from 30 to 100 percent in just a few weeks (45 percent on average in just

   1
     Part of the reproductive health literature considers unintendedness, unwantedness and mistimed to be different
concepts regarding pregnancies (Petersen and Moos, 1997). Although they have very relevant distinctions, in this
paper as in most dealing with these types of pregnancies (see, for instance, Gonen, 1999; Finer and Zolna, 2011), we
bundle all of them together and label them as ‘unintended’ as we have no way to identify them separately in the
data, and we believe our findings are extensive to all of them.


                                                         2
three weeks). The pharmacies established a system, called the chronogram, to raise the prices. In

practice, it implied that one pharmacy, generally the largest, moved first; the other two followed,

leaving the price of the products equal in all pharmacies in less than a week (Nuñez et al., 2010).

We use daily information on prices and quantities sold in the country by the three companies from

almost 40 million transactions to determine the date when the rise in prices for birth control pills

took place. Based on it, we implement a version of a Before-After estimator, which takes into

account the seasonality of births, the general trends of fertility in the country, as well as dynamics

that arise because it takes time for the contraceptive medication to wear off after discontinuing the

Pill’s intake. We complement the pharmacies’ transaction data with administrative information on

birth and death certificates for the period 2005 and 2007, as well as with administrative records of

school enrollment for the period 2013-2016.

    Our estimates suggest that the skyrocketing increment in prices caused a sharp decrease in

contraceptive use, yielding a price elasticity that ranges between -0.11 and -0.16 (the upper limit

reported in the literature). As a result, between 183 and 265 “extra” individuals were born in

Chile per week, a 4% increase in the weekly birth rate. We show large effects on the numbers of

children born out of wedlock, from nulliparous women, and from women in their early twenties.

We provide evidence in favor of the argument that the price spike caused a significant increase in

unintended pregnancies as we find year-to-year increases in the number of fetal deaths, the number

of underweight births, and the number of infant deaths that exceed the increase of the overall

birth rate.2 Additionally, we do not find significant impacts among teenage mothers or households

located in poor areas, as was expected due to their typically low usage of oral contraceptives.

    Lastly, we analyze the long-term consequences of the unexpected price increase of 2008. In

particular, we estimate its impact on kindergarten, first- and second-grade enrollment for the

period 2013-2016, when the children affected by price hike reached school age. We find that children

conceived shortly after the price shock were less likely to enroll relative to those conceived before

the shock. However, the same children were more likely to attend special education programs for

students with special needs, the majority helping individuals with intellectual disabilities. This

   2
     Throughout the paper, we will refer to both miscarriages and stillbirths as fetal deaths. This is just for the
sake of brevity, and through it, we do not intend to take sides on the debate on when into the pregnancy should a
conception be considered as a bearer of life. A distinction between miscarriages and stillbirths will be made when
needed.

evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that those conceived during the first weeks of 2008 faced

dire conditions during critical developmental periods.

    The paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a literature review. Section

3 describes the collusion case, the event generating the required exogenous variation in prices.

Section 4 describes our multiple sources of information. Section 5 develops a conceptual framework

motivating our empirical strategy. Sections 6 and 7 present the empirical analysis and main results,

respectively. Section 8 concludes.



2    Brief literature review

Since its introduction in the US in the late 1950’s, social scientists have tried to disentangle the

impact of access to oral contraceptives from the economic and social changes taking place at that

time (Bailey, 2010). For example, economists have argued that evidence shows a significant fertility

decline even before the introduction of oral contraceptives, corresponding to fundamental changes

in the demand for children that are closely related to women’s increasing access to the labor market

(Becker, 1981). To address the confoundedness issue, researchers used exogenous legal variations

that affected access to the Pill for particular subgroups of women. They found that the Pill reduced

the fertility in unmarried young women and contributed to strengthening the social changes that

granted them more access to the market economy (Goldin and Katz, 2002; Bailey, 2006). The

results on the reduction of fertility due to the introduction of the Pill in the US were later extended

to include married women (Bailey, 2010).

    To understand the effect of oral contraceptive access on the fertility of all women instead of

just on subgroups, we have to look for literature outside the US. Not surprisingly, just like in the

US, the confoundedness driven by social forces also diluted the impact of family planning programs

on fertility behavior in developing countries, where the impacts found were modest (Freedman

and Freedman, 1992; Pritchett, 1994). However, more recent evidence using exogenous sources of

variation shows that access to contraceptives has a significant impact on fertility in the developing

world. For instance, fertility fell by 12 percent among women who gained access to the Pill due to

the expansion of its distribution network in Indonesia (Molyneaux and Gertler, 2000). Conversely,

a city-wide ban on oral contraceptives in Manila increased family size (Dumas and Lefranc, 2013).


                                                  4
Such pronatalist policies were also found to increase fertility rates by about 0.5 children in Romania

(Pop-Eleches, 2010). In our case, the sudden, steep, and nationwide increase in oral contraceptive

prices due to the collusion of drug retailers can be interpreted as a pronatalist unexpected change.

Unlike the existing literature, where the mechanism is variation in the Pill accessibility due to

exterior factors like laws or distribution channels, we are able to explore behavioral reactions due

to price changes. Certainly, the effects of this change on fertility will depend on the price elasticity

of contraceptives.

   Therefore, our paper also relates to the literature that studies the relationship between contra-

ceptive prices and demand (Ciszewski and Harvey, 1995; Janowitz and Bratt, 1996; Matheny, 2004;

Collins and Hershbein, 2013, among others). With different identification strategies, these studies

find relatively small sensitivity of the demand of oral contraceptives to price increases ranging from

0 to 15 percent. The price changes analyzed are typically small (with the exception of Collins and

Hershbein, 2013), and the scale (amount of women affected by these changes) is reduced. Our pa-

per, on the contrary, analyzes a nationwide shock in which prices increased overnight by an average

of 45%. In that regard, our paper goes beyond the analysis of the relation between prices and

contraceptive use and contributes to the scarce literature on the relationship between contraceptive

prices and fertility. Findings indicate that subsidizing contraceptives decreases fertility by about 3

to 6 percent in Indonesia (Molyneaux and Gertler, 2000), and 9 percent for women in a relatively

high income bracket in the US (Kearney and Levine, 2009). To the best of our knowledge, ours

is the first paper to study the case in which contraceptives become substantially more expensive

while remaining widely available.

   Furthermore, our paper is the first to link the Pill’s availability and its use to fetal and infant

health. Extensive literature has shown that the development of healthy children and adults is

greatly affected by economic and environmental deprivation while in-utero (Black et al., 2007;

Kiernan and Huerta, 2008; Eriksson et al., 2009; Almond and Currie, 2011, among others), stress,

depression and emotional hardship during pregnancy (Kiernan and Huerta, 2008; Black et al., 2016),

and maternal behavior (Currie and Moretti, 2003). There is reason to believe that unintended

pregnancies are more likely to suffer from all of these deprivations. Women and families carrying

an unintended pregnancy may be unprepared to deal with the behavioral, social, economic and

health related changes that a pregnancy entails. According to public health and medical studies,

                                                   5
they may be less likely to abandon unhealthy habits (Hellerstedt et al., 1998; Dott et al., 2009),

may delay prenatal care (Mayer, 1997), and the pregnancy itself may become a source of stress and

anxiety (Biaggi et al., 2016). In consequence, children born from unintended pregnancies may be

on average less healthy than those born from intentional ones (Bustan and Coker, 1994; Sharma

et al., 1994). In that context, the Pill, as a mechanism of avoiding unintended pregnancies, may

play a role in determining the average health of the beings that get to be conceived. In this regard,

the economic literature has remained silent. Using the contraceptives price shock, we are able to

explore the causal effect of an unintended pregnancy on the health of the product of conception.

In the process, we contribute to the scarce literature on contraceptives and abortion in two ways:

considering abortion as a contraceptive method as in Pop-Eleches (2010), and considering abortion

as an indicator of poor health of unintended pregnancies.



3       The collusion case

In January of 2008, daily average prices of birth control pills in the three main pharmacies in Chile—

Farmacias Ahumada (FASA), Cruz Verde (CV), and Salcobrand (SB), who control between 92 to 97

percent of the market3 —increased by about 75 percent within just few weeks (See Figure 1). This

massive and widespread price increase was unexpected by the consumers who had been enjoying a

year long spell of a steady price decline. The price shock was the result of a secret plan to collude and

coordinate an “expressive, simultaneous and uniform” raise of prices for 222 prescription and over-

the-counter (OTC) drugs orchestrated between the three pharmacies (Fiscalı́a Nacional Económica,

2008).4 According to lawsuit documents, SB was the one that led the price increases (Tribunal de

Defensa de la Libre Competencia, 2012). This was the direct consequence of a change in ownership

of SB that took place in April 2007,5 and the new owner’s decision of abandoning the existing pricing

policy after receiving—in October 2007, just two months before collusion started—the reports of
    3
      The Fiscalı́a Nacional Económica (National Economic Prosecutor, FNE) estimates the joint market share of the
three retailers at 92%. Durán and Kremerman (2007) calculates it closer to 97%. This market concentration has
been accompanied by a long tradition of anticompetitive practices in the industry over the last 20 years. In 1995, the
same drug retailers were sanctioned for price fixing, and episodes of price wars and unfair competition accusations
were not uncommon. Not surprisingly, Chile has the highest share of out-of-pocket family expenditures on medical
care out of all OECD member nations (OECD, 2013). Drugs are the largest component of that spending.
    4
      The price increases did not occurred simultaneously, but rather implemented in successive waves of increases,
which began in December 2007 with 62 medicines. Then, they added 70 drugs in January 2008, 31 February 2008,
40 in March 2008 and 19 medications in April 2008.

a business consultancy firm who advised for a “de-commoditization” of the industry.6,7 Hence, it

is very unlikely that consumers could have anticipated the price increase, much less its timing,

rendering it exogenous to the consumers’ fertility decisions. It responded to changes in corporate

policy, triggered by the arrival of new managers.

    In December 2008, the National Economic Prosecutor (FNE) filed a lawsuit at the Tribunal

de Defensa de la Libre Competencia (Competition Tribunal, TDL) against the three major phar-

maceutical companies in Chile for price fixing (Fiscalı́a Nacional Económica, 2008). According to

the FNE, the three retailers immersed themselves in a price war during 2007, which resulted in

a reduction in marketing margins.8 The price war was put to an end in the last weeks of 2007,

when the pharmaceutical companies decided to coordinate their pricing strategies (Fiscalı́a Na-

cional Económica, 2008).9 In April 2008, the price coordination stopped after the FNE called drug

retailers’ executives to question regarding the price increases.

    In March 2009, the Competition Court delivered a settlement between the FNE and FASA,

in which FNE dropped the charges against the pharmacy.10 This settlement established a US$1

million fine for FASA, together with a statement that disclosed the coordination mechanisms and

exchanges of information that had allowed the concerted price rises.

    After more than two years of trials, on April 23, 2011 the TDLC unanimously decided that the

pharmaceutical companies were “guilty” of price fixing. It imposed a fine of US$19 million,11 the

largest fine set in the Chilean antitrust history. This sentence was ratified by the Supreme Court

after an appeal process in 2013.12

Births, Mothers’ Characteristics and Fetal and Infant Deaths.                               The main source of

(Departamento de Estadı́sticas e Información de Salud, DEIS). The DEIS records information on

      According to the FNE, coordination between the retailers was facilitated by the fact that the SB’s new owner
actively recruited executives from FASA and CV during 2007.

      This situation, evident in Figure 1, motivated FASA to present charges against CV for unfair competition.

      The FNE argued that they used the retail price suggested by the laboratories to coordinate the price increases.

the date of birth, weight at birth, place of birth, and characteristics of the mother of every newborn

in the country. Our main empirical analysis is carried out with data on all births in Chile during

2005-2008.

    In addition to date on live births, the Chilean Health Information and Statistics Department

collects data on all deaths, including those of unborn and newborn children.13 Using them, we are

able to include in our analysis pregnancies that end up in fetal deaths, as well as inquire about

effects on infant mortality (i.e., children under the age of one).14 Importantly, the census of infant

deaths records the dates of birth and death as well as the medical reason for death classified using

the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) of

the World Health Organization.15

    The Chilean Health Information and Statistics Department reports 739,390 live births in Chile

between 2007 and 2009, 90.6% of which took place in urban areas and 40.54% took place in the

Santiago region. Our data also indicate that there were 6,582 miscarriages and stillbirths during

that time. Furthermore, the death records show around 2,000 infant deaths per year, half of which

happen within their first week of life.

    Table 1 presents basic summary statistics on weekly births in 2007 for different groups in our

sample. As can be seen, there was an average of 4,626 births per week, most of them out of wedlock

(2,921), and 45% of them are their mother’s first child. About 16% are from teenage mothers.

Our data indicate an infant mortality rate of about 8 deaths per thousand live births. The main

causes of infant deaths are congenital malformations and complications within the perinatal period,

accounting for 35% and 44.8% of deaths, respectively.

    Figure 2 shows that conceptions in Chile have a clear trend and a marked seasonality.16 As the

Chilean fertile-aged population grows, so does the number of conceptions per week. This causes

   13
      The precise definition of fetal death used by the Chilean Health Information and Statistics Department is the
death that happened before the complete expulsion or extraction of a conceived being from the mother’s body,
regardless of the length of the pregnancy. A body is considered dead if after such separation the fetus does not breath
nor shows any sign of life such as heartbeat, umbilical cord pulsing, or effective movement of voluntary muscles.
   14
      The fetal death registry is built based on the collection of the Certificados de Defunción y Estadı́stica de
Mortalidad Fetal (Death Records and Fetal Mortality Registry) that a physician or a midwife should fill in ev-
ery time they are able to identify the “product of the conception”, regardless of the length of the pregnancy. It
the physician or the midwife do not identify the “product of the conception”—because, for instance, the abor-
tion happened outside the hospital—they should not fill the fetal mortality forms (see the relevant legislation at
http://deis.minsal.cl/deis/codigo/neuw/norma fetales.asp).

      We calculate the conception date by subtracting the gestation length (in weeks) from the week of birth

a positive trend of about 3 additional conceptions each week. In addition to the positive trend,

Chilean fertility patterns vary seasonally. Conceptions peak during the last three weeks of the

year, where summer vacations and end-of-year holidays coincide. These patterns are crucial for our

estimation procedures and the interpretation of results.

Contraceptives, their market, and the collusion case. We supplement the information on

births and fetal and infant deaths with data from the Competition Tribunal of Chile (TDLC). This

agency examined the evidence of collusion by the pharmaceutical companies, gathering detailed

information on around 40 million transactions involving more than 220 medicines during 2006

to 2008. From these data, we are able to precisely observe the medicines’ daily prices and the

quantities purchased. In particular, we analyze the data for birth control pills (oral contraceptives)

for the three most important drugstore franchises: Salcobrand, Fasa and Cruz Verde (who control

between 92% and 97% of the market share). For these companies, we also have information on the

number and locations of their stores over time.17

    The TDLC data allow us to inquire about important features of the contraceptives’ market in

Chile and its dynamics. Retailing contraceptives in Chile is a sizable business.18 According the the

TDLC data, 10,773,126 out of the 39,476,571 transactions (i.e., 27.3%) included contraceptives.19

On average, 10,542 units of contraceptives were sold each day between 2006 and 2008.20 Revenues

from sales of contraceptives at these three pharmacies was of around US$35.7 million in 2006,

   17
       We also supplement the births and deaths censuses and the TDLC data with information on local characteristics
(e.g., income and poverty levels) obtained from different waves of The Socio-economic Characterization surveys.
    18
       Data on the prevalence of different contraceptive methods in Chile is scant and dispersed. However, using
different sources of partial information one can paint a picture of Chileans’ contraceptive use. In 2005, there were
5,932,000 women above the age of 15 in Chile (CEPAL and INE, 2005), out of which 48.9% declare that they do not
use any contraceptive method, 8.8% had gone through an sterilization procedure in the past, and 2.2% use a so called
natural method (i.e., periodic abstinence, breastfeeding and coitus interruptus) (Ministerio de Salud, 2007). Of the
2,379,000 women that use a modern contraceptive method, 869,000 take contraceptive pills. That is 36.5% of the non-
sterilized women that use a modern contraceptive method take the Pill, 19.8% of the women in fertile age (15 to 49).
On the other hand, the Chilean government claims that 53.4% of the population that uses any kind of modern family
planning does so through the public heath system (Ministerio de Salud, 2006). Hence, around 1,100,000 women get
their contraceptives from private vendors. Our data shows that around 340,000 women purchased oral contraceptives
each month from pharmacies in 2007. Therefore, 31% of the women that use modern methods of contraception and
do not get them through the public health system buy the Pill. That figure matches up very well with the prevalence
of the Pill among the users of the public health system 38% (FLACSO-Chile et al., 2008) and its overall prevalence
of 36.5% among those who use modern methods of contraception.
    19
       It is important to note that 97% of the transactions that involved contraceptives were contraceptives-only sales,
meaning that costumers purchases the contraceptives and nothing else.
    20
       We understand as “unit of contraceptives” the dosage of medicaments that supply contraceptive capability for
one full feminine cycle. This precision needs to be made as the number of pills provided in a packet of contraceptives
varies across brands. However, regardless of the number of pills a woman needs to take monthly, the packets in
question will provide contraception for one cycle.


                                                           9
US$34.7 million in 2007 and US$47.6 million in 2008 (see Figure A.1 in the Appendix). During the

2007 price war, pharmacy revenues fell by US$ 1 million despite the fact they sold 629,254 units

more than the year before, only to rebound by around US$13 million while they were colluding.

    As we observed in Figure 1 the TDLC data are detailed enough for us to clearly see each stage

of the change in the structure of the contraceptives market (price war, collusion, and competition).

The data also allow us to analyze the synchronicity of contraceptive price increases by store. Figure

3 compares the median contraceptive price by store during the last week of 2007 to the same price

two weeks later (i.e., second week of 2008). It shows that the price increases were substantial,

sudden, and across the board. Within two weeks, around 85% of stores were charging higher

prices, and many of them—particularly, those that were on the lower side of the price distribution

at the end of 2007—were charging over 100% more than they had charged a fortnight before.

    Our data also allow us to explore contraceptive brand dominance and substitutability, because

we are able to observe the brand choices made by the Chilean public. Chileans have several alterna-

tives for oral contraceptives; in fact, pharmacies report selling 24 different brands of contraceptives.

Of those 24 brands, only five sustain market shares above 5%, and very rarely one of them surpasses

a market share of 15%.21 Hence, the contraceptive market is not highly concentrated brand-wise;

the top five brands account for 45% to 50% of the units sold in a given month. This feature of the

Chilean pharmaceutical market is easily seen in Figure 4, where we plot the shares of the market for

the main brands across time. The Figure shows that the choices of contraceptives were remarkably

stable across time, even after the spike in prices of January of 2008. Such stability in the market

share of each brand is partly due to the fact that all of the contraceptive brands saw their prices

increase starting in January 2007. In Figure A.2 in the Appendix, we can observe sharp price spikes

even at the brand level.22 Therefore, the scope of the substitutability that might have taken place

was hampered by the fact that all contraceptives became more expensive. However, we cannot rule

out that some degree of substitution may have occurred. If it occurred, substitution would bias our

econometric results towards not finding an effect. In that respect, our results can be considered as

a lower bound.
   21
     Here we measure market share with respect to units sold, where a unit is defined in footnote 20
   22
     In addition, Figure A.2 shows that the price fixing behavior was across the board and very precise. We present
the price trajectories of the five main brands. We see, even at this disaggregate level, that prices across pharmacies do
not differ and they move almost simultaneously. Such feature attests to the exact coordination of the pharmacies—the
reader should note that these are daily average prices.


                                                           10
     That same reasoning holds for the potential substitution with condoms, although such substi-

tution would have a limited scope as the prevalence of condom use among Chileans is only of 5.5%

(Ministerio de Salud, 2007).23 Regardless, we address that concern by analyzing pharmacies’ daily

data on condom prices and quantities sold, and government procurement data on 588 purchase

orders for the 2007-2008 period that include condoms for distribution in public hospitals, public

health facilities, and municipalities. Our findings indicate that prices of condoms and the quantities

demanded did not respond to skyrocketing increases in oral contraceptive prices due to the collusion

of drug retailers. The evidence presented in Appendix B shows that pharmacies did not change

their condom pricing policy—that entailed raising prices at the beginning of Summer and keeping

them at that level until next Summer—nor they sold more units after the contraceptives price

increase. In fact, Figure B.1 shows a drop in the number of condoms sold contemporaneous to the

contraceptive price increase, attesting against the fact that consumers substituted away from the

Pill in favor of condoms. Furthermore, Figure B.2 shows that public procurement of condoms did

not change after contraceptives price increased indicating that there was no reaction from public

providers to the contraceptives price shock.

School attendance years 2013 to 2016. Our final source of information comes from public

records on school attendance for the years 2013 and 2016. The Ministry of Education of Chile

reports individual-level school attendance on a monthly basis for all students attending schools

receiving public funding.24 The public records contain student’s exact date of birth for the years

2013 and 2014 and month/year of birth for the years 2015 and 2016, grade attended, type of program

including those for students with disabilities, school location, and days of school attendance per

month. In March of 2013 and 2014 (beginning of academic year), the files contain data for 3,246,945

and 3,331,326 students, respectively.



5        Conceptual Framework

In principle, exogenous changes in contraceptive prices produce ambiguous effects on the average

health of the children conceived. Suppose that the propensity of agent i to use contraceptives at
    23
      The literature recognizes that very little is known about condom access and fertility partly because condom
availability and use are very difficult to observe (Buckles and Hungerman, 2016).
   24
      During the period of analysis, the proportion of schools not receiving public funding did not exceed 9% of the
total number of schools in the country. All public and private subsidized schools received public funding.

time s is given by the price at that moment Ps , a vector of observable characteristics Zis ∈ [Z , Z̄]
                                                                                                    ¯
(e.g., age, marital status, income and education), and an unobserved component that represents

the agent’s taste for conceiving children at time s, θis ∼ Fθ (·) and θis ⊥ PS . Thus, we can write

the latent variable determining the propensity of agent i to purchase contraceptives at time s as


                                          ∗
                                         Cis = γZis − ψPs − θis


where γ and ψ are positive vectors. Consequently, the agent will use contraceptives if and only if
 ∗ > 0. Let C be a dummy variable capturing this decision: C = 1 if C ∗ > 0, and C = 0
Cis          is                                             is       is           is

otherwise. All in all, people who greatly dislike having children at time s will most likely purchase

contraceptives. Also, agents with low values of Zis (e.g., poor or teenage agents) will most likely

never use contraceptives, and agents with high values of Zis must have a higher taste for children

to abandon contraceptive use. Of course, in this context a price change—from Ps to Ps0 with

Ps0 > PS —does not modify the contraceptive purchasing behavior of all agents. Formally, the

group responding to the change can be described by

                                                ZZ̄           γZ−ψP
                                                                Z s
                                  NC∆P
                                     s =0
                                            =         f (Z)         f (θ)dθdZ.                          (1)
                                                Z         γZ−ψPs0
                                                ¯



Thus, as basic economic intuition suggests, larger price changes would induce more agents to switch

their contraceptive use behavior, modifying to a greater extent the characteristics of the individuals,

θ and Z, on each side of the decision. In fact, equation (1) implies that E[θ|C = 0, Ps0 ] < E[θ|C =

0, Ps ] after a price increase. Likewise, for each level of θ, those responding to a price change will

come from the group with relatively higher realizations of Z compared to the ones already choosing

C = 0. Therefore, a price increase implies that E[Z|C = 0, Ps0 ] > E[Z|C = 0, Ps ].

     Let’s consider now the latent propensity of agent i to conceive at time s, Yis∗ , which we describe

as

                             Yis∗ = µw(s) − bCis (Zis , Ps , θis ) + τ Xis + ξis ,                      (2)

where the idiosyncratic shock ξis is an iid random variable with distribution Fξ (·). Therefore, agent

i will conceive at time s (i.e., Yis = 1) if Yis∗ > 0. Equation (2) states that the propensity to conceive


                                                          12
at time s is affected by the use of contraceptives Cis (Ps , Zis , θis ), individual characteristics Xis , and

the thickness of the sexual/reproductive market at that time µw(s) . This last term captures the fact

that conception requires finding an appropriate mate and/or deciding to have sexual relations with

a mate. As Figure 2 demonstrates, these events might have seasonal components. In low seasons,

finding a mate and/or having sex with a mate occur with less frequency, therefore conception is

less likely. w(s) indicates which part of the yearly cycle time s belongs to. Thus, under this

framework, access to contraceptives will not only decrease the probability of conceiving by an

amount proportional to a positive constant b, but also that even in the absence of contraceptives,

conception is not guaranteed as the agent could face a low µw(s) (or obtain a low draw of ξis ).

    For simplicity, we assume that agents are myopic in that they make their choices at time s

using the information they have at that time, and do not create any expectation about the future.

This rules out any strategic behavior regarding inter-temporal decisions.25 Thus, the conditional

probability of agent i conceiving at time s is given by

                                                                                
                      Pr Yis = 1|µw(s) , Cis (Zis , Ps , θis ) = cis , Xis = xis = Ps,x,c,θ .


To obtain the unconditional probability of an agent conceiving at time s we integrate the conditional

probability over the space of conditioning variables:

                         Z Z Z
                  Ys                                                                                  
           Ps =      =            Ps,ν,ζ,% dFX (ν)dFZ (ζ)dFθ (%) = Pr Ys = 1|µw(s) , C̄s (Ps ) , α
                  Ns

where the variables with a bar indicate the average at time s, and α captures our assumption that

the distributions of Xi , Zi and θi do not change with time. Consequently, the characteristics of the

overall pool of agents are always the same.

    On the other hand, the total number of conceptions at time s can be written as

                                                                                   Ns
                                                                                   X
                                                                     µ0w(s)
                                                        
                     Ys = Ns α + µw(s) − bC̄s (Ps ) = Ns α +                  −b         Cs (Ps ) .            (3)
                                                                                   i=1


Thus, the total number of conceptions at time s depends on the number of people in fertile age at
  25
     This is not an implausible assumption as the price increase we analyze in this paper was massive and sudden.
Furthermore, before unexpected the price shock, prices had been declining steadily for about a year (see Figure 1).
In consequence, past prices gave little information about future prices when the price increase arrived.


                                                        13
that time, which is effectively a time trend; a time fixed-effect that captures seasonality, and the

number of people using contraceptives at time s, which in turn depends on the price of contracep-

tives at that time. This expression identifies the determinants of time-specific fertility, a result we

will later take to the empirical estimation.

    Finally, let the health of a being conceived at time s, His , be a random variable with associated
                         2 . Parents can affect the conceived being’s health by adopting healthier
                          
distribution FH λis , σH

behaviors before and during the pregnancy. That is, if parents choose healthier behaviors, the

baby’s realized health His will be drawn from a distribution that is centered around a higher mean

(i.e., higher λis ). We further assume that the adoption of healthier behaviors during pregnancy

positively correlates with the taste for children θ and socioeconomic characteristics Z at time s. In

particular, we assume λis = g(θis , Zis ), where g(·, ·) is a differentiable increasing function in both

arguments. Thus, the average health of the conceived at time s can be written as


  E[g(θis , Zis )|Yis = 1] = Pr(Cis = 0)E[g(θis , Zis )|ξis > −µw(s) − τ Xis , Cis = 0]

                                            + Pr(Cis = 1)E[g(θis , Zis )|ξis > −µw(s) + b − τ Xis , Cis = 1]


Given that conception while taking the Pill is a very low probability event, we focus on the first

term. Since θis ⊥ ξis ,

                                                     ZZ̄    Z∞

                                                                                          , and on the distributions

of θ and Z in the population. These results indicate that the direction of the change in average

health of the conceived will depend in part on the marginal returns to health inputs, mediated by

the parameters that measure how responsive switchers are to changes in P . If ψ is large, small

changes in P will induce many infra-marginal agents in terms of θ to change their contraceptive

choice. However, these switchers would not have substantially different Z relative to those already

choosing Cs = 0. Therefore, the size of the decrease in the average θ among all those who decide

Cs = 0 after the price increase is greater than the size of the increase in the average Z. The results

also show that the average health of the children conceived will be more likely to decrease due to a

price increase if income is highly concentrated (f 0 (Z) < 0 holds for a great portion of its domain).

    In sum, our model shows that those who alter their behavior due to price changes have different

traits from those who leave their choices unaltered. This affects the pool of agents that conceive after

the price increase, which in turn translates to a different average health of the babies conceived.

The direction of that change is ambiguous. It depends on the tests for having children at the

time, their socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, and the price elasticity of demand for

contraceptives of those who end up switching their behavior. By documenting the impact of price

hikes across different groups, our empirical analysis seeks to determine the relative relevance of

these underlying factors.



6    Empirical Strategy

Now we translate our simple model to an estimation strategy. In principle, the sharp and completely

exogenous—from the point of view of the consumer—increase in contraceptive prices in just a few

days offers an opportunity to estimate the price elasticity of contraceptives and the causal effect

of the Pill’s availability on births and birth-related outcomes using simple OLS regressions. The

intuition is that, due to the exogeneity of the price shock, the population of women before and after

the price increase are comparable except for the fact that one group of women faces contraceptive

prices 30% to 100% higher in a matter of days. This relates to the assumption made in the model,

in which the distributions of Xi , Zi and θi do not change across time. As a result, any discontinuity


                                                          15
in the conditional distribution of outcomes, such as births or the health of newborn babies that

were conceived after the price increases could be interpreted as the effect of contraceptive prices.

Hence, we would be evaluating the difference in the outcomes between pre and post price shock

periods.

    More formally, let us call s∗ the week in which the price of contraceptives increased, given

that prices remained high, we can define a treatment indicator Di = 1{t ≥ s∗ }. Therefore, the

estimation would take the form:

                                               Yi = α + βDi + εi                                                 (4)

where β would be our parameter (i.e., the average causal effect of the treatment) of interest given

that Di ⊥ εi .

    However, the nature of the treatment and the outcomes we explore entails a significant amount of

dynamics. Regarding the former, we have shown in equation (3) and in Figure 2 that conceptions

in Chile have a secular trend and a marked seasonality. Regarding the latter, medical evidence

shows that the probability of conception increases with the time elapsed after the suspension of

contraceptive intake, due to the fact that the contraceptive medication progressively wears off and

the menstrual cycle is gradually regulated (Gnoth et al., 2002). Hence, ignoring the dynamic

elements of outcomes and treatment invalidates equation (4) as the correct empirical strategy

because Di (t) 6⊥ εi (t).26

    To avoid the confoundedness caused by the dynamics in conceptions, and following our model,

we need to control for a trend and seasonality in the conceptions series. Empirically, if we ignore

the trend, we will overestimate our results since more conceptions happen as the fertile population

in the country grows. If we ignore the seasonality, the comparison between the conceptions pre

and post price shock will be misleading, because the number of conceptions fluctuate predictably

throughout the year. Hence, we consider the following specification:

                                                                             51

     Dynamics are also the main reason for not using the sharp increase of the contraceptives’ prices to implement a
Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD). RDD identifies the average casual effect of the treatment at the discontinuity
point τRD = E[Yi (1) − Yi (0)|t = t∗ ] (Lee and Lemieux, 2010).

where t∗ is the week when we start observing the treatment, t is a linear trend, and                        w=1 ωw Sw

represents the week-of-the-year fixed-effects.27

     We need to make two choices regarding the slopes of the regression lines before and after the

cutoff (i.e., f (β, |t − t∗ |)). First, we need to choose wether we force those slopes to be the same or to

differ depending on the side of the discontinuity they lie. For instance, if we choose an specification

in which f (β, |t − t∗ |) = βp (|t − t∗ |), we impose the restriction for both slopes to be the same.

On the other hand, if we allow the pre-treatment and treatment slopes to differ, the specification

for f (·) would be f (β, |t − t∗ |) = βb p (|t − t∗ |) + (βa − βb ) 1 [t > t∗ ] p (|t − t∗ |). Second, we need to

choose the degree of the polynomial with which we are going to approximate the true regression

lines (i.e., p (|t − t∗ |)).

     To provide as much flexibility as possible, we favor specifications that allow a different quadratic

functional form for f (β, |t − t∗ |) in each side of the discontinuity.28 We highlight the importance

of the dynamic component of the effect by presenting results at different moments throughout the

year; evaluating the estimated polynomial at different values of t. That is, the effect on week

t = s > t∗ is given by

                                     Ys>t∗ − Yt∗ = τ + βa p (|t − t∗ |) |t=s>t∗



7        Results

As explained in the previous section, our empirical strategy relies on a version of a Before-After

estimation strategy that uses an exogenous positive shock in the price of contraceptives. The

discontinuity is in the time dimension, as we compare the year-to-year difference in conception

before and after the rise in the contraceptive prices.




    27
      Note that t∗ in equation (5) need not be the first week of 2008. We can use this specification to allow for a
“donut-hole” approach (i.e., t∗ > s∗ ) as in Cohodes and Goodman (2014) and Barreca et al. (2011), but not for the
usual reason of manipulation of the running variable. Instead, we could potentially do so to deal with the fact that a
sudden price increase of contraceptives does not imply that their consumption will immediately be modified, because
women’s Pill stocks will take time to deplete before the new prices must be faced, and then in order to conceive, a
new menstrual cycle should commence after the withdrawal from the Pill.
   28
      In some cases, we show robustness to the inclusion of cubic polynomials in f (β, |t − t∗ |). More of these results
can be provided upon request.

7.1     Prices and Quantities.

We analyze first the responses of contraceptive purchases. Given that the expected cost of not

taking the contraceptives outweighs the price spike, one would expect contraceptives to be very

inelastic to price. However, our first result, presented in Figure 5, and quantified in Table 2 indi-

cates that the exogenous price increase caused a sizable reduction in the amount of contraceptives

purchased weekly. By week five after the price shock, pharmacies were selling 4,500 units less (a

5.5% reduction), and by mid-2008 that drop had reached 14,500 units (a 17.6% reduction). In that

sense, we show that contraceptive prices are relevant in determining their consumption. Putting

together Figures 1 and 5, we see that consumption of contraceptives was rising steadily as prices

were decreasing throughout 2007. However, as the price spiked in January 2008, consumption re-

ceded.29 Then, considering an average price increase of 45 percent during the first weeks after the

shock, a Wald estimate of the contraceptives’ price elasticity ranges between -0.11 and -0.16, which

is in the upper end of those found in the literature (between 0 and -0.15).30 One explanation of

this relatively high elasticity (when compared to others found in the international literature) is that

abortion is illegal in Chile and the distribution of emergency contraceptives, such as the morning

after pill, was very restricted until mid 2008 (Bentancor and Clarke, 2017).

    In the remainder of this section, we analyze the impact of the significant reduction in contra-

ceptive purchases on weekly conceptions, fetal deaths and infant deaths.


7.2     Results on Live Births

Our first set of results on conceptions is presented in Table 3. We collect the dynamic estimations

of the impact of the price increase on conceptions that took place in different weeks after the price

increase and resulted in live births.31 Table 3 and shows the extent to which the sizable reduction

   29
       It is important to note that the increase of the contraceptives’ prices was large, sudden and unanticipated.
In consequence, there are no reasons to believe that people could strategically be stockpiling contraceptives as
anticipation to price changes (Simonsen et al., 2015). Our data show that between 2006 and 2008 96.4% of the
contraceptive purchases were single purchases in that costumers only bought one box. Therefore, stockpiling was
negligible in the first place, and the proportion of single purchases remained fairly stable between 94.4% and 96.6%
throughout 2007. Our analysis in Appendix D shows that if there was any stockpiling, it was not as an strategic
response to prices, but due to pharmacy availability.
    30
       A more thorough analysis of the contraceptive demand elasticity can be found in Appendix C
    31
       In the estimations we include all week after the price increase, although it should be noted that we should find
no positive effect on the first two weeks after the price shock. This because women would need at least half of a
menstrual cycle after stopping the Pill intake to conceive and the soonest a woman can be affected by the price shock
is on January 1st of 2008.


                                                          18
in contraceptive purchases—itself due to the massive price increases—caused a significant increase

in births. In fact, just nine weeks after the price shock, there is an increase of about 71 births per

week; four weeks later, there are on average 116 more births. As expected, and in line with medical

evidence, the risk of conception increases with time, as the effect of past contraceptive medication

wears off and the natural menstrual cycle is progressively restored.32 The effect on total conceptions

peaks during mid-year at a year-to-year increase of around 183 births per week, which represents

4% of the births that take place in the average week and yields a price elasticity of 0.089. The

fact that the effect peaks during mid-year is in line with medical evidence that shows that women

continue to experience cycle disturbances that may prevent a conception for five to nine months

after they discontinue the use of oral contraceptives (Gnoth et al., 2002). The effect of the price

shock persists through September, after which the extra weekly conceptions return to pre-treatment

levels. This interesting feature suggests that the increased pregnancy risk was counteracted either

by behavioral changes that took some time to materialize, or by dynamic selection out of the pool

of women that could get pregnant—given that that those who conceived were no longer able to do

so in later weeks.

    Our parametric results can be biased if the functional forms assumed are misspecified. To check

for this we also estimate a non-parametric model whose results we present in Figure 6.33 They

corroborate our findings in Table 3. They show an increasing effect that peaks during mid-year

reaching a year-to-year increase of 164 conceptions per week, and the returns to pre-treatment

levels.34

    Having calculated the overall effect of pharmacy collusion in terms of total births, we now

      In particular by extending the length of the luteal phase, which improves the chances of a successful pregnancy
(Gnoth et al., 2002)
   33
      In the non-parametric procedure we control for the distance to the shock using Local Linear Regressions (LLR)
for the practical estimation of the parameter of interest τ BA , since it minimizes bias when estimating regression
functions at the boundary and allows wide flexibility for exploring the treatment dynamics (Fan and Gijbels, 2000).
More specifically, we solve:

at time t, Yit , on a time trend (i.e., Yt = α + γt + νt ). This way, we compare weekly conceptions between the same
week of each year, absorbing the peaks and nadirs of conceptions within the calendar year. Therefore, the estimated
average treatment effect at time t is given by τ̂tBA = α̂sr∗ − α̂tl

proceed to analyze the impact across different groups.

   If we split the effect described in Figure 6 by the age of the mother, as in Figures E.1 in the

Appendix, we see that the effect followed different patterns for older women (age 30 to 35) versus

younger women. The effect on older women took place immediately after the price shock, as the

number of weekly conceptions increased by about 40, representing a relative increase of 3.6%. On

the other hand, the effect on younger women increased over time, peaking by mid-year with about

60 extra weekly conceptions. This represents about 5.5% of the average weekly conceptions for

that age range. Our evidence suggests that although the effect of the price increase is present for

women of all ages, it was a bigger burden for women in their early twenties.

   The second set of results in Table 3 shows a significant increase in the number of weekly out-

of-wedlock births (see also Figure E.4a in the Appendix). Nine weeks after the price shock, we find

a year-to-year increase of around 94.6 conceptions. This number goes up to around 197 by mid-

year. This represents about 6.5% of the out-of-wedlock births that take place within the average

week. Our estimations, reported in Figures E.3 in the Appendix, show that the significant increase

in out-of-wedlock conceptions occurred among women of all fertile ages. The impact of the price

increase on out-of-wedlock births follow the same overall pattern as the impact on all conceptions,

presented in Figure 6. That is, these births increase until mid-year and then gradually return to

pre-treatment levels. This should not be a surprise, given that two-thirds of the weekly births come

from unmarried women.

   The third set of estimates presented in Table 3 also show that the increase of the contraceptive

prices caused a significant increase in the number of underweight births (measured as the proportion

of newborns with low birthweight for gestational age, as indicated by Mikolajczyk et al. (2011)).

At the peak of the effect, there were 18.5 more underweight births per week. They represent about

11.4% of the weekly average underweight births in the pre-treatment period. This effect is almost

three times grater than the overall effect, in relative terms. Such large effect is in line with medical

literature linking unintended pregnancies with the incidence of underweight newborns (Sharma

et al., 1994). This should be a major concern given the well documented fact that weight at birth is

a significant determinant of cognitive development (Torche and Echevarrı́a, 2011; Figlio et al., 2014),

school attainment (Oreopoulos et al., 2008) and even future earnings (Behrman and Rosenzweig,

2004; Black et al., 2007). Economic and early childhood development literatures consider weight

                                                  20
at birth to be a measure of initial endowments product of not only genetic background and the

extent to which the parents were involved in pre-natal care, but also the mother’s previous health

and habits (Currie, 2011).

    Figure E.4b in the Appendix also shows that conceptions that resulted in underweight newborns

were falling on a year-to-year basis prior to the price shock, during the period when contraceptive

prices were falling as the pharmacies engaged in a price war. Sadly, the price spike that resulted

from the pharmacies colluding broke the trend in the reduction of weekly underweight births.

    The last set of results in Table 3 and Figure E.4c show the impact of the price spike on first-child

conceptions. Before the pharmacies colluded, the first-child conceptions were falling on a year-to-

year basis. In particular, first-child conceptions among young women (i.e., between 20 and 24 years

of age) were falling by more than 30 conceptions per week (see Figures E.2 in the Appendix),

congruent with the ongoing pattern of delaying fertility among women in middle and high income

societies. However, the trend reversed after the price shock. By week nine after the price increase,

there were around 59 more first-child conceptions, and by week 29, the effect reached 130 additional

first-child conceptions. This represents an increase of 6% relative to the average week during the

pre-treatment period.


Effects on poor households and teenage pregnancies.                         Interestingly, we find little or no

effect among teenage mothers or among households that live in poorest municipalities. In fact, the

barely significant positive effects we find are proportionally smaller than the overall effects we find

on total conceptions. The results presented in Table 4 confirms our hypothesis that the observed

changes in the number of births is the result of a behavioral response to the rise in prices. Poor

households and teenagers, most likely not using birth control pills as a contraceptive method, do

not respond to the price change as much as the rest of the population did. Poor households not

only have a significantly lower rates of Pill use (Ministerio de Salud, 2007), but are also more likely

to get contraceptives through the public health system.35 Use of the Pill is also very low among

teenagers. Only 6.6% of teenagers use oral contraceptives, in contrasts with 19.8% of all women in

fertile age.36
  35
      Using data on government procurement of contraceptives, we found that the government did not react to the
price increases by acquiring more contraceptives in order to supply them to the public.
   36
      The 6.6% prevalence rate come from the following facts: only 40% of teenagers aged 15 to 19 have been sexually
initiated (Ministerio de Salud, 2007), only two-thirds of those use any kind of protection in their sexual relations,


                                                         21
7.3     Fetal Deaths

Just like first-child conceptions, miscarriages and stillbirths were consistently falling on a year-to-

year basis prior to the price shock, at which point they increased significantly.37 Table 5 and Figure

7 show that weekly conceptions that resulted in miscarriages and stillbirths increased by around

11 during their peak in mid-year. Such an increase represents a 27% growth in the average weekly

fetal deaths prior to the price shock, around 7 times the proportional effect the price shock had

on live births. There can be three explanations to such disproportionate effect on fetal deaths.

First, fetal deaths may be the product of unintended and therefore neglected pregnancies. Since

abortion is illegal in Chile, some part of this increase could reflect efforts to end the pregnancy.

Second, they may be from women who, due to health reasons, could not bring a pregnancy to term

and were avoiding it by taking oral contraceptives. And third, it is possible that women who take

contraceptives for a very long time face an increased probability of miscarriages when they become

pregnant (Garcı́a-Enguı́danos et al., 2005).

    To shed light on which of these possible explanations may be driving the result, we analyze

the effect of the price increase on fetal deaths across different subsamples. First, we split the

sample according to the average income in the mother’s municipality. Table 5 shows that the effect

is exclusive to females who live in municipalities with above median income. Among these, the

greatest effect is on women from municipalities in the third quartile of the income distribution.

Hence, there is reason to believe that middle class women were the most affected by the price

shock. While women in low income municipalities might not be able to afford contraceptives in the

first place—or the abortion later on—and women in high income municipalities are able to afford

contraceptives even after the price increase, middle class women find the price increase binding,

ergo the pregnancies. However, middle class women may have had the means to attempt to end

them. This is consistent with research showing that granting access to contraceptives can drastically

reduce the incidence of abortion. For instance, Peipert et al. (2012) found that providing at risk

women with free access to long-acting reversible contraceptives in St. Louis reduced the abortion


and among the latter only one in four use the Pill (while two-thirds use condoms) (INJUV, 2009).
   37
      The difference between miscarriages and stillbirths is based on the length of gestation until the product of
conception leaves the mother’s body, being miscarriages early fetal deaths and stillbirths late fetal deaths. The
threshold after which a fetal death is considered a stillbirth is still in contention in the medical literature. Thresholds
vary from 18 to 28 weeks, being 22 and 28 the most commonly used (Lawn et al., 2011).


                                                            22
rate by half.

    The differential effect across average income of the municipalities also suggests that the second

explanation does not drive the results, since it is unlikely that the women who are unable to bring a

pregnancy to term for health reasons are clustered in municipalities belonging to the third quartile

of the income distribution.

    To explore the possibility that the effect of the price increase worked through a lasting effect

of past exposure to contraceptives, we analyze the incidence of miscarriages and stillbirths among

women women who are pregnant for the first time. If we assume that older nulliparous women are

more likely to have a longer exposure to hormonal contraceptives than younger nulliparous women,

we would expect more fetal losses among older first-time pregnant women. However, regressions in

Table E.1 in the Appendix show no evidence of differential effects of the price shock on fetal losses

across the two age groups of first-time pregnant women. Furthermore, Figure E.5 in the Appendix

shows that even though there are effects for first-time pregnant women in all age groups, except

those in the 20-24 age bracket, these effects are not statistically different across age groups. That

is, the confidence intervals of the four estimates always overlap with one another.38

    Taken together, this evidence suggests that the only hypothesis that we cannot refute as an

explanation for the increase in fetal deaths due to the price increase, is the possibility of mothers

continuing with unhealthy behaviors during pregnancy, intentional neglect of the pregnancy, or

interruption of unintended pregnancies. Due to a lack of information, and given the unlawfulness

of abortion in Chile, we are not able to disentangle fetal deaths due to poor heath from abortions.

Furthermore, because of the way fetal death records are collected, the results we provide on the

impact of the contraceptives’ price increase on fetal deaths serve as a lower bound. As explained

in Section 4, fetal deaths are recorded only if the physician or the midwife identify the “product of

the conception”. Therefore, fetal deaths at early stages of the pregnancy—the ones more likely to

be have been abortions—are less likely to be recorded.39 In fact, when we analyze stillbirths and

miscarriages separately, we find that the effect on fetal deaths is due almost exclusively to a year-to-
   38
      Fertility literature has linked mother’s age with the likelihood of miscarriages and stillbirths (Andersen et al.,
2000, see for example). They show that the likelihood of these events remain under 20% for women younger than 35
years old, but starts increasing rapidly after that age, reaching 84% for women above 45. This feature will not play
a confounding role in our comparisons across ages because in each of our estimates of the effect we are comparing
people within the same age group before and after the discontinuity.
   39
      Pop-Eleches (2010) provides evidence on the fact that intentional abortion is a relatively common birth control
mechanism that has significant impacts on fertility.

year increase in stillbirths and not in miscarriages. Such findings suggest that the contraceptives’

price increase caused an increase in the number of unhealthy fetuses. The next section explores

whether this holds for live births as well.


7.4   Infant Deaths

Just as the increase in unintended pregnancies due to the contraceptives’ price increase boosted

the incidence of fetal deaths, it could also have resulted in an increase in the number of unhealthy

babies born alive, either because of poor health and habits of the now expectant mother, neglected

pregnancies or as a consequence of failed pregnancy interruption efforts. Having shown a large

effect of the price shock on the number of underweight newborns, we now turn to infant mortality

(i.e., the number of children that were born alive and died before they completed their first year of

life). We explore whether there is a deterioration of newborn health after the contraceptives’ price

increase in an even more stringent margin than the one we explored with low birthweight. Prior to

2008, there were around 2,000 infant deaths per year in Chile (representing an infant mortality rate

of about 8 per 1,000 live births) due to numerous causes. In fact, our data shows that physicians

list 589 different diagnoses as causes of the infant deaths that range from congenital malformations

to infections and trauma. However, almost 80% of the infant deaths we observe can be classified in

two broad categories: congenital malformations and conditions originating in the perinatal period

(i.e., the time immediately before and after birth). We will focus in analyzing deaths that are

due to conditions related to the mother’s health and habits, prenatal care, or failed attempts to

end the pregnancy. In particular, we are interested in diagnoses that reflect unpreparedness of

the expectant mother, a lack of healthy habits, or exposure to toxic substances while in-utero.

Namely, perinatal complications, nervous system diseases, brain malformations, malformations of

the cardiac chambers, connections and valves, and enterocolitis. These conditions, listed in Table

6 where we provide the average number of weekly deaths and the mortality rate associated with

each cause, account for 55% of all infant deaths in a given week.

   The results presented in Table 7 suggest the price shock had a positive, although not statistically

significant, year-to-year impact on the total infant mortality rate of around 0.7 permille points

during the first two months after the two-cycle gap. Such difference represents a 9% increase in

total infant mortality. The lack of significance may be attributable to the fact that infant deaths

                                                 24
can happen for a variety of reasons, many of which are not related to the mother’s health and

habits, prenatal care, or failed attempts to end the pregnancy. Therefore, the effect of the price

shock on total infant mortality may be diluted. When we limit the analysis to conditions related to

unpreparedness of the expectant mother, a lack of healthy habits, or exposure to toxic substances

while in-utero, we find that, infant deaths due to these conditions were falling on a year-to-year

basis prior to the price increase, but spiked up among the babies that were conceived after the

contraceptives’ price increase.

    Table 7 indicates that the weekly infant mortality rate due to conditions arising during the

perinatal period increased by 0.85 permille points, for those conceived during the second month

after the price shock. This represents a year-to-year growth of 24% in the weekly infant mortality

of that kind.40 In particular, we find a proportionally large effect on weekly infant deaths due

to necrotizing enterocolitis of the newborn, a condition that typically develops among premature

babies, especially those that are formula fed, and is the second most common cause of death among

premature infants (Panigrahi, 2006). Our results indicate a year-to-year increase in weekly infant

mortality due to necrotizing enterocolitis of about 73.25% among babies conceived after the price

increase.41

    Likewise, when we analyze the change in the weekly infant mortality rate due to malformations

of the cardiac chambers, connections and valves, we find a stable year-to-year increase of 0.15

permille points. This represents a 75% growth in that particular infant mortality rate.

    The weekly infant mortality rate due to diseases of the nervous system grew by around 0.15

permille points among infants conceived in the first six months after the contraceptives’ price in-

crease, a 103% year-to-year increase in the infant mortality rate associated with nervous diseases.42

In an effort to distinguish the effect on structural nervous system diseases, we exclude diseases that

   40
       The conditions generated in the perinatal period explored in Table 7 include newborn affected by maternal
factors and by complications of pregnancy, labour and delivery, disorders related to length of gestation and fetal
growth, birth trauma, respiratory and cardiovascular disorders specific to the perinatal period, infections specific to
the period, hemorrhagic and hematological disorders of the newborn, transitory endocrine and metabolic disorders
specific to the newborn, digestive system disorders, conditions involving the integument and temperature regulation
of the newborn, and other unclassified disorders originating in the period like convulsions of the newborn, neonatal
cerebral ischemia, feeding problems of the newborn and disorders of muscle tone.
    41
       See also non-parametric results in Figure E.6a in the Appendix.

       The diseases of the newborns’ nervous system explored in Table 7 include inflammatory diseases of the central
nervous system (e.g., meningitis), spinal muscular atrophy and related syndromes, degenerative diseases of the nervous
system, epilepsy, primary disorders of muscles, cerebral palsy and other unclassified disorders of the nervous system

arise due to contagion, like meningitis. Our findings, show that the weekly infant mortality rate

due to non-inflammatory nervous system diseases increased by 141.5% on a yearly basis among

babies conceived after the contraceptives’ price increase.

    Among infant deaths due to brain malformations, we find that the impact of the contraceptives’

price increase is greater five to six months after the price shock. By this time, the weekly infant

mortality rate due to brain malformations increased by 116.3%.43 It is worth noting that most of the

diseases associated with brain malformations have been linked to exposure of teratogens, substances

that can disturb the development of the embryo or fetus resulting in congenital malformations.

Croen et al. (2000) find that babies of mothers who take insulin, aspirin, alcohol or cigarettes,

among other substances during pregnancy have higher incidence of brain malformations.44

    Overall, the estimated impacts on infant mortality show that the pharmacies’ collusion increased

the number of conceptions as well as the conception of babies that were more likely to die as a

result of cardiac malformations, perinatal complications like those caused by the immaturity of

the digestive system, and congenital structural problems of the brain and the nervous system. The

nature and causes of these diseases, together with our findings on miscarriages, are suggestive of not

only an increase in the number of unintended and neglected pregnancies (in congruence with the

medical literature on the topic) (Bustan and Coker, 1994), but also an increase in early termination

attempts in a country where abortion is illegal and the morning-after pill was not available.

    Our findings regarding the year-to-year increase in the numbers of mothers in the early twenties;

out-of-wedlock, first-born, underweighted births; fetal and infant deaths suggest an increase in

the number of unintended pregnancies due to the pharmacies’ colluding practices. Due to the

skyrocketing prices of contraceptives, people who otherwise would have avoided pregnancy ended

up conceiving. This resulted not only in a significant increase in weekly births, but also in the

arrival of less healthy babies. In light of the theoretical model, all these results indicate that, among
  43
      The diseases considered under the category of brain malformations include malformations of the corpus callosum,
holoprosencephaly, defective development or absence of part of the brain, lissencephaly (i.e., lack of brain fold and
grooves), hydranencephaly, congenital cerebral cysts, macrocephaly, and malformation that affect facial appearance.
   44
      We implement the empirical strategy outlined in Section 5 to a different data source containing information
on mothers and births for the relevant period, The Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey (Encuesta Longitudinal
de Primera Infancia or ELPI). We find that, compared to women who became pregnant before the contraceptives’
price shock, women who conceived after the price hike were twice more likely to drink alcoholic beverages during
pregnancy, on average they ended breastfeeding one month earlier, and the babies conceived were 5 percentage
points more likely to have below-median cranial circumferences. This goes in line with findings in the public health
and medical literatures that indicate that women with unintended pregnancies tend to have a harder time quitting
unhealthy behaviors even after they know they are pregnant (Dott et al., 2009).


                                                         26
those priced out by the shock, the effect of having relatively lower preferences for children at the

time dominates that of having relatively better socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. In

consequence, they provide evidence in favor of the notion that contraceptives, by preventing the

conception of unexpected babies, truncate from the left the health distribution we observe among

children. We will further explore this by analyzing the consequences of the price shock on long run

outcomes.


7.5    Long Term Outcomes

We use publicly available administrative information on school attendance for the academic years

2013 to 2016 to investigate the long term consequences of the unexpected, sharp and significant

price hike of oral contraceptives of 2008.

    In Chile, first grade enrollment is compulsory for children who turned six years of age by March

31st of a given year. Therefore, this group is expected to be attending a school by March of that

year (the academic year goes from the first week of March to beginning of December). Nevertheless,

the Ministry of Education, upon parent request, might authorize children turning six before June

30th to enroll as well.45 On the other hand, although similar entry age requirements apply to

kindergarten, enrollment in this level was not compulsory for the cohort of individuals potentially

affected by the collusion (it became mandatory only after 2015). Therefore, children turning five

by March 31st of a given year could enroll in kindergarten at public or private subsidized schools

offering the level.46

    Unlike all the data used so far, we do not observe gestation length in the school enrollment

records. Therefore, although we observe the exact birthdate of enrollees for the years 2013 and 2014,

we have some uncertainty on the precise conception week. In consequence, we include specifications

that exclude individuals born within few weeks of the 40th week of the year. These mimic a donut-

  45
      Requests to enroll children not old enough are common in Chile. For example, out of the 242,041 children
attending first grade in March 2016, 10.65% reported as month of birth Abril (4.88%), May (3.53%), or June (2.24%)
of 2010. Only 177 first graders, equivalent to 0.03%, reported a date of birth beyond June 30th of 2010.
   46
      Our empirical strategy remains very similar to the one used throughout the paper. The only difference is that
we need to incorporate the details of the timing of school enrollment. The children that could potentially be affected
by the collusion case were those eligible to attend kindergarten by March 2014. Among them, we distinguish two
groups: those more likely to have been conceived before the price increase (born before September 2008) and those
more likely to have been conceived after the hike (born during or after September 2008). Thus, September defines
the treatment threshold. As before, we use the children conceived one year earlier (i.e., those eligible to enroll in
kindergarten by March 2013) to control for seasonality.


                                                         27
hole specification. Moreover, to examine how sensitive our results are to the downward trend in

prices observed during 2007, we present results covering two time periods: all births from weeks 34

to 48 of a given year, and all births from week 27 of a year and week 3 of the following year (we

label it “week 55”).

    First, we first focus on kindergarten enrollment.47 Table 8 presents the results. Columns

(1) and (2) display the point estimates without excluding those born in the vicinity of week 40.

Column (1) does so for the sample of children born between weeks 34-48 and Column (2) for those

born between weeks 27-55. We find that the price increase reduced kindergarten enrollment five

years later in at least -0.84 per each 1000 births. As we better capture differences between those

conceived before and after the effect of collusion if we exclude the uncertainty surrounding week

40 of 2008, we expect the negative effects to magnify in the donut-hole specifications. The next

two columns confirm this. In particular, excluding two weeks before and after week 40 leads to

point estimates of -7.81 (column 3) and -3.13 (column 4). Columns (5)-(6) and (7)-(8) repeat the

exercise but excluding three and four weeks, respectively. Overall, we find robust evidence that

the price increase of oral contraceptives of 2008 had a negative effect on voluntary enrollment in

kindergarten.

    Since kindergarten enrollment was not compulsory, we need to be careful in interpreting the

negative coefficients reported in Table 8. They might not only suggest that the “extra” children

had a deprived early development because of being product of unexpected pregnancies. Selection

into pre-primary education emerging from, for example, potential changes in family size and its

impact on child’s education (Black et al., 2005), could also explain the results.

    To further investigate the impact on enrollment, we extent the analysis to the academic years

2014, 2015 and 2016. This allows us to examine mandatory enrollment in first and second grades.

For these years, however, only month and year of birth are reported. This prevents us from

estimating specifications that exclude children born between specific weeks of a given year. Instead,

we report results excluding those children born between September and October. Table 9 presents

the results. Panel A does so for the full sample (no donut-hole). In it we report that while we

estimate a small and non-significant negative effect on first grade enrollment, we find that the 2008

  47
     We proxy enrollment with the report of at least one day of school attendance during the first quarter of the year
the student became eligible to enroll.


                                                         28
price increase reduced second-grade enrollment by 5.70 students per each 1000 births seven years

later. The differences between first and second grade might suggest higher grade retention among

those individuals conceived during 2008 relative to those conceived in 2007. However, the results

in Panel B confirm negative impacts for both grades after excluding individuals born between

September and October. In this case, the point estimates are -5.33 and -13.15 for first and second

grade, respectively.

    Administrative records are detailed enough to allow us to observe attendance to special edu-

cation programs. In particular, those programs dedicated to supporting the educational needs of

students with disabilities in different areas. These include hearing impairment, vision impairment,

speech-language impairment, physical impairment, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual dis-

ability. However, most of the children with educational needs report attending a program for

students with intellectual disability.48

    To examine the impact of the price of contraceptive on enrollment in special education programs,

we use the proportion of children (born in a specific month) attending programs for students with

intellectual disabilities as the dependent variable. As before, we interpret any attendance during

the first quarter of the academic year as a proxy for overall enrollment. We report the point

estimates in Table 10. Our findings reveal a positive association between the price increase of

2008 and enrollment in special programs six and seven years later. In particular, among first an

second graders, panel A discloses increases of 0.46 and 0.81 students with special needs (intellectual

disability) per each 1000 births. As expected, the point estimates increase in magnitude after

excluding students born in September of October (panel B). Table E.2 in the Appendix presents

the results aggregating all special education programs. The results confirm our findings.

    As school enrollment in first and second grade is mandatory, we interpret the findings reported

in Table 9 as an indication that those conceived during the first weeks of 2008 (post price increase)

were more likely to face dire conditions during critical periods of development, supporting the

hypothesis—outlined by the theoretical model—of an increase in the number of unexpected children.

The results in Table 10 seem to confirm this interpretation. They go in line with the evidence on

health outcomes of fetuses and infants presented above.
  48
     Among first graders in our cohort of interests, 79.13% and 78.59% of the 4880 and 4882 children reporting
educational needs in 2014 and 2015 attended a program for students with intellectual disability. For second graders
in 2015 and 2016, the figures are 92.57% and 91.44%, respectively


                                                        29
7.6    Falsification Tests

Geographical Variation.           In order to further explore the behavioral response to a sharp price

increase, we use the geographical discontinuity provided by the international border between Chile

and Peru. Arica is the northernmost city in Chile, and is the closest Chilean urban center to Peru.

On the Peruvian side of the border, there is Tacna, a city characterized by its cheap medical services

intended to attract inhabitants to this border city. Arica is just 57kms (35.6 miles) away from

Tacna, and anecdotal evidence suggests that Chileans from Arica go to Tacna when they intend to

purchase medical services, including prescription drugs.49 The availability of cheaper prescription

drugs should dilute the effect the contraceptives’ price increase on the fertility of women living in

Arica. We explore this in Table 11, and find that the price increase of contraceptives in Chilean

pharmacies had no effect on conceptions in this border city.


Changing discontinuity date.            We test whether our non-parametric estimation strategy is me-

chanically identifying effects where there are none by creating a placebo situation in which we set

the discontinuity one year prior to the price increase. Figure 1 shows that, unlike the first weeks of

2008, during the first weeks of 2007 prices did not change dramatically compared to those at the

end of the previous year. Therefore, if our results identify behavioral responses to the contracep-

tives’ prices change, we should see no differential effects on weekly conception just before and after

January 2007. Table 11 shows our results when the discontinuity is timed at the 1st of January of

2007. There are no differences in the year-to-year growth of weekly conceptions, providing evidence

that our results do come from behavioral responses to the price increase in 2008 and not from

mechanical features of the estimation procedure.

    We perform the same test using data on miscarriages and fetal deaths. Congruent with what

we described above, Table 11 shows that both miscarriages and fetal deaths where falling on a

year-to-year basis up until 2007. Therefore, when we use the 1st of January of 2007 as cutoff,

we find negative results. In the absence of the contraceptives’ price increase of January of 2008,

the downward trends in fetal and infant deaths would have continued. Instead, they peaked to

unprecedented levels.

  49
      While Arica is 57kms (35.6 miles) away from Tacna, it is 311kms (193.3 miles) away from the closest Chilean
city, Iquique.


                                                       30
8    Conclusions

This paper presents direct estimates of the behavioral responses of women to the price of the birth

control pills. Specifically, we analyze the impact of unexpected, sharp and massive price hikes

of oral contraceptives on the number of births as well as on the health of fetuses and newborns.

Our identification strategy exploits the proved and documented case collusion of pharmaceutical

companies in Chile, which resulted in a substantial exogenous change in prices between December

2007 and April 2008 (as we documented above, the prices increased between 30% and 100% during

this period).

    We find positive and statistically significant results for overall births. Our estimates suggest

that as a result of skyrocketing prices, between 183 and 265 “extra” individuals were born per week

in Chile during 2008. We show large effects on the number of children born out of wedlock and

from mothers in their early twenties. We also show a disproportionate year-to-year increase in the

number of underweight births and the numbers of miscarriages and infant deaths. Furthermore,

we find evidence linking the price shock with a decrease in kindergarten, first and second-grade

enrollment and an increase in the number of children requiring special education several years after

the event. Hence, we provide evidence consistent with that the Pill is not only a birth control

mechanism but also a tool that may improve newborn health by avoiding unintended pregnancies

that are more likely to be affected by economic, social, biological and emotional deprivation. As

expected, we do not find significant impacts among poor households and teenage mothers.

during the first week of 2008, we define those children born between July 2007 and March of 2008 as
part of the control group. Likewise, children born between July of 2008 and March of 2009 belong to
the treatment group. The time dummy is equal to 1 if birth month is July or August, and 0 otherwise.
For first grade attendance we use data for the years 2014 and 2015. For second grade attendance we
use data for the same months for the years 2015 and 2016. (a): The means at baseline represent the

     Note: *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1. Standard errors in parenthesis. All estimations include week of the year fixed-effects and at
     least a linear trend. We fit a different polynomial f (β, |t − t∗ |) to each side of the cutoff. The conception week is obtained by subtracting
     the pregnancy length to the birth date. Total Births (Fake Cutoff ), Fetal Deaths (Fake Cutoff ) and Perinatal (Fake Cutoff ) perform the
     estimations using as cutoff the 31st of December of 2006. The latter corresponds to the effect on the infant mortality rate due to conditions
     that arose during the perinatal period.

           Note: Daily revenue is calculated by multiplying the median price for a given
           contraceptive brand at a given pharmacy at a given day by the number of
           units sold by that pharmacy of that contraceptive that day. Yearly revenue
           due to the sale of contraceptives is calculated by aggregating across pharma-
           cies and brands for a given year. The exchange rates used to report these
           figures in US dollar is the official one provided by the central bank of Chile at
           http://si3.bcentral.cl/Siete/secure/cuadros/arboles.aspx.

We further our analysis of the contraceptives’ price elasticity by estimating a 2SLS model the

following triangular system


                                      ln(qt ) = α + t + β ln(pt ) + ut

                                     ln(pt ) = γ + t + δ1 [t > t∗ ] + vt


where pt and qt are weekly prices and quantities and 1 [t > t∗ ] is dummy variable equal to one

after the collusion date t∗ . The parameter of interest is β which corresponds to the contraceptive

price elasticity. We run four different specifications presented in Table C.1. In column (1), for

comparison purposes, we present the OLS estimate that yields a parameter of -0.18. Columns (2)

to (4) present the 2SLS results. Column (2) presents the results when we do not exclude the eight

first weeks of the year (i.e., without the donut-hole), while column (3) present the estimates that

incorporate the donut-hole. Column (4) use a kernel weight (gaussian) that gives more weight to

observations near the collusion date and decreasing for dates further away. As can be seen, in the

2SLS strategy elasticities varies form -0.11 to -0.16 which agrees with the rough Wald estimate

obtained from Figures 1 and 5.50




    50
     The lower panel of Table C.1 shows that the first stage in each 2SLS estimation is very strong considering the
high value of the Cragg-Donald statistics.

D     Pharmacy Availability

In this Appendix, we explore the effect of the price jump by the availability of pharmacies in a

given comuna. Although we can only obtain results for the Santiago region, due to data availability,

we find suggestive evidence in favor of the fact that there were different impact depending on such

availability. One would expect that consumers that have easier access to pharmacies would stock

less quantities of medicine as they can easily purchase the monthly dosage needed. On the contrary,

consumers that face scarcity of pharmacies might visit them less often and therefore, be less exposed

to price shifts. To test this hypothesis, we identify comunas with high and low density of pharmacies

using the number of stores per capita as a proxy. Those comunas above the median are considered

to be high density comunas, and consequently, those below the median are considered low density

comunas.

    Table D.1 shows evidence in favor of the contraceptives’ price increase having an earlier effect

in high density comunas than in low density comunas. In fact, high density comunas start feeling

the effect as early as the first week after the two-cycle period, while the low density comunas start

feeling the effect of the price increase around two months after the two-cycle period. Interestingly,

although the effects have different timing, they are of similar sizes: around 35 to 45 extra births

per week.

Note: *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1. Standard errors in parenthesis. HD of Pharm stands for conceptions
that took place in Santiago’s comunas with high density of pharmacies and LD of Pharm stands for conceptions
that took place in comunas with low density of pharmacies. A comuna is said to have high density of pharmacies
if the number pharmacies per capita exceeds the median number of pharmacies per capita in Santiago’s comunas.
Series are detrended (linear trend) and deseasonalized by standard methods (dummies per week of year). Then, the
year-to-year difference in weekly births is computed. The conception week is obtained by subtracting the pregnancy
length to the birth date. Rows titled Non-parametric present the estimates using local polynomial regressions in
which the effect is the difference between the mean of the outcome at the last week of 2007 and the mean—given
by the local polynomial regression—of the outcome at each particular week after the 2-period cycle. Rows titled
Parametric present the results from the estimations presented in Specification 1 in which f (β, |t − t∗ |) fits a different
quadratic polynomial to each side of the cutoff.

     Note: *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1. Standard errors in parenthesis. We combine individual-
     level administrative information on daily school attendance and birth dates. The dependent variable is
     the defined as the proportion of individuals born in a specific week reporting at least one day of school
     attendance in any special education program during the first quarter of the year they are eligible to
     enroll first or second grade. These include: (211) Hearing Disability (Educación Especial Discapaci-
     dad Auditiva), (212) Intelectual Disability (Educación Especial Discapacidad Intelectual ), (213) Visual
     Disability (Educación Especial Discapacidad Visual ), (214) Language Disability (Educación Especial
     Trastornos Especı́ficos del Lenguaje), (215) Motor Disability (Educación Especial Trastornos Motores),
     (216) Autism (Educación Especial Autismo), (217) Social and Communication Disabilities (Educación
     Especial Discapacidad Graves Alteraciones en la Capacidad de Relación y Comunicación), and (299)
     Program for Integration in School (Opción 4 Programa Integración Escolar ). Children turning 6 by
     March 31st of a given year are eligible to enroll in first grade in March of that year. However, the
     Ministry of Education can authorize children turning 6 until June 30th to enroll as well. The children
     that could potentially be affected by the price increase are those who turned six between July 2014
     and January of 2015, so they could attend first grade starting March 2015. The reference group will
     be the ones who turned six between July 2013 and January of 2014, so they could attend first grade
     starting March 2014. Since the effect of collusion on prices became visible during the first week of
     2008, we define those children born between July 2007 and March of 2008 as part of the control group.
     Likewise, children born between July of 2008 and March of 2009 belong to the treatment group. The
     time dummy is equal to 1 if birth month is July or August, and 0 otherwise. For first grade attendance
     we use data for the years 2014 and 2015. For second grade attendance we use data for the same months
     for the years 2015 and 2016. (a): For first and second grade, the means at baseline are represent the
     monthly averages of the dependent variable computed among those born between July and August of
     2014 and 2015, respectively.
