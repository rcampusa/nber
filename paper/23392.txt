                                          ABSTRACT

Using a unique dataset linking preschool blood lead levels (BLLs), birth, school, and detention
data for 120,000 children born 1990-2004 in Rhode Island, we estimate the impact of lead on
behavior: school suspensions and juvenile detention. We develop two instrumental variables
approaches to deal with potential confounding from omitted variables and measurement error in
lead. The first leverages the fact that we have multiple noisy measures for each child. The second
exploits very local, within neighborhood, variation in lead exposure that derives from road
proximity and the de-leading of gasoline. Both methods indicate that OLS considerably
understates the negative effects of lead, suggesting that measurement error is more important than
bias from omitted variables. A one-unit increase in lead increased the probability of suspension
from school by 6.4-9.3 percent and the probability of detention by 27-74 percent, though the latter
applies only to boys.

        Lead exposure in early childhood has been linked to diminished cognition, poor impulse

control, inattention, and aggressive behavior (Wilson and Petersilia (1995), Needleman, Schell,

Bellinger, et al. (1990), Needleman and Gatsonis (1991), Banks, Ferretti and Shucar (1997)).

More recent studies seek to identify the effects of childhood lead exposure on crime by

exploiting the de-leading of gasoline (Gronquist, Nilsson and Robling, 2014; Mielke and

Zahran, 2012; Wolpaw Reyes, 2007 & 2015; Nevin, 2000 & 2007). 1 These studies suggest that

reductions in exposure to lead in early childhood could explain up to 90% of the sharp downward

trend in crime in the U.S. that started in the mid-1990s. However, there are many competing

hypotheses for the large decreases in crime including abortion legalization (Donohue and Levitt,

2001), the decline of the crack-cocaine epidemic, changes in the availability of handguns,

demographic shifts, changes in the demand for unskilled labor, improvements in policing, and

increases in the prison population (see Blumstein and Wallman, 2004 for a discussion). Because

so many of these factors co-vary, it can be difficult to distinguish the independent effect of any

individual factor in a cohort analysis. 2


        In this paper we shift away from an exclusive focus on crime, which is a rare child

outcome (especially among girls). We examine school disciplinary problems in addition to

juvenile incarceration. Disciplinary problems are of interest in their own right as a precursor to

school failure and drop out, as an outcome that can be observed in even relatively young

children, and as an indicator that may be predictive of future criminal behavior (Bernberg and




1
  Other work has exploited the addition of lead pipes to municipal water systems (Feigenbaum and Muller,
forthcoming; Ferrie, Rolf and Troesken, 2012) as a source of variation in lead exposure to estimate the impact of
lead exposure in early childhood on homicide rates and adult IQ, respectively. See Rice (1992) for a summary of
research on lead and aggression based on animal experiments.
2
  For example, California, in addition to de-leading gasoline ahead of the federal schedule, was also an early
legalizer of abortion, and witnessed the early rise and decline of the crack-cocaine epidemic in Los Angeles.

                                                         3
Krohn, 2003; Mowen, 2016; Snyder and Sickmund, 2006). 3 In our data, children who have been

suspended from school are ten times more likely to be detained or incarcerated as adolescents or

young adults. Juvenile incarceration is one of the more extreme consequences of juvenile crime,

and arguably has its own negative impact on the trajectories of affected adolescents. Youth who

are detained for even a short period are less likely to graduate from high school and more likely

to recidivate as adults (Aizer and Doyle, 2015). By examining school disciplinary problems as

well as juvenile incarceration we provide a more nuanced picture of the effect of lead on anti-

social behavior.


         A second contribution is the use of unique individual-level data on all children born in

Rhode Island between 1990 and 2004. Preschool blood lead levels are linked to birth records,

school disciplinary records, and data on juvenile incarcerations. The relationship between lead

exposure and juvenile anti-social behavior is likely to be confounded both by omitted variables

and by measurement errors in blood lead levels. Omitted variables might be expected to lead to

overstatements of the effects of lead since disadvantaged children are more likely to be exposed

to lead. Measurement error could be expected to either attenuate or exaggerate the estimated

effects of lead, depending on its form.


         A third contribution is to develop two distinct identification strategies. Our first strategy

exploits the fact that there are multiple measures of blood lead for the same child for 70-80% of

our sample, or sometimes for multiple children in a family. Hence it is possible to instrument

one blood lead measure with another for either the same child or a sibling, while at the same time


3
  This relationship could reflect differences in underlying behavior, a causal relationship through a labeling effect, or
an “incapacitation effect” of being in school. Monahan et al. (2014) compares outcomes for the same child over
time and finds that during periods when children are suspended from school, they are more likely to be arrested
compared with periods during which they are in school.


                                                           4
controlling for child, family and neighborhood characteristics. Under the null hypothesis that the

errors are uncorrelated (as they would be, for example, if they originated mainly from common

random laboratory measurement errors) this procedure provides an effective way to deal with

attenuation bias due to measurement error in blood lead levels.


       Our second identification strategy can be used with all children (not just those with

multiple measures or siblings), and focuses on the children most affected by exposure to residual

lead from busy roads within a neighborhood. Before the de-leading of gasoline, the lead in car

exhaust fell within 25-50 meters of the road, such that the soil near roads was historically more

contaminated with lead than soil further from roads (Milberg et al, 1980; Fu et al, 1989).

Consistent with this observation, we show that for children born in the early 1990s, there is a

strong relationship between child blood lead levels and traffic on roads within 25-50 meters of

the child’s residence. However, the amount of lead in soil has declined over time following the

de-leading of gasoline between 1979 and 1986, and so too has the relationship between road

proximity and child blood lead levels. We find that for those born in 2004, lead levels vary little

with proximity to traffic.


       We adopt an instrumental variable approach that exploits the greater decline over time in

child lead levels for those with more exposure to traffic within a neighborhood. Our instrument

is an interaction between birth year and proximity to high traffic roads within a neighborhood.

We show that over this time period there was little change in the background characteristics of

children living near high traffic roads, providing some support for the assumed exogeneity of the

instrument. Nor do conditions appear to be improving more generally for those near busy roads:

Birth weight, which is very sensitive to maternal conditions and air pollution, does not change

over time with exposure to traffic.

                                                 5
       We find that both school disciplinary infractions and juvenile incarceration rise with

preschool blood lead levels. Surprisingly, all our IV estimates indicate that simple ordinary

least squares (OLS) estimates considerably understate the negative effects of lead. Since lead

exposure is associated with other measures of disadvantage that tend to predict worse child

outcomes, one might have expected OLS estimates to overstate lead’s effects. Thus, our results

point to mismeasurement of lead exposure as an important source of bias that has been largely

ignored in previous research.


       The IV estimates suggest that a one unit increase in blood lead levels (BLLs) increased

the probability of suspension from school by 6.5 to 7% for boys and by 6.4 to 9.3% for girls,

depending on the instrument and specification. For incarceration, we find significant effects

only for boys. The estimates for incarceration are less precise (given low levels of detention in

the sample) and vary from a 27% to a 74% increase for each one unit increase in BLLs.

Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the large estimated effects of lead on crime in earlier

cohort-based studies and support the hypothesis that reductions in blood lead levels may indeed

have been responsible for a significant part of the observed decrease in anti-social behavior

among youths and young adults in recent decades.




II. Background

       Lead mimics calcium in the body and interferes with all systems that require calcium to

function effectively including the renal, cardiovascular, and nervous systems. Children absorb

lead via ingestion or inhalation and once absorbed, lead impairs brain development and disrupts

neurotransmitter function in ways that negatively affect cognition, attention and short term



                                                 6
memory, and reduce impulse control. Children are more susceptible to lead than adults:

Whereas nearly all of the lead taken into an adult body will leave in waste within weeks, for

children only a third of the lead taken in will leave in waste (US Dept. of Health and Human

Services, 2007).

         Once lead is either ingested or inhaled, it enters the blood stream and is deposited in soft

tissues and organs including the brain. It does not remain in the blood for long (the half life of

lead in blood is 36 days), suggesting that a single blood lead measure could fail to capture all but

recent exposures. Sampling or laboratory errors also add random noise to lead measurement that

could lead to under-estimates of the effects of lead exposure, as discussed further below.

         Historically, the two main sources of lead in the environment were gasoline and

household paint. 4 Beginning in the mid-1920s, lead was added to gasoline in order to improve

engine functioning. With the increase in traffic over the 20th century, the amount of lead from

automobile exhaust increased dramatically from 0.3 tons per 1000 people in 1937 to 1.3 tons by

1974 (Nevin, 2000). By 1971, mounting evidence of the negative health effects of lead

culminated in the U.S. Surgeon General’s pronouncement that lead and childhood lead poisoning

was a public health hazard (U.S. Surgeon General, 1971). In response, the federal government

banned the addition of lead to household paint starting in 1978 and required the phase-out of lead

from gasoline over the period 1979 to 1986. 5 As a result, the amount of new lead in the

environment fell back to its 1937 level within a few years (Laidlow and Filipelli, 2008).


         Lead in automobile exhaust, because of it’s weight, generally fell within 25-50 meters of

the automobile/road. As a result, because of the greater (historical) traffic in urban areas,


4
  A third historical source is lead smelters, with significant but localized exposure. The last lead smelter in the U.S.
was closed in 2013.
5
  Gasoline was mostly de-leaded by 1986 and completely de-leaded by 1996.

                                                            7
concentrations of lead in soil are highest in urban areas, and within urban areas, the soil is most

contaminated near roadways (Batelle, 1998; Lejano and Ericson, 2005; Filipelli et al, 2005).


         Children absorb this residual lead from soil via inhalation and/or ingestion. Sometimes

children eat soil (pica) but inhalation through roadside soil resuspension is more common

(Laidlaw and Filipelli, 2008). Resuspension is positively related to the amount of turbulence

generated by weather and by vehicles passing (Lough et al, 2005). This resuspension of lead in

the air outside of homes is responsible for roughly half of lead found inside homes. 6 Open doors

and windows are the primary ways in which lead bearing dust enters, but in old homes even

closed, “leaky” doors and windows can represent a major pathway for lead dust (Sayre and

Katzel, 1979). Lead is also frequently tracked into homes via shoes and clothing (Hunt et al,

2006).


         In a review of the literature on the sources of lead poisoning among urban children,

Laidlaw and Filippelli (2008) conclude that “interior paint AND pb-enriched soils are both

harmful sources of Pb to children, with paint the likely culprit in cases of acute Pb poisoning,

and soil an important source of Pb in the myriad examples of chronic Pb poisoning of urban

children” (page 2023). As we will see, there are many cases of low level lead exposure in our

data and relative few cases of what appears to be acute lead poisoning leading us to focus on lead

deposited in soil in this analysis.


         Fortunately, the amount of lead in soil has been declining over time as a result of physical

and geochemical transformations. Over time, lead in the soil near roadways gets washed out,

blown or tracked away, and/or complexed onto soil particles, posing less of a threat to children


6
 One study found that half of the lead in house dust in 10 homes in Jersey City came from sources outside of the
home such as soil (Agate et al., 1998a).

                                                         8
(Ming et al, 2012; Datko-Williams, Wilkie and Richmond-Bryant, 2014). The decline in

bioavailable lead in soil over time has been greater in areas near roads than in areas far from

roads, since the former started with much higher levels which then decayed over time. This

convergence in lead levels between areas near and far from busy roads provides one source of

identifying variation that we will use to estimate the causal impact of lead on future behavior, as

described below.


        Lead paint remains a threat in many older homes. Aizer et al. (2017) examine the effect

of a Rhode Island program that aimed to reduce children’s exposure to lead paint by requiring

landlords to obtain lead-safe certificates in order to rent their homes beginning in 1997. The

younger cohorts in our study are likely to have benefitted both from the de-leading of gasoline

and from the certificate program. However, the certificate program targeted particular Census

tracts, rather than distance to roads. We show below that controlling for the number of

certificates that had been issued in the Census tract where the child lived as of the time of their

first lead test (a proxy for the intensity of the lead paint clean up efforts) has little impact on the

estimates reported below which are identified by variation in lead in soil near roads.


        Disadvantaged children are more likely to live in urban settings which in turn have more

lead as a result of greater traffic congestion and an older housing stock. Even within urban

settings, disadvantaged children have higher blood lead levels because they disproportionately

reside in neighborhoods characterized by both greater road density and the oldest homes (Jacobs

et al, 2002; Rowangould, 2013). As we will show below, these patterns also hold in Rhode

Island and hence OLS estimates may be biased by unobserved confounders that are correlated

with both lead exposure and worse child outcomes.



                                                   9
           While disadvantaged children are more likely to be exposed, it is also possible that the

same lead burden has a greater effect on poor and minority children. Billings and Schnepel

(2015) show for example, that intensive intervention is helpful in reversing the effects of lead

poisoning. To the extent that more advantaged children are more likely to receive such

interventions they may suffer less harm than other children. Poor nutrition (especially iron and

zinc deficiency) increases the absorption of lead in a child’s system (Landrigan et al, 1976), and

poor children may be more likely to have such deficiencies. In addition, recent research based

on animal experiments suggests a strong interactive effect between stress (which is more

prevalent among the disadvantaged) and exposure to lead. 7 Hence, in what follows we will ask

whether the estimated effect of a unit exposure to lead appears to be different for more

disadvantaged children.

           However, it is possible that disadvantaged children who display the same behaviors as

other more advantaged children are more severely punished via suspensions or juvenile

incarceration (Rocque, 2010; Kinsler, 2011). So while we can observe whether some children

suffer a greater burden from lead exposure in terms of suspensions and incarcerations, we will

not be able to directly attribute observed differences to differences in a child’s underlying

behavior rather than to differential responses of society to the child’s behavior.




III. Data


           A. Lead and Child Outcomes in Rhode Island




7
    Two animal experiments include Amos-Koohs et al, 2016 and Cory-Slechta et al, 2010.

                                                        10
        In order to estimate the relationship between preschool child blood lead levels and later

problem behavior, we have created a unique data set for Rhode Island children born between

1990 and 2004. Data on each child’s preschool blood lead levels from the state Department of

Health’s (RIDOH) screening program (1994-2010) is linked with information from the Rhode

Island Department of Education (RIDE) on in-school disciplinary infractions resulting in

suspension from school for school years 2007-2008 through 2013-2014. This data is then linked

to information from the Rhode Island Training School, the state’s juvenile detention facility

(which houses juveniles up to age 17) as well as to data from all state correctional institutions

(which house individuals age 18 and older). Data on detentions is available for 2004-2014. 8


        The state of RI is an ideal place to study the effects of lead on future outcomes because of

the state’s aggressive lead screening program. Reports from 2001 to 2011 indicate that over 70

percent of all children had at least one lead screen by 18 months and the screening rate was

roughly constant over this time period, ranging from 71 to 75 percent (RIDOH, 2011). Children

on Medicaid and children living in Providence have slightly higher screening rates. 9

        In contrast, the national screening rate ranged from 22 (in 2002) to 30 percent (in 2010)

(Raymond, Wheler and Brown, 2014). In many jurisdictions children are screened only if there

is some reason to suspect lead poisoning, so that the sample of children who are tested is not

representative of all children in the jurisdiction. Given the high screening rates in RI, the sample

with lead tests is much more similar to the state-wide population of children. Moreover, because



8
  The number of years for which we have outcome data for individuals in our sample varies. Year of birth is strongly
predictive of years of outcome data available and therefore including year of birth fixed effects in our analysis
implicitly controls for the number of years of outcomes data. However some children might leave the state or repeat
a year in school and this would change the number of years for which we have outcome data. In our analyses, we
also control for the number of years of suspension data that we have for each individual.
9
  In Providence, nearly 90% of all children have a BLL by kindergarten entry (McClaine et al, 2013) and 80% of
children on Medicaid in the state had been screened for lead by 36 months (Vivier et al, 2001).

                                                        11
children without obvious symptoms were tested, we have a large sample of children with

relatively low lead levels and can examine the effects of these low lead levels on outcomes.


         Blood lead levels (BLLs) were measured multiple times for most RI children between

birth and the age of 6. Seventy-three percent of children with at least one BLL have more than

one BLL. The data for each test include the BLL, the age of the child in months, method of

collection (capillary vs. venous), and the child’s address at date of measurement. Blood lead is

not normally measured for children over 6 years old so in all cases we are examining the

relationship between preschool BLLs and later juvenile or young adult outcomes.


         There is significant measurement error in blood lead levels that derives from three

sources. The first two concern mismeasurement in each individual blood test. The CDC sets an

acceptable range for measurement error at 4 ug/dL or 10 percent, whichever is greater (Parsons

and Chisolm, 1997). At BLLs below 10 ug/dL, this margin represents a considerable amount of

noise. Moreover, the sample can be contaminated, though this is less common. Contamination,

if it occurs, is more likely in blood drawn via a finger prick (capillary method) than a needle

(venous method). For this reason, venous measures are typically considered more accurate

measures of child BLLs. 10 The third source of measurement error relates to the fact that the half

life of lead in blood is approximately 36 days. As such, lead levels in whole blood indicate

mainly recent exposure, although “there can be variable (but not dominant) input to total blood

lead concentration from past exposure” (National Research Council,1993).




10
  A review of the research comparing measures of BLL from capillary and venous sampled drawn on the same day
suggest a strong correlation between capillary and venous measures, and while capillary measures tend on average
to be slightly higher, it does happen that venous measures can be higher than capillary measures (Parsons, Reilly and
Essernio-Jensen, 1997).

                                                         12
        These sources of noise or error in measures of blood lead levels can lead to either over or

under estimates of a child’s true lead burden in OLS regression. Random errors of the type

implied by the CDCs margins of error would tend to cause understatement of the estimated

effects of lead. The short half life of lead in blood would tend to lead to understating the extent

of lead exposure, and thus overstating the estimated effect of lead on outcomes in OLS

regressions. As we will show below, the evidence suggests that in practice measurement error

leads to considerable understatement of the effects of lead.


        Because we have on average 3 tests per child, we will have a noisy measure of lead

burden over the child’s first 72 months of life, but one that we will show is considerably more

informative than a single measure of blood lead would be. To generate a summary measure of

blood lead levels for each child, we calculate the geometric mean over all tests, a procedure that

minimizes the influence of outliers and is consistent with the existing literature.


        The data on disciplinary infractions includes the reason for the disciplinary infraction, the

type of discipline, a scrambled school ID, year of infraction, student race, gender, ethnicity and

free lunch status for school years 2007/8 to 2013/14. 11 For each child we have, on average, five

years of infractions data. With these data we construct a single summary outcome measure:

Whether the child was ever suspended. Roughly 20% of children in our sample were ever

suspended compared to 24% who ever had any sort of disciplinary infraction suggesting that

most students who ran afoul of school authorities were eventually suspended. Our second

outcome is whether the child was ever detained in the state’s juvenile detention center or state



11
  For all infractions: 37% are for disorderly conduct or disrespectful behavior, 10% for fighting/assault, 28% for
skipping school or detention, 4% for threats/harassment and 1% for drugs. For infractions leading to suspension,
36% are for disorderly conduct/disrespectful behavior, 15% for fighting/assault, 21% for skipping school/detention,
6% for threats/harassment, and 2% for drugs. Fifty-five percent of infractions resulted in suspension.

                                                        13
correctional facility. In our sample, 1.1% of all children were ever detained or incarcerated

(1.8% of boys). When we examine this measure, we limit our data to children born between

1991 and 1999 because few younger children are detained or incarcerated.


        For a subset of these records, those born in the state of RI after 1996, we also have linked

vital statistics natality data (birth certificates). The natality data include child birth weight, birth

order, maternal marital status, age and education at time of birth. They also include a maternal

identifier that allows us to identify siblings in the data.


        Table 1 provides an overview of our data. There are significant disparities in blood lead

levels by race and income, just as one sees in national data (Raymond, Wheeler and Brown,

2014). For all children, the average preschool BLL of children in our sample is 3.8 micrograms

per deciliter (ug/dl); for white children, the average is 3.4 ug/dl, while Black and Hispanic

children have levels of 5.3 ug/dl and 4.5 ug/dl respectively. If we categorize the sample by free

lunch status (i.e. children who were ever observed to receive free school lunch), the average BLL

of free lunch children is 4.5 ug/dl compared with an average BLL of 3.0 ug/dl among students

who always paid for their lunch. Note that BLLs of less than 5 ug/dl (10 in the earlier years of

our data) were unlikely to be treated in any way over most of our sample period. Treatment

consists of chelation, which involves removing circulating lead from blood, but does not remove

lead that has already been deposited to organs such as the brain.


        These overall means mask important trends in both lead levels and disparities over time.

Over time, both average lead levels and disparities by race and income have declined

considerably (see Appendix Figures 1 and 2). Among children born in 2004, the average lead




                                                   14
level had declined by 3.2 ug/dl, the black-white gap had shrunk from 3.6 to 0.8 ug/dl and the

income gap (free lunch vs paid) had shrunk from 2.7 to 0.9 ug/dl.


       The dramatic declines in lead levels were accompanied by large declines in disciplinary

infractions that were likewise greater for African-American children and free lunch children.

Table 1 shows that overall, about 24 percent of children had a disciplinary infraction over the

time period that we observe them, and 20 percent were suspended. These rates are more than

double for African-American compared to white children. Appendix Figures 3A and 3B show

that rates of infractions were falling over the time period, though they are quite different for

different grade levels. Interestingly, middle school students have the highest rates of disciplinary

infractions, though this may reflect high rates of drop out in higher grades (assuming that the

most disruptive students drop out). Rates of juvenile detention are very low in the full sample at

only 1.1 percent, but rise to 3.5 percent among African-Americans, and 5.9 percent among

African-American males. One sees similar gaps in juvenile detention between free lunch and

paid lunch children with rates of 3.2 percent vs. .3 percent among males in these two groups,

respectively.


       The rest of Table 1 traces out the familiar pattern of disadvantage that one might expect.

In addition to higher lead levels, African-American and free lunch children tend to have less

educated mothers, younger mothers, single mothers, lower birth weight, and more siblings as

reflected in a higher birth order. These differences highlight the challenges involved in

separating the effects of lead from the effects of other disadvantages.

        B. Lead and Exposure to Traffic


        In order to measure a child’s potential exposure to residual lead in soil near roads, the

data on child blood levels were matched, based on the child’s geocoded address at the time of

each test, to data on Rhode Island roads from the RIGIS E-911 data for the period 2001-2014. 12

For each child and blood test, we measure the number of meters of road by road type within a

radius of 25 and 50 meters of the child’s home. We multiply the number of meters of each road

type with measures of average traffic per road type based on 1980 national traffic data. We then

calculate a measure of “average traffic” over the child’s multiple addresses. The appendix

describes the construction of this measure in greater detail.


        To address changes in the road network over time, we compared satellite images from the

1980s with current data. Few differences can be seen with one exception: the expansion of roads

in suburban subdivisions. In the robustness section we describe analyses that remove these areas

with newer roads from our sample in order to test the sensitivity of our results to this source of

mismeasurement of road density.


        There is considerable variation in road density and traffic volume across the state even

within a neighborhood. The median coefficient of variation in traffic within a census block group

is 0.64 and ranges from 0.29 to 2.3. Figure 1 shows a map of a single RI census tract made up of

five census block groups to illustrate how this measure of traffic exposure varies even across

homes within a census block group. In the figure, each circle represents a home with a child.

Circle radius indicates traffic volume within a 50 meter radius of the home, with larger radii

indicating greater traffic volume. The traffic volume for each home is a function of the number


12
  Because the matching process required access to address, the match was performed by the Providence Plan which
created and maintained the linked dataset.

                                                      16
of meters of road within 50 meters and the type of road, with highways generating the most

traffic, town streets the least, and state and county roads somewhere in between.


       Table 2 shows that disadvantaged children are more likely to live in high traffic

neighborhoods. When we compare the race and free lunch status of children who live in high

traffic (top quartile) vs. low traffic (bottom quartile), we find that high traffic areas are 59%

white and 33% paid lunch relative to low traffic areas which are 87% white and 64% paid lunch,

a difference of 28 (white) and 31 (paid lunch) percentage points (Table 2, column 1). Much of

this difference is due to the fact that disadvantaged children live in more urban parts of the state:

When we condition on municipality, the difference in racial and income composition by traffic

exposure declines from 28 and 31 percentage points, respectively, to 6 and 13 percentage points

(Table 3, Column 2). 13 If we condition on census tract or census block group, the differences

decline further still to 3 and 9 percentage points, respectively, as shown in columns 3 and 4.

Clearly conditioning on neighborhood significantly reduces differences in child characteristics

across high and low road dense areas, though it does not entirely eliminate the differences.


       Because conditioning on neighborhood doesn’t eliminate average differences in child

characteristics between high and low traffic exposure homes, we do not simply use spatial

variation in traffic exposure within neighborhoods for identification. Rather, we exploit changes

over time in high vs. low traffic areas within a neighborhood. More specifically, the identifying

assumption is that traffic exposure is more predictive of a child’s blood lead levels early in the

sample (i.e., for those born in the early 1990s), than for those born later in the sample (in the

early 2000s).



13
     There are 39 cities.

                                                   17
   Figure 2 shows the relationship between traffic exposure (measured in percentiles) and child

preschool blood lead levels for children born in 1990 and children born in 2004. In order to

focus on differences in traffic exposure within a neighborhood (defined as a census block group)

we first regress lead levels and traffic measures on neighborhood fixed effects and then plot the

residuals from these two regressions in Figure 2. The residuals capture variation in both lead

levels and traffic within a neighborhood. The relationship between within-neighborhood traffic

volume and child preschool BLLs (the slope) is steeper for the older children than the younger

children in our sample.


   For this identification strategy to be valid (that is, for the exclusion restriction to hold), it

must be the case that the variation in lead exposure over time within high traffic areas is

uncorrelated with underlying changes in the characteristics of children living in these areas that

might also affect outcomes. In other words, the declines in children’s blood lead levels cannot be

correlated with changes in the underlying composition of the children that would predict

probabilities of suspension or incarceration.


   To provide evidence on this point, Figure 3 plots time trends in lead levels and child

characteristics by birth cohort and traffic volume (top quartile vs. bottom quartile of traffic

volume). The difference in the average lead levels of children with the highest vs. lowest traffic

exposure are initially large, but converge over time (top left panel of Figure 3). In contrast,

while the underlying characteristics of children (race, income and maternal education) differ in

high traffic areas relative to low traffic areas, both the levels and the differences between high

and low traffic areas are fairly constant over time (top right and bottom panels of Figure 3). We

conclude that the convergence in lead levels for children living in high vs. low traffic areas is not

driven by changes in the underlying characteristics of the children living in these areas.

                                                  18
   Another possible explanation for the steeper declines in lead levels among children living in

high traffic areas is that conditions are simply improving generally for disadvantaged children,

who happen to live in high traffic areas of the state. To explore this possibility, we examine

time trends in lead levels for advantaged children living near vs. far from traffic. If the declining

lead levels are attributable to reductions in lead in soil and not to overall improvements in

conditions among the most disadvantaged, then we should see that even among children from

advantaged families, traffic exposure predicts child lead levels.


    We explore this idea in Figure 4. In order to generate this figure we calculated a summary

measure of child disadvantage: The predicted lead level of the child based on coefficients

obtained from a regression of lead levels on child race, ethnicity, free lunch status, and

neighborhood fixed effects using data from the 1990 and 1991 birth cohorts. Children with

higher predicted lead levels are more disadvantaged and would have higher BLLs in 1990. We

define the advantaged population of children as those with the lowest predicted lead (the bottom

quartile). We plot the trends in lead levels for the most advantaged children in our sample

separately for high traffic and low traffic areas. Figure 4 shows that even among the advantaged

children, those in high traffic areas start with higher levels of blood lead which converge over

time to the BLLs of advantaged children in low traffic areas. Thus, our results are not driven by

contemporaneous policies mainly benefitting disadvantaged children.


   Finally, could the declines in lead levels that we observe simply reflect more general

improvements in environmental conditions over this period? To rule out this possibility, we show

below that birthweight, an indicator of child health that is sensitive to pollution (Aizer and

Currie, 2014) does not differentially improve over time for children near roads.



                                                 19
IV. Estimation
         We first present estimates of the relationship between preschool BLLs and the probability

of school disciplinary infractions and juvenile detentions based on the following OLS equation:


(1) 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 = β0 + β1 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 + β2 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖1 + β3 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖2 + β4 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖

                    + β5 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ ∗ 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + β6 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ2 ∗ 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

                    + β7 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ ∗ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + β8 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ2 ∗ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿ℎ 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜏𝜏𝑛𝑛

                    + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖


Each observation is a child, and Y is an indicator for ever suspended or juvenile

detention/incarceration; Lead is the geometric mean of the child’s multiple BLLs measured

before the start of school, X1 is a vector of child characteristics that we have for all children

(gender, race, ethnicity and free lunch status); X2 is a vector of child characteristics that we have

only for children born in RI after 1996 (maternal education, birth weight, birth order, maternal

age and marital status at birth); Years of infraction data is a vector of indicator variables for the

number of years for which we have infraction data for the child which ranges from 1 to 8, with

an average of 5. We also include a vector of neighborhood fixed effects, τn, year of birth fixed

effects, τt, and race and free lunch specific quadratic time trends to address the concern that any

improvements in outcomes could simply reflect improving circumstances over time for the most

disadvantaged children generally.


    As discussed above, OLS estimates may be biased by confounding, and are likely to be

attenuated by random measurement error. Hence, we estimate two types of instrumental variable

models. The first takes advantage of the fact that we have multiple measures for most of the


                                                                  20
children in our sample. 14 Thus, we can estimate the impact of a single, randomly drawn measure

of a child’s BLL (a noisy measure) on behavior in an OLS setting and compare it with an

estimate based on a less noisy measure of child lead that’s based on the average of all the other

lead measures. Not only should the noisier measure of lead result in a smaller estimated

relationship between lead and suspensions, but once we instrument for the single measure with

the average measure, the IV estimate should be considerably larger than the OLS.


     For the subset of the data for which we also have sibling lead levels, we can use a sibling’s

average lead level as an instrument for the child’s own average lead level. The rationale for using

sibling lead levels as an instrument for own lead levels is that preschool lead levels are mostly a

function of one’s residence. Given that siblings usually co-reside, a sibling’s lead level should

reflect the same (or at least very similar) lead exposure. Note that we can only perform this last

exercise for the school suspension outcome, not the detention/incarceration outcome due to data

limitations—there are too few sibling pairs with incarceration data, given that sibling

information is not available until 1997.


     Our second instrumental variables strategy exploits declines in the residual lead in soil near

roads to identify the estimated impact of preschool child BLLs on future behavior. Our

instruments are interactions between quartiles of traffic volume and a linear time trend. The

main terms (quartiles of traffic volume and year of birth) are included as controls in both the first

and second stage. We use quartiles of traffic volume in order to allow for any non-linearity in

the relationship between traffic volume and BLLs. The first stage equation is:

where Lead is the child’s average BLL, X1 includes child gender, race, ethnicity and free lunch

status, X2 includes maternal education, birth weight, birth order, maternal age and marital status

at birth. Traffic volume is a vector of three indicator variables for the top three quartiles of road

density (the lowest quartile is omitted), Traffic volume*Year of Birth is the interaction between

each quartile of road density and a linear year of birth term. In the robustness section, we allow

for a non-linear time trend for traffic volume by including quadratic terms as well (Traffic

volume* year of birth2). We include race and free lunch specific quadratic time trends as well as

indicators for the number of years for which we have infractions data for each child, year of birth

FE (τt ) and census block group fixed effects (τn).

V. Results


   A. OLS Results


   Table 3 shows OLS estimates of equation (1) with increasing numbers of controls as one

moves across the columns. Comparing columns 1 and 2 shows that once we control for town or

municipality, adding Census block group fixed effects has almost no impact on the estimated

effect of lead on the probability of a suspension. The estimate of 0.0095 implies that each 1unit

increase in average blood lead increases the probability of a suspension by about one percentage

point on a baseline of 20 percent. Column 3 adds fixed effects for Census block groups and

schools. This addition reduces the estimated effect of lead slightly. Finally, column 4 shows the

effect of adding additional controls for family background and birth weight. This model is

estimated using the sub-sample for whom we have this information. The estimate of 0.0089 is

very little reduced from the column 1 model, suggesting that adding further demographic

controls would not be likely to have much effect.


   Columns 5 to 7 of Table 3 perform the same exercise for detentions and incarcerations on the

smaller sample for whom we have this outcome. Once again, the results are quite stable when

additional sets of controls are added suggesting that a fairly basic set of background controls may

be sufficient to control for potential confounding. The point estimate here of 0.0014 on a

baseline of 0.01 suggests that an increase of one unit in average blood lead levels increases the

probability of detention or incarceration by about 10 percent.

                                                23
   A second way to test for the importance of omitted variable bias in the OLS estimates

exploits the decline in negative selection into lead witnessed over this period. Assuming that

observables and unobservables are positively correlated, as negative selection on observables

declines over time, so too should negative selection on unobservables. If negative selection on

unobservables is driving OLS estimates of the relationship between lead and suspensions, then

the negative estimated relationship between lead and suspensions in OLS should likewise decline

over time. We explore this conjecture in Appendix Table 1. We first present evidence of the

decline in negative selection over time in elevated BLLs. This sample is limited to children born

1993-1998 so that we can examine a single uniform outcome for all: the number of infractions in

9th grade. We regress lead levels on race, free lunch, gender, year of birth (linear), and census

block group FE, as well as interactions between free lunch and year of birth and race (African

American) and year of birth. The interaction terms are intended to capture any changes over

time in selection on race and income into elevated lead. The results (column 1) show that being

poor and African American is strongly predictive of elevated BLLs, but this relationship has

been declining over time, as evidenced by the negative and significant interaction terms.


       Next, we present estimates of a regression of the number of ninth grade infractions on

child lead levels, lead interacted with year of birth and all demographic controls. While the

coefficient on lead is positive and significant, the coefficient on the interaction between lead and

year of birth is small and imprecise (column 2). Column (3) shows similar results for a

specification that includes race and free lunch-specific time trends. This table suggests that

although disparities in lead exposure are falling the relationship between a unit of blood lead and

behavior is not changing over time which is inconsistent with the estimated effect being driven

by omitted variables bias.


                                                 24
     B. Heterogeneous Effects


     As discussed above, there is considerable heterogeneity in exposure to lead, and there may

also be heterogeneous effects of similar lead exposure by socioeconomic status. Heterogeneity

in the effects of lead is explored further in Table 4. Panel A examines the effects of lead on the

probability of any suspension. The specification is similar to that in column 2 of Table 3 except

that lead is also interacted with an indicator for male. Column (1) shows that overall, the effect

of lead on girls (0.0059) is roughly half the size of the effect on boys (0.0059+0.0056=0.012).

But this smaller effect for girls is driven largely by white and paid lunch students (columns 2 and

5). Among whites the gender difference in the effect of lead on suspensions is even more

pronounced with a point estimate of 0.0033 for girls compared to 0.0099 for boys. Among

children who pay for their lunch, lead is only estimated to affect suspensions among boys.


     In contrast, among African-American, Hispanic, and free lunch students, lead is estimated to

have equal effects on boys and girls, that is, the interaction with male is not statistically

significant. Among boys, the estimated effect of a unit of blood lead on the probability of

suspension is actually rather similar for whites, African-Americans, or Hispanics. These results

could be easily explained in terms of, for example, preferential treatment for white and higher

income girls. 15 That is, the differences do not necessarily reflect any differences in the

underlying behavior problems caused by a one unit increase in blood lead levels.




15
  Existing national data on racial differences in school suspensions shows that boys receive two thirds of all
suspensions but black girls are suspended at higher rates than girls of any race and most boys (USDOE Office of
Civil Rights, 2014).

                                                        25
   Panel B shows a similar breakdown for detention/incarceration. This panel makes it clear

that lead only appears to affect detention/incarceration among boys, with a clear gradient by

socioeconomic status. Among boys, whites and children who pay for their lunch have much

lower estimates than African-Americans, Hispanics, and children on free lunch. Again it is not

entirely clear that these differences reflect differences in behavior vs. differences in punishments

conditional on behavior. It should be noted that while the point estimates are larger for African

American, Hispanic and free lunch children, relative to the baseline rates of detention for these

groups, the effects are actually smaller. For example, a unit of lead increases the probability of

incarceration for black males by only 6.6 percent compared to 16.6 percent for white males.


   In what follows we will allow estimated effects to vary for males, which seems very

important at least in the case of incarceration.   We will also show separate estimates for the free

lunch sample, as it is the group most vulnerable to suspensions and incarceration.




   C. Instrumental Variables Estimates Based on Multiple Measures of Lead


   The estimates in Tables 3 and in Appendix Table 1 suggest that given the rich controls

available in our data, perhaps residual confounding is not a large source of bias in our estimates.

However, as we will show below, there is good reason to believe that measurement error remains

a problem, biasing the estimated effects of lead shown in Tables 3 and 4 towards zero. The fact

that there are multiple lead measures for each child, and in some cases for each family, suggests

several possible instrumental variables estimates based on using one measure as an instrument

for another noisy measure of the child’s underlying level of lead exposure. Table 5a shows three

different ways in which we have implemented this idea.


                                                   26
   In columns 1 to 4, we focus on the subset of children who have both a capillary and a venous

BLL measure. Since capillary measures are less accurate, we would expect the use of a capillary

measure to result in an estimate that is smaller than one based on a venous measure. A

comparison of columns 1 and 2 shows that this is indeed the case. In column 3 we use the

average of the venous tests as instruments for the average of the capillary test measures, and in

column 4 we do the reverse. Both instrumental variables estimates are considerably larger than

the corresponding OLS estimates, consistent with measurement error in these tests. Column 4

suggests, for example, that the probability of having ever been suspended increases by 1.2

percentage points for girls and 1.6 percentage points for boys for each one unit increase in BLLs

(on a baseline of 20 percent of children who have any suspension). A drawback of this approach

is that relatively few children in our sample (24,509) have both types of measures and they are

unlikely to be a random sample of all children.


   In columns 5 through 8 we therefore experiment with taking a random draw and

instrumenting for it using the average of all the other available measures, and vice versa. This

procedure is possible for any child who has more than one BLL. Columns 7 and 8 show that

these IV estimates are again much larger than the corresponding OLS estimates shown in

columns 5 and 6. For example, column 8 suggests that based on the instrumented estimate, a

one unit increase in the average BLL increases the probability of any suspension by .96

percentage points for girls, and by 1.7 percentage points for boys, compared with .49 and .96,

respectively, for the OLS.


   Finally, in column 9 we show estimates where one child in the household’s average BLL is

instrumented using a sibling’s BLL (if there are multiple siblings, we use the average of the

siblings’ BLLs). This estimation can only be done on the subset of children (34,252) who have a

                                                  27
sibling with a BLL. The estimates of 1.2 for girls and 2.98 for boys are somewhat larger than

those discussed above.


   Panel B of Table 5a performs the same estimations for detention/incarceration, with the

exception of the sibling IV. The latter is infeasible because the sibling subsample was born in

1997 or later so that they are too young for the incarceration outcome. Again these estimates

suggest that OLS estimates are biased towards zero due to considerable measurement error in

BLLs. For example, column 6 shows the OLS estimate of lead on suspension using the average

of all other tests as the measure of lead. The estimated effect of a one-unit increase in BLL for

males is .35 percentage points. Column 8 shows the IV estimate, where the instrument is a

randomly drawn BLL. The estimated effect increases to .56 percentage points, on a baseline of

2.04 percent for males, suggesting a very large effect of lead on the probability of incarceration.


   Table 5b repeats these estimations using the sample of children with a much higher baseline

rate of suspensions and incarceration: children who ever participated in the free school lunch

program (Table 1). These results suggest larger effects for girls in this sample, but similar

effects for boys (Panel A). However, given the different baseline probabilities of suspensions in

this sample, the estimates for boys, for example, translate into a 4.3% increase in the probability

of suspension per one-unit increase in BLL in the free lunch sample compared to a 6.5% increase

in the full sample.


   For the incarceration outcome, Panel B of Table 5b shows that the point estimates of the

effects of lead are remarkably similar in the full and free lunch samples. Comparing the IV

coefficients in column 8, panel B of Tables 5a and 5b suggests that a unit increase in BLL

increases the probability of male incarceration by .56pp in the full sample and by .55pp in the


                                                 28
free lunch sample. Given the baseline differences in the probability of incarceration, these

estimates translate into increases of 27% and 16.9% for the full sample and the free lunch sample

respectively.


   Overall, these IV estimates suggest that the true effect of lead on suspensions is considerably

understated by OLS estimates, consistent with a large amount of measurement error in BLLs.

The estimates also suggest that the underlying effects of lead may be quite similar in more and

less disadvantaged samples, although a given increase in disruptive behavior results in larger

percentage increases in negative outcomes among more advantaged children given their lower

baseline probabilities of suffering either suspensions or incarcerations.




        D. Instrumental Variables Estimates Based on Exposure to Traffic


       In this section, we present estimates based on our traffic IV. These estimates measure the

effect of lead on the children who were “treated” by a reduction in ambient lead from roadways

near their homes. Regression models linking traffic volume with child BLLs from equation (2)

are shown in Appendix Table 2. Exposure to traffic is a highly statistically significant

determinant of child BLLs (see the coefficients on the indicators for Traffic volume quartile 2 to

Traffic volume quartile 4). The relationship is strongest for children in the top quartile of traffic

exposure. As discussed above, our instrument is not traffic volume, but the interaction between

the traffic volume indicators and a linear time trend. The identifying assumption is that places

with higher traffic volumes saw larger reductions in blood lead levels, due to the reduction over

time in the amount of residual lead near roadways, and not some other factor that also affected

children’s probability of being suspended or incarcerated. Recall earlier evidence that changes in


                                                 29
the composition of children are not driving the decline near roadways (Figure 3), nor are general

improvements in the outcomes of disadvantaged children over this period (Figure 4).


       Because we are allowing the effects to differ for males, by including the interaction term

lead*male, we use the predicted lead level from column 1 of Appendix Table 2 to predict lead

levels for all children, and then interact this variable with an indicator for male to form an

instrument for lead*male (Wooldridge, 2010). Table 6 presents the first stages for the two

endogenous variables: lead (column 1) and lead*male (column 2). Column 1 of Table 6 is

similar to Appendix Table 2 and like Appendix Table 2, shows a strong relationship between

traffic and lead that declines over time. However, this first stage differs slightly from the

Appendix regression because it also includes the instrument for lead*male. In column 2 of Table

6, the instrument, predicted lead*male, is highly statistically significant.


       Estimates of the second stage regression (equation 3), including the lead*male interaction

and using the traffic instrument, are shown in columns 2 and 4 of Table 7 along with the

corresponding OLS estimates from column 1 of Table 4 (reproduced in columns 1 and 3 of Table

7 for convenience). The estimates in column 2 Panel A suggest that a one unit increase in her

average BLL raises a girl’s probability of being suspended by 1.3 percentage points on a baseline

of 14 percent. The corresponding estimate for boys is 2.7 percentage points on a baseline of 25

percent. In percent terms, the effects are not very different, suggesting a 9.3% increase in the

probability of suspension for girls and a 10.8% increase in the probability of suspension for boys.

These results can be compared to the IV estimated based on multiple measures of lead presented

in Table 5a which implied that a one unit increase in BLL would increase the probability of

suspension among boys and girls by 6.4% and 6.5% respectively.



                                                  30
       Column 4 in Panel A of Table 7 shows the traffic IV estimates of the effect of lead on the

probability of incarceration in the full sample. As with the IV estimates based on alternative lead

measures (Table 5a), there is no statistically significant effect for girls. For boys, the estimate

implies that a one unit increase in average blood lead increases the probability of incarceration

by 1.3 percentage points, on an overall baseline incarceration rate of 1.8 percent. This is a large

percent effect, in part because the baseline incarceration rate in the overall population is so small.


       We also present these results for the free lunch sample, given that this is the population

most at risk for these outcomes. In terms of the estimated effects of BLLs on suspension, the

estimates suggest once again that in the free lunch sample, lead increases the probability of

suspension for both boys and girls, whereas in the full sample, the effect was only statistically

significant for males. The point estimates suggest that a one unit increase in BLL increases the

probably of suspension by 24% for boys and 39% for girls in the free lunch sample.


       The estimated effects of lead on incarceration are also larger in the IV setting, and once

again found only for boys. A one unit increase in BLL is estimated to increase the probability of

incarceration by 1.8 percentage points. However, given the much higher incidence of

incarceration in free lunch group, the percentage increase is smaller than in the full sample, at

57%.


       Clearly, the percent changes in incarceration are very sensitive to the baseline level

chosen for comparison, given the small incidence of incarceration in the population. However,

regardless of the correct baseline for computing percentage effects, the traffic IV point estimates

for incarceration in Table 7 are much larger than the multiple measures IV estimates in Table 5,




                                                  31
which is in line with the idea that the traffic IV is picking up the effect of lead in the most

vulnerable population.




         E. Robustness


         We conducted four robustness checks (Table 8). First we include a control for the

average number of infractions per year in the child’s school*birth cohort to account for any

changes in policy at the school*cohort level that might also influence the number of disciplinary

infractions (column 2). 16 Second, we add controls to account for the Rhode Island Lead-Safe

certificate program analyzed by Aizer et al. (2017). This program aimed to encourage landlords

to mitigate lead hazards in homes for rent. Specifically, in column 3 we add controls for the

number of certificates that had been issued in the census tract where the child lived as of the time

of their first lead test (a proxy for the intensity of the lead paint clean up efforts).


         As a third robustness check, we drop all census tracks for which we observe substantial

changes (increases) in roads over this period. Sixty-six percent of our sample live in tracts that

gain no new roads between 1980 and today. Eight percent of our sample live in tracts that gain a

substantial number of new roads. These are mostly suburban subdivisions. No one lives in a

tract that loses roads over this period. When we drop the sample that gain a substantial number of

new roads, the sample size falls to 114,512 from approximately 125,000, and the estimates

remain largely unchanged (column 4). Finally, we include quadratic trends for traffic*birth



16
  Construction of this control proceeds as follow: for all children in the RI schools in 6th grade, we include the
average number of infractions in that child’s school for 6th graders. For children missing information on 6th grade
(because they were born early or late in the period), we include either 3rd grade averages (for those born later), or 9th
grade averages for those born earlier.

                                                           32
cohort in the IV regressions (column 5, panel B). The results suggest that the estimates are

robust to all these modifications.


       Could traffic volume and the interaction between traffic volume and birth cohort simply

reflect changes in housing or air quality more generally over this period? If so, one might expect

to estimate a significant relationship between traffic volume and birth weight, a measure of

newborn health that is very responsive to both maternal circumstances and air pollution (Aizer

and Currie, 2015). To consider this possibility, we present reduced form estimates of the impact

of traffic volume and its interaction with year of birth on birth weight as well as neighborhood

fixed effects and IV estimates of the impact of lead levels on birth weight in Table 9.


       There appears to be no relationship between traffic volume or its interaction with birth

cohort, and birth weight (Table 9, column 1). Moreover, there does not appear to be any

meaningful or significant relationship between lead and birth weight (columns 2 and 3): The

OLS estimate of -.00291 would suggest that a 3.5 unit decline in lead (the decline witnessed over

the 14 year period studied here) is associated with a 10 gram decline in birth weight (relative to a

mean birth weight of 3,300 grams) and the IV estimate is similarly small in magnitude though

positive and statistically insignificant. We interpret these estimates as suggestive evidence that

the decline in lead levels over time in high traffic areas does not reflect improving conditions

more generally as these might also be expected to affect birth weight.




       VI. Conclusions


       This paper makes several contributions to the literature examining the link between lead

poisoning and anti-social behavior among juveniles. First, we broaden our study away from the

                                                 33
exclusive focus on crime, to consider school disciplinary problems. Disciplinary problems

predict school failure and drop out, are much more common, and can be observed in both boys

and girls. Suspensions are also highly predictive of future criminal activity: in our data, children

who have been suspended are ten times more likely to be involved in criminal activity. We also

look at juvenile detention/incarceration, which is an indicator of crime but also has its own

negative impacts on juveniles.


       A second contribution is to add to a literature that has relied on variation in exposure to

lead at the state-cohort level by constructing and examining rich individual-level data from

linked administrative records for all children born in Rhode Island between 1990 and 2004 and

exploiting very local variation in exposure to lead. This long time span allows us to link

preschool BLLs to the outcomes of children in middle school and beyond. By including

individual-level controls and also controlling for neighborhoods at the level of the Census block

group, we are able to alleviate concerns about confounding due to omitted variables.


       A third contribution is to develop two identification strategies which rely on different

assumptions. Both identification strategies indicate that OLS estimates are considerably

attenuated by measurement error in BLLs, an important result given that attenuation due to

measurement error has been largely ignored in the previous literature.


       We find that a one unit increase in BLLs increased the probability of suspension from

school by 6.5 to 7% for boys and by 6.4 to 9.3% for girls. For incarceration, we only find

statistically significant effects for boys. The estimates are less precise and suggest that a one unit

increase in BLL increases the probability of incarceration by between 27% to a 74% increase for

each one unit increase in BLLs. Given low baseline levels of incarceration, the estimated


                                                 34
probabilities are quite sensitive to the exact baseline level chosen. Still, our results support the

hypothesis that reductions in blood lead levels may have been responsible for a significant part

of the observed decrease in anti-social behavior among youths and young adults in recent

decades.

     Child SES is measured using the predicted lead level of the child based on estimates
     of a regresion of lead on gender race ethnicity free lunch status and neigbhborhood
     fixed effects for children born 1990-1991 and applied to all chidlren.
     Our proxy for high SES children is a predicted lead level in the bottom quartile.
                    Appendix – Construction of the measure of traffic volume

Steps in the construction of the traffic measure:
   1) For each household, we measure the number of meters of road within 25 and 50 meters
      by functional class (primary, secondary and tertiary roads) and urban/rural status.
      Primary roads refer to highways, secondary roads to state routes, and tertiary roads to
      streets. In total, there are 6 road types: primary-urban, secondary-urban, tertiary-urban,
      primary –rural, secondary-rural, tertiary-rural. See below for a more detailed description
      of the road types. These data come from the RIGIS Roads-E-911 data. A description of
      the data and a link to the data can be found here: http://www.rigis.org/data/e911Roads.
      “These data contain street center lines and address ranges for all highways, roads, and
      streets for the entire state of Rhode Island. AK Associates conflated this data from the
      existing road data developed by MicroDATA GIS, RI DOT, 2008 Pictometry and data
      provided by Municipal Agencies for Rhode Island Enhanced 9-1-1 (RI E-911). Portions
      of this data set were collected as early as 2001.”
   2) Using data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics on traffic patterns by road type
      for 1980 we then generate a measure of traffic volume by multiplying each meter of road
      by functional class and urban/rural status with measures of vehicles miles travelled per
      lane-mile by functional class and urban/rural status in 1980. 1
   3) Finally, we sum up the traffic measures generated in step 2. Roads within 25 meters are
      given full weight, roads between 25 and 50 meters are given ¼ weight to reflect the
      highly localized nature of lead contamination.
   4) For each child, we may have multiple addresses and therefore multiple measures of
      traffic exposure. Since we are estimating the impact of an average measure of lead on
      outcomes, we calculate an average measure of traffic exposure over the preschool years
      and use that measure in our analysis.


Description of road types: Primary roads are generally divided limited-access highways within
the interstate highway system or under State management, and are distinguished by the presence
of interchanges. These highways are accessible by ramps and may include some toll highways.
Secondary roads are main arteries, usually in the U.S. Highway, State Highway, and/or County
Highway system. These roads have one or more lanes of traffic in each direction, may or may
not be divided, and usually have at-grade intersections with many other roads and driveways.
They usually have both a local name and a route number. Tertiary roads consist of paved non-
arterial streets, roads, or byways that usually have a single lane of traffic in each direction.
