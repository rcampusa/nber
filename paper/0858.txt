                                Abstract



     This paper surveys new methods for estimating labor supply functions. A

unified framework of analysis is presented. All recent models of labor supply are

special cases of a general index function model developed for the analysis of

                                     Introduction


                Recant empirical studies of labor supply have their foundations

in the statistical theory of "index functions." This theory offers a general

methodology to correct for sample selection biases and provides a concep-

tually simple framework     far modeling corner solutions to the consumer's
utility vtttie4mization   problem. In this survey we show how recent studies on

labor   supply dealing with    the   topics of labor force participation, fixed
costs of work, and taxes can all be fit within a general "index function
framework."
            The statistical theory of index functions has its foundation in the
literature on duy endogenous variables in a system of simultaneous equations.
This   literature is based on the notion that discrete endogenous variables
are generated by continuous latent variables crossing thresholds. Tobin's
(1958) seminal paper on estimating the demand for consumer durables is
the first application of index function theory in economics. In Tobin's
model, the intensity of demand for the durable good is the index function.
Due to population variation in reservation prices, many consumers are at
corner solutions. Only if the intensity of demand exceeds some minimum
level   (the threshold) does the individual purchase the durable good.

            Over   the past decade, the "3.ndex function   framework" has been used

extensively   to analyze many problems in the area of consumer choice, includ-
ing the analysis of quantal (i.e., discrete) choice (McFadden, 1974, 1976
and Domencich and McFadden, 1976). This framework also forms the basis
for recent work dealing with problems arising from the use of nonrandom
samples and sample selection biases. A general discussion of index functions
and their relationship to simultaneous equation models which incorporate
                                       —2—




both continuous and discrete variables appears in Heckman (1978).



           This survey begins with a discussion of the basic statistical

framework found in many recent labor supply studies. In Section It we

interpret Recican's (1974a) model of joint labor supply, participation, and

wage rates within this framework. Section III considers extensions of this

model to incorporate fixed costs associated with labor supply, and it inter-

prets the studies of Cogan (1976, 1979), Hanoch (1976, 1979), and Hausman

(1979). Section IV develops a basic model for analyzing progressive tax

schemes and labor supply. In Section V we generalize this model to allow
for   regressive as well as progressive taxes along the lines proposed by
Sunless    and   Ilausman (1978), Hausinan (1979), and Wales and Woodland (1979).
Discussion of specific methods of estimation is deferred to an appendix.

                                       I.   The   Basic   Index Model


       The prototype for all of the models                  considered   in this    paper    is   a simple
binary    choice 'model. Let V(1) (K1,, '4                be the best attainable utility for a
consumar      who does not work.               is unearned income and v is          an unobserved

"taste"      component. Let V(2) (K2, W, v) be his best attainable utility given
that he      works.      His net wage is W and K2          is   his unearned income        measured   net
of money costs          of   work (and other money         transactions costs).             may differ
from R. due to the presence of work—related fixed costs. The net wage is
irrelevant in evaluating the utility of the no work state.
       If V(2)      '   V(1))
                                 the consumer works. Otherwise, he does not. Write

                             then if
Ti     V(2) —    V(1)

(1)
               T1       V(2) — V'(1) > 0



the   consumer works. This condition, and closely related conditions, underlie

much recent work in labor supply.
         -

               If    the consier works, one may             define an    hours of work equation for

the consumer. If equilibrium hours of work are                       determined by equating
marginal benefits of             work with marginal        cost3,   one may   use   Roy   's identity
to derive the equation governing hours of work as




                Mt       3V(2)   /V(2)
                                 /
                                     3K2


               The      hours of work equation may be written as
                                            —4—


                             W, v).

In the ensuing analysis, we use           this notation           for the hours of work equation

even when the conditions required           for   the application of Roy's theorem no

longer apply.

        Condition (1) Is a prototype of a class of sample selection conditions

that has received considerable attention in the recent econometric literature.

In order to focus         on the essential statistical issues involved, consider two
linear functions

tional mean of            depends on      and,   In   particular, on the probability that

        Write the joint density of c, £2 as f(c1, c2k) where 6 is a vector of

parameters that generate the density. The probability that                            >   0 is simply

The estimated value of             differs from the true value 'by the second term on

the right—hand side.

       The essential point is that as we change Z2. we alter the effective

composition of the sample of workers. Computed partial derivatives with

respect to         combine the cetaris paribus effect of changing Z2. holding

tastes fixed with the effect of changes in Z2. on altering the ple

distribution of tastes for work. The sample distribution of tastes for work

is the distribution of c conditional on condition (1) being met. This final

effect    is a consequence of entry and exit of observations from the sample due
to the fact that condition (1) must be satisfied.
       Condition (I) encompasses                 two distinct   ideas which are sometimes

confused in the     literature. The first idea is that of self—selection. An
individual chooseè either to work or not to work. From an initial random

sample of consumers,       a sample of workers is not random in view of condition
(1).     The second idea is a more general concept——that of sample selection—

which includes the first idea as a special case. From an "ideal" random

sample, some rule is used to generate an observed sample of individuals

These rules may     or   may not be the consequences of choices made

by the consumers being studied. For example, in the negative income tax

experiments,      decisions were made to "experiment" on low       income populations.

The effect of this restriction is that a decision rule             generates   the observed

samples of workers and       nonworkers.    Since earnings are generated, in part, by

tastes for work, these restrictions on sample membership operate on labor
                                            —7—




supply estimates based on selected samples in much the same way as condition

(1). Econometric solutions to the general sample selection bias problem and

the self—selection bias problem are identical. Much of the modern work on

female labor supply and the analysis of experimental data, to be discussed

below, is designed to eliminate the effects of sample selection bias on

estimated structural labor supply functions.

     The index function model given by equationè (2) — (5) underlies all of

the recent work on truncation and sample selection. For example, Cain and

Watts (1973, p. 343) and Hausman and Wise (1977) consider a censoring problem

that arises in analyzing data from the Negative Income Tax          experiments.
Labor   supply functions are fit for experimental participants. However, to
be an experimental participant, earnings, K, are required to be below a
certain cutoff level E.       We    thus observe individuals in the experiment only
if K C 1. In terms of the index function models, we may write


            TI I - K.
Write labor supply as Y2           Z2B2 +           We   observe   only if T
Since it   is   plausible that the disturbances of the earnings function are not
distributed     independently of the disturbances of the hours of work function,

the analysis of equations (2)—(5) applies with full force to this case.

        The index function model can readily be generalized to encompass a

multiplicity of sample       generation     rules and a multiplicity of behavioral

functions.         and
                         Y2 may
                                be vectors, and the simultaneous satisfaction of
a set oE sample generation rules can be characterized by the requirement that

   lies in some subset of the feasible range of Ti,.
                                            —8—




       A.   version of the index model that will occupy our attention below is

one in which individuals may be in any one of m states of the world where

the value of the random variable                determines the state. tn particular,

a consumer is in state i if T lies in a set 0 which is some prespecified

subset of the sample space of               The labor supply of a consumer occupying

state i is determined by a function y2              H(i) (Rip W., v). Thus, the function

relevant for determining a consumer's hours of work is state dependent in

the sense that its form and/or its arguments differ across the various states.

In the simple binary index model given by equations              (1)   —   (3),    there are two

states of the world (i.e., m —        2),   and the sample space of               is divided into two sets:

       {Y1 :Y1 c O} and. 02 s
                                      :YL
                                            >   01. When in state 1 (i.e., ? e
                                                                                          °I'
consumer's hours of work is given by Y2 a                 = 0; and when in state 2 (i.e.,
                                                     H1

   6 2' Y2 H2 a               + £2.
       All of the statistical models of labor supply to be considered below are

special cases of this simple index function model. in the Heckian (1974a)

model, there is a "work" and a "no work" state.                  is the difference between

the market wage and the reservation wage at zero hours of work, if                         >   0,
the consumer works. Given that he works, labor supply is defined as

              where y is a substitution parameter. The Cogan (1979) model of

fixed costs is alsQ a two—state model.                here is the difference between

hours of work if the consumer is constrained to work and incur fixed costs,

on the one hand, and "reservation hours" of work, on the other hand. If

   >   0, the consumer chooses to work, and               is the hours of work chosen by

the consumer. In the analysis of labor supply under progressive taxes

where the budget constraint is composed of linear segments (due to discrete

jumps in the     marginal tax rate),   each segment and kink corresponds to a

different     state   of the world. Thus, in
                                      —9—




contrast to the Heckman and Cogan models, there is more than one state

associated with "work."         is the marginal rate of substitution function,

and as it takes values in various intervals, the consumer's labor supply

equilibrium occurs on different branches of the budget constraint. While

the hours of work function has the sane f on for each of the work. states,

the arguments of the function are appropriately modified to reflect the

different tax parameters facing consumers on the different branches and

kinks of their budget constraints. The Burtless and Hausman (1978) modeL

of labor supply and taxes is general enough to deal with both regressive

and progressive taxes. Their basic framework is the same as the one for

the progressive tax case previously mentioned, except        in their model is

an unobserved random "taste" component of the preference function4 As Y1

fails   in various regions, equilibrium occurs on different segments of the
budget constraint. The index function models can accomodate a wide variety
of errors in the variables, including errors that arise from the inability
to   observe directly   the particular state of the world a consumer occupies.

     II. The Elementary Model of Labor Supply without Fixed Costs and Taxes


           Consider a simple model of labor supply that neglects fixed costs of

work and taxes. A consumer faces parametric wage                        Let K be a Hicks

composite       co=odity of goods and           L a Hicks composite coodity of nonmarket

time. The consumer's strictly quasiconcave preference function                       may   be written
as U(X, L, v) where v is a "taste shifter." For the population                       of consumers,

the       density   of   v is written as f(v). This function induces a distribution on
U.    The maximum amount of leisure is T. Income in the absence of work is It.

          A consumer works only if        his   best work alternative is better than his

best nonwork. alternative (i.e., full leisure).                  In the elementary     model, a global

comparison between the best attainable utilities in the work and no work

states can be reduced to a local comparison between the marginal value of

leisure at the no work position (the slope of the consumer's highest attainable

indifference curve at zero hours of work) and the wage rate.

          The marginal rate of substitution is defined as


                                               T—H, v)
(5)            frUIt H v)a
                                               T—R, v)
                                   U1(R+WI{,


where H is hours of work and X a R+WH.                   The reservation wage is frUIt, 0, v).

The consumer works if



(7    )         M(R, 0,    )   <




otherwise,          he does not. If condition (1) is satisfied, the labor supply

function is determined by solving the equation M(R, H, .i)                    14   for El to obtain

()             U   a U(R, W, v).



       There are three distinct concepts of labor supply or expected hours of

work that are often confused in the literature. Consider a population of

consumers who all face offer wage W and receive unearned income B. but who

have   different      v's. The density f(v) determines the distribution of 11tastes

for work" over the population. One measure of labor supply is the fraction

of   the population       that works. Letting 0 denote the set of v such that

M(R,   0, v)       C W, this fraction is




(9 )           P(W, B.) a f    f('v)dv       — Prob(M(R, 0, v) c w)




where      denotes integrating over the set S. The mean hours worked for those

employed is

       There is also some confusion in the literature concerning the appropriate
interpretation of the partial derivatives of these different measures of
labor   supply. The    partial. derivatives of the hours of work function given by
(8),   H. and U, produce the textbook uncompensated wage and income effects.

It is crucial to note that these derivatives of P(W, B.) with respect to

Wand B. do not correspond to            and
                                              R   (Lewis, 1967; Ben   Porath,   1973).

must   be   positive, and
                            R. need   not be. The partial derivatives of (10) or (11)

with   respect to 14' and B.   do not correspond to the Hicks—Slutsky terms

or      unless condition (7) is satisfied for everyone in the population. These
simple points have be&z ignored in much of the literature. For example, Hall
(1973) and Boskin (1973)       interpret the partial derivatives of estimates of

equation     (11) with respect to W and R as estimates of and H respectively.
Others interpret partial derivatives of (10) (estimated from labor supply
functions fit on samples of working individuals) as estimates of the Hicks—
Slutsky parameters. If nonparticipation is a significant phenomenon in the
population being sampled, estimates of (10) or (11) do not generate meaningful
structural labor supply parameters.2

       The model of Heckman (1974a) can be written within the index function
framework.     Write the marginal rate of substitution function given by (6 )

in   sezilog form as

                   III. Labor Supply Models siith Fixed Costs

       Cogan (1976, 1979) and    Hanoch    (1976, 1979) extend   the   simple model of
the previous section by allowing for a nonconvex choice set arising from
fixed costs of work such as co=uting costs,     expenditures on clothes needed
for   work, etc.     The   motivation for introducing fixed      costs   is to account
Lor   the small number of observations near zero in the hours of work distri-

butions coputed for     workers.        Our      exposition follows more closely the

work of Cogan..

       Consider Figure 1. A consumer's no work indifference curve is given by

HA. For the simple model described above, if the wage rate is given by the

slope of RC, the consumer works, and a standard interior solution labor supply

function is generated. If the wage rate is given by the slope of line RB,

the consumer does not work. The introduction of fixed money costs of work

means that the consumer must pay fixed money cost F in order to work. The

breakaven wage, which      causes the
consumer   to be indifferent between work (with the fixed cost) and no work,

is given by the slope of the line connecting points R—F and 0. If the consumer

is given a wage with this slope, and works Hd hours, he is indifferent between

work and nonwork. At any higher wage rate, he will work. As money costs are

thcreasad, so are reservation wage rates and the minisun number of hours that

the consumer works if he works at all. The relevant reservation wage for labor

supply is the slope of indifference curve RA at position D.
      The labor supply curve thus has a discontinuity. The consumer either

does not work at all or works at least Ed hours. "Ed" is called "reservation

hours" in the literature. The slope of the no work indifference curve at Rd

hours,       is termed the reservation wage. The labor supply function for

those who work is essentially a standard labor supply curve with unearned

income a reduced by amount F, the fixed money costs of work.

                                      Figure 2.



     The analysis of fixed time costs of work parallels our discussion of

fixed money costs of work except that time costs reduce hours worked by

working individuals while money costs increase hours worked by working

individuals (assuming leisure is a normal good). No new idea is involved.

     The most direct way to salve for         and Ha is to use the indirect

utility function.         is defined as that value of 14 such that




          v(a—F, W, 'v)     tJ(R, T, v)



i.e., that value of 14d such that given the fixed costs of work, F, the

conster is indifferent between working at wage Wd and not working at all.

This is the procedure used by Cogan (1979).

     From equation (16) one can solve for         and by Roy's Identity one

can solve for
                                               —17—




                        = vw
                  Ha



Thus       one can      write




                  Rd        Ha(R F) v)

       -
                            Wd(R, F, v)

                   if       H(R—F, W,v).-




Since the Rd Wa. and H functions are derived from a common utility function,

cross—equation              restrictions connect these three functions. Without assuming
explicit functional forms for the utility function it is difficult to impose
these restrictions. Cogan does not impose a specific functional f on and so
does not exploit all, the available information in the system. Zn practice,
one does not have data on fixed costs. f is assumed to depend on a large
set   of observed variables, some of which do not enter the labor supply          equa-
tion       in their own right.

           The   consumer works provided that


                 H>Rd.

In terms         of the index function model, we may write


                        n H -
                                 Hd

                        —   H.
                                              —18--




Thus we observe Y2 only when              >   0.
           Using standard sample selection bias correction procedures it is possible

 to obtain estimates of the parameters of the H function. Assuming a functional

 form for H and H, writing H —
                                         Ha in reduced form, and assuming that one
variable appears in H that does not appear in Rd (e.g., the wage rate),1 it

 is possible to estimate the Hd function from the reduced form probability

 that the consumer works if the sample at hand contains both workers and nonworkers.

       Thus, if

       All   of the tests for the presence or absence of fixed costs that have been

conducted within the Cogan framework have taken the Heck.n (1974a) specif i—

cation given by equations (13) and (14) as the baseline model of labor supply

without fixed costs. This model assnes a strict proportionality relationship

between the H and the H —
                                  H   equations (i.e., between the      and the        indices).

The simple Heckman specification of the labor supply curve may be drawn as

BB' in Figure 2. The intercept of the function is the log of the reservation
                                                 —19—




        wage.      The key point of Cogans analysis is that with fixed money costs of

        work, the labor supply function looks like CC'Ct. The log reservation wage

        is higher than 3, a working consumer works at least Rd hours, and the labor

        supply     function is above the Heckman function (because leisure is assumed to
        be a normal good). If CC'Ct' is the true labor supply function, and the linear
        Heckman function is fit        to the data, labor supply elasticities will be
        overstated     because the    intercept in the linear Heckman labor supply curve
        is   the   reservation wage. Cogan's test for the presence of fixed costs          amounts

        to   determining whether the curve CC'Ct'       explains   the data significantly better
        than the curve BB';      if it does,   then there are fixed costs associated with
        working.
                                Coga&s test crucially depends on an assumed functional

        form    for   the labor supply equation given by (14). If one permits nonlinearities

        in   the   log wage rate variable in    this equation, then a nonlinear curve like 3D         in

        Figure     2 is also consistent with the proportionality assumption (see Recl=an (1974b)
        for such an     analysis).    For all practical purposes this nonlinearity captures the
        essential features of Cogan's          specification; namely, most consumers work a
        large   number of hours if they     work at all. Fixed costs may make a linear
        model    of labor supply into a nonlinear model, but there are many reasons for

        nonlinearity. tests for proportionality are more appropriately interpreted

        as tests for the presence or absence of nonlinearity in labor supply functions.

        Fixed costs are a source of nonlinearities, but evidence for or against

        nonlinearity is certainly not evidence for or against fixed costs.

                Hausman   (1979) extends Cogan's analysis of fixed costs by utilizing cross—

    -   equation      restrictions   on the H and Ed equations,    and   by utilizing another piece

curve for nonworkers does not depend on fixed costs. Utilizing this informa-

tion, he is able to estimate income and substitution effects of labor supply

using   only participation data. The price of these achievements is the
imposition of stringent functional forms for preferences and assumptions
about the     way unobservablas enter the model.

       The utility of the consumer                 in     the no work position is U(R, T, v).

Using the indirect utility function V(R—F, W, v), Rausman  is able to locate
the   best work alternative. It is possible that the indirect utility function
is   not defined for certain values of                         R, F, 1.1 and v, but for such a case, the
consumer does not     work.

       Rausman's  specification of unobserved heterogeneity v is strong but
leads to     econometrically useful results. Under his assumptions, U, V, and
their   difference,   U — V, are monotonic functions of 'v, a scalar random

variable. Given W, R and an exact function for F (so that fixed costs are
                                        —21—




a function solely of observed variables) 1-Tausman can divide the domain of v

into two regions: a work region and a no work region. The boundary point for

;he region is given by J* which satisfies



          V(R—F, W, *) = U(R, T, v*)



Preferences are defined so that for v >        v the consumer works (i.e.,
V(R—P, W, v) > U(R, T, v)), and for v -C .u* the consumer does not work (i.e.,

V(R—F, W, v) < U(R, 2', v)).

     For each set of parameters (of V and U) and given R, W, and his assumed

function for F, Hausman writes




          Yl = V — U,



where    corresponds to the index function of equation (2 ).          The probability

of participation is simply the probability that          >   0.   Given a distribution

of "tastes,t' f(v), the probability of working is



              f(v)dv =
                         Prob(Y1
                                   >   0).


     A corunon set of parameters generate U and V. Hausman is able to estimate

all of the parameters of the functions, and hence can generate all of the

labor supply parameters, including income and substitution parameters, using

only participation data. He is able to extract as much information as Cogan

using less data because he assumes that the same linear labor supply function

applies to the entire preference map, whereas Cogan uses a linear specification
                                       —22—




only as an    approximation for the labor supply function for workers. However,

given hours of work data,    his   procedure products no more     information than the
Cogan procedure.
      Two key assumptions in hausman's        model   not needed in Cogan's, are

(1) fixed costs components are perfectly predicted by measured variables, and

(2) data on wage rates are available for all individuals in the sample

(including nonworkers). -   If either of these assumptions is violated, a more
involved procedure is required which amounts to solving for u* given the

unobserved components of F and of W and integrating over both these unobserved

components.    While it   is conceivable that Rausman's   first   assumption concerning

theperfect measurability of F is true, his second requirement concerning the
availability of data on offer wages for nonworkers is surely violated for
most data sets. We dater discussion of the consequences of not being able
to observe wages for some individuals until Section V, where we develop a

                   IV. Labor Spp_1y Models with Progressive Taxes


     In this section we extend the simple model of hours of work without

fixed costs outlined in Section II to incorporate progressive taxes. In

contrast to the models of labor supply discussed above where there are two

possible states of the world (Le., work or no work), here we consider a

multistate model. Although this extended model cannot be readily applied

to the regressive tax case, it provides the essential ingredients required

to analyze the general. case.

     Provided that the tax function facing the consumer generates a

continuously differentiable strictly convex constraint set, the introduction

of taxes into the model poses few analytical difficulties.1 Define after—tax

income as



            K — K(WH +        a; p), V      >   0, K"   C   0,


where r    is   a vector of parameters of the tax function (including exemption

parameters and the Like). The marginal, wage rate at zero hours of work is




                        a   E'(R;   4).
                 JHaO



Replacing K'(R; *)          for   SI in condition (7 ),     the   analysis of labor force

participation is the same as that given before. If the modified participation

condition is met, one can linearize the budget constraint around the

equilibrium hours of work position and solve for the structural labor supply

equation   in terms of the equilibrium marginal              wage K' (WU +   R; ip) and   the
                                               —24—




intercept of the     linearized        budget constraint at the zero hours of work

position, E(WH     + R; *) — V (WE!       + B.; qt)H.    The marginal   wage replaces the
gross wage in equation (8 ),            and   the   intercept   ten replaces R in the
equation.
        We may write the structural labor supply equation as


             H—   H(E',   E—    Vii,   ij).




tf labor supply is measured with error, or there are disturbances in the

labor   supply equation, one must instrument the marginal wage and intercept
tens of the linearized budget constraint to achieve consistent estimates.2'3
This analysis tarries over fully to estimation of labor supply functions
in the presence of an equilibrium wage—hours locus (or hedonic line) of the
sort considered by Lewis (1969) and Rosen (1974) provided that the constraint
set   facing the consumer is continuous and convex.4
        The institutional      features of the U.S. tax system are such that the

assumption of smooth, continuously differentiable constraint sets for after—

tax    income is counterfactual. The U.S. tax             system induces kinks and flats
in    the post—tn income function. A progressive tax system generates a convex

budget set with linear segments and kinks such as the one depicted in Figure 3.

To    simplify the exposition, we consider only a two—flat function. The
ensuing    analysis may   easily   be extended to        a multiple kink constraint. Given
initial income (after tax) of           a2,
                                              and   a gross wage rate W,   after—tax income

in the presence of a kinked tax schedule may               be   characterized by a marginal

tax rate of tA on the first segment, (0, H), and a higher marginal tax rate

      on the second segment, (H, T).

          A consumer may occupy any one of four states of the world in this model

of taxes. Each state corresponds to a different kink or segment of the

budget constraint. A consumer who does not work is at kink point a2 which

constitutes state 1. A consumer who chooses to work, on the other hand, may

be on segment R2Z, or at kink point 1, or on segment ZN, which constitute

states 2, 3, and 4, respectively. A consumer in state 2 faces a net marginal

wage rate equal. to              E W(].   —   5) and   receives unearned income R. A consumer

          As a consequence of convexity of preferences and the constraint set, a
local comparison of the marginal rate of substitution function given by (6 )
and the      after—tax wage rate at the kink points determines the location of an
individual on the budget set. The consumer chooses not to work if

Finally,     the consumer is at an interior solution in the interval (H, T) if

       It   is straightforward to derive the implied labor supply function

associated        with each state of the world. To simplify the following exposition
denote this         function by (U          for    state i. In state 1,           the no work state,

obviously R(1)             0. At    interior       equilibrium on branch R1Z, the labor supply

function         is determined by solving the equation M(R2. 11(2)1 v)                        E 14(1.

for H(2); so, in state 2 hours of work is given by

In state 3, the corner equilibrium at Z, 11(3)                              H. Finally, in state

While the functional for       of   the labor supply functions             in   states 2 and 4
is the same, the arguments of these functions differ as a consequence of the
different tax rates facing consumers on the different branches of the budget
constraint.
       To set up this model as an index function model, the "taste shifter"
component,. v, is a natural candidate for the index                      to determine which

state of the world the consumer occupies. For given values of a1, W, H,

and t.3, the consumer chooses one of the four possible states depending on the

region in which v lies. The conditions relating M(R2, 0, v) and M(R4, H, '4

to after—tax wage rates listed above define these regions. Let
2' 83 and 8 denote the subsets of the sample space of 'v that satisfy
conditions (l7)—(20),      respectively.       If v &         (i.e., v is an element of
the set          the consumer chooses state i.
       If we   assume that the   marginal rate of substitution function, M(R, H, v),
is   monotonicaJ.ly increasing in v, we obtain simple expressions for these sets.

Each      is a single interval in the real line. Define 4,                      '4, and      as

those values of v satisfying




           ER2, 0,             W2! W(1 — tA)

Convexity of preferences implies that t4(R4, i,              v)    '   bf(R2, 0, '4.

           Estimation of structural labor supply parameters involves the same set

of issues considered in the simple Eeckman model                      except that instead of the
single corner and single interior solution segments as in the Heckman model,
there are two corners and two interior segments in                         the   model with kinked
progressive taxes               considered   here. In order to       avoid       sample selection bias
                                             —29—




in     estimating structural labor supply functions, one must                account     for the

conditioning that generates the observations (i.e., one must                    account    for the

particular       branch or corner on which an observation              is situated).     It is
obvious that, in                      for potential sample selection 'bias
                       this case, correcting

automatically corrects for the endogeneity in tax rates and unearned income
levels.        Indeed, in this model, endogeneity of taxes and              sample   selection

bias come to the same thing.

           To illustrate the procedure involved, consider the following empirical

specification. Write }f(R, H, v) as



(27)            M(R, H, v) -m0+m1R+m2H+v.


Since       ti is monoton.ically increasing      in 'i',    the   formulas for 4,   v,   and

given       by (23) provide a simple method for dividing the sample space of 'v into

        An
         important assumption of this version of the model is that one can
directly observe the state of the world each consumer occupies. Knowledge
of   a consumer's hours      of work is all the information required. If H = 0,
the consumer is        instate ].; i.fflc (0, fi), beis instate 2; ifHff, he is           instate
3; and if H e (H, T), the consumer occupies state 1•                By choosing a density function

f(V),    it   is possible to estimate directly the structural parameters deter—

mining the probabilities of each state of the world given by (29) —              (32).
        If we choose f(v) as the normal density, this statistical model is an

ordered probit scheme (see Johnson (l72) and Rossett—Nelson (1975)). Forming

the sample likelihood, one can estimate all. the parameters of the marginal
                                         —31—




rate of substitution function, and the variance of v. (The variance of v,

a2, is estimated by normalizing by the standard deviation within each

probability statement, and noting that the coefficient on (1 e           t)w   is

1/a.    The parameter    is identified if the kink point in the after—

tax income function comes at different hours of work for different consumers——

which, plausibly, is the case.)

        Since the parameters of the N function generate all of the parameters•

of the labor supply function, the ordered probit analysis suffices to

determine    the parameters of   the labor supply function without usiqg any data

on   hours of work. Given these probabilities, one can compute the conditional
means of the interior solution of the hours of work function for each branch
of   the budget constraint   and, by following a straightforward generalization

of   equation ( 5), achieve more efficient estimates of the labor supply
parameters. However, no new parameter is estimated by this procedure. It
is   straightforward to write down the       likelihood function for the full model
and    so achieve full efficiency in deriving the estimates.

        The labor supply function implied by the linear specification for N

associated   with equilibrium on segment R2Z is

        The empirical spec±fication for hours of work implied by this analysis is


(33)         H    E(H) + e


where    E(R) is given by (37)          and c   is a randomly distributed heteroscedastic

error    term with man zero. This regression equation is estimated                         using a

random    sample of consumers; nonworkers are assigned H — 0.
                                         —33—




       One does not necessarily require complicated nonlinear methods to

estimate the parameters of (37). Assuming that u is normally distributed,

it   is   possible to estimate each of the F(u) functions by ordered probit analysis.

Then one can form the product of the estimated F(u) and the wage, tax, and income
variables. Following a straightforward modification of the procedure of
Heckman (1979), one can estimate A2       and A, up to a factor   of proportionality.
Then regression of H on these variables will yield estimates of C0,
                                                                    C1, C2,
and the factors of proportionality on A2 and A4 (b2 and b4).5

          There   is a crucial implicit assumption in the preceding estimation
procedures:        hours of work are not measured with error, so measured hours

reflect true or desired hours. If this is not so, data on hours of work do

not suffice to allocate individuals to the correct branch of the budget

constraint. The state of the world a consumer occupies can no longer be

directly observed, and we confront a discrete data version of an errors in

variables problem. If we use data on H to assign individuals to various

states of the world, the ordered probit estimates the wrong flu) functions.

Suppose that true hours of work, U, and measured hours, which we denote by

       are related by the ecuation H*      H + e where e is a disturbance repre-

senting measurement error which is distributed independently of H and all

the explanatory variables. Then the probability that one observes H in

agiven interval is not the same as the probability that H falls in that
interval.6 For example, the probability that H H is positive, but the
probability        that H*   H is zero assuming e follows a continuous density

function. Since we estimate the wrong F(u) functions (by using ordered probit

analysis) when assigning consumers to various states on the basis of their

fl*, the variables formed by multiplying estimated F(u) functIons with W,
                                        —34—




t3,    R2, R4, Fl, and 1. in equation (37) are measured   with   error which produces

inconsistent parameter estimates.

        This    measurement error problem only affects the proposed two—stage
estimation technique. It does not lead to any serious complications in the
above theory and empirical. specifications. The expression for S('E given
by (37) is unchanged. Nowhere in its derivation do we require states of
the worl,d to be correctly observed. The equation for 11* can always be
written as


(3g)           C — H)    +



where       = c + a.

        This   observation iediately suggests    how to avoid the errors in
variables problem discussed above in the two—stage procedure based on ordered
probit analysis. Instead of using a two—stage procedure of the sort proposed
above to estimate the hours of work function (by first predicting the P() terms
in equation (37) and forming variables using F(',) for the second stage regression),
one should estimate equation (37) directly by nonlinear least squares,
exploiting all of the restrictions of the model, to generate parameter
estimates.       The v, \4, v terms contaln parameters of the marginal rate
of    substitution function which are intimately linked with the parameters of

the labor supply equation (see equation (Zs)).7        As   we will see in the next
section,       this principle is the technique used by Burtless—Hausman in their

analysis of labor supply and taxes.

        Allowing    for measurement error in hours of work causes no
essential change       in the general fornui.as describing labor

supply presented above. As previously noted, the formulas for            the   probabilities
of occupying each state are exactly the same. The formula for the uncondi-
tional expected value of measured hours of work is the sane as for true
hours       given by (37) except that       replaces H. Expected values in this

instance       are computed by integrating H(s) over the set       and   the sample

space       of the measurement error component of hours using the joint density
of u and the measurement error component.
•          Two important assumptions maintained in this section are that data on
    potential wage rates are available for all individuals including nonworkers
    and    that wage rates are exogenous variables. Relaxing these assumptions does
    not introduce cnaj or complications in     the previous analysis.

           Suppose that true market wage rates are generated by the function


(40)            W—W(Q, n)


where Q       includes   a consumer's measured characteristics, and n is an error

term representing the contribution of unmeasured characteristics. Conditions

(l7)—(ZO) still determine the state of the world a consumer occupies.

Replacing W by W(Q, ri), we see that, these conditions divide the sample space

of (,        ii) into   subsets associated with each state of the world; they define

the sets          such that Cv, n) S G implies the consumer is in state i. and

the probability of such an event is



    (41)      Prob ((v, n) e s) a ff®     k(v, 'rDdvdri


where k(v, n) is the joint density of v and r, and integration is carried

out over the set G.
                                        —36—




       The labor supply functions associated with each state are unchanged

except that W(Q, ) replaces ti in constructing the arguments of the

functions for states 2 and 4 given by (21) and (22). The expression for

expected hours of work given by (26) becomes

        to   illustrate the problems that arise when one introduces a wage

function,      consider combining a wage function of the form


(44)          W=30+B1Q+n

with    the linear specification of the marginal rate of substitution function

used above to develop the empirical model of labor supply given by (37) and

(38). Even if we assume       that   v and n follow a joint normal distribution,

an ordered probit analysis which allocates individuals to different states of

the world no longer applies. While the conditions defining states given by

(l7)—(2a) imply restrictions on linear combinations of v and n,                it is not
possible to construct a single linear combination of v and r whose value

completely determines which state a consumer occupies.

        In particular, define W as E(W) (i.e.,        a B0 +
                                                                B1Q), and R4     E(R4).

Replacing         ti with W and K4 with 14 in equations (28), we see that

    (i.e., ui,          and $3) determine occupancy of a state. Also, occupancy of

either state 2 or 3 requires the simultaneous satisfaction of two conditions.

Thus, while univariate probit analysis can be used to predict the probability

of state 1 or 4, bivariate probit analysis is needed to specify the probability

of state 2 or 3.

linear wage function is straightforward using the notation of the previous

paragraph. The labor supply functions for state 2 and for state 4 given by

The labor supply functions associated with states 1 and 3 are
unchanged. Given these new expressions for expected hours and the proba-
bilities of occupying each state, one can easily modify expression (37) for
the unconditional expected value of hours of work by making the appropriate
substitutions.
      Substituting thisnew expression for E(E) into the regression equation
given by (38) creates an estimating equation for labor supply which allows
wages to be endogenous and which does not require that wage offer .data be
available for all observations. This new specification can be estimated
using the nonlinear least—squares procedure described above. To identify
all the parameters, one nst also estimate the wage equation using data on
workers, adjusting for sample selection bias. This is accomplished by
regressing W    on E(Wlconsuzaer   works)   —      + B1Q + E(nIw   >   a*) where E(nlw   >


can   be   computed using   techniques   proposed by Kecletnan (1979).. It is also

possible to estimate hours and wage equations           jointly.

       It is significant to note that       ri   here represents the contribution of
unobserved variables affecting true wages; it does not include a measure-
ment error component for wages. Allowing for measurenent errors in wages
requires exactly the sae type of adju.stment in the formulas for probabili-
ties and expected values as is required in treating measurement errors in
hours. The formuThc for probabilities and expected values given by (41),
-(42), and (43)    remain   valid when easurement error in wages is present,
 except that expected values are now computed by integrating E(i) times the

joint density function of v, i'j, and the measurement error components over

               V. A General Treatment of Taxes and Labor Supply



     This section formulates a model of hours of work that allows for

regressive as well as progressive taxes. Here we develop a methodology to

handle cases where local marginal. comparisons do not fully characterize

labor supply behavior following suggestions by Burtless and Hausman (1978),

Bausman (1979), and Wales and Woodland (1979).



     A regressive tax scheme leads to a budget set that is not convex.

Figure 4 displays the case we consider here? A marginal tax rate of CA

applies to the branch R2S, and a lower marginal rate C3               applies   to the

branch SN.

       The analysis of kinked—nonconvex budget constraints involves an idea
already    considered. in the analysis of fixed costs: a local comparison

between the reservation wage and the market                         wage does not adequately char-
acterize the work—no work decision. Due                     to      the   nonconvexity         of constraints,
existence     of   an interior   solution          on a branch       does    not lnply         that   equilibtium
will    occur   on the branch. Thus           in    Figure 4,        point B assoicated          with indiff-

clearly    not   the   global optimum. Since local comparisons of the marginal
rates   of substitution function and                after—tax wage          rates cannot be used to
determine the state of the          world         a consumer occupies, some features of the
model developed in the previous section no longer apply.
       An alternative strategy for deter'-nit'g the portion of the budget
constraint on which a consumer decides to locate is the following. Write
the   direct    preference function as             U(X,   L, Za,      v) where       the exogenous variable
Z represents       the measured characteristics of a consumer, a                          is   an   unknown

vector   of   parameters,     and   v   represents the unmeasured characteristics of a
consumer that       affect preferences.             Using well—known methods, one may form
the   indirect     preference function V(R, W, Zn. ,                 'i). For       interior solutions,

labor    supply functions may be written as

While the arguments of the functions TJ(•), V(-), and E(•) may differ across
consumers, the functional forms are assumed to be the same for each cons timer.
        If a consumer is at an interior equilibrium on either segment R2S or
SN, then the equilibrium is defined by a tangency of the indifference curve
and the budget constraint. Since this. tangency indicates a paint of maximum
attainable utility, the indifference curve at this point represents a level
of utility given by V(Ri W, Za, v) where R and                               are respectively the after—
tax unearned income         and wage         rate aEsociated with segment i             Thus, hours
of work at such a point must be given by V/V evaluated at                                and W. br
this point to be an admissible solution, the implied hours of work must lie
between       the two endpoints of the interval                  (i.e.,   equilibrium   must occur on
the    budget segment). A consumer chooses                      not to work if   utility at kink a2,

         t,    Ia, v), is greater than both V(R2, W2, Za, v) and                    ICR3, Si3, Za,    v),

whose   (i,,   ru)    6                      chooses    to occupy state i. Given these new

definitions          of 5,, the formulas for probabilities of occupying various
states given by (41), and the formulas for expected values of                     labor supply

given by (42) and (43) all apply without modification. If an errors in the

variables problem exists for hours of work and wages, these formulas still

apply except in computing the appropriate expected                    values it   is also necessary to

include integration              over the measurement       error components of hours and wages.
       Burtless        and Rausman       (1978),   Eiaustnan (1979), and Wales and Woodland
(1979) in their work on labor supply and taxes each use a variant of the
                                              —45—




general   framework described above. All of these studies assume that hours

of work. are maasured with error, and none of thent treat wages as endogencus

or measured   with   error.3

       urtless   and Bausman assume a specific utility function that is monotonic in
the unobserved component v, and           for   which ail consumers   are   guaranteed   to   work.
In   terms of the   above model,    a consumer occupies either state 2 or state 3 (I.e.,

the probability of occupying state 1 is zero). For their preference function,

there exists a critical value v such that at that value, given the wage rate,

tax rate, and intercept income components, the consumer is in equilibrium on

both branches. Working with the indirect utility function, V, v' is defined

such that



(52)        V(2) — V(R2, W2, Zcs, v*) — V(R3, W3, ict,




and for their special functional form a unique solution for .?                 is   guaranteed

to   exist. For values of v less than v the consumer is in equilibrium on
branch one. Por values of v greater than t, the consumer is on branch two.
Thus, t defines the sets and $37 and in this instance these sets are
intervals of the real line.
     Given their functional form for 7, hours of work equations are defined
by Roy's identity (see equation (45)). In the Burtiess and Hausman

world   of two working states, the formula for expected labor supply given by

(26) may   be written as


                         *
            S(H) a                        +

      Burtless and Hausman estimate the parameters of their model using
maxim likelihood procedures. AJ.lowing for measurement error in hours of
work, they assum     that   this measurement error and v are independently
distributed normal random variables. Their procedure, however, may       be

interpreted as employing the nonlinear least squares method described in
the previous section. In particular, letting H denote measured hours of
work, the criterion



                 —




is   minimized with respect to the parameters of f(v) and the parameters of

the utility function (which, of course, are also parameters of the labor

supply function). Notice that the value of v changes with values of wages,

taxes, unearned income, a consumer's measured characteristics, and the

parameters of the preference function. Thus         must be updated in any

computational   algorithm that determines the parameters of the model.
Assuming normally    distributed optimization error, this criterion is also a
maximum likelihood criterion.
      Hausman (1979) extends this procedure to allow for corner equilibrium

at zero hours of work. Since we have already discussed the essential

features of Hausman's model in Section III on fixed costs, we will not

repeat that discussion here. As      noted in that section, there is a serious
problem with    Hausman's analysis concerning his treaent of unobserved wages.

To deal with the problem of missing wage rates for nonworicers, Hausman introduces

a wage function of the sort considered above. He fails, however, to account

properly for the presence of unobserved components of wages when constructing
                                               -.47—




    the   sets       which   define   states of the world (see formulas (51)).

    Hausuianestimates parameters of a wage equation corrected for censoring,
    and then treats the predicted values from this equation as if they were the
    true values of wages. This procedure is equivalent to assuming that the
    unobserved       components of wages denoted above by ri (see equation (44)) are

    identically equal to zero for all individuals in the           sample. Thus, he

    defines    the      sets only over the sample space of v, the random component
    reflecting differences in consumer's "tastes." This leads to improper
    definitions of these sets if there are any unobserved random components
    determtntng      wage rates, and    this is true even if v and   ii   are independently
    distributed.       The result is inconsistent estimates of the parameters of the

    preference     and the labor supply functions.
          The analyses of Burtless-Hausman and ifausman depend crucially on
    particui.ar functiona.l forms for preferences. 'or a general specification
    of preferences, and unobserved components, the indirect utility function, V,
    need not be monotonic in v, More crucially, we are not guaranteed that a v'
    satisfying equation (52) exists, or 11 one does exist, that it is unique;
    in this case the sample space of v cannot be simply partitioned into regions
    associated with equilibrium along different branches.
          In   contrast to the above studies, Wales and Woodland (1979) do          not allow
    f or unmeasured random differences in consumer1s "tastes." tn particular, the
    distributton of 'i is assumed to be degenerate at a single point. Thjs implies
    that the direct and the indirect preference functions and the labor supply
    function     no longer depend on v;     they reduce to tJ(X, I., Za), V(R, W, Zc4 and
    H(R, W, Za). Thus, preferences and          labor   supply behavior differ across

-
    consumers only to the extent that there are differences in measured charac-

    teristics.

       In    terms of the general framework described above, the Wales—Woodland

model can be interpreted as one in which the probability of occupying one

of the states is one and is zero for all other states. In fact, once a

consumer's     measured characteristics,            wage rate, and unearned income are

known,   there   is no uncertainty regarding his exact                 location   on the budget

constraint.      Since the         variables R, W,       and Zn   exactly determine a consumer's
state of the     world,       the expression for the        unconditional    expectation for

hours of work given by (37) becomes



                                      if   CR, W, Zn)        imply state 1
                           H(1)
(53)          E(H)
                           11(2)
                                      if   CR,    W, Zn)     imply state 2

                           E(3)
                                      if   (B.,   W, Zn)     imply state 3.


Each H(i) then,          is   a nonstochastic function of B., W, and Zn that is valid

for only certain combinations of these                   variables. For other combinations,
ECU) shifts to a different R() function associated with the state implied

by the new combinations of observed variables.

       The   Wales—Woodland estimation            procedure is to      choose the parameters of
the preference function to minimize


                     -   ECU))2



where the suation             is over consumers and               is measured hours of   work

(which   need not be the same as true hours of                work,   10.   By   searching over
potential values of the parameters of the preference function, one chooses
the set of values that minimizes the above least squares criterion. In
                                       —49—




computing the value of this   criterion   (for a given set of parameter values),

the following procedure is used to choose the labor supply function (i.e.,

E(E)) relevant for each consumer.

     Given the functional form for preferences, the exogenous variables of

the model (i.e., a consumer's measured characteristics), and values for the

parameters of the preference function, one can compute the utility of the

consumer at each point of the budget constraint—in particular, along each

branch and at each kink point (including the no—work point R2). By checking

utility on each branch and verifying the existence of an interior solution,

and by checking utility at each kink, one can literally solve the consumer's

ma.mization problem by choosing that labor supply function associated with

the highest utility. For each set of values for the parameters of the

utility   function, it is possible to calculate the unique equilibrium
position, either interior or corner, for each consumer. As the parameter
values change, the computed equilibrium hours of work changes.
    When taxes are progressive (the only case Wales—Woodland consider),
this procedure boils down to the following algorithm. For each value of a,
one can compute the hours of work implied for each branch using the labor
supply function associated with that branch implied by Roy's Identity.
Thus, for the first branch (i.e., state 2) hours of work are given by
If the predicted H(2) ties in the interval (0, HI, the consumer's equilibrium
position is assumed to lie along the first branch and ECU) is set equal to


     Suppose that for the particular value of a under consideration, fl(2) lies
outside   the interval (0, Th, then   the equilibrium position is not on the
first branch; so, one checks the   second branch. For the same a, one can
                                      —50—




compute the implied hours of work for this branch,              If the 11(3) lies

in the ixitervaJ. (H, TI, the consumer is assumed to be in equilibrium at art

interior point on the second branch, and ER)       U(3)• Otherwise he is not.

The same procedure can be used for    a problem with more than    two

branches. From convedty of preferences and constraints, for each a,

equilibrium can occur on only one branch at most.

     Suppose that we never predict an H that lies itt    the   correct interval,,

This can happen if there is a corner equilibrium. Each corner should then be

checked including the no—work corner. Evaluate U at each corner. Pick the

corner with the highest utility. This is the equilibrium value, and E(H) is

set equal to that labor supply function associated with the kink. This

procedure is guaranteed to locate the consumer's optimum for each value of a.

     This procedure is i=cdest in that it     assumes that   given a, the

econometrician   can   solve the consumer's problem as well as the consumer can.

There is no information the consumer has that is relevant to selecting his desired
hours of work that the econometrician does not know as well. There are no
omitted variables in the model. Moreover, the model assumes that all

consumers have the same a.

     These are strong assumptions. If there are such omitted variables, or

if a differs across consumers, the Wales—Woodland procedure generates

inconsistent parameter estimates because their procedure can allocate

consumers to the wrong branch of the budget constraint. Surprisingly, less

restrictive assumptions that allow for random differences in unmeasured

traits affecting "tastes" may lead to a simpler estimation scheme, such as

the one proposed by 3urtless and Hausman outlined above.

                              VI.   Conclusion

            The index function framework forms the basis for
much of the recent work on labor supply. The use of this framework provides
a convenient approach for the estimation of hours of work functions when
budget constraints consist of several segments and kink-s. The methodology
presented in the last section is the most general. It not only admits both
convex and non—convex constraint sets, it also allows for the endogenèity
of   wage rates, for the absence of   wage data for some of the sample obser-
vations, and.   for arbitrary forms of easurement   error   in hours of work and

wages.

Wages are observed only if Ii >            0. In      their sam1ing experiments u and e

are assumed to       be mean zero normally distributed             variables with variances

      and      respectively and interequation            correlation of p.
            The following methods are compared:                (a) ordinary   least squares (OLS);
(b)   maximt      likelihood; (c) Amiya's estimator (1973); Cd) nonlinear

least souares; Ce) Hec3an's maximum likelihood estimator (1974); (f) Heckmants

two    step    estimator   (1976, 1979). For a complete and thoroughly competent
discussion of these estimators see Wales and Woodland (1978). Table 1 reports

on estimators based on samoles of S000 individuals. The number of workers is

indicated      by M. The true         parameters    are given in   the first column. Least

scuares     results are shown in the second column to              be badly biased. The maximum
likelihood      estimators (method 1 and method 7) generate estimates quite close to the
                                   —53—




true values. Amemiya's procedure (method 2) and a one round iterate

of Amemiya (method ZA which is one-Newton step toward the likelihood

optimum from the initial consistent Amemiya estimator) is badly

behaved. A nonlinear least squares procedure (method 3) produces

estimates that are badly biased.

        Essentially the same results are found for estimators that use

the entire sample (see Table 2). OLS is badly biased. Maximum likeli-

hood (method 4) generates estimates quite close to the true values.

Two stage methods are less precise in generating parameter estimates.

        Corrections foi selection bias in the wage equation (results
reported in Table 3) suggest that the two stage procedures and the
maximua likelihood procedure do about equally well, but maximum likelihood

is still marginally better.

        It is important to note    that these samples   are generated   under
ideal conditions. It would be very interesting to compare      the performance

of these estimators, which are based on the normality asstnption, in

the situation in which the errors are nonnormal. It seems Likely that

the two stage estimators are more robust because the conditional means

of the errors may still closely approximate the true conditional mean

(i.e., the g    ten in equation (5 )j. Little is known about the

performance of these estimitors in the presence of other model misspeciii-

cations, but by analogy with the findings in the simultaneous equation

literature it is likely that the to stage estimators are more robust

to misspecification than are the maximum likelihood estimators.

Notes   to Table 1

            Method 1 estimates are achieved by maximizing the conditional

likelihood function for hours of work.

            Method 2 is based on Amemiya's estimator for truncated samples

Anemiya, 1973).
            Method 2A is one-Newton—Raohson iterate of           the likelihood   function

used in method 1      using the   Amerniya initial consistent estimator.

            Method 3 is a nonlinear least squares procedure that jointly

estimates     the parameters of the regression function and the           conditional

mean   of   the   random sample   disturbance    (for details, see Wales and
Woodland, 1978, who propose this procedure).
            Method 7 is    Heckman's   (l974a) maximum likelihood estimator for
hours and wages conditioned for samples            of workers.    This estimator is
proposed     by   Wfles   and Woodland (1978).

Notes to Table 2

            Method 4 is Hec]cnan1s (1974a) maximum     likelihood   estimator for

hours and wages.

            Method SA is the Hecan (1976, 1979) indirect least squares

two—step estimator. The multiplicity of estimates for                arises because

this varameter is overidentified in the current model.

            Method SB is a CLS version of LA.

            Method SC is the Hecloan procedure    as   modified by Wales and

Woodird      (1978)   or   Heclan (1978) to resolve the overidentification

prob1.
            Method SD is a GLS version of SC.

                  is the estimated conditional mean of the disturbance

term   in   the hours   of work equation. (This corresponds to g          in
equation (5 ).)

S.ection II


     1For .expositional simplicity, we abstract from endogenous wages in
the statistical analysis presented below. This assumption is not essential
to the analysis.


       efining    = 0 for nonworkers-, it is straightforward to verify that
the partial derivative of expected hours with respect to W from equation (11)
exceeds the mean value of B in the population. Defining ER = 0 for non—
workers, if leisure is a normal good the partial derivative of expected hours
with respect to R is smaller than the mean value of H in the population.


     3To simplify notation, we supress Z2 (i.e., a consumer's measured char-
acteristics) as an argument of the functions U(•), M(•) and H(•).




Section III


     1Recall that we are assuming that W is exogenous and is available for
each individual in the sample exposition. Cogan (1979) allows for endogenous
wages and his approach does not require wage data for nonworkers.


     2Because of the assumptions about functional forms, any set of exogenous
variables, including those that enter the utility function in their own right,
serve to identify the effect of fixed costs on hours of work. Thus, as a
consequence of his functional form, Hausman does not require the exclusion
restriction needed by Cogan to identify the effect of fixed costs on labor
supply.
                                  —6 Ga—




Section LV


     11n this section, we abstract from the very important problem that true
taxes are not measured by published tax schedules1 even schedules that care-
fully set out exemptions and deductions. If consumers spend real resources
to avoid paying taxes, such tax avoidance costs are properly considered as
part of the effective tax. With the exception of preliminary work of Gould
(1979), this problem has not received attention in the literature.

     1
      lnstruments will be available provided that variables appearing in the
wage function do not appear in the structural labor supply function. Such
variables are valid instruments.

     3The procedure suggested by Hall (1973) and Rosen (1976) that evaluates
the marginal tax rates and intercept terms at a standard number of hours of
work for everyone in the sample, generates inconsistent parameter estimates
because V and E — E'H are evaluated at the wrong point.

     4However, we have no guarantee in this problem that the constraint set
will be so characterized. See Rosen (1974).


     5pellechio (1979) proposes estimating a model with kiniced convex
constraints in essentially this fashion.

Section IV (continued)


     6Letting g(e) denote the density function of e, these probabilities are
related by the equation                -


            Prob (C1 c   c C2) = Prob          ff+e c C2)
                                         (C1

                                                   <'Ft <
                                IL     Prob(C1—e

where the last line follows from the independence assumption of ii and a.

     71t is clear that one need not rigidly chain the parameters of the hours
of work function to the F functions to secure identification. Thus, one
could estimate the parameters of equation (37) by restricting the parameters
of the P and X functions to be the same, and not exploiting the theory to
generate the relationship between these parameters and a1, a2, and a3.
However, even though the model is formally identified, it is likely that
parameter estimates obtained by this procedure would be imprecisely estimated.
Exploiting all the restrictions of the theory requires making strong assump-
tions about functional form. But if these assumptions are not made, parameter
estimates are likely to be imprecise.


     8Notice that the arguments t42, W4, and           each depend on W.

Section V

     SC,eneralization to more than two branches involves no new principle.
Constraint sets like R2SZ are couon in negative income tax experiments and
in certain social programs.

     2The kink at S is not treated as a state of the world because there is
not a positive probability that a consumer will be at this point if the
"taste" component v follows a continuous density. In fact, for most
preference functions, point S can never be an equilibriums


     3Hausm.an (1979) introduces and estimates a wage equation, but, as we
discuss later in this section, his estimation procedures do not properly
treat unobserved components of wages.
