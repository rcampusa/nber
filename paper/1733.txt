                    Union Work Rules and Efficiency
                         in the Building Trade



                               ABSTRACT




     This   paper estimates the effect of union work rules in the building

trades on employment and costs by comparing factor demand elasticities for

union and nonunion contractors and subcontractors over micro data from two

different types of construction. The results show that the elasticities

of substitution between labor and nonlabor inputs and own-price elasticities

for nonlabor inputs are about the same for union and nonunion contractors.

In contrast, the elasticities of substitution among different skill categories

of labor and the own-price elasticities for each category are much lower under

unionism. A simulation based on a typical office building subcontract shows

that these lower factor demand elasticities result in excess staffing of

3.2 percent, excess labor costs of 5.0 percent, and excess total costs of 2.0

percent. This study also examines directly the effect of union work rules on

the use of prefabricated components and finds that union contractors are just

as likely to use them as nonunion contractors.

 I.   Introduction


                unions had shackled the industry with make-work rules
           and jurisdictional distinctions even more preposterous,
           perhaps, than the restrictions that have all but ruined
           the railroads.

                                                "A Time of Reckoning
                                                 for the Building Unions,"
                                                 Fortune, June 4, 1979,
                                                 p. 82.


      The conventional view of union work rules in construction stated above

is that they result in excessive manning and technological stagnation. This

view largely originates from journalistic accounts of such horror stories as

the journeyman assigned to operate an automatic elevator and the master

mechanic who earned $90,000 one year without touching his wrench. Many non-

academic studies of the issue, frequently funded by business groups, reinforce

this view. For instance, the Business Roundtable (BR) recently conducted a

major study of construction industry productivity. The overall tone of their

report was described in these terms by the Wall Street Journal, "Although the

Roundtable spreads blame for the productivity problem widely, it clearly thinks

the principal culprit is organized labor."1

      This is difficult to reconcile with the results of academic research

designed to measure the impact of work rules on factor allocation. Surveys of

actual work practices in the 1950s and 1970s concluded the impact of union work

rules on efficiency had been vastly overestimated in popular accounts. This is

consistent with the conclusions of my quantitative estimates of productivity

differences between union and nonunion contractors in Mlen (1983, l984a).

Although these estimates did not consider work rules explicitly, it
                                       2

is difficult to reconcile my findings of generally higher productivity in union

construction with highly restrictive work practices.

     This paper directly estimates the impact of union work rules in construction

by comparing factor demand elasticities for union and nonunion contractors. The

hypothesis that work rules produce lower demand elasticities in the union sector

was proposed by Freeman and Medoff. Union work rules either specify situations

in which certain inputs cannot be used (occupational jurisdictions, restrictions

on subcontracting, prefabrication, or certain types of equipment) or restrict

the quantity of inputs (foremen or apprentice ratios, minimum crew sizes).     In

either case managers have less flexibility to select the least-cost combination

of inputs. As a result, union contractors cannot adjust input quantities to a given

differential in input prices as much as nonunion contractors, resulting in lower

own—price elasticities and elasticities of substitution under unionism. Freeman

and Medoff call this the relative inelasticity hypothesis.2

     This study focuses on contractor behavior in samples of micro data in

commercial office building and elementary and secondary school construction.

These data sets are especially well-suited for testing the relative inelasticity

hypothesis because the product and the technology are identical within each sample.

This was not the case for the two-digit manufacturing industry data used by Freeman

and Medoff. As a result they could not reject the possibility that their finding

of lower demand elasticities under unionism was attributable to decisions by unions

to organize sectors within each two-digit industry that had the lowest factor demand

elasticities (so as to minimize the adverse employment effects of higher wages),

rather than to the impact of union work rules. Since contractors are price takers

in local labor markets, this study also avoids the simultaneity between price and

quantity determination involved with most studies of factor demand elasticities.

     The focus here is solely upon factor misallocation resulting from union work

rules, as opposed to that resulting from union-nonunion wage gaps. The latter

issue cannot be addressed without carefully standardizing for labor quality

differences between union and nonunion labor. Such standardization is not

necessary for this study. Even though my earlier studies show more labor

services are embodied in an hour of union labor, this will not bias the

elasticity estimates. Although the union contractors would make smaller adjust-

ments in the number of hours for a given type of labor in response to a difference

in relative prices, the percentage adjustment in hours relative to the percentage

adjustment in prices would not be affected by this consideration.

     This study also reports direct evidence on the effect of union work rules

involving prefabrication. General contractors in a survey of hospitals and nursing

homes were asked whether 15 different types of prefabricated components were used.

The possible restrictive impact of unionism is gauged by comparing the questionnaire

responses of union and nonunion contractors and by estimating prefabrication

probability equations relating the usage of prefabricated components to unionism,

wage rates, size and type of building, and other control variables.

     This paper is organized in the following fashion. Section II reviews the

literature on restrictive union work practices in construction. Section III

describes the procedures used to estimate factor demand elasticities; Section IV,

the data.   I initially assume labor inputs are separable from capital and materials

and present results on aggregated labor, capital, and materials in Section V.

Differences in demand elasticities by union status for skilled labor, supervisory

labor, and unskilled labor are reported in Section VI. The separability

restrictions are tested in Section VII and results from models without those
                                                                        4

restrictions are discussed. Section VIII contains a simulation of the effect

of union work rules as manifested by differences in factor demand elasticities

on factor demand, costs, and productivity. Union-nonunion differences in

prefabrication are examined in Section IX. The results are summarized and

evaluated in Section X.

first approach union contracts are examined to see if they contain restrictive

language. This method can produce misleading conclusions because management and

the union may agree to ignore the contract provisions. Even if the contract is

followed, the restrictions need not be costly. On large jobs, minimum crew size

provisions are not going to be binding constraints.                                         In some cases excess labor

can be used outside craft lines. On the other hand, restrictive practices may

be followed at the work site even though they are not required by the contract.

      The second approach is to interview union officials, union and open—shop

contractors, and construction owners to determine which practices are actually

being followed. This allows the researcher to determine whether the work rules

in the contract are actually costly and whether practices not mentioned in the

contract are imposing additional constraints. Both approaches are limited in one

key respect--ad hoc assumptions about staffing requirements and factor demand

elasticities have to be made to determine the quantitative impact of these

provisions.

      The most comprehensive study of contract provisions is the Bureau of Labor

Statistics' (BLS) examination of 769 agreements for 16 building trades unions
                                        5

in the 66 largest SMSAs in 1972-73. The percentage of workers covered by each

of nine productivity-related contract provisions is reported for each of ten

major unions and for all 16 unions together in Table 1 .   Minimum crew size

provisions and requirements for a foreman after a given number of workers are

hired are the most widespread practices with potentially adverse effects on

productivity. Crew size restrictions cover over one-third of all workers and

over two-thirds of bricklayers, ironworkers, electrical workers, and operating

engineers. This could reduce the own-price elasticity of skilled labor and the

elasticity of substitution between skilled labor and other inputs on small jobs.

About 60 percent of the contracts require foremen after so many workers are

hired, with over half of these requiring a foreman after one to three workers.

This could reduce the own-price elasticity of supervisory labor and the elasticity

of substitution between supervisors and other types of labor on small jobs.     In

addition, 26.5 percent of the contracts contain foreman-to-journeyman ratios,

which could reduce this elasticity for jobs in all size categories.

     Considerably less widespread are 'provisions limiting prefabrication, tools

and equipment, the ability of employers (usually subcontractors) to work with

tools, and the use of non-bargaining unit personnel. These provisios are

clustered within a few trades. Prefabrication limits cover 70 percent of the

plumbers and 77 percent of the sheet metal workers. Limits on tools cover

83 percent of the painters (maximum brush size). Restrictions on the use of tools

by employers are most often found in the contracts of painters, plumbers, and

electrical workers. Three-fourths of the sheet metal workers are covered by

contracts restricting the use of non-bargaining unit personnel. Nearly half of

the workers in this samole are covered by contracts that bar limitations on the

amount of work performed per day or bar resistance to technological improvements

or labor-saving devices. Such provisions are rarely found, however, in agree-

ments covering painters or sheet metal workers. Since these sets of provisions

are not widely observed, it will be difficult to assess their impact over samples

that are pooled across various trades.3

     As part of a larger study examining all aspects of productivity, BR (1982a)

examined a sample of agreements in effect in 1979 representing 20 percent of all

agreements and covering almost half of the union work force.4 It found almost

20 percent of their sample contracts contained crew size restrictions. Most

ironworker contracts contained such restrictions, along with a substantial propor-

tion of boilermaker and operating engineer agreements. Assuming management would

utilize 10 percent fewer workers for 10 percent of the tasks assigned to these

crafts, BR estimated crew size provisions result in an annual excess cost of

$42 million. In comparison, the BLS study found much greater use of these

restrictions in its 1972-73 sample. 0ff-site fabrication restrictions were found

in only a minor proportion of all contiracts but in about half of the pipefitter

or plumber agreements. This results in an annual excess cost of $30 million,

using assumptions identical to those in the crew size case above.5

     BR (1982b) cites exclusive jurisdiction as "the greatest.   .   .current
handicap faced by union contractors,' (p. i) not only because of distortions

in factor mixes but also because of disputes among unions. A Stanford University

survey done for BR found these problems to be especially severe in the unloading

and storage of materials, operation of small equipment, and installation of

scaffolding and supports. BR (1982c) argued that restrictions on the use of

semiskilled and unskilled workers may raise costs as much as 20 percent. Although
                                       8

the quantitative basis for all these claims and estimates is quite weak,

they all suggest that factor demand elasticities are much lower in union

construction.

     The most thorough interview study was done in 1952 by Haber and Levinson.

They interviewed 268 representatives of labor, management, and government in

16 cities to determine, among other things, how receptive labor unions were to

new techniques, how widespread union work rules were, and how much impact they

had on costs. While their back-of-the envelope calculations concluded union work

rules raise costs by 3 to 8 percent, they noted "the building trades unions

have been more receptive to new techniques than has been widely believed" (p. 153)

and that "an over-all evaluation of the extent and importance of union working

rules strongly suggests that their adverse impact is much less than has been

widely alleged" (p. 189). Three fourths of their cost estimate is attributed to

restrictions on the employment of different types of labor, whereas the remainder

is attributed to restrictions on techniques.

     Mandelstamm obtained cost and man-hour estimates for a standard small house

from contractors in two Michigan cities in 1957: one heavily unionized and the

other dominated by open-shop contractors. Contractors were also asked how their

man-hours estimates were influenced by work rules and technological restrictions.

Except for paint spray guns and prefabricated parts manufactured by nonunion labor,

Mandelstamm found no union opposition to labor-saving techniques. In fact, other

new techniques were utilized more frequently in the unionized city, a factor

Mandelstarnm attributed to better management. Mandelstamm found the only work

rules with any restrictive effects were minimum crew sizes to lift glass, limits

on overtime work, and a requirement to hire local men on jobs outside their

home base. He found no evidence of organized slowdowns, absolute restrictions
                                       9

on output, insistence on unnecessary quality, barriers to discharge, or limits

on working contractors. He concluded, "Although no reliable quantitative

estimate can be made of the effect of these rules on efficiency, their total

impact would appear to be very small" (p. 512).

     More recently Bourdon and Levitt's survey of union and nonunion contractors

in eight cities in 1976 found relatively few restrictive work practices in the

union sector. Operating engineers and ironworkers set strict limits on the number

of workers for a given job; the mechanical trades were very restrictive on work

performed off-site. Such rules tend to be irrelevant for large projects, but

they impose costly constraints on small specialty contractors. Even in these

cases, rules are often ignored or loosely interpreted to fit the context. No

work-rule restrictions were reported by 55 percent of the contractors interviewed.

Another 92 percent said there were no restrictions on materials; 95 percent

on tools. The only such restrictions that tended to be observed involved nonunion

prefabricated products.

     According to the union contractors interviewed by Bourdon and Levitt, the

major restriction imposed by union work rules was that they rarely allowed workers

to cross trade lines. Only 27 percent of the union contractors said that their

workers crossed trade lines "occasionally to often," while 43 percent said

"rarely'   and 30 percent said "never." In contrast, 82 percent of the nonunion

contractors   responded "occasionally to often" and only 18 percent said "never."
The authors concluded, "There   is no question that at various times and places,

various locals of the building trades unions have resisted technological innovation

in tools or materials and have established unduly restrictive work rules or

practices. Yet, the results of the survey, as of other field research, do
                                              10

  not support the contention that this has been a widespread or consistent

  policy' (p. 63).

       What are the common themes in all of these findings? First, despite popular

  conceptions, most union contracts are not riddled with provisions that seriously

   interfere with factor allocation. Second, the interview studies indicate many

  rules look more restrictive on paper than they are in practice because either

  they do not generally impose binding constraints or they are not followed. Third,

  although most trades seem relatively free of restrictive work practices, certain

  problem areas keep popping up in almost all of the studies summarized above.

  These include limits on prefabrication in plumbing and sheet metal work, limits

  on tools and equipment in painting, crew size limits among ironworkers and

  operating engineers, and restrictions on the use of tools by employers in electrical

  work. Fourth, the two most recent studies both concluded the major work rule

  problem facing employers today was the exclusive jurisdiction system. Contractors

  strongly believed they could significantly reduce manhour requirements if they

  could assign workers to tasks outside their craft's jurisdiction and make greater

  use of semiskilled and unskilled labor.


III. Specification

       Estimates of union and nonunion factor demand elasticities are obtained from

  translog cost system parameters. This allows elasticites of substitution between

  factors to vary. The cost function is written:


       inC =        +    mY +                      mY
                                  i(lnY)2 +
                                                                         (1)

where C =   cost,    Y =   output,        and       =   price    of factor i, i = 1, ..., n.    Two sets

of restrictions are imposed in all cases:                                           =    and (2) degree
                                                                 (1) symmetry

                                                                   Yij
     The partial derivatives of (1) with respect to factor prices are the demand

equations for each factor, that is C/aP =                        Xi.     In logarithms this becomes


                         by
     alnC/alnP.      =   rn       = Si,

where S. = share of factor i in total cost. In the translog case,

Since both the cost function and the share equations contain information about

the parameters of interest, they are jointly estimated below by iterated seemingly

unrelated regression. One share equation is dropped to make the covariance

matrix of the disturbances nonsingular. This produces maximum likelihood estimates

that are invariant to the choice of which share equation is dropped.

     Elasticities of substitution (an) and own-price demand elasticities

are computed from the estimates of (1) and (2) using the formulae


        =   (y.. +

        = (1         ÷ S(S1 —
                                       l))/S
With (1) and (2) estimated separately by union status,                            and    can be compared

for union and nonunion contractors. Two hypotheses about union and nonunion demand
                                                    12

elasticities are tested. The first hypothesis is the equality of all union

and nonunion coefficients. This is done by examining the likelihood ratio

  =
      (Il/I)2                     where

matrix for the pooled specification,
                                          =   determinant of the disturbance covariance
                                                         =   the same determinant for the specifi-
cation with separate union and nonunion coefficients, and n = number of contractors

in the sample. The test statistic —29nX has a chi-square distribution with

degrees of freedom equal to the number of restrictions being tested. Conceivably,

the union and nonunion elasticities could be identical, even when the hypothesis

of equal cost and share equation coefficients is rejected. Accordingly, the second

test is to examine the difference between the elasticity estimates directly.

Superscripting union (nonunion) values by u(n), this involves testing whether

       u              n
             -             = 0,

       U —       fl       =0
      ni

Standard errors of these differences are derived under two assumptions: (1) non-

stochastic S. and (2) E(o aj) =                  E(n n) = 0.        Under these assumptions the

ratio of the union-nonunion difference in elasticities to its estimated standard

error approximates the ratio of the union-nonunion difference in                       to its

estimated standard error.

      A key issue in specifying the model is the separabil ity of labor from other

inputs. Five inputs are considered below: skilled labor (S), supervisory and

administrative labor (B), semiskilled and unskilled labor including apprentices

(U), materials (M), and equipment (K). If all five inputs are examined

simultaneoulsy, there are as many as 21 parameters to estimate from five

equations, a potentially extreme demand to place upon the data. Further,
                                         13

    and, to a lesser extent,    are subject to measurement error, biasing the

 K and M elasticities downward and all other elasticities upward (because of the

 homogeneity restrictions).

     A natural procedure for reducing the burden upon the data and reducing

potential measurement error bias is to impose separability between the different

types of labor and nonlabor inputs and to estimate two models: one examining

labor (L), K, and M, where L is obtained by aggregating S. B, and U into a single

 input (KLM model) and the other examing S, B, and U as separate inputs while

ignoring K and M (BSU model). This reduces the number of free parameters per

model to 10 and the number of equations to three. Measurement error bias is no

longer a serious factor in the BSU model, although it is still present in the

KLM model. The risk involved with imposing separability is that the elasticity

estimates may turn out to be biased if different types of labor are not separable

from other inputs. Estimates both with and without the separability restrictions

are reported below.

     One limitation of this procedure is that it assumes that factor quantities

are selected at points on the contractor's demand curve. In practice some union

work rules specify factor quantities well to the right of the demand curve

(e.g. minimum crew size restrictions), which means the isoquants of union

contractors (as constrained by the work rules) contain flat segments and

discontinujtjes, especially at small levels of output. By assuming normally

distributed errors in the share equations, the model will be misspecified to some

extent for the union contractors. The true union elasticities will be zero at

some points, whereas the model will impose a smooth, continuous structure on

the isoquants. Standard errors will be biased upwardly in the union sample.
                                    14

In spite of the limitations of the translog specification, the model can

approximate the curvature of isoquants under unionism and these results

can be compared to the curvature of nonunion isoquants in order to get at

the fundamental question of how much do union work rules matter in

determining factor quantities.

IV. Data

     Two different data sets are examined: one containing 83 commercial office

buildings built in 1974 and the other containing 68 elementary and secondary

schools built in 1972. Both data sets were gathered by BLS as part of its

Construction Labor and Material Requirements series.   I originally intended to

use individual contractors and subcontractors as observations for the estimation

of demand elasticities. Upon screening the data, I frequently found more than one

subcontractor involved in a particular type of operation. In many cases one

subcontractor provided only materials while others provided labor. Since focusing

on individual contractors in such cases would be quite misleading, I decided to

aggregate all subcontractors on a project doing the same type of work into a

single observation. General contractors are omitted because their output is

reported as the total value of the building rather than the value of the work

done by their crews. They cannot be included in the sample without imposing

homotheticity restrictions which, as will be shown below, are strongly rejected

by the data.6 This results in 823 union and 266 nonunion observations in the

office building sample; 806 union and 155 nonunion observations in the school

sample.

     Each contractor reports the amount of the contract, union status, type

and cost of each material item, fair rental value or depreciation for each type

of equipment, and hours and wages for each occupation employed onsite.
                                      15

 Since the focus here is on substitution patterns for onsite inputs, interest

 expenses are not included in capital costs. The cost measure used below is

 total labor, material, and equipment costs in the KLM model; total labor costs,

 in the BSU model .   The contract amount is used as the output measure in both

models.

      Materials prices are not reported and must be constructed from other sources.

The 1973 Dodge Manual for Building Construction Pricing and Scheduling reports a

materials price index for eighty cities. These were aggregated into nine indices

for each of the Census subregions, using 1972 construction employment in each

city as weights. Since this index varies much more across rather than within

regions, this aggregation is unlikely to seriously contaminate the results.

Values of this variable for smaller geographic units could not be constructed

because, to protect the confidentiality of contractors, individual states or

SMSAs are not identified in the data.

     The school survey reports hours and costs for each type of equipment, but

only costs are reported for the office building sample. The capital price

variable used for the latter sample is the rate of return from the 1972 Census

of Construction Industries for each project's Census subregion. The ratio of

equipment costs to equipment hours is the theoretically appropriate capital

price measure for the school sample. Some contractors had no equipment costs.

To impute capital prices in those cases, the rnean-cost-.to-hours ratio for

the contractor's operation code (e.g., plumbing, carpentry, excavation, etc.)

is used.
                                       16

     Factor prices also had to be imputed for occupational groups when they were

not used on a particular project. These were obtained from the coefficients

of an average hourly earnings equation estimated over each occupational group

used by each contractor with separate intercepts for each building, each

occupational group, and complete occupation-union interactions. The dependant

variable was specified in linear form. The results, reported in Table 2, are

generally consistent with what is known about the wage structure in the industry.

Apprentices and unskilled workers earn about the same amount within each sector.

Both qoups earn less than skilled workers, who in turn earn less than

supervisors. The union-nonunion wage gap is largest in percentage terms for

the least skilled occupations.

V. KLM Model Results

     The shares of labor, materials, and capital for all samples are reported

in the first three lines of Table 3. The factor shares are quite similar for

office buildings and schools. Labor's share is about 40 percent; materials',

55 percent; capital 's, 5 percent. There is very little difference in the factor

shares for union and nonunion contractors. Despite higher union wages, labor's

share is near 40 percent for both union and nonunion contractors in both

samples.

Materials' share is slightly higher for union contractors, whereas capital's

share is slightly lower.

     Equality of the translog cost system parameters for union and nonunion

contractors is strongly rejected in both office building and school construction.

The test of equal union and nonunion coefficients involves 10 restrictions.

The critical chi-square value at the 99.5 percent confidence level for 10 degrees

of freedom is 25.2, well below the reported values of —2nX.

     Conceivably, the      coefficients are equal for union and nonunion

contractors but receive so little weight relative to the other seven restrictions

that pooling by union status is still rejected. A more stringent test is to drop

the cost function from the system. This leaves seven restrictions to test, three

involving     coefficients. In this case, -2n is 14.62 for office buildings

and 64.76 for schools. Both tests reject pooling of union and nonunion observa-

tions at conventionally accepted significance levels.

    The translog coefficients show the production function for subcontractors

in school and office building construction to be nonhomothetic and, in all but

one case, constant returns to scale. Labor and capital shares shrink with

output in both samples, with greater shrinkage among nonunion contractors.

Materials share is greater in large projects, once again with a larger rate of

increase with respect to project size in the nonunion sector. The hypothesis

of constant returns to scale can be rejected only for union school subcontractors.

They are subject to increasing (decreasing) returns for projects with value

added of more (less) than $9451. These results are somewhat different from

those I obtained in Allen (1984b) in which the unit of observation was theentjre

building project rather than individual contractors. This need not reflect
                                         21

aggregation bias in the earlier paper since general and miscellaneous

contractors are omitted here. The two exercises are also conceptually dif-

ferent, as the results in the other paper reflect not only the behavior of

subcontractors but also the coordination of many types of work going on at

once.

        Even though pooling by union status is rejected, the estimates of factor

demand elasticities for labor, materials, and capital in Table 4 show no

particular pattern for union as opposed to nonunion contractors. In both

samples, there is little difference in the own price elasticity for labor by

union status, with all of the estimates falling between .51 and .66. The own

price elasticity for capital is somewhat larger for union contractors in both

samples, and the own price elasticity for materials is slightly larger for

nonunion contractors in the school sample, but the differences are not

statistically significant.

     The elasticity of substitution estimates show labor and materials to be

substitutes in construction, as are materials and capital. Labor and capital

are complements for both union and nonunion contractors in office building

construction and for nonunion contractors in school construction. In union

school construction, labor and capital are substitutes. Out of the four cases

where factor pairs are substitutes for both union and nonunion contractors, the

nonunion elasticity is larger in three cases, but the null hypothesis cannot

be rejected in any of them.

     A serio.s potential source of bias in the office building sample is

measurement error in the capital price proxy variable. The       estimates are

much smaller for that sample, whereas the standard errors for all parameters

associated with capital are much larger. This results in an upward bias in           the

other coefficients because of the homogeneity restrictions. It also makes           it

more difficult to estimate accurately union-nonunion differences.

        One way to roughly assess this bias is to re-estimate the model over the

school sample using the capital price proxy in place of the correct measure.

The following elasticity estimates were obtained for the pooled sample:

The own price elasticity for capital is much larger in       absolute value in this

specification,   as the     estimate falls from .025 to -.017.         The elasticities
of   substitution between capital and both labor and materials bear little

resemblance to the earlier estimates. This casts some doubt about the findings

of complementarity between labor and capital and a large materials-capital

elasticity in the office building sample.

      Measurement error seems to have little effect on the finding of no difference

in elasticities by union status. All of the nonunion elasticities are larger

(but not significantly) than the union elasticities in this case, in contrast
                                         24

 to only three out of six in Table 4. This suggests that if there is a bias in

 the office building estimates of union-nonunion differences, it is in favor of

 the relative inelasticity hypothesis.

      In summary, there is no support for the hypothesis of lower factor demand

elasticities for union contractors in the KLM model. This is consistent with

 the results of earlier academic studies. It also is consistent with the data

on contract provisions showing limits on prefabrication or on tools and equipment

 to be relatively rare. This still leaves open the possibility of union work

 rules restricting the quantity or even the types of labor that can be hired,

a matter that will now be examined.


VI. BSU Model Results

     The allocation of different types of labor varies substantially by union

 status. As shown in the first three lines of Table 5, the share of skilled

labor is substantially higher for union contractors. In the school sample,

 skilled labor's share is 85 percent for union contractors versus 74 percent

 for nonunion contractors. Skilled labor's share is 80 percent for union con-

 tractors in the office building sample as opposed to 71 percent for nonunion

contractors. These differences may reflect lower prices for skilled relative

 to unskilled labor under unionism or jurisdictional rules keeping unskilled

workers out of certain tasks.

     Supervisory labor's share is slightly higher for union contractors in both

 samples. This may result from minimum foreman requirements or the relatively

 small difference between the wages of supervisory and other types of labor.

 Unskilled labor's share is much smaller for union contractors in both samples.

     Once again, equality of all ten union and nonunion coefficients is rejected

at extremely high confidence levels for the translog cost system. When the cost

function was deleted from the system and the hypothesis retested with seven

restrictions, pooling was still soundly rejected.8

     The production function is nonhomothetic in all samples. The share of

supervisory labor increases with output in all cases. The share of skilled

labor falls with output for union contractors, but rises for nonunion con-

tractors. The share of unskilled labor falls with output in the nonunion

samples, but changes very little with output in the union samples.

     How do own price elasticities for different types of labor and patterns

of labor-labor substitution differ between union and nonunion contractors?

These results, reported in Table 6, provide very strong support for the hypo-

thesis that union work rules reduce management's flexibility to assign workers

to jobs in the most efficient fashion. In five out of six cases, the own price

elasticities are larger for nonunion contractors and in three such cases the

differences are statistically significant from zero at a 90 percent or greater

confidence level.

     The estimated differences are especially pronounced in the case of skilled

labor, as one would expect if occupational jurisdictions are the major restrictive

aspect of union work rules. In both samples this elasticity is more than twice

as large for nonunion contractors. In the school sample the elasticity for

skilled labor is - .15 for union contractors as opposed to - .38 for nonunion

contractors. The magnitudes of the estimates in the office building sample are

quite similar: -.17 for union contractors and -.46 for nonunion contractors.

     The magnitudes of the union-nonunion differences in the own price elasticity

for unskilled labor are also quite large. This elasticity is -.44 for union

contractors in the school sample and - .95 in the office building sample. In

contrast, they are -l .06 and -l .26, respectively, for nonunion contractors.

Although the estimated standard errors for the union-nonunion difference are

not small enough to reject the null hypothesis, the consistency of these results

from two different samples is striking.

     The results for supervisory labor in the office building sample are also

consistent with the relative inelasticity hypothesis. The demand curve for

supervisory labor in the union sector is practically vertical, perhaps reflecting

foreman requirement rules. In contrast the demand elasticity is about -2.7

for nonunion contractors in this sample. Although this difference is significantly

different from zero, it is difficult to reconcile with the results from the

school sample in which the union elasticity is —2.1 .   The nonunion elasticity is

positive, but estimated with very little precision.

     Elasticities of substitution also generally tend to be smaller in the

union sector. The elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled

labor is near 1.6 for nonunion contractors in both samples. In contrast, this

elasticity for union contractors in the school sample is 0.6; in the office

building sample, 1.1. However, the hypothesis of no difference in the estimates

in the office building sample cannot be rejected. This is also the case for the

supervisory-unskilled elasticity in that sample.

     The two samples produced conflicting results for substitution between

skilled and supervisory workers. In the office building sample the union

elasticity is negative (but not significantly different from zero), whereas the

nonunion elasticity is 1.7. In contrast, the union elasticity in the school

sample is 2.8, whereas the nonunion elasticity was negative.

        All the elasticities for supervisory labor for nonunion school construction

  seem unreliable. The elasticity of substitution between supervisory and

 unskilled labor is negative and unaccountably large in magnitude, whereas the

 own price elasticity is positive. If 1BB is too large and 1BU and                     are too

  small ,   the   other nonunion elasticities are also biased because of the homogeneity

  restrictions. Larger values of                and SB would imply either (1) larger own-

  price elasticities for skilled or unskilled labor or (2) a smaller elasticity

  of substitution between skilled and unskilled labor.


VII. Is Labor Separable from Other Inputs?

        The results in the two preceding sections show the demand elasticities

  for different types of labor and for labor-labor substitution are lower for union

  than for nonunion contractors. In contrast, there is no difference by union status

  in demand elasticities for nonlabor inputs and for substitution between aggregate

  labor and nonlabor inputs. These results were obtained under the assumption of

  separability between aggregate labor and nonlabor inputs. The separability

  assumption requires the elasticities of substitution between the different types

  of labor and any rionlabor input to be equal .         Algebraically,   this means

    aBM = °UM and          =         =
                               °BK
        Denny and Fuss have developed tests of these restrictions. In this section,

  I report the results of those tests. They show labor inputs are separable from

  nonlabor inputs in the school sample but not in the office building sample.

  I then report union-nonunion elasticity differences for both samples when the

  separability restrictions are removed. Their removal has relatively little effect

 on the office building results, but produces estimates in the school sample that

 are difficult to believe (indicating their imposition was appropriate for that

  sample).
                                         31


     Denny and Fuss show the translog function is weakly separable between labor

and nonlabor inputs if


           =
               SM'BM      SK'BK'

               SM1LJM =   SK'UK

The determinants of the error covariance matrix with and without these restrictions

are used to calculate log likelihood ratio test statistics. These are distributed

chi-square with 4 degrees of freedom. The results are as follows:


     Sample:                Test statistic:       Significance level:

     Office buildings             57.2                    .999

     Schools                       6.5                    .835



Weak separability is strongly rejected for office buildings but cannot be rejected

for schools. This suggests the LKM model produces misleading estimates of the

elasticities of substitution between labor and nonlabor inputs for office buildings.

Other elasticity estimates may also be biased by the homogeneity restrictions.

     The alternative procedure of estimating a five-factor translog cost system

has an equally serious limitation. The data may simply not be up to the task of

estimating three different elasticities of substitution between labor and capital

and three more for labor and materials, especially with measurement error in the

prices of capital and materials.

     With this proviso in mind, turn now to the elasticity estimates in Table 7.

The five—factor model results for office buildings are similar to those

obtained in the previous section. Once again, labor demand elasticities are

much lower for union contractors. In fact, the gap between union and

nonunion elasticities is somewhat larger in the five-factor model, especially

for the own price elasticities of supervisory and unskilled labor and all of

the substitution elasticities between different types of labor. The absolute

value of all nonunion elasticities involving supervisory labor is much larger

in the five-factor model. Some are so large, especially the elasticity of

substitution between supervisory and unskilled labor, that they cast doubt upon

all the nonunion elasticity estimates.

     One important difference between the five-factor and BSU model results is

that all three types of labor are complements in the union sector. This suggests

that jurisdictional rules allow little substitution among different types of labor.

Each type of labor is substitutable for materials and two are substitutable

for capital, results roughly consistent with the KLM model estimates. Once

again, capital and materials elasticities do not differ by union status.

     The rejection of separability implies the elasticities of substitution

between labor and nonlabor inputs should vary for different types of labor.

Recall in Table 4 that the elasticity of substitution between labor and materials

for the pooled sample was 1.1.   In Table 6 the elasticity between materials and

skilled labor is 0.7; between materials and supervisory labor, 8.0; between

materials and unskilled labor, 1.8. The larger elasticity estimate for unskilled

labor is consistent with the notion of greater economies of prefabrication for

simple, repetitive tasks.   I have no explanation for the extremely large

elasticity estimate for supervisory labor.

     The elasticity of substitution between labor and capital for the pooled

sample is -1.8. In the case of skilled labor, this elasticity is 0.4; supervisory

labor, -75.9; unskilled labor, 1.1. Once again, the relative magnitude of the
                                          35

skilled and unskilled elasticities makes some sense, indicating construction

equipment is considerably less substitutable for the former. Apparently the

complementarity between supervisory labor and capital is so large that it

makes the aggregate labor elasticity somewhat misleading. The magnitude of the

supervisory labor elasticity at mean factor share values seems too large to

take seriously. When supervisory labor and capital's share are each 10 percent,

this elasticity becomes -4.2.

     Even though the separability restrictions for schools cannot be rejected,

the five—factor model was also estimated over that sample to determine the

sensitivity of those results to an alternative specification. A larger nonunion

elasticity for unskilled labor and elasticity of substitution beten skilled

and unskilled labor are the only results at all consistent with the BSU and

KLM models. The supervisory labor elasticity estimates are more peculiar

here than in Table 6, casting considerable doubt upon the reasonableness of the

other elasticities. Since the separability restrictions cannot be rejected for

schools, I don't believe the five-factor model results merit serious consideration

in this case.

     Because of the peculiar values of the elasticities for supervisory labor,

a four-factor model in which skilled and supervisory labor were aggregated and

examined along with unskilled labor, materials and capital was also estimated.

Weak separability of skilled and supervisory labor was strongly rejected for the

office building sample (-2nA =    46.2)   but could not be rejected for schools

(-2nx =   3.6).   The results are fairly similar to those in Table 7 and are

reported in Appendix Table A. Weak separability of the skilled-supervisory

aggregate and unskilled labor from capital and materials was rejected at about

the 90 percent confidence level for both samples (-2znx =    4.9   for offices and

4.5 for schools).

VIII. The Cost of Union Work Rules

       The above results show own-price elasticities for labor and labor-labor

  substitution elasticities to be much lower for union contractors. How much of

  an effect do lower elasticities have on employment patterns, costs and produc-

  tivity? To illustrate the magnitude of these adjustments, the change in factor

  allocation in the union sector resulting when wages fall to nonunion levels is

  simulated, using both union and nonunion elasticities. The quality of union

  labor available at union wage rates is assumed to be identical to that available

  at nonunion rates. This allows the results of the simulation using union

  elasticities to be interpreted as the magnitude of allocative inefficiency

  resulting from higher union wages minus the magnitude of the technical ineffi-

  ciency resulting from union work rules. The results obtained with nonunion

  elasticities solely reflect the magnitude of the allocative inefficiency resulting

  from union wages. By comparing these two sets of results, the magnitude of the

   technical inefficiency resulting from union work rules can be determined.

       The simulation is based on a commercial office building subcontract in which

  output, costs of each input and hours of each type of labor equal their union

   sample means. Wages for all three types of labor are assumed to fall from mean

   union to mean nonunion values. This amounts to a 22.2 percent decrease for

   skilled labor, 6.8 percent for supervisory, and 33.6 percent for unskilled.

   Constant output cross-price elasticities are obtained from the formula


        alnX1JalnP = Si   a.
   Since the KLM model found no difference by union status in elasticities of

   substitution between labor and noniabor inputs, I base the simulation solely

   on the BSU model results and ignore changes in capital and materials costs.
                                      37

     In both simulations a fall in wages to nonunion levels results in reduced

employment of skilled and supervisory labor and increased employment of unskilled

labor. The adjustments are much larger when nonunion elasticities are used,

especially for skilled and supervisory labor. Under the union elasticities,

the quantity of labor hours demanded increases by 0.8 percent, reflecting a

shift from skilled to unskilled labor. Under the nonunion elasticities, the

quantity of labor hours demanded actually decreases by 2.4 percent. This implies

removal of union work rules would reduce staffing by 3.2 percent. Productivity

would increase by the same proportion.

     Labor costs for the average union project are $60,907. If wages fell to

nonunion levels, costs would fall to $46,706 under union elasticities, a reduc-

tion of 23.3 percent. Under nonunion elasticities, labor costs faF to $44,388,

a reduction of 27.1 percent. The ratio of labor costs under nonunion elasticities

to those under union elasticities indicates that removal of union work rules could

reduce labor costs by 5.0 percent and total costs by 2.0 (   5.0   x .40, where .40

is labor's share of total cost) percent. These results are fairly consistent

with the findings of earlier academic studies. Although their magnitude is by no

means trivial, they create an impression quite different from that produced by

journalistic horror stories or studies by "experts'1 in the business community.

Another way of interpreting these results is that unions are willing to give up

5 percent of their wages in return for a 3 percent increase in staffing.


IX. Unions and Prefabrication

    The effect of unions on the use of prefabricated components has already

been addressed indirectly in the estimates of the elasticity of substitution

between labor and materials reported above. This is far from an ideal test of

the hypothesis that union work rules restrict the amount of prefabrication, as

this elasticity also reflects factors such as building design and engineering.

A more suitable approach is to compare the usage of prefabricated components

for union and nonunion contractors in a sample of technologically similar

structures. This can be done for 36 union and 8 nonunion hospitals and nursing

homes completed in 1976 and included in a BLS Construction Labor and Material

Requirements survey. The survey reports whether each of 15 different types of

prefabricated components was used in the project.

     There is very little difference in the usage of prefabricated components

between union and nonunion contractors, as reported in Table 9.   In eight of the

15 cases, union contractors are more likely to use the prefabricated component.

Recall that, according to BLS, contractual limits on prefabrication are most

widespread for sheet metal workers. Despite these limits, about half of the

union contractors used prefabricated air handling ducts and air conditioning

equipment and union contractors were more likely than nonunion contractors to use

prefabricated underfloor ducts. Thus, there seems to be, even in the case where

contractual language is most restrictive, little union impact on prefabrication.

     Another way to examine this question is to use probit equations to estimate

the effect of unions on the probability that a particular type of prefabricated

component is used. This allows the impact of exogenous variables that may be

correlated with union status to be held constant. These variables include average

hourly earnings, square footage of the building (both in logs), and binary

variables indicating region (3), location in an SMSA, whether the building is an

addition to an existing structure, whether the building is a nursing home, and

whether the building is owned by a government or public agency. The union

coefficients for each of these 15 equations are reported in the last

column of Table 9. All but three of these coefficients are positive, indicating

greater use of prefabrication by union contractors. The largest coefficients

are those for air conditioning equipment, plumbing pipe or electrical conduit

"trees", windows, concrete forms, hung ceilings, roof and floor decks, and

underfloor ducts. However, most of the union coefficients are smaller than their

standard errors, which means that, despite the surprisingly large number of

positive coefficients, this evidence cannot reject the hypothesis of no

difference in the use of prefabricated components between union and nonunion

contractors.

     In summary, the direct evidence on prefabrication is fully consistent with

the indirect evidence on elasticities of substitution between labor and materials.

Both sets of evidence indicate no restrictive impact of union work rules on the

choice of materials or the usage of prefabricated components.

IX. Conclusion

    There are five major empirical results in this paper:

     (1) The elasticities of substitution among different skill categories

          of labor and the own-price elasticities for each category are much

          lower in union than in nonunion construction.

     (2) The elasticities of substitution between labor and nonlabor inputs

         and own-price elasticities for nonlabor inputs are about the same in

         union and nonunion construction.

    (3) Labor is separable from nonlabor inputs in school construction

         but not in office building construction. Even when this lack of

         separability in the latter case is taken into account, the former

         results still hold. When separability restrictions are removed

         in the office building sample, all types of labor income become

         complements for each other. This indicates occupational jurisdictions
                                     42

         in the union sector nay have a large effect on managerial

         flexibility.

     (4) A simulation based on a typical office building subcontract shows

         that lower factor demand elasticities in the union sector result in

         excess staffing of 3.2 percent, excess labor costs of 5.0 percent,

         and excess total costs of 2.0 percent.

     (5) Despite contractual provisions limiting prefabrication in some

         situations, there is no difference in the use of prefabricated

         components between union and nonunion contractors.

     What emerges from this and earlier research by myself and others is the

following view of the impact of union work rules in construction. First, these

rules are rstricted mainly to the allocation of different types of labor and

tend to have little effect on the employment of capital or materials. This is

consistent with the BLS contract provision data as well as with the field work

of Bourdon and Levitt (who emphasize exclusive jurisdiction as the most costly

set of restrictions) and Haber and Levinson (who base only one-fourth of their

cost estimates on capital and materials restrictions). It is probably not a

coincidence that this finding mirrors Freeman and Medoff's results for manu-

facturing. Second, although the costs of such work rules are not as alarmingly

large as journalistic accounts and nonacademic studies suggest, sizable increases

in productivity would result from their removal. Third, the forces linking

unionism and efficiency are very complex, with tendencies pulling in opposite

directions simultaneously. Even with work rules raising costs by 2.0 percent

and higher wages raising costs by 9.3 percent (=   .4 x .233) in office building

construction, my earlier work has shown that productivity is sufficiently higher in
                                      43

the union sector to make unit costs competitive with open shop contractors in

some cases. Superior training and reduced hiring costs seem to override the

effects of work rules and wages.

     Despite these appealing consistencies, these conclusions are subject to two

general classes of criticisms. First, the results rely heavily on a particular

functional form, the translog. These same issues were also explored with a more

restrictive econometric approach, the relative factor input form of the CES.

The results, available upon request, showed lower union elasticities of substitu-

tion between skilled and unskilled labor but higher union elasticities of

substitution between labor and capital for both office buildings and schools.

Clearly, work with less restrictive functional forms such as the generalized

Box-Cox or the Fourier may yield different results. The frontier cost function

approach is also applicable to union-nonunion elasticity comparisons (if you are

willing to believe there is no such thing as good luck in construction).

     Second, this paper shows some union demand elasticities to be lower and

attributed this to union work rules. Since I have not produced an eyewitness

account or ballistics evidence, this boils down to guilt by association. One

way of 'proving union work rules cause lower elasticities is to compare

elasticities across different types of contractors and then see if the patterns

match up with those one would expect from the BLS contract provisions data

(e.g., lower sustitutability between labor and materials in plumbing and sheet

metal work). When I tried this with both translog and CES specifications, I found

most of the results to be inconsistent with production theory, presumably because

the data were being asked to do too much. Another appropriate procedure would

be to estimate elasticities on union work covered by project agreements (which

usually waive most restrictive work rules) and compare them to those for similar

work where the work rules are followed, but no such data are currently available.

     2Demand elasticity comparisons could produce misleading signals about

managerial flexibility if the distributions of input prices for union and

nonunion contractors did not overlap and elasticities varied with input prices.

The former condition does not hold here. Union and nonunion contractors pay

the same prices for materials and capital in a given area. Although union

contractors do pay higher wages on average, many nonunion contractors pay union

scale or above.

     3Attempts to estimate separate union and nonunion elasticities for particular

types of work (e.g., plumbing) were made, but the coefficients were either

inconsistent with production theory (e.g., upward-sloping demand curves, all

inputs complementary to each other) or much smaller than their standard errors.

     4For an overview of the results of the entire BR construction productivity

project, see BR (1983).

     58R (l982a) also dealt with provisions that increase labor costs such as

overtime premiums, pay for time not worked, subsistence and travel pay, and

shift premiums. The effect of such rules cannot be examined here directly because

labor costs are not broken down in any detail. Although these provisions raise the

price of labor, they do not generally prevent contractors from making adjustments

in factor mixes to avoid such premiums and should have little or no effect on

demand elasticities.

     6Even if an output measure were available, the factor demand decisions

of general contractors are not really comparable to those of subcontractors, as
                                      45

one of their major functions is coordination of the entire project. This is

reflected in a larger share of supervisory and administrative labor for

general contractors. In the office building sample, seven general contractors

hired only supervisory and administrative labor, and for 26 others this type of

labor accounted for more than 20 percent of their labor costs.

     7All of the models were also estimated over individual contractors with

positive labor costs. These completely disaggregated estimates are very similar

to those reported below and are available upon request.

    8The values of -2nA are 38.7 for office buildings and 56.7 for schools.

Pooling of union and nonunion contractors can be rejected at the 99 percent

confidence level in both cases.
