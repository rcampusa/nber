              U.S. Antidumping Policies: The Case of Steel


                                ABS TRACT


     This   paper examines the controversy surrounding recent allegations
that foreign producers are dumping steel products onto U.S. markets. The
paper is in four sections, which take four quite distinct views of dumping
and recent U.S. antidumping policies, emphasizing the changing definition

of dumping and the development of administrative procedures. Section II

focuses on the application of these procedures to the international steel

trade, taking as a case study the most noteworthy of recent innovations:

the Trigger Price Mechanism for steel. Section III considers models that

can be used to analyze dumping. The models of most relevance to the prac-

tices currently at issue in the steel industry seem to us models of oligo—

polistic rivalry in imperfectly competitive, segmented markets. We develop

a model designed to identify crucial factors upon which the incidence of

dumping will depend: the number of firms producing for each national market,

their costs, their market shares, and the extent to which they recognize

and exploit their mutual dependence. Finally, in Section IV we calibrate

these models to illustrate how the extent of dumping and the effects of the

TPM depend on the model's parameters.

          Few aspects of international economic relations are as contentious as

 the allegation of dumping and the enforcement of antidumping statutes.

Recently, attention has been focused on allegations by U.S. producers of foreign

violations of U.S. trade law, most notably in the steel sector. The controversy

surrounding these allegations clearly has focused the attention of foreign

governments, which have threatened to retaliate against the United States if

antidumping duties are assessed. To defuse a potentially explosive situation,

the U.S. has experimented with a new form of administered protection, the

Trigger Price Mechanism for steel, and made several formal and informal attempts

to negotiate orderly marceting arrangements with foreign governments and produ-

cers.

         Dumping   complaints certainly are not limited to steel. Indeed,   recent

allegations are notable for their catholicity: in the U.S. alone, dumping

complaints have ranged from trade in basic agricultural commodities to sophisti-

cated high technolor products, encompassing exports from developed and deve-

loping countries alike. Neither are dumping allegations new; by now such

complaints have been prevalent in the international steel trade for more than a

century. However, not since the 1920s, in the environment of mutual suspicion

and costly structural adjustment that followed the First World War, have these

allegations been so widespread. Indeed, dumping complaints and the use of anti—

dumping policies to protect industries claiming injury from "unfair competition"

are prototypical of the "new protectionism" of the post—Bretton Woods era. In

contrast to the operation of traditional trade restrictions, which typically

entails the imposition of specific or ad valorem tariffs at well—defined rates

or quotas at well—defined levels, the new protectionism is characterized by

trade restrictions administered on a contingent basis by complex bureaucracies
                                         —2—


exercising a considerable degree of discretion. Antidumping duties generally,

and the Trigger Price Mechanism in particular, can be seen as instances of this
                                               -

phenomenon.

           In   part, recent interest in U.S. antidumping policy has been stimulated

by changes in the popular connotation attached to the term "dumping." Under the

provisions of the U.S. Antiduinping Act of 1921, the primary definition of

dumping was export sales at a price below that of sales in the home market.

Following Viner (1923), economIsts generally adhered to this criterion, defining

dumping as price discrimination between national markets and explaining it with

familiar theories of monopolistic behavior. This definition encompasses both

the standard case of export prices below domestic prices and the opposite

configuration, known as "reverse dumping." However, the 1921 Antiduinping      Act
also included a provision to be invoked in the absence of comparable sales in

foreign markets. In such instances, dumping was said to occur when export

prices failed to cover a statutory measure of foreign producers' production

costs. Nearly half a century ago, Haberler (1937) noted that this "rival" defi-

nition had gained considerable currency. The 1974 U.S. Trade Act and 1979 Trade

Agreements Act further broadened the applicability of these constructed value

provisions. As dumping allegations increasingly have come to revolve around the

relation of prices to production costs, the literature has extended beyond

reasons for price discrimination to encompass also the motivation for sales at

prices that fail to cover costs (e.g., Ethier [1982], Davies and McGuinness

[1982]).

           In this paper, we analyze dumping from both theoretical and empirical

viewpoints.1 The paper is in four sections, which take     four   quite distinct

views of dumping and recent U.S. antidumping policies. Section I describes the
                                        —3—


evolution of U.S. antidumping policies, emphasizing the changing definition of

dumping and the development of administrative procedures. Section II focuses on

the application of these procedures to the international steel trade, taking as

a case study the most noteworthy of recent innovations: the Trigger Price

Mechanism (TPN). We analyze the administrative and procedural conventions that

caused the TPM to be attractive in the first place but contributed ultimately to

its demise, and we examine its economic effects. Given recent events, this ana-

lysis has the appearance of an extended postmortem, but we think it serves an

important function in illuminating some general principles about the effects of

administered protection.

           Section III formulates a model that can be used to analyze dumping. We

discuss both the "traditional" definition of dumping as price discrimination

among   national markets and the "modern" definition of du.mping as pricing below
costs. Evidence presented below indicates the presence of substantial price
discrimination persisting for extended periods in markets for steel products
such   as cold rolled sheet and concrete reinforcing bars. For this and other

reasons, in our theoretical and empirical analyses, we concentrate on the tradi-

tional definition of dumping as price discrimination in international trade.

Section IV of the paper calibrates the model and uses it to illustrate how the

extent of dumping and the TPM's effects depend on the model's parameters. The

final section presents some concluding remarks.


I. The Evolution of U.S. Antidumping Policies

          Current U.S. antidwuping statutes can be traced to the Antidumping

Act of 1921.2 The avowed purpose of the 1921 Act was to deter predatory pricing

in international trade in order to prevent foreign monopolization of domestic

ma&ets.3 Its provisions, as incorporated into the 1930 Tariff, remained little
                                      —4—


changed until the 1950's. The Secretary of the Treasury was to investigate

dumping complaints by comparing U.S. import prices with the "fair value" of

imports. Upon finding that fair value exceeded U.S. import prices, Treasury was

to calculate the difference, known as the dumping margin, and finding evidence

of material injury to U.S. producers to assess an antidumping duty. Measurement

of U.S. import prices was straightforward: the FOB factory sales price could be

used except when the transaction between foreign supplier and U.S. purchaser was

not at arm's length, in which case U.S. market price,   net   of import charges and

costs of transportation and preparation for the market,   could be substituted.
From the law's inception, the calculation of fair value was ambiguous, since the

concept was not defined by statute. From 1921 through 1954, Treasury used as a

standard for fair value a commodity's foreign market value or, in its absence,

constructed value. Foreign market value was a transactions price, preferably

observed in the exporter's home market but otherwise in third markets.

Constructed value was a complex measure made up of allowances for production

costs, costs of preparing the good for shipment, and statutory minima for

general expenses and profits.

         Before 1955, Treasury calculations of fair value and foreign market

value rarely proved problematic. Most dumping cases simply were disposed of on

the grounds that injury was absent or on the acceptance of price assurances. In

1954, however, an amendment to the Antidumping Act assigned responsibility for

determining injury to the Tariff Commission and instructed that injury decisions

be deferred pending the Treasury ruling that dumping was present, thereby sub-

jecting the Treasury decision to public scrutiny. In addition, the growth of

trade with centrally-planned economies for which market prices were not readily

observed increased Treasury's reliance on constructed value. Repeatedly,
                                      —5—




Treasury was forced to revise its procedures as new complications arose. On
several occasions between 1958 and 1974, antidumping regulations were modified

to bring them into conformance with established practice.

         The amendments to the Antidu.mping Act contained in the Trade Act of

1974 culminated this process of revision. Of greatest consequence was Section

205(b), which defined new circumstances under which the constructed value cri-

terion could be substituted for foreign maitet value.4 In instances where

sales "over an extended period of time and in substantial quantities" were made

in the foreign producer's home market at prices below costs of production,

those foreign inaitet prices were to be disregarded and constructed value calcu—

].ations were to be substituted. Ispite ambiguity about the meaning of "an

extended period" and "substantial quantities," this revision of the law repre-

sented a significant shift in the design of U.S. antidumping policies from an

emphasis on dumping as price discrimination to an emphasis on dumping as sales

below cost.

          The economic effects of the constructed value provisions in U.S.

antiduinping statutes have been the subject of considerable recent discussion.5

According to U.S. antidu.mping law, constructed value should be a guide to prices

which permit the recovery of raw material and fabrication costs, plus a ten per

cent minimum allowance for general expenses and an eight per cent minimum

allowance for profits.6 Other than the "extended period" clause, the Act makes

no provision for the profit margin to vary over the business cycle. Thus, the

law makes it difficult for firms to cut prices when market conditions are unfa-

vorable and increases the likelihood that marginal cost pricing during

recessions will be construed as dumping. Moreover, the eight per cent profit

allowance, which makes no provision for variations in corporate finance,
                                         —6—


requires a higher return on equity for firms with higher debt-equity ratios, and

the ten per cent allowance for general expenses makes no provision for

variations in cost structure.

          These provisions provided a considerable incentive for U.S. producers

to file antidumping suits. In the case of the steel industry, other factors

also contributed to the growing incidence of dumping complaints. The United

States had been a net importer of steel products since 1959, and by 1968 the

import share of the U.S. maiket had risen to nearly 17 per cent. In 1969 the

first of two successive voluntary restraint agreements with the European

Community and Japan went into effect. When the second of these agreements

expired in 1974, coincident with the end of the 1972—74 steel mazket boom, U.S.

producers pressed with growing vigor for further voluntary restraints, but

without success.7 From 1975 through 1977, the industry's position worsened:

three consecutive years of exceptionally low shipments by domestic producers

culminated in a serious profit squeeze. In 1977, the Carter Administration

suggested that the U.S. steel industry drop its campaign for quantitative import

restrictions in return for strict enforcement of the provisions of the 1974

Trade Act providing protection from unfair foreign competition. As the pro-

ceedings of the Gilmore case, filed in early 1977, seemed to indicate, this

approach was highly promising. When the industry initiated 23 dumping

complaints, the European Community threatened to retaliate against the U.S.,

while Treasury and the ITC were confronted by the difficulty of processing the

petitions within required time limits.

         The Administration had already established a Treasury task force to

study the problem. Its recommendations included a reference price system to

facilitate rapid initiation of steel dumping complaints.8 In the event that
                                        —7-


 steel was imported at a price below reference prices based upon the constructed

value of Japanese steel (Japan being assumed the world's most efficient

producer), a Treasury dumping investigation automatically would be triggered.

Hence the term "Trigger Price Mechanism." Claiming insufficient resources both

to administer the TPM and to investigate independent dumping complaints,

Treasury warned the industry that the TPM would be maintained only so long as

producers   refrained from filing antidumping petitions. Eventually, the steel
industry complied and withdrew most of its complaints.
         The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 represented an attempt to limit the

discretion of administrative authorities, to enhance the prospect of relief for

petitioners, and to strengthen opportunities for judicial review. Title I of

the 1979 Act replaced the Antidumping Act of 1921. Its central provisions shor-

tened the time limits within which an antidumping determination must be reached.

Under the new law, the preliminary determination of less than fair value sales

must come within 140 or 190 days of the initiation of an investigation,

depending on a case's complexity. This compares with 180 or 270 days under pre-

vious law. In exceptional circumstances, the preliminary determination now may

be announced within 90 days.9

            In addition to these changes, the 1979 Act marks the continued ascen-

dancy of the constructed value criterion. Previously, when price comparisons

with the exporters' home market were appropriate but impossible, the authorities

were permitted to use constructed value only when price comparisons with third

country markets were infeasible. Under the 1979 Act, they are allowed further

discretion in the use of either third country or constructed value comparisons.

Although Treasury initially was instructed to continue its use of third market

comparisons wherever possible, Commerce now has the option of using constructed
                                        -8-


value not just when there is evidence that sales fail to cover costs "over an

extended period of time and in substantial quantities," but whenever necessary

to meet the shortened time limits.10 Even the possibility that constructed value

calculations might be substituted for third market comparisons has elicitied

objections from U.S. importers and foreign producers.1 1

         Once again, the modifications in the new Act provided an inducement to

file antidurnping petitions. In March of 1980, the U.S. Steel Corporation filed

a major dumping complaint against European producers, leading to the suspension

of the TPM. This and subsequent petitions eventually were withdrawn after a new

set of trigger prices was adopted in October. However, this second

understanding was even less durable than the first. In January 1982, the steel

industry lodged a new round of 132 complaints under the provisions of both coun-

tervailing duty and antidumping statutes, marking the second suspension and

apparently the demise of the TPM.

         In summary, the evolution of U.S. antidu.rnping policies can be seen as a

response to economic and administrative exigencies. As markets have grown

increasingly   integrated, criteria and procedures for determining dumping have
been modified to expedite the decision—making process. Statutory and procedural
changes have led   to growing dependence on the constructed value criterion for

dumping. Thssatisfaction with earlier procedures has provided the impetus to

reduce the discretion of administrative agencies and to place greater reliance

on legalistic procedures, leaving less room for negotiated solutions and

encouraging the emergence of adversarial relationships. The Trigger Price

Mechanism provides a clear illustration of these phenomena.


II. The Trigger Price Mechanism

         The TPM was based on the following principles:    (1) Treasury was to
                                       —9—


calculate for each product the average cost of production in Japan, which was

taken as the world's most efficient producer. (2) Customs was to collect and

analyze data on production costs and prices in major steel—exporting countries

and to monitor imports by means of a Special Invoice for steel products,

alerting Treasury of substantial or repeated shipments below trigger prices.

(3) In such instances, Treasury was to initiate an antidumping investigation

without waiting to receive a complaint.      (4) While officially the TPM did not

prevent domestic producers from exercising their rights under U.S. trade law, in

fact the TPM was based on an understanding that existing dumping complaints

would be dropped and no major new ones would be initiated.      (5) Equally, the TPN

did not prevent foreign producers from exercising their rights under U.S. anti—

dumping statutes. Preclearance (assurance that exports under trigger price

levels would not lead to the initiation of antidumping procedures) would be

granted if they demonstrated that prices were not below fair value.     (6) If

sales at less than fair value were found and injury was established, counter-

vailing duties were imposed on all shipments of the product by the offending

producer. The level of the duty was determined by the difference between either

foreign market price or constructed value and U.S. market price; that is,

without reference to trigger prices.

         The trigger price for each product was made up of three components: a

"base price" for each product category, "extras," and transport charges. The

base price reflected estimates of average cost of production in Japan.

Treasury, and later Commerce, based their average cost estimates on confidential

data supplied by MITI. To base prices, "extras" were added to account for addi-

tional costs associated with specifications for width, thickness, ôhemistry or

surface preparation which differed from the base product. To these figures were
                                      -10-


added transport costs, including charges for Japanese inland freight, loading,

ocean freight, insurance and wharfage. These charges differed for East Coast,

Gulf Coast, Pacific Coast and Great Lakes shipments. Importer's sales com-

missions were excluded, since trigger prices were based on cost to importers,

assuming that transactions were at arm's—length. If the importer was related to

the exporter of the steelmill product and the transfer price did not reflect an

arm's—length transaction, then the first sales price by the importer to an unre-

lated U.S. buyer was compared with the trigger price.

         Trigger prices were calculated in dollars per metric ton (2,205 lbs) or

net ton (2,000 lbs), with quarterly adjustments for changes in estimated produc-

tion costs, transport charges and yen-dollar exchange rates. To provide the

authorities with some discretion in light of the extent of exchange rate fluc-

tuations, a five per cent "flexibility band" was introduced to permit trigger

prices to fluctuate around landed cost estimates. With the reinstatement of the

TPM in 1980, the preclearance procedure and the exchange rate conversion factor

were altered, and an "antisurge" provision was added, setting quantitative rules

for a special review of imports in periods when steel imports were increasing

and domestic capacity utilization was low.12


    A. Calculating Trigger Prices

         Calculating Japanese production costs is a difficult task. (A repre-

sentative estimate is shown in Table 1.) We focus on four problematic aspects

of the cost calculation: estimating normal capacity utilization rates, adding an

allowance for profits, estimating yield ratios, and converting costs in yen into

trigger prices in dollars.

        Estimates of normal capacity utilization rates mattered for calculating

Japanese costs because the fixed cost component of total costs was divided by
                      Table 1

       Estimated Japanese Cost of Production
      (19811V, $/metric ton finished product)

Basic raw materials                          166.60

normal capacity utilization rather than current capacity utilization in

constructing fixed costs per ton of production. For the second and third quar-

ters of 1978, cost estimates were based on an 85 per cent capacity utilization

rate, the average for Japanese facilities over the previous 20 years. In

19781V, Treasury switched to the average operating rate over the previous five

years. Given Japan's relatively low capacity utilization rates in the

mid—1970s, this change raised trigger prices by approximately $18 per net ton.13

This effect became even more   significant as    the high capacity   utilization years
1973-74 left    the five—year reference period. Capacity utilization assumptions
significantly   affected estimated Japanese costs because not only 90 per cent of

depreciation and 75 per cent of interest expenses but 50 per cent of labor costs

and other expenses were included in fixed costs.

           In accordance with U.S. trade law, under the TPM an allowance for nor-

mal profits was added to Japanese costs in the amount of eight per cent of raw

material costs, labor costs and other expenses. Like fixed costs, this

allowance was divided by normal capacity utilization rather than actual capacity

utilization   in calculating profits per ton of production. Compared to the
constructed value provision of U.S. antiduinping law, there was little tendency
for    the profit margin to rise as the level of activity declined. However, this

provision still prevented foreign firms   from   emulating their domestic com-

petitors by reducing their maiups and accepting lower profit margins in periods

of   stagnant demand.
           The production cost data submitted by TI was based on an 86.5 per
cent   yield ratio (tons of finished steel per ton of crude steel). U.S. produ-

cers, whose older facilities generated lower yields, claimed that some of the

products that were regarded as finished by the Japanese were scrap by U.S.
                                          —12—



standards.     Consequently, the 86.5 per cent yield was lowered to 80 per cent.

Only from 19781V, after a mission by     the   Steel Task Force to Japan, was the

extent    of Japanese superiority in steel processing and finishing recognized and
incorporated into higher yield ratios of 82.7 per cent and into higher yield
credits, together reducing estimated Japanese costs      by   as much as $15 per net
ton. 14
            While   trigger prices were expressed in dollars, production costs, with

exception of most raw materials, were denominated in yen. Since exchange rates

were considerably more variable than production costs, initially yen were con-

verted to dollars using a 60-day average exchange rate for the period prior to

announcement of the current quarter's trigger prices. After reinstatement, this

60—day average was replaced by a 36-month moving average "to minimize the impact

of exchange rate fluctuations on TFM levels."15 This change in the exchange

rates used to convert yen to dollars significantly affected trigger price
levels.16
           Table   2 illustrates the extent to which exchange rate conversion fac-

tors affected estimated Japanese production costs. For example, had Japanese

production costs been based on current exchange rates, the average base price

would have fallen from $395 in 19781V to $356 in 19791V instead of rising by

$16 over the period. Had a 36—month average been used in this period, it is

likely that the TPM would have been stillborn, because the first base price

would have been $293 instead of $328, a difference of 11 per cent.

           In the first year of the TPM, the base price rose 18 per cent, not

withstanding a 2.8 per cent downward adjustment under flexibility band provi-

sions. This rise was almost exclusively attributable to appreciation of the

yen. It is not surprising that a one-year review of the TPM by the Steel
                                                                            Table 2

1.  Average exchange rate for the quarter.
2. The 60—day average was based on a period which terminated between one and
      two months before the quarter's start. In calculating the 60—day average
      exchange rate applied to a quarter, we average the exchange rate for the
      first two months of the previous quarter.
3.    Average of 36 months terminating two months before the quarter's start.
4.   Base prices, which are for illustrative purposes only, do not include
      "extras," transport costs and importation charges.
5.   Japanese production cost estimates may differ from base trigger prices due
      to use of the flexibility band. A "plus" indicates an upward adjustment due
      to the flexibility band.
6.   For purposes of these calculations, base prices are corrected for flexibi-
      lity band effects. One—third of Japanese costs are assumed to be expressed
      in dollars to allow for dollar—denominated raw material imports.

Tripartite Comniittee regarded it a highly successful mechanism.1? In 19791 the

yen began its steep decline which was reflected in trigger prices beginning with

197911. Rising Japanese production costs were almost entirely offset by the

higher yen/dollar exchange rate:   the 19801 base price was less than two per

cent above its 19791 level. Again, it is not surprising that the U.S. industry

grew increasingly dissatisfied with the TPM's operation. The U.S. Steel Co.

filed its March 1980 antidumping suits in reaction to these develonents more

than anything else.18 Thus, exchange rate fluctuations play a major role in

explaining the suspension of the TPM.

         Following reinstatement, the 36—month average was substituted for the

60—day average. This reduced the risk that further depreciation of the yen

would reduce base prices in the immediate future. The choice of exchange rate

conversion factor had major implications. The most extreme instance was in

19791, when the difference under the two exchange rate conversion factors was 20

per cent. If, in the first two years of the TPM, a 36-month average had been

used, Japanese production costs in dollars would have been 12 per cent lower on

average. In contrast, following the reinstatement of the TPM, the difference

under the two methods was comparatively small.

         The TPM's first suspension was partly the result of the depreciation of

the yen and the strength of the dollar; its second suspension and demise were

partly a consequence of inflation in the U.S. combined with stable Japanese pro-

duction costs, in yen, and a virtually constant 36—month average exchange rate.

At the same time, fluctuations of the European currencies against the dollar and

the yen contributed to disintegration of the second stage of the TPM.

Appreciation of the yen against most European currencies increased European

producers' ability to export below trigger prices (see Table 3). Although the

impact of these exchange rate changes was mitigated to some extent by raw

material prices quoted in dollars, it resulted in a proliferation of

preclearance requests by European producers; for example, preclearance proce-

dures on behalf of Hoogovens of the Netherlands indicated that they were in fact

capable of exporting under trigger prices without exporting below fair value.

With the realization that prospects for extensive antiduinping actions were dim,

the U.S. industry's focus shifted increasingly to the issue of foreign govern-

mental subsidization, and the TPM's days were numbered.


     B. Economic Implications of the TPM

         The shipping cost of Japanese exports to the U.S. differs substantially

by region (see Table 4). Since different trigger prices were calculated by

region, owing to differences in Japanese transport costs and related factors,

the system significantly distorted established trade and production patterns.

The use of Japanese transport costs in the calculation of trigger prices

reversed the traditional geographic relationship of relatively low Great Lakes

prices to relatively high West Coast prices.19 The implications for foreign pro-

ducers, other than the Japanese, depended on whether their major export maxket

was the East Coast and Great Lakes or the Gulf Coast and the West. Regional

differences in trigger prices penalized European producers whose markets were in

the East relative to those whose markets were in the West. The effects were

analogous for domestic firnis West Coast producers were penalized relative to

East Coast and Great Lakes producers, since they faced lower priced import com-

petition. Both the 30 per cent rise in imports on the Pacific Coast between

1977 and 1978, in a period when imports into the Great Lakes region were

declining by 15 per cent, and the losses experienced by Kaiser Steel, a leading

West Coast producer, in an otherwise profitable year may have reflected these

phenomena.20 Similarly, domestic steel—using industries in Ohio were put at a

disadvantage relative to their competitors in California and the Southwest.

European opposition to generous trigger prices in their major regional maitets

led Treasury to adjust downward the freight allowance to the Great Lakes, but

distortions of established trade patterns remained.

         In addition to regional price differentials, the product mix of imports

was altered by the TPM. For some products, differences between trigger prices

and U.S. mill list prices were substantial, while for others they were minor.

Compare the margins (which disregard American discounting) reported in Table 5.

A comparison of trigger prices and American list prices suggests that the

trigger price-list price differential varied substantially. Foreign producers

specializing in relatively sophisticated, expensive products objected most

strenuously to large positive differentials.

         Another effect was a shift by foreign producers to the sale of fabri-

cated steel products which were exempt initially from the TPM. Imports of

fabricated standard shapes were 71 per cent higher in December 1978 than in the

previous year. In contrast to large increases in the price of basic steel pro-

ducts, the prices of TPM—exempt fabricated standard shapes increased on average

by only 3.5 per cent from the previous year.21 The wire and wire rod segment of

the market provided a graphic example of incomplete coverage:   the fact that

initially the TPM covered wire processors' inputs but not their outputs led them

to complain of negative effective rates of protection. Subsequent extensions of

the TPN's coverage from 65 per cent of imports initially to 85 per cent in

197911 reflected the Administration's recognition of this problem.

product, independent of origin, affects all foreign suppliers similarly only if

products are homogeneous. In fact, there are significant quality differences in

products which appear superficially to be homogeneous.22 Prior to the TPM,

foreign suppliers of low quality steel could use low prices to compete with

suppliers of higher quality products. This was more difficult under the TPM,

which tended, other things equal, to divert trade from suppliers of low—quality

steel to suppliers of high—quality products.

         In theory, the TPM was based on prices charged by exporters to unre—

lated U.S. customers, or by related importers to subsequent unrelated customers.

However, when the exporting and importing companies were related, the proper

measure of compliance often was difficult to observe. tbmestic customers could

delegate steel purchases to a foreign branch or open an offshore trading firm to

buy foreign steel below trigger prices and export it to the U.S. above trigger

prices. Similarly, foreign producers with downstream investments in steel pro-

cessing in the U.S. could respect trigger prices in sales to U.S. subsidiaries,

merely transfering profits from the U.S. subsidiary to the foreign base without

affecting any physical transactions. The rise of related party transactions

from 40 to 60 per cent of total imports in the first year of the TPM is

suggestive of the extent of these practices.23   in response, Commerce changed

its related party monitoring procedures to include an ex mill price monitoring

policy and new rules to evaluate unrelated resale prices.

         Economic considerations provided importers and exporters with obvious

incentives to circumvent the Customs Bureau's policing mechanism. The indict-

ment of the Japanese trading company, Mitsui, for defrauding the United States

provides an indication of the techniques available to an importer.24 To circum-

vent the TPM and the Antidumping Act, Mitsui admitted to having reported falsely

inflated invoice prices and to having reduced actual payments by customers by
                                         —17—


arranging false contract cancellation confirmations, which entitled the customer

to cancellation penalties; by providing refunds for false damage claims, inispro—

ductions or other debit memoranda; by paying commissions to a foreign parent

company   of an   American customer; and by making   "currency   adjustment" payments

based   on a secret "yen/dollar exchange rate agreement." It also admitted to

predating   contracts to shift the apparent sales date into the period when the
TPN was suspended.

          We have no way of estimating the prevalence of such practices, but it

is clear that insuring compliance is one of the major problems confronting

architects of schemes for administered protection such as the TPM. To

understand these problems better, it may help to look more closely at the moti-

vation for dumping itself.


III. Nodels of Dumping

          Although a number of explanations for dumping, defined either as price

discrimination in international trade or as sales below costs of production, are

current in policy circles, few of these arguments have been subjected to formal

analysis. In this section, we first review the popular explanations, starting

with the "modern" definition of dumping as sales below costs of production,

before proceeding to the alternative definition of the practice as international

price discrimination. Finally, we present a theoretical model of what seems to

us a particularly important explanation for dumping in the international steel

trade: international differences in industry structure and conduct in imper-

fectly competitive, segmented markets.

          Until recently, there have been few formal models of reasons why firms

may persist in exporting at prices below production costs. It is well known, of

course, that in perfectly competitive markets where firms         equate   price with
                                      -18-


marginal cost, it may be optimal to continue operating at a loss during periods

of depressed demand so long as revenues cover variable costs. However, this

does not seem to be quite what those who criticize sales below costs have in

mind. Rather, they seem to be objecting to practices which imply that firms

have departed from their cost curves and are engaged in questionable practices,

possibly predatory in nature. Ethier (1982) has presented a model in which

competitive firms not only export at prices below costs but appear to depart

from their supply curves when demand is unusually depressed. He assumes that

firms are constrained to negotiate wage contracts before the state of demand is

known, and that they are incapable of responding to a demand Bhortfall by rene-

gotiating wages. Their only option is to lay off laborers whose contracts can

be terminated. Since they are not permitted to accumulate inventories, firms

may have no choice but to sell output at prices below average cost when demand

is unfavorable. The unique feature of the model is that there are circumstances

in which it is optimal for firms to practice restraint in laying off woikers

even when labor's wage exceeds its marginal product. Ethier assumes that

employers and employees share knowledge of the shape of the wage—employment

tradeoffs Firms which retain some workers when demand is depressed despite the

fact that labor's wage exceeds its marginal product are able to pay lower wages,

other things being equal, when demand is buoyant. Thus, firms engage in prac-

tices that bear little resemblance to a strater of minimizing losses in the

face of fixed costs and that can be construed as predatory dumping. In fact,

they are merely acting in their preceived long—run interest, given conditions in

factor and product maxcets.

         Other explanations for the persistence of pricing below apparent

variable costs are based upon dynamic considerations. In Eichengreen (1982) we
                                          —19—


 analyze several dynamic models. We formalize the claim that firms dump inter-

mittently to attract other firm's loyal customers, referred to by Stegemann

 (1980) as the "short—sighted buyer" argument. The firm's problem is formulated

in standard dynamic optimization terms, where the number of customers to whom it

can   sell   is a slowly adjusting variable which depends on the firm's past pricing

policy. In response to disturbances, the firm may find it optimal to reduce

price below variable cost in order to augment its stoc of customers. At each

point in time, the firm equates current marginal cost with marginal revenue from

current sales plus the present value of future sales to customers acquired as a

result of current pricing policy. This practice, which in fact equates marginal

cost with shadow marginal revenue, resembles dumping nonetheless.

             We also formalize the argument that finns may price below the standard

markup and perhaps below current variable cost in periods of depressed demand

due to additional costs of adjusting •the level of production.    Again, the dyna-

mic optimization problem is standard, except that we include an adjustment cost

term, specified as an increasing function of the percentage change in output.

The optimal response to a permanent decline in demand is fairly intuitive. As

the unanticipated demand shortfall occurs, the firm must sharply reduce its

price, since it is costly to cut production in response to the exogenous decline

in demand. Over time, the firm reduces production at the optimal rate, given

adjustment costs, permitting it to increase the price charged for its output.

Although the firm is simply equating marginal revenue with shadow marginal cost,

the initial price cut again resembles dumping.

         Another popular dynamic argument is that dumping results from firms'

concern with the economics of learning—by—doing. If firms wish to move down

their learning curves, they may sell output at prices where current marginal
                                         - 20.-


costs are less than current marginal revenues. If higher output now reduces

costs of production later, then the solution to a firm's dynamic optimization

problem is to set current marginal cost equal to the sum of current marginal

revenue plus the present value of the indirect saving on future production

costs. Spence (1981) has analyzed this problem for the closed economy, and

Krugman (1982) has extended the analysis to the case of international com-

petition.

            The other explanations for dumping we have labelled the "traditional"

view. In textbos, dumping is explained as price discrimination between

national markets by foreign producers facing a price elasticity of demand in the

export market that exceeds the price elasticity of demand in their own martet.25

Permitting foreign suppliers to discriminate in favor of domestic consumers

reduces the surplus captured by domestic rivals but by less than the increase in

the surplus captured by domestic consumers. ]mestic competitors have an incen-

tive to lobby for restrictions on price discrimination by foreign suppliers,

while policymakers se&ing to maximize national welfare have an incentive to



         A limitation of the textbook explanation of dumping as monopolistic

price discrimination is that different price elasticities of demand are assumed

to arise arbitrarily from taste differences among residents of home and foreign

countries. As Brander and Krugman (1981) note, this explanation provides little

guidance as to instances when we should expect to observe dumping rather than

reverse dumping or no price discrimination at all.

         We proceed by analyzing the textbock explanation for dumping as price

discrimination in international trade. However, instead of assuming arbitrary

differences in demand, we emphasize systematic differences in supply.
                                       —21—


Specifically, we focus on aspects of market structure and conduct which can lead

to price discrimination in favor of overseas customers. To highlight these fac-

tors, we assume, until explicitly stated to the contrary, that commodity demands

in the home and foreign countries are identical. Thus, dumping cannot arise

from arbitrary differences in tastes. To further simplify the exposition, we

assume throughout the theoretical analysis that the common price elasticity of

demand       is constant and exceeds one in absolute value.

         We analyze a model made up of two regions (or "countries"): the

importing   and exporting, or domestic and foreign, countries. As the nomencla-

ture suggests, the model does not admit of trade—pattern reversals or two—way

trade in identical products. It is necessary to rule out re—exports by assump-

tion, for in their presence price discrimination (net of transport costs) is

impossible. Any one of several restrictions is sufficient to preclude this

possibility; for simplicity we assume that the exporting country's market iB

protected by prohibitive trade restrictions. We consider a number of specific

market structures under which dumping may occur. Market structure is taken as

parametric in that entry and exit are not permitted. Models of dumping as entry

deterrence are considered in Eichengreen (1982), but such considerations are

omitted here as not being essential to a relatively short run analysis of the

steel industry.

            The implication of the analysis is the same in each case: dumping will

occur when firms producing for sale to customers in the importing country find

it relatively difficult to restrict output to the joint—profit—maximizing level.

The incidence of dumping will depend on the number of firms producing for each

national market, their costs, their market shares, and the degree to which they

recognize and exploit their mutual dependence.

C (ce) is total cost of domestic (foreign) firms.27 Asterisks denote foreign

and X1 and    x are foreign firm i's production for the domestic and foreign

markets, respectively. The constant variable cost assumption is dispensible,

but it makes for expository simplicity. Its realism is addressed below.

         The industry in each country is comprised of a small number of oligopo—

listic rivals. Initially, we assume that all such firms abide by the Cournot

rule, setting quantities under the assumption that rivals' supplies to each

market are fixed. There are a variety of richer strategies available to the

firm, but this assumption provides a reasonable starting point. Here and below,

we consistently assume that second order and stability conditions are satisfied.

Each firm maximizes profits n(ir*) subject to its rivals' behavior. It is

possible that firms owned or operated by government agencies pursue other objec-

tives, but we restrict our attention here to the implications of profit maximi-

zation. For a representative foreign firm:

the ratio of foreign to domestic prices (the "dumping ratio") is:

               p       c   s_H*

Here c is a share-weighted average of variable costs for firms selling to the

domestic market, and H is the Herfindahl Index of domestic sales concentration,

defined over both domestic and foreign firms. Note that the Herfindahl Index

measures the extent to which sales to customers in a given country (as distinct

from production by firms located in that country) are concentrated among a small

number of rivals. The first term in (6) indicates that price will be lower in

the market where on average suppliers produce subject to lower variable costs.

The second term in (6) indicates that the domestic price/cost ratio will be

lower than the foreign one when the domestic market is less concentrated than

the foreign market as measured by the Herfindahi Index. The greater the degree

of concentration in sales, the closer the oligopolists are able to approach the

joint-profit—maximizing solution.

         The intuition for this result is apparent. Equation (3), from which

the dumping ratio is derived, indicates that the firm sets perceived marginal

revenue equal to marginal cost. Perceived marginal revenue depends not only on

market price and market elasticity of demand but in addition on the individual

firm's market share. A smaller market share increases the elasticity of the

firm's perceived marginal revenue function by reducing its loss of revenue on

inframarginal sales.

        A special case is where all firms produce subject to identical costs.

In this case, all firms selling in a particular market have identical market

shares, and the Herfindahi Index is simply that number of firms raised to the

second power. Thimping occurs when more firms produce for sale to the domestic
                                                          —25—


market than to the foreign one, which is necessarily the case in this instance

given our other assumptions. The sales of each domestic firm are z/m, so pro-

fits of each firm are [p(z)—c]z/m —                      F.   Thus, while our model focuses on the

price discrimination definition of dumping, it is compatable with the sales

below cost criterion analyzed by Ethier (1982) and others, for it is entirely

possible in our model for profits to be negative during periods of depressed

demand.

          It is straightforward to generalize the dumping ratio to allow firms to

anticipate the reactions of rivals and to introduce a competitive fringe in each

marcet. To introduce the fringe firms, define:

Multiplying by        (or by x1/z) and summing over firms producing for the

where H is the truncated Herfindahl Index for the k + a    —   n   largest firms

selling to the domestic maitet, and 6 is the conjectural variation on rivals'

domestic sales.3° The dumping ratio is:



              _  P   C
                           E —H(1 +6)

where H* is the truncated Herfindahi Index for foreign firms, defined over

shares of foreign sales, and 6* is the conjectural variation on foreign rivals'

foreign sales. Thus, the dumping ratio depends on costs, on maitet demand

elasticities, and on (truncated) Herfindahl Indices, now adjusted for conjec-

tural variations. The dumping ratio is a decreasing function of the conjectural

variation in the domestic market, since the larger the conjectural variation,

the greater the perceived threat of retaliation by rivals to an individual

firm's price reduction.

price of home output in the domestic market, and p is the price of foreign

output in the domestic market. For simplicity of exposition, we retain the

assumption that the foreign market is closed to imports; thus '                                          = p*(x*)       .   It

For algebraic simplicity, we again assume that each domestic oligopolist's con-

jecture about the reaction of each domestic rival is identical. It is con-

venient to impose two further assumptions: that each domestic oligopolist makes

the   same conjecture about the response of foreign suppliers to a percentage


change in its output ( = —p---                         is the same     for   all q) , and that each domes—

H   is the truncated Herfindahi Index for the s—n largest domestic firms, and

and the ratio of imported to domestic steel prices is:



             p =    c            e'(l +      a)      —
                                                          H(1      +   6)

where H* (H**) is the truncated Herfindahl Index defined over shares of sales of

the k largest foreign firms in the domestic (foreign) maxtet. Again, the

dumping ratio depends on (truncated) Herfindahl Indices adjusted for conjectural

variations. The ratio p/p' is a decreasing function of the conjectural

variation in the domestic market, since the larger the conjectural variation,

the greater the extent of retaliation anticipated by firms contemplating a price

reduction. Now however, the dumping ratio also depends on market demand elasti-

cities adjusted for the effects of a •                         a       reflects foreign firms' estimates

of the substitutability of national outputs x and foreign firms' conjectures
 on their domestic rivals reactions to import price cuts 'V                .    The larger foreign
 firm8'   conjectures   on the reaction of domestic firms to an import price reduc-

tion, the less the temptation to cut prices.

             The welfare effects of antidumping actions are illustrated in Figure

1, with zero subscripts denoting initial prices and quantities. We consider the

case where domestic and foreign outputs are imperfect substitutes for one

another and analyze the effects of an antidumping action which effectively pla-

ces a floor p1 beneath the price of imports. Income effects are neglected

throughout. Before any antidumping action, there is a distortion in each maiket

due to the presence of imperfect competition. When the price of the importable

is raised from p0 to p1, rents accruing to foreign suppliers change by areas

E—B. E-B may be positive, in part since foreign producers were incapable pre-

viously of restricting output to joint-profit—maximizing levels. Even in this

case, however, foreigners may object to antiduinping initiatives, since under the

assumptions of the model any one foreign producer expects to increase its pro-

fits by expanding supply and driving down prices. It is possible for E—B to be

negative if P1-p0 is large and if the demand for imports is depressed suf-

ficiently below the joint—profit—maximizing level.

            The rise in the price of imports shifts the demand curve for domestic

output to the right. However, due to our assumption of a constant demand

elasticity and no change in firms' conjectures, domestic producers do not raise

prices in response to the shift in domestic demand. In this model, if domestic

rents are zero initially, they remain zero. In this case import restraints do

not increase the profitability of domestic production, and domestic producers

derive little if any benefit from the imposition of antidumping duties or simi-

lar trade restrictions. In general, the change in domestic rents equals F+Q.

            The implications for domestic consumers are straightforward.

 Consumers suffer a loss of surplus in the market for x amounting to areas C+E.

Since the marginal utility of y equals the price consumers pay, there is rio

change   in consumer surplus in the market for domestic steel.
            To measure the welfare loss associated with an antidunping action
which raises the price of x from
                                          P0 to p1, we employ Harberger's (1974) standard

quantity   demanded, and T. is the distortion due to the divergence of price from

marginal cost. The first term     in      this summation approximates area C in the top

panel of Figure 1.            approximates areas F+G—B. B is the extra loss in the

market for x due to the presence of a previous distortion also working to

restrict demand. F+G is the welfare gain in the market for y, since raising the

price of imports stimulates demand for another good whose production is

depressed by the presence of second distortion. Thus, for the welfare loss we

have the expression —w = (B+C) — (F+G).


IV. Some Numerical Estimates

           In this section, we calibrate the model of Section III in order to

illustrate how the extent of dumping and the TPM's effects depend on the model's

parameters. We calibrate the model for 1979, the latest year for which the

necessary data is available and the TPM was in effect. Readers familiar with

previous efforts along these lines will note the resemblance of our approach to

those of Crandall (1981) and Tarr (1982a). Our framework differs from theirs,

however, in that we highlight the presence of imperfect competition.

         One way to proceed is to estimate pricing equations with time series

data. The results of the previous section indicate that the dumping ratio

should be a function of the market demand elasticities, Herfindahl Indices, and
                                          —31—


 conjectural variations. Using time series methods to estimate this relationship

 is appealing, but in this instance there are a number of impediments to imple-

 menting this approach. Consistent time series on the value and volume of pre-

 cisely defined categories of European steel exports can be constructed only from

 1960 or 1966. The small size of the sample is problematic when the pricing

equation is nonlinear, as is the case in Section III. A further difficulty is

 that certain variables of interest, such as the conjectural variation, are

unobservable. While the use of proxies is feasible, it is unlikely in practice

to yield definitive conclusions. In preference to time series estimation, we

choose to examine what data are available and to use them as a basis for

calibrating the model. The parameter values irnp'sed are best thought of as

informed guesses of the relevant magnitudes. Given that our model is highly

simplified and our parameter values certainly are not above dispute, we would

prefer our estimates to be viewed as numerical illustrations of how the extent

of dumping and the TPM's effects depend on particular parameters.


        A. Data

           A number of sources provide information on the domestic and foreign

prices of steel products. However, there are difficult and well—known problems

in establishing a concordance between U.S. statistics and those of other

nations. In this section we examine data on the price of European steel exports

to the U.S. relative to the price of the same goods in Europe, since European

producers were among the exporters most heavily affected by U.S. trigger prices.

While official base prices for European steel products are readily available,

the prevalence of discounting in the European steel maiet renders them a poor

proxy   for transactions prices. We choose instead to examine unit value figureS
derived   from   international trade statistics. Thus, for the price of European
                                        — 32—




steel in Europe, we use unit values of intra—E.C, trade. By implication, we

neglect discounting by European producers in sales to their favored domestic

customers. Unit values are themselves imperfect proxies for transactions

prices; a number of authors have shown that changes in calculated unit values

tend to lag behind changes in transactions prices. While this problem should be

borne in mind, it is more important in other applications than when trade

figures are annual totals and when one set of unit values is deflated by

another.

           Calculated unit values for European exports have been employed pre-

viously by Tarr (1979, 1982b) and Takacs (1982). However, their figures are not

appropriate for our purposes, since they do not distinguish European exports to

the U.S. from European exports bound for other destinations. Our figures for

unit values of European steel exports to the U.S. and intra—E.C. steel trade,

drawn from the E.C. 'a Analytical Tables of Foreign Trade, are available at a low

level of aggregation, permitting us to present statistics for relatively homoge-

neous product categories. For example, we consider only concrete reinforcing

bars,   eliminating other bars from that category, and remove hot rolled sheet and
plate from   the figures for sheet and plate less than 3   mm. used   by   Tarr and
Takacs.    While product—mix effects may not be eliminated entirely, their

influence should be minimized by our use of narrow product catagories.

           Table 6 presents the ratio of domestic to export prices for four cate-

gories of European steel products: rails, wire rod, concrete reinforcing bars

and cold rolled sheet. The dumping ratios exhibit a striking degree of

variation. Regressing the unit value of exports destined for the U.S. on a

constant term and the intra—E.C. export unit value leads in every case to rejec-

tion of the joint hypothesis of a zero constant and a slope coefficient of

differentials of up to 40 per cent reported by Kravis and Lipsey (1977) for

German—American trade in bars and in tube and pipe fittings.


     B. Dumping Ratios

            Our calculated dumping ratios will differ greatly depending on whether

U.S. and imported steel products are treated as perfect or imperfect substitu-

tes. Evidence on this issue is far from conclusive. Many carbon steel products

appear undifferentiated —        concrete reinforcing bars being perhaps the best
instance in our sample. At the same time, as noted in Section II, subtle

quality differences are cited frequently in studies of import penetration. The

imperfect substitutes assumption is supported by all recent empirical studies,

so we adopt it here.

            Prices are assumed to be set in accordance with a generalized version

of (ii').     For European     steel:




               =       •
                               c(1   +   *)   —
                                                  H*(1       +   s)
                                                                                            (12
                   C       C   C - H*x*(1         +   *)
In contrast to (ii'), marcet demand elasticities                      (ce) are allowed to differ,

and we consider standard Herfindahi Indices. For price elasticities of demand,

we draw on worc by Stone (1979). For iron and steel semi—manufactures, Stone

reports import demand elasticities of 2.83 and 1.66 for the U.S. and E.C.

respectively. We use 1.66 as the maiket demand elasticity for Europe and 2.83

as the own—price elasticity of demand in U.S. import demand functions.

           In constructing Herfindahl Indices, we treat each national European

industry as a joint—profit maximizer. While it is a drastic simplification, we

impose this assumption in recognition of the extent of nationalization and per—
                                       —34—


vasive government involvement in the various national industries. Thus, the

Herfindahl Indices measure the extent to which sales by European producers,

either to the U.S. ma&et or within the E.C., are concentrated nationally. For

1979 values for H and H, calculated as in Table 6 and weighted by product

shares are .335 and .215 respectively. Relaxing the assumption of joint profit

maximization would tend to lower the Herfindahl indices and reduce the price—

cost margins. For the conjectural variations, we consider the Cournot and

constant market share values of zero and unity. a* is calibrated at 0 and

—0.1. In the absence of contrary evidence, we set c/c to to unity.

         The dumping ratios for 1979 generated by equation (12) are presented in

Table 7. For the parameter values considered, the dumping ratio falls within

the range of values appearing in Table 6.


     C. The TPM's Effects

         For purposes of our calculations, it is necessary to consider the

supply response of Japan and other exporting nations against whom the TPM was

not primarily directed. If, for example, trigger prices restrict exports by the

E.C. and other suppliers whose costs are high relative to those in Japan, the

incipient change in U.S. import prices may elicit increased exports by suppliers

whose costs are relatively low. The effects will be smaller the larger the

supply response of the so—called "restrained suppliers," to use the terminology

of Tarr (1982a).32 In our view, while restrained suppliers possessed con-

siderable excess capacity both prior to and in the period of the TPM, they

resisted the temptation to increase exports to the U.S. Hence, we assume no

supply response by restrained suppliers to the imposition of trigger prices. In

the welfare calculations that follow, we treat their supply curves as inelastic

and their maiets as undistorted. In this and other respects, our analysis is

partial    equilibrium.

           In what follows, we distinguish three categories of steel:   steel pro-

duced domestically, steel imported from Europe, and steel imported from other

countries. Each of our demand functions has their three respective prices as

arguments. As a first approximation, we treat foreign producers other than

European as restrained suppliers.

            We model the TPM as simply placing a floor under the price of U.S.

imports at the 1979 average trigger price of $350 per net ton. Thus, we neglect

problems of non—compliance and related complications discussed in Section II.

To quantify the TPN's effects, we use equations such as (12) to calculate the

prices that would have obtained in the mechanism's absence. To do so, it is

necessary to select specific values for c and c' .       The ratio of domestic to

foreign costs is a fiercely debated issue which cannot be resolved here; we set

c/c' equal to 1.2, and for upper and lower bounds we calibrate c at $230 and

$290 per net ton.33 We do not distintuish U.S. exports from domestic sales.

U.S. exports are small in volume and value; adding this distinction would only

modify our measures in minor ways at the cost of further complexity. In the

absence of precise estimates, we set the own—price elasticity of demand for

domestic steel to unity and all cross-price elasticities to half the value of

own-price elasticities, thereby insuring that demands are homogeneous of degree

zero in prices. Given the manner in which U.S. mill list prices appear to have

hovered around trigger prices, we set the price of domestic steel to $350 per

net ton.

            The results of our numerical calculations are shown in Table 8 for the

cases where the TPM would be binding. As indicated above, the magnitude of the

effects and the sign of the net change in welfare depend largely on whether the

initial distortion in domestic markets Is large relative to the rise in import

prices caused by the TPM. In cases (1) through (4), the domestic distortion is

large and the welfare effects are easily Interpreted. European producers suffer

a loss of surplus, while U.S. producers and foreign restrained suppliers receive

additional rents. Since the markup charged by domestic producers is relatively

large, so is the transfer they receive. Thus, domestic producers receive the

largest portion of the incremental rents. The estimated efficiency gain ranges

from $1931.4 million to $5985.6 million.

          When the domestic distortion is relatively small, in cases (5) and

(6), the sign of the welfare effect is reversed. On balance, the loss to con-

sumers outweighs the gain to producers. Foreign firms   capture   the largest share

of transfers to producers, and there is an overall loss of efficiency which

ranges from $5.3 million to $29.7 milion. These effects resemble what we

referred to in Section III as the standard textbock case.

         The unusual welfare effects in cases (1) through (4) provide a graphic

illustration of the theory of the second best: when distortions in the market

for domestic steel are severe relative to distortions in the market for imports,

it is possible to reduce the deadweight loss by adding distortions on the import

side. Having mentioned this possibility compels us to close on a cautionary

note. If antidumping action can be welfare-improving because of distortions in

domestic markets, first—best policies addressed at those domestic distortions

are still to be preferred. In our case, promoting competition can alleviate the

domestic distortion without causing any loss on the import side.

          Although we have attempted to extend simple welfare calculations in a

number of directions, our model ultimately remains partial equilibrium. We have

already seen how effects that are usually dismissed as second-order can be cru—
                                          —37-


cially   important in an imperfectly competitive setting. Among the effects we

have suppressed are distortions in factor maicets, changes in the extent of

collusion, dangers of foreign retaliation, and rent—seeking by domestic factors

of production; this last possibility, for example, greatly diminishes the like-

lihood that the additional distortion will enhance welfare. Many of these

extensions     are readily incorporated into our framewoxk. Even without these
complications, however, our analysis suggests that governments must be able to
estimate a relatively large number of parameters with considerable accuracy
before they can be assured that this form of intervention is welfare-improving.

V. Concluding Renia&s

             In this paper, we have analyzed dumping and U.S. antidumping policy

from a number of different perspectives. While attempting to address a broad

range   of   questions in a relatively few pages, we recognize that each of these

issues warrants more extensive treatment. The first sections of the paper ana-

lyze the evolution of U.S. antiduxnping policy and the design of the Trigger

Price Mechanism. To understand the evolution of antiduraping policy, we have

argued, it is necessary to analyze how policy is adapted in response to politi-

cal pressures; the TPM provides a dramatic illustration of these considerations.

From the point of view of its architects, who felt pressure from all sides, the

TPM was a political masterpiece. Economically, it was perhaps less masterful;

its exponents may have incompletely anticipated how administered protection

could distort established patterns of trade and production. An analysis of the

TF demonstrates also how administrative decisions on seemingly minor points —

such as the exchange rate to use in computing costs — can have major economic
effects.
             The latter sections of the paper use theoretical models to explain the
                                      —38—


sources of dumping and to illustrate the magnitude of its effects. The models

of most relevance to the practices currently at issue in the steel industry seem

to us models of oligopolistic rivalry in imperfectly competitive, segmented

maiets. Basing our analysis on the traditional economic definition of dumping

as price discrimination in international trade, we have attempted to identify a

number of crucial variables upon which the incidence of dumping will depend: the

number of firms producing for each national market,   their   costs, their market

shares, and the extent to which they recognize and exploit their mutual depen-

dence. Finally, we have used these models of imperfect competition to

illustrate how the size of the dumping ratio and the incidence of the TPM depend

on certain crucial parameter values. Much rexaains to be done to establish the

generality of our framework, but we hope at least that we have stimulated some

of our readers to think along these lines.

 1. In this paper we are concerned solely with dumping and U.S. antidumping

      policies. We do not discuss countervailing duties imposed in response to

      foreign government subsidization of exports. However, see footnote 25

      below.

2. Antidumping measures also were included in the Revenue Act of 1916, whose

      provisions unfortunately proved difficult to administer.

3.    U.S. Senate (1934) discusses the origins of the Act.

4. The immediate impetus for the change was a complaint that Canadian sulfur

     was being sold in both U.S. and Canadian markets at prices below costs.

     The 1974 Act also authorized the Treasury to base constructed value calcu-

     lations on data for comparable market economies when production costs in

     state—controlled economies proved difficult to measure.

5. See for example Crandall (1978, 1980), U.S. GAO (1979), and Kawahito

     (1981).

6. Section 206(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 defined constructed value as the

     sum   of   (i) "The cost of materials...and of fabrication or other processing

       .at a time preceding the date of exportation of the merchandise under

     consideration which would ordinarily permit the production of that par-

     ticular merchandise in the ordinary course of business." (2) "An amount

     for general expenses. .   .not   less than ten per cent of material and of fabri-

     cation costs." (3) "An amount for profit not less than eight per cent of

     the sum of material and fabrication costs and general expenses." (4) "The

     cost of all containers and coverings...and all other expenses incidental to

     placing the merchandise .    . .in   condition. .   .ready for shipnent to the U.S."
7. The debate over VRAs is recounted by Takacs (1976), Nueller and Kawahito

       (1979), and Adams and Dirlam (1980).

  8. In the words of its architects, the system was to "expedite relief from

      unfair import competition, but to do so In a manner which would not preclude

      competition in the U.S. market." See Solomon (1977), p. 8.

 9.   Treasury    must acquire sufficient information upon which to base a deter-

      mination within 75 days, and the complaintant must waive his right to

      verify the exporter's submission. In a related action, responsibility for

      enforcing U.S. antiduxnping statutes was transferred from Treasury to

      Commerce.

10. In practice, the constructed value provisions do not appear to have been

      invoked on these grounds.

14.   Ibid. If the yield ratio is 80 per cent, the other 20 per cent is scrap.

      A credit in the amount        of   the value of the scrap was applied to production

      cost   estimates for finished steel. The yield credit was raised in 19781V
      on the grounds that Japanese scrap was actually a higher valued secondary
      material.

16.   We   neglect feedba& from trigger prices to exchange rates, and from there
      to   domestic costs. The assumption that such feedback was negligible is

      crucial to our interpretation of Table 2. On these effects, see

      Eichengreen (1 981 ,   1   983).

26. This is not to imply that there is no role for policy toward industries

       facing  import competition. For analyses of the arguments for adjusnent
       assistance, see Bhagwati (1982).
27. It would be straightforward to introduce production and export subsidies
       at   this point. However, as noted above, we feel that the subsidy question

       is logically distinct from the issues analyzed here, so we make no attempt

       to incorporate it into our model. For a similar approach to analyzing sub-

       sidies, see Brander and Spencer (1982). It would also be straightforward

       to introduce transport costs. Although we do not treat such costs expli-

       citly, they can be thought of as a component of c .              See also Brander

       (1981) and Brander and Krugman (1981).

     Dixit and Stern (1982) argue that this assumption captures the case where

     oligopolists are in the industry on broadly equal terms.

30. If the oligopolists take fringe firms' reactions into account, then we get

     the standard Herfindahi Index in place of the truncated index. The conjec-

     tural variation is the firm's estimate of the slope of rivals' reaction

     functions. It can be heuristically interpreted as the perceived probabi-

     lity of retaliation. Thus,    iS =   0   is the Cournot case, and 'S =        1     is the

     case where each firm believes that other firms will try to preserve market

     shares. Cases of 'S < 0 ,    while   conceivable, are not considered here.

     Firms' conjectures are taken as constant throughout. Modeling conjectures

     as rational makes it difficult to characterize industry equilibrium, so we

     follow standard practice by taking conjectural variations as exogenous. On

     rational conjectural variations, see citations in Kamien and Schwartz

     (1981).

31. Such tests of the "law of one price" are surveyed by Crouhy-Veyrac. Crouhy,

     and Melitz (1982).

32. Were national outputs perfect substitutes and market           imperfections       absent,

     one could visualize a scenario in which U.S. antidumping policy admi-

    nistered under the TPM caused European steel formerly destined for the U.S.

     to be diverted to Japanese markets or to remain in Europe and a

    corresponding quantity of Japanese production to be diverted to the U.S.

    In fact, allegations of this type of activity on part of European and

    Japanese producers have recently been made by the U.S. industry.

    neglecting transport costs, in this case U.S. antidumping policies would
                                            —43—


      have no efficiency or distributional effects. When steel products produced

      in different countries are imperfect substitutes, the analysis is more

      complicated but the implication is the same.

33.   Mueller   and Kawahito (1978) review the available evidence and present esti-.

      mates of their own. For example, for 1976 their estimate of the ratio of

      European to U.S. costs is 1.17. In this paper we present no evidence on

      the constancy of variable cost. Since Takacs (1976) finds marginal costs

      to be slightly declining, while others such as Crandall (1981) treat them

      as rising, this seems to be a judicious conaproraise. Our estimates of c

      for 1979 are constructed by adjusting Mueller and Kawahito's figure of $205

      in 1976 for    the change in   prices of industrial goods. We think of these

      figures   as   including costs of variable labor, coal, fuel oil, natural gas,

      electricity, iron ore and scrap, plus transportation and related expenses.

      For a number of reasons, including the fact that their calculations exclude

      the U.K., there is reason to treat $230 as a lower bound; we use $290 as an

      upper bound. We recognize, however that we have suppressed the large cost

      differentials that exist among producers in a given location.
