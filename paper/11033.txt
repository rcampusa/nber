This paper examines the relationship between spot and futures prices for energy commodities (crude

oil, gasoline, heating oil markets and natural gas). In particular, we examine whether futures prices

are (1) an unbiased and/or (2) accurate predictor of subsequent spot prices. We find that while
futures prices are unbiased predictors of future spot prices, with the exception those in the natural

gas markets at the 3-month horizon. Futures do not appear to well predict subsequent movements

in energy commodity prices, although they slightly outperform time series models.

       In September of 2004, the price of oil broke the record of $50. Analysts predicted

a sustained period of elevated petroleum prices, a natural conclusion given the growing

world demand for petroleum products and the tight capacity constraints. Since then, oil

prices have fallen below the levels predicted by petroleum futures. It is natural at this

juncture to ask whether judgmental forecasts or market based indicators – such as futures

prices – are superior predictors.

       This paper examines the relationship between spot and futures prices for energy

commodities. In particular, we examine whether futures prices are (1) an unbiased and/or

(2) accurate predictors of subsequent spot prices, in the markets for crude oil, natural gas,

gasoline, and heating oil.

       In our view, a re-examination is warranted because of recent public policy

concerns about sharp movements in energy prices that have macroeconomic and

international repercussions (see for instance Hunt et al., 2001; LeBlanc and Chinn, 2004).

Figure 1 illustrates the wide swings that have occurred in the price of petroleum over the

past two decades. The most recent of these movements occurred in the last few years.

From a low of $11 per barrel at the end of November 1998, crude oil prices rose to

almost $34 in November of 2000. Price movements were even more dramatic in the

natural gas market. They rose from $1.98 at the end of 1998 to over $10 at the end of

2000. If futures prices correctly anticipate the direction of these movements on average,

then public policy can be based upon such market information.1 On the other hand, if

futures prices are misleading indicators of future price movements, then policy-makers




                                              1
should take into account the deficiencies of futures prices as price predictors, and either

appeal to alternative forecasting devices, or undertake public policies to mitigate the

effects of energy price uncertainty.

         To illustrate this point, consider the situation at the beginning of 2001. Certain

policy makers were arguing for a policy of encouraging domestic production of

petroleum, in light of the then high prices of crude oil in order to drive down prices.2

However, in the absence of externalities, if individuals and firms can make “good”

forecasts of prices, then hedging activities can nullify arguments for public policy

interventions of this nature. Interestingly, at the end of March 2001, March 2002 futures

were trading at $25.04/barrel, almost exactly equal to average price of $24.28 actually

recorded for that month. Of course, one anecdote does not constitute a proof, so in this

paper we undertake a systematic analysis of the issue.

         To anticipate the results, we find that the informational content of futures prices

varies with commodity. Specifically, futures prices are unbiased predictors of future spot

prices in the petroleum, gasoline and heating oil markets. In contrast natural gas futures

prices are a biased predictor of subsequent spot prices at the 3- and 6-month horizons.

While the proportion of variation in price changes explained by futures prices is not

typically very large, the forecasting performance of futures prices often exceeds that of

optimally selected time series models, over the January 1999 to October 2004 period.

  Greenspan (2004) has appealed to long dated futures as predictors of petroleum prices. While there is
some dispute as to whether such futures have much informational content (Baum, 2004), we focus on
futures with maturities within one year.

  One recent example is outlined in The Report of the National Energy Policy Development Group
(Executive Office of the President, 2001).

1. Theory and Previous Literature

       The notion that the futures price is the optimal forecast of the spot price is an

implication of the efficient market hypothesis. In an efficient market, new information is

reflected instantly in commodity prices. If this is true, then price patterns are random,

and no system based on past market behavior can do other than break even. The link

between efficiency and forecastability arises from realizing the difference between the

current futures price and the future spot price represents both the forecasting error and the

opportunity gain or loss realized from taking certain positions. The requirement that the

forecasting error is zero on average is consistent with both market efficiency (the absence

of profitable arbitrage opportunities) and the unbiasedness property of the forecaster

(zero forecasting error on average).

       The futures price of a storable commodity such as crude oil is determined by the

spot price and the cost incurred while the commodity is stored awaiting delivery some

time in the future. The cost associated with holding the commodity until the delivery

date is known as the cost-of-carry. The cost-of-carry consists of the cost of storing oil in

a tank (and perhaps insurance) and the financial cost in the form of the opportunity cost

of holding oil, or the cost of funding, and perhaps a risk premium.3

       The spot/futures pricing relationship is based on the assumption that market

participants are able to trade in the spot and futures markets simultaneously, i.e. they can

utilize spot/futures arbitrage. The relationship between the futures rate and the current

spot rate for petroleum is given by:

       f t|t - k − st - k = d t|t - k + Qt|t - k                                   (1)




                                                   3
where f t|t-k is the observed (log) time t-k futures contract price that matures at time t, and

s t-k is the time t-k spot rate, d t|t-k the log cost-of-carry (the sum of storage costs minus

convenience yield, plus interest costs and a risk premium), and Q t|t-k is a term accounting

for the marking-to-market feature of futures. The object on the left hand side of (1) is

called the “basis” in the commodity futures literature.4

            If we assume the log spot rate follows a time random walk with drift, and

expectations are rational, then the time t-k expectation of the change in the spot rate will

equal the basis and the marking-to-market term. Hence, in the regression of change in the

spot rate on the basis,



                  s t - s t - k = β 0 + β 1 ( f t|t - k - s t - k ) + ε t                                   (2)




    0   subsumes the terms in the right hand side of (1), as well as the parameters defining the

time series process governing the spot rate, while                          1   = 1 if the basis is the optimal

predictor of the change in the spot rate.

            The literature examining the behavior of futures markets is fairly extensive. A

number of studies have examined the efficiency of futures markets and have investigated

the related issue of the forecastability of spot energy prices. Unsurprisingly, the

conclusions are quite diverse. A number of studies provide evidence for efficient markets

and an equally large number provide evidence that contradicts an efficient market

(unbiased futures price prediction) interpretation. For example, Serletis (1991) found

evidence consistent with efficient crude petroleum markets. Bopp and Lady (1991),

3
    Williams and Wright (1991) provide an excellent overview to the behavior of commodity prices and




                                                                      4
however, found that either the spot or the futures price can be the superior forecasting

variable depending on market conditions, and the information content of the two price

series is essentially the same.

        The more recent literature has focused on the long-run properties of the spot and

forward prices, in the context of cointegration.5 We focus on the change in the spot rate,

and its relation to the basis, reserving the analysis of long run dynamics to future study.



2. An Empirical Analysis

2.1 Overview of the Data

        We obtained data for four energy prices – petroleum (West Texas Intermediate, or

WTI), natural gas (Henry Hub), gasoline (Gulf Coast), and heating oil (No. 2, Gulf

Coast). All the futures prices pertain to the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX),

as reported by Bloomberg.

        Figures 2 through 5 depict the current spot and the futures price for 3 months

ahead (st and ft,3 ) for each of these energy commodities. Due to the institutional nature

of the crude oil market, the "current" price is measured by the one month futures price, as

the "spot" price is for a delivery approximately one month later than the transaction.6 As

is typical of futures prices, the implied future spot rate tracks the actual spot rate with a 3

month lag. This pattern is also evident at longer horizons, but is slightly less pronounced.




futures.

  The discussion and notation is based upon the exposition in Brenner and Kroner (1995).
5
  See for instance, Crowder and Hamed (1993), Moosa and Al-Loughani (1994), Herbert (1993) and Walls
(1995).
6
  The one month future and spot are the same, except for some timing differences due to closing times in
the spot and futures markets.



                                                   5
          Interestingly, an exception to the aforementioned pattern occurs when there are

sharp spikes in the spot rate. Then – with the exception of the 1991 price increase – future

rates tend to deviate from the spot rate. The most obvious instances of this phenomenon

are for the 1996 and 2000 spikes in natural gas prices, and the 2000 spike in heating oil

prices.

          In order to evaluate more formally the properties of the relationship between the

spot and futures prices, we now move to a statistical analysis.

2.2 Estimation and Results

          Equation (2) is estimated using OLS using spot and futures prices sampled at a

monthly frequency. These data are all sampled at the end of month, and hence allow

proper synchronization of prices. Note however that because horizons of 3, 6 and 12

months are used, and the data is of monthly frequency, the regression residuals

incorporate overlapping information. Under the null hypothesis of efficient markets (risk

neutrality and rational expectations), the regression residuals will exhibit serial

correlation. In order to obtain consistent estimates of the standard errors, necessary to

conduct proper statistical inference, we calculate heteroskedasticity and serial correlation

robust standard errors.7

          The results are reported in Table 1. For the crude oil market, the estimates for β1

at the 3, 6 and 12-month horizons are not statistically distinguishable from unity. Hence,

one cannot reject the efficient markets hypothesis. However, it is also true that in none of

the cases are futures good predictors of subsequent spot prices. At the 3-month horizon,

the basis accounts for only 5 percent of total variation in changes in spot rates; at the 12-




                                                6
month horizon, this proportion is only 10 percent.8 Further note that even though the

slope coefficient is near unity, the constant is fairly large – albeit not statistically

significant – indicating that the basis points in the correct direction, but there is a natural

drift up in the price change, even after accounting for other factors.

        Natural gas futures appear to be a slightly more successful predictor of future spot

prices, especially at the longer horizon. While the coefficient is quantitatively and

statistically different from the posited value of unity at the 3 month horizon, at the other

horizons, the slope coefficient is not statistically distinguishable from unity, and the

proportion of variance explained exceeds 25 percent.

        For gasoline futures, one cannot reject the possibility of β1 being statistically

indistinguishable from unity. However, as with crude oil markets, these futures are very

poor predictors of subsequent prices. The adjusted R2s are relatively low in these

regressions, explaining only between 9% and 23% of total variation respectively.

Moreover, the interpretation of the results using 12-month futures price series is

complicated by the large and numerous gaps in the data series, which limits the number

of observations to 115.

        Estimating the same equation for heating oil, we find that we cannot reject the

market efficiency hypothesis for our three futures contracts. As with gasoline, the R2s

remain low, with 3, 6, and 12-month futures accounting for 15%, 13%, and 17% of the

variation in future spot prices.

7
  Using monthly data, if the futures mature 12 months (4 quarters) in the future, then a moving average
process of 11 (=12-1) is induced. The Newey-West standard errors are calculated using a Bartlett window
and lag order set equal to the 2×(k-1), following Cochrane (1991).
8
  The crude oil market possesses some unique institutional features. The most important is that it is not
possible to truly effect a purchase on the spot market. Rather, toward the end of each month, delivery is
arranged for something approaching one month in the future. Hence, the current 1-month futures price is




                                                    7
         The pattern of these results is apparently not dependent upon the sample

encompassing the recent run-up in energy prices. If the sample is truncated at March

2001, then similar results are obtained. One of the few differences is the finding of

slightly more evidence of inefficiency in the natural gas futures market, with bias

exhibited at two horizons (3 and 6 months). No substantive differences are detected in the

other markets.



3. Forecast Comparison

We evaluate the relative forecasting abilities of two rules of thumb and a simple

econometric model: the futures rate as a predictor, and the current spot rate as the best

guess of the future rate, and a time series model. A description of how the model is

selected and estimated is provided in the Appendix. The futures rate is used here as a

simple predictor; the estimated relationships in Table 1 are not incorporated in these

estimates. The 1999m01-2004m10 period is used to compare the forecasts.

         As indicated in Table 2, futures prices do a quite good job, in terms of both

unbiasedness and smallest forecast errors, for both natural gas and gasoline. Futures also

do well in terms of smallest errors for petroleum and heating oil, even though a random

walk proves to be superior in terms of unbiasedness at short horizons.

         In general, the predictors -- futures prices and time series models -- underpredict

actual energy prices. This is partly true because of the pronounced upward drift in energy

prices during the post-2001 period.




used as a measure of the true spot rate. If one uses the reported spot price instead, the predictive power of
the basis is somewhat reduced.



                                                       8
       This pattern of results can be put into context by examining the visual depiction of

the data. Figure 6 shows the crude oil price, the price predicted by the 12 month futures,

and price predicted by the time series model and random walk. It is clear that neither the

futures prices nor the time series models provide a tremendous amount of information

about the actual path of petroleum prices.



4. Conclusion

   •   Futures prices are unbiased predictors of crude oil, gasoline, and heating oil

       prices, but not of natural gas prices at the 3 month horizon.

   •   Futures prices typically explain only a small proportion of the variation in

       underlying commodity price movements -- no more than 35 percent even at the 12

       month horizon for natural gas.

   •   Time series models (relating a commodity price to lagged own prices, and

       estimated errors) do not fare any better -- and usually fare worse – than

       commodity futures prices as forecasts.

   •   A random walk characterization of commodity prices is not a particularly good

       one. This result contrasts with those found for other asset prices, notably foreign

       exchange rates. However, this result may partly be an artifact of our forecasting

       sample which encompasses a period of rising prices.

                                         Appendix

To generate the forecasts using time series models, the following algorithm was used.

   1. An ARIMA(1,1,1) is estimated.

   2. Use the AIC to select the optimal lag length.

   3. Estimate using the in-sample period (up to 1997m12); then roll recursively the

       estimation until all the out-of-sample observations are exhausted.

   4. Forecasts are compared on a 1999m01-2004m10 sample.

In an earlier version of this paper examining data ending in 2001m04, petroleum prices

were determined to be trend stationary, while the other prices were found to be difference

stationary; as a consequence an ARMA(1,1) was used for petroleum and an

ARIMA(1,1,1) for the other series. In this longer sample ending in 2004m10, the

stationarity findings are reversed. Given the ambiguity in the results, and the fact that all

the series are nominal prices, we opt to assume all series are I(1).
