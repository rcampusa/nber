                                                 ABSTRACT

This paper evaluates the impact of the availability of electronic labor markets on the university-to-work
transition. In particular, we analyze the effect of the intermediation activity carried on by the inter-university
consortium, AlmaLaurea, on graduates' labor market outcomes. The different timing of universities'
enrollment in AlmaLaurea allows us to apply the difference-in-differences method to a repeated cross
section data set. If the usual assumption concerning parallel outcomes holds, AlmaLaurea reduces
the individual unemployment probability and improves matching quality. Interestingly, we also find
that on-line intermediaries foster graduates' geographic mobility.

                                        1.   Introduction

     The internet and electronic technologies more generally have a great potential for chang-
ing the way employer-employee matches are made (Autor 2001). Since the mid 1990s there
has been a well documented increase in the number of internet job boards and corporate
web sites devoted to job applications, and in the shares of job seekers and recruiters using
on-line resources. For example, according to Taleo Research, the incidence of Fortune 500
companies using their careers web site as a corporate job board increased from 29 percent
in 1998 to 92 percent in 2002. Moreover, the importance of on-line technologies may be
underestimated since the possible uses of the internet in job search are multifaceted and go
well beyond viewing advertisements or posting résumés (Kuhn 2000).2
     However, it has been extremely difficult to assess the impact of on-line technologies
on labor market outcomes. The internet is believed to increase the amount of information
available to recruiters and job seekers and at the same time to improve their ability to screen
on-line applications and opportunities. Both aspects are likely to decrease the cost of job
search and, therefore, to improve matching productivity (Pissarides 2000).
     Nevertheless, it has also been noted that even if searching on-line has private individual
benefits, it does not follow that the equilibrium effects on labor market outcomes are socially
beneficial (Autor 2001). In a recent empirical investigation, Kuhn and Skuterud (2004) also
find that – once individual observable characteristics are controlled for – internet seekers do
not have shorter unemployment duration than other searchers and, in some specification,
it may even be longer. As the authors acknowledge, these results may be contaminated
by selection into internet job search on unobservables that are negatively correlated with
employability. However, it is also possible that internet search is counterproductive at the
individual level because of the negative signal it might send to employers. Workers may still
use the internet, the authors argue, because it is very cheap and they are not aware of this
drawback.
     Therefore, despite their rapid diffusion, whether on-line electronic technologies are capa-
ble of increasing the overall efficiency with which workers and jobs are matched or, conversely,
are merely cheaper substitutes for more traditional means (e.g. newspaper ads or face-to-face
intermediation), is still an open issue.
    This paper evaluates the impact of the availability of electronic labor markets on the
university-to-work transition. In particular, we study the effects of a specific electronic

also have played a role in reducing the natural rate (of unemployment)” (CBO 2002).

intermediary, the inter-university consortium AlmaLaurea, on graduates’ unemployment,
mobility, and matching quality. In a nutshell, AlmaLaurea collects and organizes on-line
information concerning college graduates’ curricula and, conditional on their permission,
sells it to firms in electronic format. Hence, similar to other commercial job boards, it
makes information about searching candidates available on-line. However, it also contains
information on almost the entire universe of graduates from the institutions that it serves.
     The present case study provides exceptional evidence on the effect of online labor market
intermediaries for two main reasons: first, the impact of AlmaLaurea is observed during a
time period when e-recruitment was almost non-existent in Italy. AlmaLaurea was founded
in 1994 and, to the best of our knowledge, until 1999 there were no major internet job
boards operating in Italy. Second, different timing of universities’ enrolment in AlmaLaurea
produces counterfactuals that allow us to tackle the problems faced by previous empirical
investigations. Although today most Italian universities are members of AlmaLaurea, a
smaller subset was in the consortium at the time our data were collected. We identify the
average effect of AlmaLaurea on graduates from this initial subset—i.e. the ones that might
have used its services—comparing the dynamics of their employment outcomes with those of
graduates from universities that were not members. Hence, we aim at estimating the effect
of the availability of electronic intermediaries, not the private benefits of using them.
     Formally, we measure the effect of AlmaLaurea using the difference-in-differences (DID)
approach applied to a repeated cross section data set. The data set is built by merging
two distinct (but almost identical) surveys run by the Italian Statistical Office (ISTAT) on
representative samples of two cohorts of university graduates interviewed three years after
graduation. Given that AlmaLaurea intermediation activity only started in a subset of uni-
versities in the period between the graduation of the two cohorts, we split the sample in two
distinct groups; graduates that completed their degree in a university that joined AlmaLau-
rea in 1996 and 1997 (the treatment group) and those that graduated from universities not
members of AlmaLaurea during that period (the control group). The subtleties of envisag-
ing participation of academic institutions in AlmaLaurea as a quasi-natural experiment are
discussed in more depth below. Here, it suffices to say that, first, individual decisions con-
cerning college enrolment were made before AlmaLaurea came into being; second, graduates
and universities in the two groups are not statistically different in terms of observable charac-
teristics; third, according to personal conversations with the consortium’s director, initially
membership in AlmaLaurea was fairly accidental and mostly based on informal relationships
among a few faculties.
     AlmaLaurea, as we discuss more thoroughly below, has a number of features that make it
likely to be effective: first, it collects official information, which is partially disclose to firms,
                                                 –4–


concerning also those individuals who decide not to post their résumés on-line. Second, it
achieves very high enrolment rates from graduates. We conjecture that these features are
likely to reduce adverse selection.
      According to our most conservative estimate, AlmaLaurea decreases the probability of
unemployment by about 1.6 percentage points and has a positive effect on wages, and two
self-reported measures of job satisfaction. We also find that it fosters graduates’ geographical
mobility.
    To check the robustness of the above findings, we test for pre-treatment parallel out-
comes and find that graduates from the two groups of universities had similar employment
dynamics prior to AlmaLaurea’s operation. Our results might also be affected by the adverse
consequence of AlmaLaurea for graduates from universities not members of the consortium.
To control for this possibility, we build alternative treatment and control groups based on
geographical proximity. We find no evidence of such a negative effect.
     Our work is related to the growing number of studies that investigate the effect of
the internet and electronic technologies on the labor market (Autor 2001; Freeman 2002).
Kuhn and Skuterud (2004) study the impact of Internet job search on the probability of the
unemployed finding a job. According to their analysis, there are no discernible differences
between transition to employment of on-line and traditional searchers. They conclude that
either on-line search is ineffective or that Internet job searchers are negatively selected.
In a recent paper — methodologically similar to ours — Kroft and Pope (2008) exploit the
uneven geographical expansion of the website Craigslist to assess the impact of on-line search
on labor and housing markets efficiency. Although, consistently with Kuhn and Skuterud
(2004), they find that on-line search had no effect on the unemployment rate, they did
find that it lowered more traditional classified job advertisements in newspapers. Stevenson
(2007) investigates the importance of on-line technologies on employed on-line job search
and finds that in the United States state-level rise in Internet penetration is associated with
state-level rise in employer-to-employer worker flows. In this paper, we focus on the impact
of online search on a specific segment of the labor market, i.e. transition of university to
work.
     Our study is also useful for policy evaluation and formulation: the consortium Al-
maLaurea is co-financed by the Italian Ministry of Education, therefore clear evidence on
its effectiveness is useful for evaluating how public money is spent.3 Moreover, should Al-

   Given that we do not know the magnitude of public funding invested, we are not able to measure whether
AlmaLaurea is a worthwhile social investment; we can only measure whether students from AlmaLaurea
member universities have benefited from it.

learn from its example, improving public policy aimed at facilitating the university-to-work
transition.
     The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the
university-to-work transition in Italy, provides an in depth description of the AlmaLaurea
consortium, and briefly discusses the economics of on-line labor market intermediaries. Sec-
tion 3 outlines the identification assumptions needed to make our empirical strategy valid.
Section 4 describes of the data used in the analysis. Section 5 presents the main results.
Sections 6 and 7 justify the validity of the results of our empirical approach, and Section 8
concludes.

                         2.1.    University-to-work transition in Italy

     Labor market functioning is deeply affected by different kinds of information imperfec-
tions and asymmetries. The education-to-work transition is particularly exposed to these
imperfections: first-time job seekers typically lack work experience and this negatively af-
fects both their outlooks concerning employment opportunities and job characteristics, and
employers’ screening options.
     In most countries unemployment rates are lower for university graduates than for the
rest of labor force and highly educated people experience a smoother entry into working life
(OECD 2007). As Table 1 shows, however, international comparisons depict the university-
to-work transition in Italy as one of the most problematic cases among industrialized coun-
tries.4 There are three main possible explanation for this. First, there are frictions on the
supply side: it might be that education provided by Italian universities is of such a poor
standard that graduates are obliged to undertake further training, either formal or informal,
before getting into work. Second, the slow transition rates may be due to labor demand char-
acteristics: the Italian industrial structure, compared to that of other developed countries,
is biased in favor of small firms and low tech industries that typically do not employ highly
qualified workers. Third, there may be inefficiencies in the matching mechanisms caused by
information imperfections and, possibly, by lack of intermediaries.
       AlmaLaurea potentially improves labor market functioning for two reasons. First, it

reduces search costs for both firms and workers by making accurate qualification, grade and
study data readily available. Second, it may mitigate adverse selection by making it possible
to compare searching students with others in their cohorts.
     Universities are often active actors in labor market intermediation. For instance, most
academic institutions set up and manage placement offices and, in some cases, their faculties
establish informal ties with firms.5 However, when universities receive financial resources
on a relatively egalitarian basis and their graduates’ labor market performance does not
affect their financial endowments, they may have little incentive to concern themselves with
students’ placement. In Italy before AlmaLaurea was established public universities were
involved in minimal formal intermediation activity.6 Table 2 refers to 1995 graduates and
for a selected sample of European countries displays the share of graduates who used the
services of their institutions’ placement office (first column) and the share of graduates who
got their first job through this channel (second column). It can be seen that Italy ranks low,
higher only than Germany, in both respects.7

     AlmaLaurea was founded in 1994 and began on-line intermediation in 1995 at a time
when, to the best of our knowledge, there were no other internet job boards in Italy. Monster
and InfoJob, according to Nielsen/NetRatings the current most popular e-recruitment sites,
started in 2001 and 2004 respectively.8
     Initially run by the Statistical Observatory of the University of Bologna, AlmaLaurea
currently managed by a consortium of 50 private and public universities with the support
of the Italian Ministry of Education. Member universities pay a one-time association fee
(ranging from 2582 to 5165 euros according to the size of the university) and an annual
subscription fee for the collection and the insertion of new data in the AlmaLaurea database
(4.96 euros for each student in the data base).
     AlmaLaurea’s institutional objectives are twofold. First, it provides member academic
institutions with reliable information on their graduates. Second, it aims at facilitating
graduates’ labor market transition.
      In terms of the first objective, AlmaLaurea manages a database that collects information
on graduates drawing it from three distinct sources. First, academic institutions provide
official data on grades, course durations, and degrees received for their alumni. Second,
undergraduates provide several pieces of information including military service obligations,

    8
    It ultimately proved impossible to establish with any precision the timing of the first Italian internet
job-board. Nevertheless, according to personal communications with industry experts in the field the first
was JobPilot, which was founded in 1999 and was acquired by Monster in 2005.

periods of study abroad, work experience, and a self-evaluation concerning foreign languages
and computer skills. Finally, graduates have the option to upload and update their curricula
on-line for up to three years after graduation.9 In accordance with Italian privacy law, only
a subset of the information in the database can be disclosed to third parties.10
     With respect to the second objective, AlmaLaurea manages a service that gives firm
electronic access to graduates’ CVs. The CV is an electronic file containing biographical
information, age at graduation, university and high school grades, information on internships,
experience abroad, postgraduate education, languages and computer skills, work experience,
and work preferences (i.e. type of occupation desired, location, and contract preferred).
Graduates may include additional information and a cover letter.11
     The service is free for graduates. Firms and other institutions can browse individual
curricula and observe populational aggregate information for free, are required to pay if they
want to contact a particular graduate. The price ranges between 0.5 and 10 euros per CV,
depending on the type of subscription and the number of curricula acquired.12

          2.3.   AlmaLaurea and the economics of electronic labor markets

     The AlmaLaurea recruitment service turns out to be an insightful example concerning
how on-line communication technologies — coupled with more traditional forms of inter-
mediation — might ameliorate the way in which employers and employees match in the
labor market. On-line labor market intermediaries are expected to decrease the search costs
for both employers and employees. Standard search theory predicts that, everything being
equal, this should lead to better matches. Conversely, the effects on unemployment duration
are ambiguous. In fact, although Burdett and Ondrich (1985) suggest that it is unlikely,
on-line technologies might induce both job seekers and employers to be more choosy and to
increase their reservation wages and screening standards (Pissarides 2000). Finally, on-line
labor market intermediaries are expected to weaken the constraints posed by geographical
distance (Autor 2001). Consistently, in the AlmaLaurea case most graduates’ curricula are
bought by firms located in regions other than the one where the individual graduated (see
Table 3).
     On the other hand, a likely consequence of lower costs in distinct job search channels is
that job seekers, ceteris paribus, will apply for more jobs. And when employers perceive such
excess application to be a problem, adverse selection is likely to undermine the effectiveness
of cheap search methods (Autor 2001).
     With the exception of time required to update personal information, AlmaLaurea is
completely free for students and therefore is potentially exposed to the adverse selection
problem referred to above: employers might expect that individuals who upload and update
their résumés on-line are somehow negatively selected. However, AlmaLaurea’s organiza-
tional features are likely to make its intermediation activity less exposed to the above risk
for two reasons.
     First, as explained above, some pieces of the information contained in AlmaLaurea
data set concern the entire graduates population and are provided directly by academic
institutions. This information is organized by AlmaLaurea and made freely available on-line
at its website.13 For every member university and degree, the website provides information
on average grades, share of students that completed their degree on time, and the share of
individuals that studied abroad within a EU subsidized program. Therefore, employers who
purchase a CV should be able to identify differences between the selected job seeker and the
entire graduate population which considerably reduces the adverse selection problem.
       Second, academic institutions that joined AlmaLaurea are able to enroll the vast ma-

jority of their graduates. For instance, more than 92% of 1998 graduates updated their CVs
on-line at least once. High participation rates have been very effective in building a good
reputation for the serve, and make adverse selection unlikely. To sum up, we expect that
AlmaLaurea’s particular organizational features protect it from the disadvantages of on-line
labor markets.



                                     3.    The empirical strategy

     The basic goal of this paper is to evaluate the impact of a treatment, i.e. the availability
of on-line labor market intermediaries, on an array of labor market outcomes, i.e. the
probability of being unemployed, mobility, and matching quality. This section formalizes
and explicitly discusses our empirical approach and outlines the strategies employed to assess
its validity.
     One of the most serious empirical problems that arises in assessing the impact of on-line
intermediaries is that job seekers and firms typically self select in the adoption of on-line
technologies. It is therefore difficult to identify to what extent the correlation between their
use and labor market outcomes stems from the technology itself and to what extent it stems
from some important and difficult to measure individual characteristics.
     In this paper we can rely on a transparent exogenous source of variation, i.e. the timing
of universities’ enrolment in AlmaLaurea. This heterogeneity allows to apply the DID method
to a repeated cross-section data set. This helps to overcome the above mentioned problem.
     The simple DID framework can be described as follows. The causal effect of a treatment
on an outcome is defined as the difference between two potential outcomes (Rubin 1974;
Heckman 1990). Of course, it is impossible to observe such an effect for a given individual.
However, it is possible to identify an average effect if the population of interest is observed in
at least two distinct time periods, if only a fraction of the population is exposed to treatment,
and if we assume parallel paths over time for treated and controls. The main intuition is that,
under this design, an untreated group of the population is used to identify time variation in
the outcome that is not due to treatment exposure.
     More formally, each individual i belongs to one group, Gi ∈ {0, 1}, where for convenience
group 1 is the treatment group and 0 the control one. Moreover, individual i is observed
only in time period Ti ∈ {0, 1}. Let Ii = Gi · Ti denote an indicator for the actual submin-
istration of treatment.14 YiN (t) and YiI (t) represent two potential outcomes: respectively,

 14
      Note that in our simple setting Ii assumes the value 1 only for the treatment group (Gi = 1) in the post
                                                     – 11 –


that achieved by i at time t if not treated and that achieved if treated before t.
      The fundamental problem in identifying the treatment effect on individual i, defined
as YiI (t) − YiN (t), is that for any particular individual, it is not possible to observe both
potential outcomes. What we do observe is the realized outcome, which can be written as
Yi (t) = YiI (t) · Ii + YiN (t) · (1 − Ii ).
        If it is assumed that

                       E[YiN (1) − YiN (0)|Gi = 1] = E[YiN (1) − Y N (0)|Gi = 0],                (1)

then, it easily follows that

                E[YiI (1) − YiN (1)|Gi = 1] = E[Yi (1)|Gi = 1] − E[Yi (0)|Gi = 1]
                                                                                                 (2)
                                              −{E[Yi (1)|Gi = 0] − E[Yi (0)|Gi = 0]}.

     In other words, if the average outcomes for the treatment and control groups had parallel
paths over time in the absence of treatment, then the so-called average treatment effect on
the treated (ATT) can be expressed as something whose sample counterpart is observable,
i.e. as the average variation of the treatment group purged by the average variation of the
control group.
     Hence in the present study, it is assumed that in absence of AlmaLaurea the average
occupational outcomes of graduates from early joining universities (hereafter AlmaLaurea
universities) would have followed the same dynamics as those of graduates from universities
that either joined later or did not join (hereafter non-AlmaLaurea universities). Thus the
average effect of AlmaLaurea is simply obtained by subtracting the dynamics of the graduates
of the control group from the dynamics of those in the treatment group.
        The above estimator is easily obtained as

                              Yi = µ + γ · Gi + δ · Ti + α · (Gi · Ti ) + ui     ,               (3)

where α is the ATT and the assumption stated in equation 1 is equivalent to mean indepen-
dence.
     The validity of our approach faces a number of threats. As far as the so-called internal
validity is concerned, i.e. the causal effect within the context of the study, there are two main
problems.15 First, the compositional effect: the use of repeated cross-sections is only valid


treatment period (Ti = 1).
  15
       See Meyer (1995) for a comprehensive discussion of internal validity in this framework.
                                               – 12 –


when the composition of the target population does not change between the two periods,
i.e. ui ⊥ Ti | Gi . Given that individual decisions concerning college enrolment were taken
before the existence of AlmaLaurea, we can presume that, in our case, this problem is not
very severe. Nevertheless, following standard practice, we shall test whether the means of
relevant characteristics of the population within each group did change unevenly between
the pre-treatment and the post-treatment periods.
     Second, the assumption of parallel dynamics in the absence of treatment between the
two groups (equation 1) turns out to be strong. It is, in fact, possible that the two groups
have different trends for reasons other than treatment. However, if non-parallel dynamics
are due to observables, we can overcome the problem by including covariates. This analysis,
as we discuss in detail in Section 4, relies on a large array of individual and university
covariates. Nevertheless, if the dynamics of the outcome variables of the two groups are
affected by unobservables, identification breaks down.16 In Section 6, we try to overcome
this important problem using data for an additional pre-treatment period in order to test
for non-parallel paths between the treatment and control groups before treatment.
     Another issue concerns the unit of analysis of our ATT. It could be that AlmaLaurea
might not be an appropriate individual level treatment since member institutions are enrolled
at once, and there are possibly important interactions among each university’s students. If,
for instance, the impact of AlmaLaurea on a given student depends on the characteristics of
students in her cohort, we are measuring the effect on university rather than the individual
graduate employment performance. Although in the present study we model AlmaLaurea
as an individual level treatment, in future research we aim to investigate the possibility of
within university spillovers.
     Similarly, to be valid, the DID approach assumes no interactions among the agents in the
treatment and control groups. If, for example, AlmaLaurea graduates improved occupational
outcomes harm non-AlmaLaurea graduates, our estimates have very different implications,
especially in terms of informing policy. In Section 7, we try to assess this problem identifying
additional control and treatment groups which include only graduates from those universities
that are located in the same geographical region.
     Finally, in order to generalize the results to different individuals and contexts, external
validity is important. It is possible that AlmaLaurea would not have had an effect for grad-
uates from those universities that chose not to join. This would also explain why they did
not join. However, we do not think this is a major problem since, as mentioned in the intro-

  16
    Given that decisions to enrol in AlmaLaurea are made by universities, we are mostly concerned with
university unobservables.

duction, membership tended to be accidental, at least during the first years. Nevertheless,
below we test whether the observable characteristics of the universities in the two groups
differ significantly.



                                                            4.      The data

     Our data on graduates are drawn from two almost identical surveys — Indagine Inser-
imento Professionale Laureati (Survey on University-to-Work Transition) in 1998 and 2001
of individuals who graduated in 1995 and 1998 respectively.17
     To implement the econometric approach described in Section 3 we include in our main
treatment group those individuals graduating from universities that joined AlmaLaurea in
1996 and 1997. As shown in Table 4, this includes the universities of Modena-Reggio Emilia,
Ferrara, Parma, Florence, Catania, Trieste, Udine, Messina, Chieti, Trento, Molise and
Venice School of Architecture. Students in the treatment group account for about 18 per
cent of the sample (see Table 5).
    In Section 5.2, we exploit an additional source of variation. As shown in Table 4, the
Universities of Turin and Eastern Piedmont start selling graduates CVs only after August
1998. Thus, we used graduates from these universities as an additional treatment group in
a DID setting in which the ”before and after” are the time of graduation before and after
August 1998 and only graduates from 1998 are considered.18

  17
    The publicly available micro-data do not include information concerning from which university the
surveyed individual graduated. Therefore, we carried out the analysis at the ADELE ISTAT laboratory in
Rome.
  18
       In Italy graduates can complete their degree at different times in the same academic year, depending on
                                                  – 14 –


     Unfortunately, ISTAT does not provide information concerning the month of graduation
for 1995 graduates. Therefore, graduates from Bologna are not considered in the analysis.19
     The ISTAT target samples consist of 25,716 individuals in 1998 and 36,373 individuals
in 2001. They represent respectively 25% and 28.1% of the total population of Italian
university graduates. The response were 64.7% and 53.3% for a total of 17,326 and 20,844
respondents.20 After eliminating individuals that did not respond to the question concerning
their employment status, those with missing values for key variables, and graduates from
Bologna, Turin and Eastern Piedmont, we are left with 15,282 and 18,181 observations
respectively. In both years the sample is stratified according to sex, university and university
degree and in the analysis below all estimations are performed using stratification weights.
     The surveys collect information on (i) school and university curricula, (ii) labor market
experience, and (iii) demographic and social backgrounds of graduates. Table 5 presents
summary statistics for the key variables. In the analysis below, individual level right-hand
variables are grouped into two subsets. The first includes characteristics that are predeter-
mined with respect to college efforts and outcomes: sex, age, high school grades, 14 dummies
for high school type, 1 dummy for having two university degree, 5 dummies for each par-
ent’s level of education, 104 dummies for province of residence before college enrolment, and
345 dummies for departments (university*field of study). The second contains indicators
related to college curricula that could—at least potentially—be influenced by AlmaLaurea:
university grade and number of years to graduation.
     As Table 5 shows, with the exception only of the share of women which increased for
both groups, the remaining variables show no notable variations within groups over time.
Moreover, control and treatment groups present very similar characteristics for both years,
reducing the possibilities of major interactions (beyond the treatment itself) at the individual
level between being enroled in a college member of AlmaLaurea and graduating in 1998.
    In order to control for observable variations in academic institution quality, we use
data on university characteristics provided by ISTAT in its annual Lo Stato dell’Universitá


when they finish their dissertation.
  19
    Bologna is also a very special case, the most ”self-selected” one, given that it is the university where
AlmaLaurea get started. However, results do not change qualitatively whether we include Bologna graduates
in the control group or the treatment group.
  20
     Differences in response rates probably stem from the different interviewing techniques in the surveys:
in 1998 ISTAT mailed paper-based questionnaires, while in 2001 the CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone
Interview) was used. In principle, this change should affect universities in a homogenous way and therefore
it should not represent a major problem for our analysis.

(University Indicators), for the academic years 1991-98. In particular, we collect information
at the level of the individual university, on numbers of students, professors, and delayed
students.21 Table 6 shows that universities in the treatment group enrol fewer students
per professor than the universities in the control group. The difference, however, is not
statistically significant. The two groups have very similar average rates of delayed students.
Both indicators are generally considered proxies for university teaching quality.22 Note, also,
that the share of delayed students increased in both groups, but the increase is steeper for
the treatment group. In terms of overall number of students, the two groups of universities
have very similar averages.

       In Italy most students graduate after the official deadline.
  22
   As discussed in Bagues et al. (2008) both indicators have drawbacks in a system such as the Italian one
where most universities cannot restrict entry and therefore the number of students per professor depends,
among other things, on demand.

performance, we collect province23 level information on per capita Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) and unemployment rates.
     The present study considers three basic outcome variables measured three years after
graduation: occupational status, which takes the value 1 if an individual is unemployed,
and 0 otherwise;24 regional mobility, which takes the value 1 if the individual resides in a
different region from the one where she graduated;25 and wage, measured as net monthly
wage expressed in euros and self reported by the interviewed. We also consider two additional
proxies for matching productivity. The first is for the perceived level of adequacy of the
knowledge acquired at university with respect to the content of the present job. The second
is related to the perceived stability of the job. Both variables are self reported and take
values from 1, not at all satisfied, to 4, very satisfied.



                                   5.     The impact of AlmaLaurea

                         5.1.    Universities that joined in 1996 and 1997

     A first picture of the impact of AlmaLaurea is obtained by comparing time differences
in means of key outcomes within the two groups (treatment and control). Table 7 shows
that unemployment rates decreased sharply from 1998 to 2001 for the whole target popula-
tion.26 Moreover, and most importantly for the present study, occupational status improved
the most for those in the treated group: the rate of unemployment decreased about 3.5
points more than in the control group. Note also that the ranking between the two groups
reverses. This means that the same qualitative result would be obtained if we used changes
in employment logs as outcome variables.
   For mobility, rates remained stable for AlmaLaurea students, and decreased for non-
AlmaLaurea ones. Hence, for graduates in the treatment group regional mobility increased

  23
       Italy is composed by 104 provinces which correspond approximately to US counties.
  24
   Following standard definitions, we consider unemployed to be those individuals that declare not to having
worked during the week before the interview and to be searching for a job.
  25
       Italy is composed of 20 regions.
  26
    Italian labor market conditions improved substantially between 1998 and 2001. According to ISTAT,
standardized unemployment rates for the entire population were 11.7 in 1998 and 9.4 in 2001. The change
was from 12.8 to 9.8 for university graduates aged between 25 and 39. It could be that our figures display
a steeper decrease because individuals in the sample are younger and because of the changes made to the
survey technique mentioned above.

by about 1 point relatively to graduates in the control group. However, this difference is not
statistically different from zero. Note also that graduates in the treatment group are more
mobile than those in the control group. Finally, in terms of matching quality, monthly wages
increased by some 44 euros more for AlmaLaurea graduates than for the control group.
     To interpret the above results as being the sole effect of AlmaLaurea, involves assuming
that in the absence of the treatment the averages of the two groups would have experienced
the same variation (equation 1). This is a strong restriction when treatment (i.e. graduating
from a university enroled in AlmaLaurea) is not randomly assigned across individuals. In the
remaining part the paper we use the approaches outlined in Section 3 to assess the extent
to which the observed changes may be interpreted as the effect of AlmaLaurea.
     The basic identification assumption of the DID method (equation 1) may be too strin-
gent if treatment and control groups are unbalanced in covariates that are thought to be
associated with the dynamics of the outcome variable. To begin with, we follow the tra-
ditional way to accommodate this problem and introduce a linear set of controls Xi in
equation 3, which then becomes:

                               Yi = µ + β · Xi + γ · Gi + δ · Ti + α · (Gi · Ti ) + ui                           ,                           (4)

column 4 displays the results of a regression that includes province unemployment and GDP
per capita. Note that all specifications include university time department dummies.
      Table 8 shows that, conditional on individual characteristics, if a university decides to
affiliate to AlmaLaurea the probability that its graduates are unemployed three years after
graduation significantly decreases by about 2 points. Potentially endogenous individual re-
gressors (column 2) and university controls (column 3) do not affect significantly our results.
Conversely, controlling for provincial unemployment rates and GDP (column 4) reduces the

    If we cluster standard errors at university level, most of the coefficients are not statistically significant
at the 10% level.

magnitude of the coefficient to about 1.6 points and also its statistical significance. How-
ever, the coefficient is still statistically significant at the 10 percent level. Quantitatively,
this implies that, out of the 23,688 individuals that graduated from a member university in
1998, 379 graduates were out of unemployment as a consequence of AlmaLaurea adoption.
Although we do not have direct evidence on the extent to which AlmaLaurea crowded out
other search channels, this finding is plausible if one observes the high number of curricula
sold by the consortium displayed in Table 3.
     Table 9 shows that also regional mobility rates have different dynamics for graduates
in AlmaLaurea universities: depending on the controls used, AlmaLaurea has a positive
and statistically significant effect on mobility, ranging from 2.3 to 2.8 points:28 about 570
individuals that without the consortium would have been resident in the region where they
graduated, moved to a different one.
     As mentioned, lower search costs are also expected to improve the quality of labor
market matches. Table 10 shows that according to our analysis AlmaLaurea significantly
increases monthly wages by about 3 percent.29 Taking as a reference the average wage, this
implies that working graduates made about 35 more euros per month. We also find that
AlmaLaurea increases graduates’ satisfaction with the adequacy of the knowledge acquired
at university, and job stability.30



                                5.2.    Universities that joined in 1998

     The above findings may be driven by time varying omitted university characteristics.
To investigate whether this is the case, in this section, we exploit an additional source of
exogenous variation. The Universities of Turin and Eastern Piedmont joined AlmaLaurea in
August 1998 and hence sold résumés on-line only for those 1998 graduates that completed
their degree after that date. In our alternative DID setting the new treatment group is
composed of graduates from these two universities with the before and after being graduation
after August 1998. In this specification only 1998 data are considered and dummies for
month of graduation are included. As Table 11 shows, AlmaLaurea significantly decrease
unemployment probability by about 2.5 points, which is a similar magnitude to the effect

  28
       Similar results are obtained if we consider provincial mobility.
  29
   This result needs to be interpreted with caution because of the possible different composition of the two
samples. In fact wage regressions are run only for those individuals who are employed.

achieved above. However, there is no significant effect on either mobility or wages.



                                                  6.     Unparallel outcomes

     Possibly, the most important threat to the internal validity of the above results is the
extent to which the ”parallel trends” assumption stated in equation 1 is valid. One of the
standard ways of assessing its plausibility is to use data from the pre-treatment periods to
check whether trends were parallel in the past. If this is the case, it is likely that the results
achieved here stem from the treatment itself.
     ISTAT conducted an earlier university-to-work survey on 1992 graduates, who were
interviewed in 1995.31 As depicted in Figure 1, prior to 1998 the employment rate dynam-
ics for the control and the treatment groups were remarkably similar. We apply the DID
method with linear controls on data for 1992 and 1995 graduates, i.e. before AlmaLaurea
come into existence. Table 12 shows that the DID coefficient for unemployment is positive,

       Unfortunately the 1995 survey does not include data on wages.

negligible, and not statistically different from zero. The result is similar for mobility: the
AlmaLaurea coefficient is not statistically different from zero. This reduces the likelihood
that the coefficients in Tables 8 and 9 stem from unparallel trends in the two groups.
     Of course, the above checks do not control for time specific unparallel outcomes. In fact,
possible interactions between AlmaLaurea enrolment and unobserved time variant charac-
teristics cannot easily to be ruled out. One could argue, for example, that those universities
that self-selected in the treatment group are the ones whose unobservable teaching quality
improved most. This might affect the occupational outcomes of their graduates.
     To investigate this possibility we build a placebo treatment group composed of grad-
uates from the Universities of Siena and Lecce. According to AlmaLaurea official sources,
these universities decided to join AlmaLaurea in 1997, but did not start selling their stu-
dents’ résumés on-line until 1999 and 2003 respectively. If these graduates also experienced
an improvement vis-a-vis the others, the likelihood that AlmaLaurea enrolment proxies for
something else is higher. We run a regression similar to the one in equation 4, but with
graduates from Siena and Lecce as the treatment group and non-AlmaLaurea universities as
the control. Table 13 shows that this group experienced a slight increase in unemployment
and wages and a decrease in mobility. None of these changes is statistically significantly dif-
ferent from zero. These findings provide evidence against the possibility that enrollment in
the treatment group is correlated with unobservables that independently cause employment
improvements.

         7.     Alternative treatment and control groups and displacement effect

     The DID design can be further strengthened using alternative treatment and comparison
groups. In fact, this is likely to reduce the importance of biases or random variation occurring
in a single setting (Meyer 1995). In the ideal specification, treatment and control groups
should face the same time specific shocks: the more similar the two groups are the better.
Given that our dependent variables concern labor market outcomes and that according to
our data when the survey took place more than 75 per cent of Italian graduates reside in the
region where they attended university (see Table 7), a new sample is created including only
graduates from regions that include both AlmaLaurea and non-AlmaLaurea universities.
     Three Italian regions fit this criterion: Tuscany, Abruzzo, and Sicily. Graduates in
these regions represent about 17 percent of the entire population and, within this group,
about 57 percent of graduates are in the treatment group universities. As can be seen
form Figure 2, AlmaLaurea universities are Florence, Chieti, Catania and Messina. Non-
AlmaLaurea universities are Pisa, Siena, L’Aquila, Teramo, and Palermo. Table 14 shows
that with respect to the general case, in this setting AlmaLaurea has a stronger effect on
employment probability (3.5 points) and wages (5 percent) and about the same impact on
mobility. The result for wages is not statistically significant. Overall, however, the general
results are confirmed and even strengthened.
     This control exercise is also helpful for checking for an additional potential problem
in our analysis. As mentioned in Section 3, graduates from nearby universities might be
used to assess whether there is a displacement effect on non-AlmaLaurea students due to
a reallocation of hiring. Interactions are in fact more likely for graduates’ occupational
outcomes from nearby universities. Hence, for example, the impact of AlmaLaurea might be
exaggerated if individuals in the control group were negatively affected by AlmaLaurea itself.
For instance, Pisa, in principle, is a better control group for Florence than Bari; nevertheless,

the risk that its graduates’ labor market performance is negatively affected by the presence
of AlmaLaurea in Florence is higher. To control for this possibility, we perform a DID
analysis with non-AlmaLaurea universities in regions where there are AlmaLaurea universities
constituting the treatment group, with control group being the remaining non-AlmaLaurea
universities. From Table 15, it can be seen that there are no significant differences in the
trajectories of the two groups. This suggests that there are no major interactions among the
graduates in the two groups and AlmaLaurea does not have negative spillovers on universities
located close by.



                                                           8.     Conclusions

      Since the late 1990s we have seen a large increase in the importance of on-line labor
market intermediaries. While their diffusion may potentially improve labor market function-
ing increasing the total quantity and quality of matches, solid evidence on their benefits is
still missing. In addition, recent works have underlined the possibility of adverse selection
                                           – 29 –


in the use of electronic intermediaries among the unemployed (Kuhn and Skuterud 2004).
     In this article we exploited the exceptional case study provided by the early adoption
of the on-line intermediary AlmaLaurea by several Italian universities. The absence of other
electronic intermediaries for those universities that had not adopted AlmaLaurea at the
time of our study provides us with an adequate control group to estimate the effect of the
treatment.
    We employed the difference-in-differences method on a repeated cross section data set.
Given that enrolment in AlmaLaurea is not random, evaluating its impact is not trivial.
However, assuming parallel outcomes between treatment and control group makes our esti-
mation valid. The inclusion of time variant indicators concerning individual and university
characteristics and standard tests aimed at ruling out alternative explanations do not raise
major concerns in relation to this important assumption.
     The evidence shows that the adoption of the on-line labor market intermediary un-
der study improved graduates’ labor market outcomes three years after graduation. In
particular, according to our most conservative estimate, AlmaLaurea decreased graduates’
unemployment probability by about 1.6 percentage points.
     Our study also suggests that on-line labor market intermediaries may have a positive
effect on matching quality. In fact, in our case study, the wage of graduates from member
universities increased by about 3 percent. Finally, we also observe an increase in mobility
by about 2.4 percentage points.
     The findings of this paper are specific to a given segment of the labor market (i.e.
university-to-work transition) and to a peculiar electronic intermediary. Thus, their external
validity has to be carefully assessed. In particular, the single characteristic of AlmaLaurea
that possibly made it a successful intermediary is also the most unusual: member universities
certify the information contained in electronic curricula and also provide some information
on the entire population of graduates. This important caveat helps to integrate our findings
within the existing literature that does not find any effect of on-line search on the overall
unemployment rates and duration (Kuhn and Skuterud 2004; Kroft and Pope 2008).
     The results presented in this paper also contribute to the policy discussion on the
university-to-work transition. The poor labor performance of Italian graduates has been
traditionally ascribed to demand and supply factors. We show that graduate labor market
functioning can also be improved by the introduction of on-line intermediaries.
    In future research we aim at exploring whether the positive impact of electronic labor
market intermediaries affects the whole graduate population evenly. Also, while in this paper
                                           – 30 –


we focus on average outcomes, the effect on outcome distribution remains an issue for further
research.
