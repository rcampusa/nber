Asset Pricing with Heterogeneous Consumers and
Limited Participation: Empirical Evidence

                                           ABSTRACT

        The Euler equations of consumption are tested on the household consumption of non-durables
and services, reconstructed from the CEX database. The estimated relative risk aversion coefficient
of the representative household decreases, and the estimated unexplained mean equity premium
decreases, as infra marginal asset holders are eliminated from the sample. These results provide
evidence of limited capital market participation. The estimated unexplained mean equity premium
decreases when the assumption of complete consumption insurance is relaxed. The estimated
correlation between the equity premium and the cross-sectional variance of the households’
consumption growth is negative, as required, if the relaxation of market completeness is to contribute
towards the explanation of the premium. The overall evidence from asset prices in favor of
relaxing the assumption of complete consumption insurance is weak. An extensive Monte Carlo
investigation highlights the relationship between the economic implications of limited participation
and the resulting statistical properties of commonly used test statistics. The simulation results
provide direct evidence relating observation error in consumption and the resulting small-sample
of the test statistics.
