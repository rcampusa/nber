Incentivizing Negative Emissions Through Carbon Shares

NBER Working Paper No. 27880
October 2020
JEL No. G12,H23,Q54,Q58

                                         ABSTRACT

I show that commonly proposed emission taxes are not optimal for controlling climate change:
they can achieve zero emissions but cannot induce negative emissions. The first-best policy
charges firms period by period for leaving a stock of carbon in the atmosphere, not just for
injecting carbon into the atmosphere. I develop a feasible version of this policy that requires
emitters to post an upfront bond that finances a transferable asset (a "carbon share"). The
regulator reduces this asset's face value as damages accumulate and pays out the asset's remaining
face value once its holder removes the underlying unit of carbon from the atmosphere. I show that
the optimal bond is equal to the maximum possible marginal damage from climate change, with
the carbon share paying a dividend as long as the worst-case is not realized. Quantitatively, a
bond that is double the optimal emission tax is sufficient to provide optimal carbon removal
incentives in 95% of cases.

1       Introduction
Countries and corporations are increasingly adopting ambitious goals of eliminating or offset-
ting all greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the century, if not sooner.1 What happens
once these targets are reached? Harm from carbon dioxide will not cease at this point, as
old emissions will remain in the atmosphere. The role for policy should also not cease: it
is unlikely that the optimal policy would stop precisely at zero emissions, forgoing use of
the several technologies for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.2 In fact, many
models suggest that achieving global temperature targets will require negative emissions over
the latter part of the century (e.g., Clarke et al., 2014; Rogelj et al., 2015, 2018; Hilaire et al.,
2019; Realmonte et al., 2019). Yet there has been little analysis of market-based mechanisms
for implementing such targets.
    The standard economic prescription for climate change requires taxing emissions (or,
equivalently for present purposes, capping emissions) so that market actors account for
the external costs that their emissions cause through global climate change.3 However, it
typically escapes notice that an emission price contains a sharp discontinuity: it incentivizes
emission reductions up to the point at which there are no further emissions from the present
period, but it does not incentivize the further emission reductions that would offset emissions
from past periods. A policymaker constrained to using emission taxes is constrained from
ever implementing negative emissions without additional direct government procurement,
regardless of what the policymaker learns about the severity of climate change impacts or
about the evolving cost of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This constraint
is not costly if there is no chance that the policymaker would choose to incentivize negative
emissions. But the increasing adoption of zero emission targets and the ongoing progress in
carbon dioxide removal technologies combine to suggest that negative emissions are in fact
    1
     For instance, France and the United Kingdom have passed laws requiring carbon neu-
trality by 2050.        The European Union subsequently adopted the same target in its Green
Deal. For some of the corporate commitments, see https://sciencebasedtargets.org/2020/06/04/
corporate-commitments-to-1-5c-and-net-zero-ramp-up-on-world-environment-day/ and https://
www.majorityaction.us/netzero.
   2
     Recognizing this, Microsoft has committed not just to eliminating ongoing emissions by 2030 but also
to removing all of its historical emissions from the atmosphere by 2050.
   3
     Much work has also discussed how the first-best policy is in fact a portfolio that also includes policies
such as R&D subsidies that account for other market failures (e.g., Fischer and Newell, 2008; Nordhaus, 2008;
Acemoglu et al., 2012; Lemoine, 2020). Most see Pigouvian emission pricing as critical to that portfolio. I
here emphasize that corrective emission price.

quite plausible.4
    Policy should recognize that the social harm from carbon dioxide follows not from its
emission but from the choice to leave it in the atmosphere. A carbon stock tax ("atmospheric
rental policy") explodes the Pigouvian emission tax into its constituent strip of period-by-
period marginal damages. It charges firms period-by-period for renting atmospheric storage,
with the charges based on same-period damages.5 This policy treats current and past emis-
sions symmetrically, so it maintains first-best abatement incentives up to the point at which
all covered emissions have been removed from the atmosphere. This constraint is unlikely
to bind if the policy is implemented soon.
    However, the carbon stock tax requires today's firms to survive over many decades until
removing near-term emissions becomes likely, and it also requires today's firms to anticipate
surviving that long so that they internalize future charges when choosing current emissions.
In reality, substantial market churn is likely over a 50-year-plus horizon, even for large energy
firms.6 This problem is a version of judgment-proofness (Shavell, 1986). I show that the
regulator can restore optimal emission incentives under the simplest form of bankruptcy risk
by making each period's charge a weighted average of the Pigouvian emission tax and the
optimal rental charge described above. But such a policy still fails to incentivize the removal
of bankrupt firms' emissions from the atmosphere.
    To avoid such problems, I develop a new type of policy that I call carbon shares. Each
emitter posts a bond and receives a carbon share attached to the unit of emission. The
emitter can choose to retain or sell its carbon share. Initially, the face value of the carbon
share is the bond. In each subsequent period, the regulator pays a dividend to the holder of
the share and deducts both that dividend and a damage charge from the face value of the
share. If the owner of a share ever removes the unit of carbon attached to it, then the owner

     Carbon dioxide removal, or negative emission, strategies include chemically separating carbon dioxide
from air ("direct air capture"), capturing the emissions from power plants that burn biomass ("bioenergy with
carbon capture and storage"), accelerating the weathering of rocks, enhancing uptake of carbon by forests
or oceans, and more. See National Research Council (2015), Fuss et al. (2018), and National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2018) for recent reviews.
   5
     A conventional emission tax charges emitters for transferring their carbon dioxide to the public for
storage in the atmosphere. The public bears the responsibility for removing that carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere if damages turn out to be large or removal turns out to be cheap. I explore policies that do not
require direct government procurement or net outlays from the public purse.
   6
     Plus there could be principal-agent problems preventing firms from fully internalizing charges that will
arise many decades down the line.

receives the remaining face value and the share is retired. In essence, the share is an option
to recover the remaining face value, with the strike price being the cost of carbon removal.
This policy converts past emissions into a valuable asset that investors want to own, whether
or not the emitter continues to exist.
    I show that the optimal carbon share policy combines the first-best emission and removal
incentives of the stock tax with the judgment-proof upfront payments of the emission tax.
The regulator should set the initial bond at least equal to the worst-case social cost of
carbon emissions based on information available at the time of emission.7 In each period, the
deducted damage charge should be equal to the current period's marginal damage estimate,
which was also the optimal stock tax. The dividends return the difference between an
updated estimate of the worst-case social cost of carbon and the previous estimate. The
shareholder thus receives substantial dividends if climate change turns out to impose small
costs and few dividends if climate damages turn out to be large. Shareholders remove their
carbon in order to recover the stream of future damage charges, which leads them to weigh
the cost of carbon removal against the expected remaining marginal harm from atmospheric
carbon. Emitters' incentives are also first-best: emitters pay the worst-case social cost of
carbon but receive a valuable asset in return, and I show that their net outlays are equal to
the expected social cost of carbon. Emitters' upfront net outlays are therefore exactly the
same as under the Pigouvian emission tax.
    I quantitatively assess the benefits of carbon shares within a conventional economic model
of climate change. I assume that the true costs of climate change are initially unknown but
revealed in 2065. Their variance is determined by the results of a recent expert survey
(Pindyck, 2019). The first-best policy nearly always uses negative emissions at some future
time, and may even do so in 2065. If the policymaker required a bond double what the year
2015 emission tax would have been, then the policymaker could fund the ex post optimal
series of charges in over 95% of damage realizations. By enabling negative emissions, the
carbon share policy increases the benefits from implementing climate policy by nearly 10%.
    The recommendation to address climate change through Pigouvian emission pricing dates
back at least to Nordhaus (1977). In fact, Nordhaus (1977) observes that there are two strate-
gies for controlling carbon dioxide: reducing emissions and cleaning it from the atmosphere
   7
    "Social cost of carbon" is sometimes used to indicate the marginal welfare loss from carbon emissions
along a business-as-usual pathway. I here use it to refer to marginal welfare loss along the optimal pathway.

ex post. He restricts attention to the first in order "to avoid the odor of science fiction" (pg
343). More recently, Nordhaus (2019) decides to ignore carbon removal on the premise that
it is not available at both scale and reasonable cost. The most recent (2016R) version of his
benchmark DICE integrated assessment model does allow limited negative emissions after
2150, but versions as late as 2007 constrained emissions to be weakly positive in all periods.
     Much other literature is more optimistic about the costs and scalability of carbon re-
moval technologies, with several climate-economy models even showing heavy use of such
technologies around midcentury (e.g., Obersteiner et al., 2001; Azar et al., 2010; Clarke
et al., 2014; Rogelj et al., 2015, 2018; Hilaire et al., 2019; Realmonte et al., 2019). Further,
Microsoft and Stripe each recently committed to paying for carbon dioxide removal services.
Despite the increasingly prominent discussion of carbon dioxide removal, I know of no work
on market-based approaches to incentivizing optimal use of these technologies. Indeed, these
technologies pose no special problems if aggregate emissions are guaranteed to remain posi-
tive.8 I here investigate how to provide optimal incentives for carbon dioxide removal in the
realistic case where we do not know in advance whether we should utilize these technologies
to drive net emissions below zero.9
     Although climate change policy has been almost exclusively focused on controlling the
injection of pollution into the atmosphere, the broader environmental policy literature grap-
ples with the need to clean up pollution that has already been released. This literature has
discussed bonding and deposit-refund schemes as solutions to the problem of monitoring
improper waste disposal.10 I obtain a sharp result: the required bond (or deposit) should
    8
      Conventional emission pricing policies could incentivize use of carbon dioxide removal technologies up to
the point at which net emissions are zero. However, the European Union's flagship cap-and-trade program
does not in practice provide the credits for carbon dioxide removal that could provide even this limited
incentive (Scott and Geden, 2018). Hilaire et al. (2019) conclude their review by noting that negative
emissions would require large-scale government financing. My new mechanism obviates this need.
    9
      In an earlier working paper, I informally described the possibility of charging emitters based on their
greenhouse gas property left in the atmosphere (Lemoine, 2007). In a deterministic model, Yang and Davis
(2018) show that incentivizing optimal mine remediation requires placing a Pigouvian tax on the stock of
damaged land, not on the flow of damaged land. This result mirrors the advantage of atmospheric rental
charges over Pigouvian emission taxes. Numerical examples in White et al. (2012) suggest that combining the
mining stock tax with an assurance bond can improve welfare in the presence of bankruptcy risk. Goodkind
and Coggins (2015) investigate the implications of corner solutions in abatement for the choice between price
and quantity instruments but do not consider how to transcend corner solutions. I discuss quantity policies
in the conclusion.
   10
      Torsello and Vercelli (1998) review the history of bonding analyses. Bonding has been proposed for mon-
itoring long-term underground storage of sequestered carbon (Klass and Wilson, 2008; Gerard and Wilson,

be set to the worst-case social cost of carbon. Others have proposed that fees on materials
or products be set to the most harmful possible environmental fate, with the fee refunded
in accord with the harmfulness of actual outcomes (e.g., Solow, 1971; Mills, 1972; Bohm
and Russell, 1985; Costanza and Perrings, 1990; Boyd, 2002). These informal proposals
rely on arguments ranging from ambiguity aversion to difficulties in monitoring pollution
to judgment-proofness. The long timespans over which carbon emissions affect the atmo-
sphere make the judgment-proofness argument especially salient here. I formally show how
the worst-case bond can be used to finance a transferable asset that reduces the bond's
upfront cost to emitters, does not burden the regulator with cleaning up past emissions in
the event that emitters forsake the bond, and provides first-best incentives for both emission
and cleanup.
    The next section contains the theoretical analysis. Section 3 quantifies the welfare gains
from using carbon shares instead of emission taxes. The final section concludes. The ap-
pendix details the numerical model.


2     Theoretical Analysis
Consider a world with many small firms and infinitely many periods. Index firms by i, and
normalize total firms to be of measure 1. Firm i's business-as-usual emissions in period t are
eit > 0. Firm i can choose to eliminate quantity Ait  eit of time t emissions. Abatement
cost Cit (Ait ) is strictly increasing and strictly convex, with Cit (0) = 0 for convenience (where
primes indicate derivatives). Each firm can also fund the removal of quantity Zit  0 of emis-
sions from the atmosphere. It purchases this emission removal from a competitive industry

and strictly convex in Zt . The random variable g        ~t shifts the marginal cost of emission re-
moval, with Gt (Zt ) increasing in g   ~t . Its value is known to all firms in period t, and it has
support between g L and g H , where g L < g H . Current emissions can be offset either by
2009). Such a policy could be important for ensuring the success of carbon removal. I here instead focus on
incentives to undertake carbon removal. Deposit-refund schemes have been justified as a means to disincen-
tivize illegal, hard-to-monitor dumping of sulfur emissions (Bohm, 1981), hazardous waste (Russell, 1987),
or municipal waste (Fullerton and Kinnaman, 1995). Deposit-refund schemes have also been understood as
means to avoid the fiscal costs of subsidies and the distributional costs of taxes (Bohm, 1981). Here the
motivation is to overcome an inefficiency in conventional tax policies without incurring additional fiscal costs
from using the public purse to directly fund carbon removal.

abatement or by removal, but abatement is the cheaper option for the first unit of emissions:
Gt (0; g L ) > Cit (0). Firms seek to minimize their costs, subject to current and anticipated
policies.
    A policymaker begins to implement policy in period 0. Let cumulative emissions up to

recognizes that carbon dioxide is a globally mixed pollutant and follows recent scientific
findings that global temperature is approximately a linear function of cumulative emissions

random variable d    ~t shifts marginal social damage, with D (Tt ) increasing in d~t .12 Its value is

known to all firms in period t, and it has support between dL and dH , where dL < dH . For
convenience, let the random variables g               ~t be jointly Markovian.

    The regulator chooses period t policy to minimize expected discounted social costs, with
knowledge of the random variables' realizations up to and including time t. The per-period
discount rate is r. The time t regulator correctly understands the distribution of the random
variables and rebates any tax revenue lump-sum.

     Allowing time t emissions to affect temperature only with a lag would not qualitatively change the
results.

These conditions equate the marginal private cost of abatement and emission removal to
their marginal social benefits, as is familiar.13 These conditions and the constraints implicitly
define unique Aopt            ~t ) and Ztopt (Mt , g    ~t ).14 Emission removal would be used while

Gt (0).


2.2     Emission Tax Policy
Now consider a regulator seeking to control emissions through emission taxes. Firms report
their emissions net of any removal they fund and pay t per unit in period t. Firm i solves:

tax                                                                                          1      tax
it  (t ) =       min           Cit (Ait ) + pt Zit + max{0, t [eit - Ait - Zit ]} +             Et  i (t+1) (t+1 )    ,
             Ait eit ,Zit 0                                                                 1+r

where pt is the cost of emission removal and where I suppress dependence of it on the
random variables. Funding emission removal allows the firm to avoid paying a tax but does
  13
     One might wonder why the marginal cost of abatement is equated to the sum of future marginal damages
out to an infinite horizon if there is a chance of removing a unit of today's emissions at some future time. The
reason is that such removal is not free: by equation (2), optimal use of emission removal equates its marginal
cost to the sum of marginal damage over all remaining periods. Equating current marginal abatement cost
to the sum of all future marginal damage thus incorporates both expected realized marginal damage and
expected future spending on emission removal.
  14
     The first-best allocation does not specify which firms pay for emission removal because that allocation
does not affect real outcomes. In contrast, the first-best allocation does specify that firms equalize marginal
abatement costs.

not entitle the firm to a subsidy if total removal exceeds eit - Ait . Firms therefore never
choose Ait + Zit > eit . At an interior solution, the first-order conditions imply

In equilibrium, pt = Gt (Zt ), so the second condition implies:

                                                                   Gt (Zt ) =t .                                              (4)

not affect firm i's net emissions because all emissions have either been eliminated or offset
by emission removal. That maximum tax is the smallest it such that

I denote this tax   t . This is the instrument familiar from previous literature (e.g., Nordhaus,
1982, 1991; Farzin, 1996). It is the unique optimal tax as long as          t    ¯t . If  t >    ¯t , then
any t      ¯t is an optimum.
    Comparing the resulting firm first-order conditions to (1) and (2), we see that, given
whatever emission decisions were made prior to time t, two conditions must hold for the
regulator to implement the first-best allocation in time t. First,       t must be weakly less than
¯it for all firms i, so that no firms merely eliminate their emissions instead of undertaking
negative emissions. This in turn happens if either d    ~t is sufficiently small or g ~t is sufficiently
large. Second, Et+s [Dt+s (Tt+s )] must be as in first-best for all s > 0. This latter condition
occurs if and only if either (i)     ¯i(t+s) cannot bind for any i at any s  0 or (ii) Dt+s (·)
is linear for all s  j , where j is the first time at which          ¯ij might bind for some i. If
condition (i) does not hold, then there are states of the world in which some firms merely
eliminate emissions, making Tt+s larger than first-best for all sufficiently large s. As a result,
Et [Dt+s (Tt+s )] becomes larger than first-best for some s > 0 if condition (ii) also does not
hold. When the regulator cannot implement first-best, the unconstrained-optimal tax                      t
obtains more abatement than in first-best in order to compensate for the reality that some
time t firms merely eliminate their emissions instead of undertaking negative emissions or
for the possibility that future taxes will not obtain the future negative emissions potentially
required by first-best.
    The following proposition formalizes the foregoing results.

Proposition 1.

   1. Ex-Ante Optimality: Looking forward from time 0, {      t }t=0 will achieve the first-best

Proof.

   1. Follows from the foregoing analysis, defining d ¯t as the smallest d ~t such that t = ¯it for
      some firm i at g      L
                     ~t = g , recognizing that   ¯it is increasing in g                   ¯
                                                                       ~t , and defining d as the
                     ¯t .
      infimum of the d

   2. Condition (i) follows by definition. For condition (ii), assume that {           t }st=0 does not
      achieve first-best ex ante, which means that      ¯it binds in some state of the world and
      at some time t. Let k be the first time at which          ¯it binds for some i. Et-j [Dt (Tt )]
      (for j  [0, t]) is the same in equations (1), (2), and (6) if and only if each Dt (·) is
                                                                                            opt       opt
      linear for all t  k . And from equations (3) and (4), {      t }s t=0 implements Ait and Zt
      from periods 0 through s if and only if, first, Et-j [Dt (Tt )] (for j  [0, t]) is the same
      in equations (1), (2), and (6) and, second,     t    ¯it for all firms i and all t  [0, s]. We
      know that                      ~
                   t decreases in dt and that   ¯it increases in g ~t , so  t          ~t is sufficiently
                                                                                ¯it if d
      small or g~t is sufficiently large. The proposition follows.



We have detected a new inefficiency when high damages and/or cheap removal imply         t >  ¯it
for some firm i. The cost of the tax policy relative to first-best depends on the probability
of wanting some firms to undertake negative emissions and on the convexity of abatement
and emission removal supply curves in regions with negative emissions. If abatement and
removal costs are highly convex around each      ¯it , then larger taxes would not substantially
affect the climate even if firm i were incentivized to undertake negative emissions, so the loss
from being unable to incentivize negative emissions is small.
    The regulator could of course implement the optimal allocation if it could subsidize
emission removal based on lump-sum taxation. However, such subsidies may be politically
infeasible or may be financed only through distortionary taxation.15 I henceforth consider
  15
     From equation (2), financing the subsidies through retained emission tax revenue can be insufficient
to finance first-best negative emissions if marginal damage ends up greater than expected and negative
emissions are substantial, two characteristics that are likely to be correlated. Also note that using emission
tax revenue to fund emission removal is costly if this revenue could have been used to cut distortionary taxes
(Goulder, 1995).

policies that can implement the optimal allocation without requiring net outlays from the
public purse.


2.3    Atmospheric Rental Policy
Now consider taxing the stock of carbon rather than the emission of carbon. I refer to this
stock tax as an atmospheric rental policy to differentiate it from standard carbon (emission)
taxes: it charges firms period-by-period for their ongoing use of atmospheric storage. The
regulator charges firms t for each unit of current or past emissions remaining in the atmo-
sphere at the end of period t. Under familiar emission tax policies, firms pay a tax only in
the period in which they emit; under the atmospheric rental policy, firms pay a tax in every
period from the time of emission until the time of emission removal (should it occur). The
optimal level of the charge will of course differ between the two policies.
   Let Mit indicate firm i's cumulative emissions from time 0 up to time t:

                                                 t-1
                                        Mit =          [eis - Ais - Zis ].
                                                 s=0


At time t, firm i solves:

   rental
   it     (t , Mit , Mt ) =       min          Cit (Ait ) + pt Zit + max{0, t [eit - Ait - Zit + Mit ]}
                              Ait eit ,Zit 0

                                                    1+r

where I again suppress dependence of it on the random variables. The maximization prob-
lem differs from that under the tax policy only in that payments here depend on the history
of abatement and emission removal decisions. Firms now never choose Ait + Zit > eit + Mit .

Proposition 2. The unique time-consistent policy that satisfies (7) sets t =  Dt (Tt ) at
every time t  0.

Proof. A time-consistent policy that satisfies (7) also satisfies:
                                                      
                          1                                   1
                                Et+1 [t+1+s ] =                     Et+1 [Dt+1+s (Tt+1+s )].
                 s=0
                       (1 + r)s                      s=0
                                                           (1 + r)s

Taking expectations of both sides with respect to the time t information set and using the
law of iterated expectations, we have:
                                                      
                             1                                1
                                   Et [t+1+s ] =                    Et [Dt+1+s (Tt+1+s )].
                    s=0
                          (1 + r)s                   s=0
                                                           (1 + r)s

Using this, (7) becomes:
                                              t =  Dt (Tt ).

The proposition follows from observing that the choice of t was arbitrary and that condi-
tion (7) holds if t+s =  Dt+s (Tt+s ) for all s  0.


I denote the charge derived in Proposition 2 as   t .
    In Section 2.2, the regulator's desired emission tax t was the present value of the strip
of marginal damages incurred by a unit of emissions. Using equation (6), we have:
                                              
                                                      1          t+s ].
                                       t =                  Et [                                         (8)
                                             s=0
                                                   (1 + r)s

The optimal rental policy explodes this strip into its constituent pieces, charging firms only as
damages are realized and only on the condition that their emissions remain in the atmosphere.
Firms' interior solutions are the same whether they face      t or the stream of  t+s .17 Define
¯it as the smallest t such that


                                        Atax   tax
                                         it + Zit = eit + Mit .                                          (9)
  17
     The result relies on forward-looking firms discounting the future at the same rate as the regulator. The
next section will show how policy can overcome firms using higher discount rates, there driven by bankruptcy
risk. See Barrage (2018) for further analysis of differential social and private discounting.

We immediately have the analogue of the analysis in Section 2.2: the rental policy achieves
first-best abatement and emission removal in period t as long as
                                       
                                                1          t+s ]

                                       s=0
                                             (1 + r)s

for all firms i and either the analogous condition holds for all later times at all feasible
states or each Dt+s (·) is linear for all s sufficiently large.18 Comparing equations (5) and (9),
¯it  
       ¯it : the rental policy can obtain more abatement and emission removal than can the
emission tax policy and can therefore achieve first-best in a weakly larger set of cases than
can the emission tax policy.
    Two points are of special policy relevance. First, note that the optimal allocation would
                  1                        1
never have 0 Ait di + Zt > Mt + 0 eit di as Mt  0 (because Dt (0) = 0). In that case,
¯t supi 
             ¯it never binds, so that the rental charge policy can always attain the optimum. It
is therefore important to begin implementing the rental policy early, when the preexisting
emissions M0 that escape later charges are still small. Second,       ¯t is independent of emission
taxes chosen in periods s < t but      ¯t decreases in rental charges chosen in periods s < t. The
gains from using a rental policy vanish if those earlier charges were so large as to eliminate
earlier emissions (implying      ¯t = ¯t ), but the gains potentially become large if those earlier
charges were so small that they left substantial emissions in the atmosphere (permitting
¯t
       ¯t ). If policy must be lax in some early periods (whether due to optimal choices or
political constraints), then the gains from using a rental policy are potentially large. Putting
these points together, it becomes especially important to immediately begin a rental policy
precisely in the case in which policymakers insist on implementing an emission charge that
is much smaller than the optimal charge. In such cases, high early emissions make negative
emissions more likely to be desirable in later periods. Starting a rental policy earlier provides
greater scope for obtaining these negative emissions through decentralized market incentives.
  18
     As in Section 2.2, the regulator obtains more time t abatement and emission removal than in first-best
if the analogous condition might not hold at some later time and Dt+s (·) is nonlinear at some sufficiently
large s. Now, however, that additional abatement and emission removal arises not because the regulator
implements a more stringent time t policy but because firms expect the regulator to implement a more
stringent policy at the later time t + s.

2.4     The Challenge of Market Churn
Instead of compiling the stream of expected marginal damages into a single emission charge,
the rental policy requires firms to pay for marginal damages period by period. However,
damages from climate change unfold over a very long time.19 If firms declare bankruptcy,
then they will not be around to pay to remove their old emissions from the atmosphere.
Moreover, if they anticipate that they may not be in business at some later time, then they
may overemit in the near term because their emissions appear less costly.20
    Let each firm have probability  of declaring bankruptcy between any two periods. So as
not to conflate issues, imagine that each firm is replaced by a similar firm, leaving aggregate
business-as-usual emissions unaffected. The chance of bankruptcy reduces firm i's discount
factor to (1 - )/(1 + r). The chance of bankruptcy does not affect firms' decisions under the
emission tax policy and thus does not affect the optimal emission tax. However, under the
rental policy, bankruptcy risk leads firms to undertake less abatement and emission removal
for a given sequence of anticipated charges. Moreover, the realization of bankruptcy also
reduces Mit to 0, as the new firm i does not carry old emission liabilities. The maximum level
of abatement plus emission removal that firm i will undertake therefore falls after bankruptcy.
    For the regulator, equation (7) becomes:

      The appendix shows that the rental charges that comprise the currently optimal emission tax remain
significant for a century or more.
   20
      The atmospheric rental charge policy could have instead been implemented by capping cumulative
emissions in each period and requiring current and past emitters to have a permit. This quantity version of
the policy is subject to the same concerns about bankruptcy risk.

                              Et+1 [t+1+s ] =                   Et+1 [Dt+1+s (Tt+1+s )].
               s=0
                     (1 + r)s                    s=0
                                                       (1 + r)s

Taking expectations of both sides with respect to the time t information set and using the
law of iterated expectations, we have:
                                                 
                        (1 - )s                           1
                                 Et [t+1+s ] =                  Et [Dt+1+s (Tt+1+s )].
                  s=0
                        (1 + r)s                 s=0
                                                       (1 + r)s

Using this in (11), simplifying, and adding and subtracting   Dt (Tt ), we have:
                                                    
                                                            1
                     t =(1 - )  Dt (Tt ) +                        Et [Dt+s (Tt+s )].
                                                   s=0
                                                         (1 + r)s

The proposition follows from observing that the choice of t was arbitrary and using the
definitions of t and t .



The optimal charge is a weighted average of the Pigouvian emission tax and the optimal
rental charge in the absence of bankruptcy risk. As   0, bankruptcy becomes highly
unlikely and we are back to the optimal rental charge analyzed in Section 2.3. As   1,
firms survive for only a single period. We are back to the Pigouvian emission tax analyzed
in Section 2.2, as we must force firms to pay for all future social costs at the time they emit.
In between these two extremes, the optimal charge forces firms to immediately pay for the
time t slice of marginal social costs associated with time t emissions and also forces them to
pay for a share of future marginal social costs that reflects their chance of going bankrupt
before paying future charges.
    The following corollary establishes that firms' incentives to reduce emissions are as in
first-best, as long as firms' solutions are interior:

Corollary 4. Under the policy from Proposition 3, firms' interior solutions are defined by
equations (1) and (2).

The optimal policy successfully forces firms to internalize the social cost of their emissions,
despite bankruptcy risk. There is no inefficiency in incentives at the time of emission.21
The inefficiency arises, as before, from incentives to undertake negative emissions. That
inefficiency is less severe than in the case of an emission tax, because firms are charged
for past emissions and thus do have an incentive to remove them. But the possibility of
bankruptcy reduces the gains relative to an emission tax: if firm i has replaced an older firm
that went bankrupt (or, equivalently, if firm i represents a firm that survived but shed its
liabilities through bankruptcy), then Mit in equation (9) is smaller than it would have been
in the absence of bankruptcy. At sufficiently large charges, firm i might pay for less emission
removal than if it were accountable for the full history of emissions by firms of type i.
    In practice, negative emissions may not be optimal until midcentury or later. The risk of
any given firm declaring bankruptcy between now and then is not small. These bankruptcies
will erode the ability of a system of rental charges to incentivize negative emissions by eroding
the base of emission liabilities subject to the charge. I next consider a policy that successfully
incentivizes negative emissions even in the presence of arbitrarily severe bankruptcy risk.


2.5     Carbon Shares
We seek a policy that can motivate firms to undertake first-best emission reductions and
carbon removal without being vulnerable to the chance that firms go bankrupt before carbon
removal becomes optimal. I now propose a new type of policy: carbon shares. This policy
will combine the advantage of emission taxes in collecting payment at the time of emission
with the advantage of rental charges in preserving incentives to remove old emissions from
the atmosphere.
    A carbon share policy requires firms to post a bond t per unit of time t emissions. This
bond is used to finance a transferable asset that the emitter receives from the regulator.
This asset is attached to the unit of carbon emitted. I refer to the asset as a carbon share
because it reflects a claim on a part of the carbon in the atmosphere. The face value of the
  21
     In practice the probability of bankruptcy will vary across firms. In that case, an additional inefficiency
will arise if each firm knows its own probability of bankruptcy and the regulator is unable to tailor the charge
to each type of firm. I here show that even the simplest form of bankruptcy risk creates distortions when
negative emissions might be optimal.

carbon share in each period t + s is Bt,t+s , with Bt,t = t . In each period subsequent to
emission, shareholders decide whether to leave the unit of carbon in the atmosphere. If they
remove that unit of carbon from the atmosphere in time t + s, they receive Bt,t+s ; otherwise
they receive a dividend t,t+s . The policymaker can also charge t,t+s to the face value of
the asset. The face value of the asset evolves as Bt,t+s+1 = (1 + r)(Bt,t+s - t,t+s - t,t+s ).
The policymaker cannot return or deduct any more than the current value of the asset:
t,t+s + t,t+s  Bt,t+s . The policymaker must eventually allocate the entire original bond to
either dividends or declared charges: lims Bt,t+s = 0.
    The carbon share is an option to obtain the face value of the bond by spending on carbon
removal. The option's holder will not exercise it unless doing so creates value. The option's
holder receives the dividends t,t+s whether exercising or holding the option, but the option's
holder loses the charges t,t+s as long as the option is unexercised. The option's value is
t,t+s . Clearly, t,t  t and t,t+s  0. At the time of emission, the firm's net outlays per
unit of non-abated emissions are t - t,t  0. If a firm that held a carbon share were to
declare bankruptcy or otherwise liquidate, its creditors would want the carbon share so they
could receive its dividends and have the option to eventually reclaim its face value.
    The benefit from exercising the option in period t + s is
                                    
                                              1
                         Bt,t+s =                   Et+s [t,t+s+j + t,t+s+j ].               (12)

                                           (1 + r)j

The cost of exercising the option is the cost pt+s of removing the unit of carbon plus the
cost Et+s [t,t+s+1 ]/(1 + r) of losing the option in the future plus the cost of not receiving the
dividend t,t+s . In a competitive equilibrium with abundant carbon shares, agents exercise
their options up to the point at which the cost of removal absorbs the profits from exercise:

                                                1
                          pt+s = Bt,t+s -          Et+s [t,t+s+1 ] - t,t+s .                 (13)
                                               1+r

Agents may compete away the entire face value of the carbon share (i.e., pt+s  Bt,t+s - t,t+s )
because they must be compensated for forgoing the right to exercise the option in future
periods.
   The following proposition establishes the equilibrium value of the carbon share:

Proposition 5. In a competitive equilibrium,

Proof. Conjecture that the value of the carbon share depends linearly on each Et+s [t,t+s+j ]
and Et+s [t,t+s+j ]:
                                                               
              t,t+s =          t+s,t+s+j Et+s [t,t+s+j ] +           t+s,t+s+j Et+s [t,t+s+j ],

                                    j =0 and {t+s,t+s+j }j =0 , with the first subscript corre-
sponding to the evaluation period and the second subscript corresponding to the period in
which the dividend is received or the charge is incurred. The constant is zero because we
know t,t+s  0 as Bt,t+s  0. If the option is exercised in period t + s, its value is

                                         t,t+s =Bt,t+s - pt+s .

Using equation (13) and substituting for t,t+s+1 , we find

  t,t+s   =t,t+s +            t+s+1,t+s+j Et+s [t,t+s+j ] +                       t+s+1,t+s+j Et+s [t,t+s+j ].

(Note that this condition is identical to the condition that holds if an option is optimally
not exercised in period t + s.) Matching coefficients, t+s,t+s = 1, t+s,t+s = 0, t+s,t+s+j =
t+s+1,t+s+j /(1+r), and t+s,t+s+j = t+s+1,t+s+j /(1+r) for j  1. Advancing the analysis by
one timestep, we find t+s+1,t+s+1 = 1 and t+s+1,t+s+1 = 0. Therefore t+s,t+s+1 = 1/(1 + r)
and t+s,t+s+1 = 0. The proposition follows from repeating these steps for later time periods.


The equilibrium value of the carbon share is the expected present value of the dividends that

Exercising the carbon share asserts a claim to the present value of expected remaining
damage charges, but the equilibrium cost of exercising the share absorbs these benefits. The
value of the carbon share in (14) does not reflect future damage charges because their value
gets competed away in equilibrium.
   Substituting for equilibrium pt+s , equation (15) becomes:

Comparing to (2), we find that emission removal decisions are first-best if

                                    t,t+s+j = [Dt+s+j (Tt+s+j )]                                     (16)

require

The cost of emitting in period t is t - t,t , which from (14) is
                                              
                                                       1

                                                    (1 + r)j

Combining this, lims Bt,t+s = 0, and (17), we have:

    The optimal damage charge is the same for all emission vintages t because damages here depend only
on cumulative emissions.

Lemoine                                      September 2020                                Carbon Shares


Comparing to (1), we have first-best abatement incentives when t,t+j is as in (16). We can
therefore attain first-best as long as assets remain in the atmosphere, which is true as long as
carbon shares remain unexercised. This is exactly the same condition under which the rental
charge policy in Section 2.3 attains first-best. And just as in that case, we here can always
attain first-best when the policy is begun before too many emissions have accumulated (i.e.,
when M0 is small).
     This new policy overcomes the challenges posed by the long lifetime of emissions and the
potential of bankruptcy by creating a valuable asset that investors want to hold. That asset
is financed at the time of emission by the initial bond t . Interpreting (17), that initial bond
should be at least as large as the worst-case social cost of carbon. The potentially large
bond does not distort firms' abatement incentives because firms receive an asset whose value
increases in the size of the bond. Interpreting (16), the regulator should deduct the current
period's marginal damage from the face value of any share attached to units of carbon that
remain in the atmosphere. The dividends can be structured in any fashion so long as they
do not reduce the face value of the share below the current estimate of the worst-case social
cost of carbon. The dividend plan that returns the bond to shareholders in the most rapid
fashion refunds the change in the worst-case social cost of carbon from period to period.23
From (14), the value of the carbon share is then the difference between the worst-case social
cost of carbon and the expected social cost of carbon.
     One might be concerned that the initial bond would challenge firms' liquidity (see Shogren
et al., 1993). Note, however, that firms receive a carbon share with value t,t in exchange for
the bond t , and they can sell that asset on. Comparing (18) and (6), their net outlays per
unit of emissions are the exact same outlays required by the traditional Pigouvian carbon
tax. The carbon share policy therefore need not be any more financially challenging than a
conventional carbon emission tax, which is not typically described as challenging liquidity
constraints.24
  23
     If the worst-case social cost of carbon is calculated correctly, then its value must weakly decline from
period to period. If the worst-case social cost of carbon somehow increased over time, then the regulator
could require shareholders to increment the posted bond. The regulator in essence marks the face value of
the carbon share to the evolving worst-case damage estimate.
  24
     Direct outlays are also capped, for two reasons. First, the magnitude of the optimal bond is capped even
when marginal damages can become arbitrarily large as long as optimal policy can avoid incurring these
damages by removing carbon. Second, any firm could avoid posting the bond by reducing its emissions. The
growing number of firms making zero-emission pledges and recent cost projections for removal technologies
both suggest that even the maximum gross outlays are limited to a reasonable scale.

3      Quantitative Evaluation
I now quantitatively assess the level of the optimal bond and the gains from enabling negative
emissions. I extend the DICE-2016R climate-economy model of Nordhaus (2017) to allow
for uncertainty about damages from warming.25 Prior to 2065, the damage parameter is
fixed and known and negative emissions are not allowed. In 2065, a random component of
the damage parameter is realized and negative emissions become feasible. I calibrate the
variance of damages to the expert survey of year 2066 losses from climate change in Pindyck
(2019), following the implementation in Lemoine (2021) that adjusts for uncertainty about
warming. In one case ("DICE Damages"), I fix the mean of the distribution to match
damages in DICE-2016R, and in the other case ("Expert Damages"), I allow the mean to
also be determined by the expert survey. The latter case implies more severe losses from
warming. The appendix provides the full equations and parameterization. It also plots
optimal trajectories in a deterministic version of each calibration.
    Negative emissions are relevant. In the case with DICE damages, emissions are negative
in 2065 in 2.6% of cases, emissions are negative at some point after 2065 in 95% of cases,
and those negative emissions are substantial enough to eventually remove some pre-2065
emissions in 71% of cases. In the case with expert damages, emissions are negative in 2065
in 48% of cases (including at the mean--see the appendix), are always eventually negative at
some point after 2065, and are nearly always substantial enough to eventually remove some
pre-2065 emissions.
    Figure 1 plots the percentage of cases in which bonds of varying sizes end up being large
enough to fund the ex-post optimal sequence of per-period charges. The left panel shows
that the case with expert damages requires much larger bonds, reflecting its much larger
emission charges. A bond of 300 $/tCO2 covers 93% of outcomes under expert damages,
whereas a bond of 50 $/tCO2 covers 96% of outcomes in the case with DICE damages.
The right panel plots these same bonds as a percentage of the optimal year 2015 optimal
emission tax, which is 192 $/tCO2 in the case of expert damages and 23 $/tCO2 in the case
  25
     Because it allows abatement to exceed 100%, the abatement cost function in DICE-2016R implicitly
accounts for carbon dioxide removal technologies. I maintain this cost function and focus on uncertainty
about damages. Allowing for the possibility of cheaper carbon removal would increase the benefits of the
carbon share policy. A full analysis would incorporate uncertainty about these costs and about other pa-
rameters, including those controlling economic growth and the sensitivity of the climate to emissions. This
first analysis builds on evidence that uncertainty about damages is especially important (Lemoine, 2021).

           Balanced growth equivalent gain (BGE) is relative to a case with abatement
           fixed at zero (but savings optimized). The BGE translates changes in welfare
           into the constant relative difference in consumption between two counterfactual
           consumption trajectories that grow at the same constant rate (Mirrlees and
           Stern, 1972).


of DICE damages.26 The two curves track each other remarkably closely until we get to the
very highest damage realizations. Requiring that firms post a bond equal to twice what the
initial emission tax would have been has more than a 95% chance of covering the stream of
optimal damage charges.27
    Table 1 reports the balanced growth equivalent (BGE) increase in consumption from
implementing policy (Mirrlees and Stern, 1972). Policy is far more valuable in the calibration
to expert damages, providing expected benefits equivalent to a permanent 40% increase
in consumption as opposed to a permanent 1.5% increase in consumption. The second
row constrains the policymaker from obtaining negative emissions in any period, as when
implementing policy through an emission tax.28 This constraint imposes expected losses of
7­9%. Adopting a carbon share policy can thus substantially increase the potential value
from controlling emissions.
  26
     The optimal tax with DICE damages is slightly below the optimal tax of 31 $/tCO2 from DICE-2016R,
primarily because I update the carbon cycle and climate system in accord with recommendations in Dietz
et al. (2020). With either damage model, the initial period's optimal tax under uncertainty is very close to
the optimal tax without uncertainty.
  27
     Experiments with DICE damages and a lower utility discount rate of 0.1% per year (as in Stern, 2007)
suggest that both this result and the expected loss from using an emission tax (see below) are robust to that
discount rate.
  28
     The regulator chooses policy in full knowledge of this constraint. To correct for the chance that the
negative emission constraint will bind, the regulator increases the initial period's emission tax to 226 (24)
$/tCO2 with expert (DICE) damages.

4    Discussion
I have described a new climate change policy that replaces an emission tax with a bond used
to fund an asset called a "carbon share". The bond should be set equal to the worst-case
social cost of carbon, and the share's face value should be reduced as climate change damages
are realized. The share's remaining face value is refunded upon removing its underlying
unit of carbon from the atmosphere. This new policy improves on commonly proposed
emission tax and cap-and-trade policies by optimally incentivizing both emission reductions
and emission removal.
    There is an additional benefit to the carbon share policy that I have not explored formally.
By establishing a larger market for carbon removal technologies, this policy should accel-
erate those technologies' development. Further, if climate damages do end up warranting
negative emissions, then innovators should receive a strong signal in the form of high per-
period charges in advance of those technologies being needed. By directing innovation, the
carbon share policy offers additional insurance against worst-case outcomes. These effects
on technical change are difficult to quantify but could be especially important.
    A few objections may arise. First, one may wonder how the regulator is to develop an
estimate of either the period-by-period charge or the worst-case social cost of carbon. This
problem also bedevils Pigouvian emission pricing. In fact, the informational challenge is

                                           25 of 31
Lemoine                                      September 2020                              Carbon Shares


smaller under the carbon share policy than under conventional emission tax or cap-and-trade
policies: specifying the worst-case social cost of carbon is less informationally demanding
than specifying the expected social cost of carbon, the current period's charge is but one
piece of the current period's expected social cost of carbon, and we no longer have to adjust
current policy for the chance that a negative emission constraint will bind in the future.
    Second, one may be concerned about the regulator's incentive to confiscate the bonds
(see Shogren et al., 1993) or to set high per-period charges that raise revenue from inelastic,
prior emission decisions. Such concerns are valid, but they should be counterpoised against
concerns that shareholders would lobby for small per-period charges and against the possi-
bility that prior emissions may not in fact be inelastic. Further work should consider the
design of institutions in more detail, for this policy as well as for traditional emission taxes
and caps.
    Finally, I have described the carbon share as a price instrument, but it could be im-
plemented as a quantity instrument. The shares would be funded by the upfront bond as
already described, but instead of announcing charges period by period, the regulator would
announce a cap on cumulative emissions. Each shareholder would bid in the damage charge
above which they will remove their underlying unit of carbon from the atmosphere. The
market-clearing charge would be deducted from the face value of each outstanding share.29
Whether the regulator sets damage charges directly or discovers them after setting caps on
cumulative emissions, the key is that carbon shareholders will not pay out of pocket after the
time of emission and will trade off the cost of carbon removal against expected future charges.
The regulator thereby divorces cleanup from emission decisions and optimally incentivizes
each, enabling announced climate goals to be achieved through market-based policies.
