                                            ABSTRACT

This paper examines the roles that information and preferences play in determining whether
households choose schools with high value added. We study Romanian school markets using
administrative data, a survey, and an experiment. The administrative data show that, on average,
households could select schools with 1 s.d. worth of additional value added. This may reflect that
households have incorrect beliefs about schools' value added, or that their preferences lead them
to prioritize other school traits. We elicit households' beliefs and find that they explain less than a
fifth of the variation in value added. We then inform randomly selected households about the
value added of the schools in their towns. This improves the accuracy of households' beliefs and
leads low-achieving students to attend higher-value added schools. We next estimate households'
preferences and predict their choices under the counterfactual of fully accurate beliefs. We find
that beliefs account for 18 (11) percent of the value added that households with low- (high-)
achieving children leave unexploited. Interestingly, for households with low-achieving children,
the experiment seems to have affected both beliefs and preferences. This generates larger effects
on choices than would be predicted via impacts on beliefs alone.

Introduction
Recent papers study whether households choose high-value added options across a series of do-
mains. For instance, whether households choose residential neighborhoods that boost children's
adult outcomes (Chetty et al. 2018), whether they select effective healthcare providers (Chandra
et al. 2016), and whether they choose productive schools and colleges (Beuermann et al. 2019;
Abdulkadiroglu et al. 2020; Chetty et al. 2020).
    These questions matter for multiple reasons. First, they reveal whether households benefit
from their choices, at least along the dimensions that researchers measure. In addition, they
provide evidence on whether choice incentivizes providers to compete on value added--as opposed
to other dimensions of service quality.1
    Such work typically finds that households leave substantial value added "on the table." For
instance, while better neighborhoods often have higher housing prices, there are "opportunity
bargains" that produce good outcomes and are relatively affordable (Chetty and Hendren 2018).
Similarly, while more selective colleges tend to be better at increasing earnings, some less selective
colleges are also effective (Chetty et al. 2020). Finally, there appears to be little correlation
between a school's value added and its popularity once one controls for the achievement level of
the school's students.2
    These findings beg the question of why households do not always favor their highest-value
added options. What constraints or factors lead them to other options? This paper explores
these questions in the context of school choice. We consider two reasons why households may not
choose the schools that researchers deem most productive. First, households may simply lack
information. Value added is the change in a student's outcomes due to attending a school. This
is considerably more difficult to observe than other school attributes, such as the quality of the
school's facilities or the achievement level of its students. Thus, it is possible that households do
wish to attend high-value added schools, but do not know which those are. On the other hand,
it may be that households' preferences lead them to prioritize other school traits. For example,
a given school might not provide the largest gains in skill, but it may provide a safe environment
or a short commute. In this case, households may willingly give up value added in exchange for
alternative dimensions of quality.
    Distinguishing between preferences and information has important policy implications. If
information is the obstacle, then making it available would improve households' choices and spur
providers to compete on value added. By contrast, if preferences are the constraint, then policy
options to boost value added may be more limited. For instance, school choice may cause schools
  1. If households choose providers based on value added, then providers will likely feel pressure to invest in this
characteristic (Rothstein 2006).
  2. In New York City, the correlation is zero (Abdulkadiroglu et al. 2020); in Trinidad and Tobago it is positive
among households with high-achieving children (Beuermann et al. 2019).



                                                         2
to invest in other, possibly less desirable, quality dimensions.
   We explore the distinction between preferences and information by studying high school
admissions in Romania. We use administrative data, a survey, and an experiment. The admin-
istrative data reveal that, on average, households choose schools at the 68th percentile of value
added among their feasible options. This means that they could choose schools with about 1
s.d. worth of additional value added. To understand why households leave so much value added
unexploited, we first assess households' knowledge of this school trait. We elicit beliefs about
value added using a survey and find that these explain less than a fifth of the cross-school varia-
tion. We next inform randomly selected households about the value added of the schools in their
towns. We find that the treatment improves the accuracy of households' beliefs. In addition,
it induces certain students to attend schools with higher value added: namely, low-achieving
students who failed to gain admission to their top choices.
   To better interpret the experimental treatment effects, we estimate households' preferences
for school traits. We find that households care about a number of traits (e.g, location, peer
quality) in addition to value added. Given these preferences, we predict how choices would
change if households' beliefs about value added were fully accurate. We find that for households
with high- (low-) achieving children, fully correcting beliefs would eliminate only 11 (18) percent
of the value added left unexploited, absent the experiment. Finally, we provide evidence that the
treatment caused households with low-achieving children to care more about value added. As a
result, it had a larger effect on their choices than predicted by its impact on beliefs.
   To elaborate, our paper relies on two features of Romania's school system. First, high school
is bookended by high-stakes standardized exams. Before entering high school, students take a
national admissions test, the "transition exam." Before graduating, they take a national exit
test, the "baccalaureate exam." Performing well on the baccalaureate exam is crucial for moving
on to higher education. Passing is required for admission to any university, and a high score
helps win merit scholarships and entry to selective programs. Thus, the two exams enable us to
calculate school value added and to do so with regard to a central academic outcome. Using the
administrative data, we obtain value added estimates for every high school in the country.
   The second feature we rely on is Romania's student assignment mechanism: a serial dicta-
torship. This algorithm gives each student a score. It then considers applicants one at a time
according to their scores, assigning each to his/her most-preferred school that has not yet reached
capacity. A household can rank an unlimited number of options; as such, its dominant strategy is
to rank truthfully according to its preferences (Chade and Smith 2006). The serial dictatorship
thus allows us to observe the high schools that a student could attend, and to be confident that
the one she enrolls in is her most preferred among the feasible options. In addition, the algo-
rithm generates school-specific admissions cutoffs. These provide regression discontinuity (RD)
estimates of the effect of access to each school. Following Angrist et al. (2017), we use the RDs


                                                 3
to validate our value added estimates, which we find closely match causal effects.
    In short, the administrative data allow us to calculate value added and to observe the outcome
of household decision-making. In order to probe the mechanics of this decision-making, we
visited middle schools to conduct surveys and run an experiment.3 We collected a baseline
survey at school-sponsored information sessions held to help households apply to high school.
We interviewed parents to obtain the school preference rankings that they intended to submit
for the high school allocation. We also asked them to evaluate the high schools in their town
along multiple quality dimensions including value added. We implemented our experiment at
the end of these sessions. At randomly selected treatment schools, we explained the concept of
value added and distributed a ranking of the town's high schools based on this characteristic.
After the assignment process was complete, we matched students with administrative data to
obtain their official school assignments. We also ran an endline survey, interviewing parents by
phone to gather the school preference rankings that they submitted, and to again elicit their
beliefs about schools' value added.
    This setup allows us to address four questions, which we use to organize the exposition and
frame the contribution of the paper. The questions and a preview of our findings are as follows.
1. Do households choose schools with high value added?
    Schools with higher value added face higher demand. The correlation between a school's
value added and the selectivity of its admissions cutoff is 0.55.4 In addition, households choose
options that are above average by value added in their feasible choice sets. Nonetheless, they
leave considerable value added on the table. Both low- and high-achieving students could gain,
on average, about 1 s.d. worth of additional value added--or a 13 percentage point increase
in the probability of passing the baccalaureate exam. By contrast, households come close to
maximizing selectivity. For this school trait, they leave only 0.3 s.d. unexploited.
    These results relate to work asking whether households favor productive schools (Beuermann
et al. 2019; Abdulkadiroglu et al. 2020). Our contribution is to exploit a setting which reveals
precisely the set of schools among which households choose, and induces households to truthfully
reveal the one they most prefer.
2. How accurate are households' beliefs regarding a school's value added?
    Households have limited knowledge of value added. When asked to score schools on this trait,
their scores are off by an average of 1.1 within-town quintiles and explain only 17 percent of the
variation. In contrast, they have more awareness of selectivity. Their scores for this school trait
   3. We visited middle schools in May of 2019. Our sample included 194 middle schools in 48 moderately-sized
towns. We aimed for towns to have enough options for households to have choice, but not to be so large as to
make commuting distance a binding constraint.
   4. This is a descriptive result--it could arise because households choose schools based on value added, but
it could also arise if households seek a correlate of value added, or if schools that attract high-scoring students
benefit from peer effects.



                                                        4
have a mean absolute error of 0.9 within-town quintiles and explain 33 percent of the variation.
Finally, households with high-achieving children have more accurate beliefs than those with low-
achieving ones. For the former, scores explain 20 percent of the variation in value added and 39
percent of that in selectivity; for the latter households, these fractions are 12 and 23 percent.
   Our contribution is to provide, to our knowledge, the first comparison between researchers'
and households' perceptions of school value added within entire markets.
3. Would households change their choices if given information on value added?
   Providing information on value added improves the accuracy of households' beliefs and causes
them to assign higher preference ranks to high-value added schools. Effects are larger for house-
holds with low-achieving children and for options that were initially less preferred. Specifically,
our experimental treatment had no effect on beliefs or preference ranks for the two options that
households ranked highest in the baseline survey. As a result, it had heterogeneous impacts on
the real-world outcome of school assignments. For low-achieving students who were rejected by
their two top choices, the treatment caused students to attend schools with 0.2 s.d. worth of
additional value added. This was a 2.4 percentage point (9.6 percent) increase in the probability
of passing the baccalaureate exam. For all other students, the treatment had no effect.
   These results address work on whether information on school quality affects households'
choices. Previous work finds positive effects from information on schools' absolute achievement
(Hastings and Weinstein 2008; Andrabi, Das, and Khwaja 2017; Ajayi, Friedman, and Lucas
2017; Corcoran et al. 2018; Allende, Gallego, and Neilson 2019) but limited impacts from in-
formation related to value added (Imberman and Lovenheim 2016; Mizala and Urquiola 2013).
Our contribution is to experimentally distribute information on value added, and to show that
households absorbed the information, a frequent concern with such interventions.
4. How do households' preferences for other school traits affect their demand for value added?
   We use households' school preference rankings and their elicited beliefs about school traits
to (descriptively) study their preferences for these traits. We first estimate preferences using a
discrete choice model. We then disentangle the roles of preferences and information in causing
households to leave value added on the table. In particular, we compare predicted school assign-
ments under accurate beliefs about value added with those under baseline beliefs. We predict
that correcting households' beliefs would spur low- (high-) achieving students to attend schools
with 0.13 (0.11) s.d. worth of additional value added, representing 18 (11) percent of the value
added that these households would otherwise leave unexploited. Finally, we show that for house-
holds with low-achieving students, the experiment had larger-than-predicted effects on choices
because it impacted both beliefs and preferences.
   These results relate to papers on households' preferences for school traits (Hastings, Kane,
and Staiger 2005; Burgess et al. 2015; Beuermann et al. 2019; Abdulkadiroglu et al. 2020). Our
contribution is to calculate preferences using households' beliefs about these traits, rather than

                                                 5
values of traits measured by researchers. More broadly, our paper relates to others assessing the
roles of preferences and frictions in driving choices (Bergman et al. 2019; Hastings, Neilson, and
Zimmerman 2018; Bergman, Chan, and Kapor 2020).
    The paper proceeds as follows. Section 0 covers "preliminaries"--inputs needed to address
our four guiding questions. Sections 1-4 analyze questions 1-4, respectively. Section 5 concludes.

0     Preliminaries
This section lays the groundwork for examining our four questions of interest. It describes: i)
Romania's high school admissions, ii) the administrative data, iii) our value added measure, iv)
the survey data, and v) the experiment.

0.1     High school admissions
In Romania, high schools cover grades 9-12 and are divided into tracks. These are self-contained
units within schools that vary in their curricular focus.5 The latter fall into three broad categories:
a) humanities, b) math or science, and c) "technical" subjects with applied themes such as
business or agriculture.6
    Students are admitted to tracks based on their academic achievement in middle school (grades
5-8). In 8th grade, a student takes a national high school entrance test, known as the transition
exam.7 The student's score on this exam is combined with her middle school GPA to generate
an admissions score, called the transition score.8
    Households have choice over the track their child attends.9 After finding out its child's
transition score, each household submits a ranked list, or preference ranking, of the tracks in
its town.10 The government then assigns students to tracks using a serial dictatorship. This
algorithm considers track preference rankings in the order of students' transition scores. It first
takes the student with the highest score and assigns him/her to his/her most-preferred track.
It then proceeds down the score distribution, assigning each student to his/her most-preferred
track that is not yet at capacity. Households' preference rankings can be as long as they wish.11
   5. Students in a track take the same coursework and are often in the same physical class. High school classes
are usually capped at 28 students, and some tracks offer multiple classes.
   6. In addition, a small number of students participate in vocational programs that do not provide a path to
university. We do not have data on these students.
   7. The transition exam includes sections on math and Romanian language and, for students who attend schools
for ethnic minorities, a native language exam.
   8. For the 2019 admission, the GPA accounted for 20 percent of the score, and the national exam for 80 percent.
   9. We assume that schooling decisions happen at the household level, as they involve both parents and students.
Sometimes, as short-hand, we refer to a student's preferences or choices. When we do this, we mean the preferences
or choices of the household that contains the student.
  10. In principle, households can rank any track in the country. In practice, few households rank tracks outside
small administrative units we call towns. We present data on this below.
  11. More precisely, there is a cap of 287 choices. This number is much larger than the total number of options
in most towns, or than most households would realistically consider.



                                                        6
As a result, the serial dictatorship is incentive compatible: the dominant strategy for households
is to submit track preference rankings that truthfully reveal their preferences.
   Formally, let Ji be the set of tracks in the town of household i, and let Ji be the number
of tracks in this set. The household assigns a rank to each track j  Ji based on the utility,
Uij , it expects to receive from it. Letting ri,m be the track to which i assigns a rank of m, the
household's preference ranking is:

                            ri,1 = j  Uij > Uik                k  Ji \ {j }
                            ri,2 = j  Uij > Uij > Uik          k  Ji \ {j, j }
                                ...
                           ri,Ji = j  Uik > Uij                k  Ji \ {j },

where m = 1 corresponds to the household's top choice.
   Next, let Jie  Ji be the set of tracks that are still available when the serial dictatorship
considers i's preference ranking. This is the set of tracks that i is eligible to attend, or i's feasible
choice set. The student is assigned to track ji , where:

                                      Uiji > Uik  k  Jie \ {ji }.

In words, ji is the household's most-preferred track within the feasible set.

0.2    Administrative data
We use administrative data to calculate value added for each high school track and to examine
whether households choose tracks with high value added. These data cover the universe of
students admitted from 2004 to 2019. They provide information on students' demographics,
academic achievement, and school assignment. Specifically, we observe a student's middle school,
middle school GPA, performance on the transition exam, and assigned high school track.12 We
add information on gender by classifying male and female first names. For the 2004 to 2014
admissions cohorts, we also merge data on students' performance on the national high school
exit baccalaureate exam.13 Since our focus is track choice, we restrict the sample in each year to
towns that have at least two tracks. For the 2004-2019 admissions cohorts there are, on average,
395 towns that meet this criterion. In these markets, each cohort of about 142,000 students
 12. In contrast with several recent papers, we do not observe students' submitted track preference rankings.
However, as we discuss below, our survey collects these for a sample of students.
 13. We matched the baccalaureate exam data with the admissions data based on a student's name, gender, and
high school track. We first conducted an exact merge and then used a fuzzy matching procedure to account for
minor changes in the spelling of names. The results are not sensitive to changes in this procedure.

The table describes the administrative data and lists the admissions cohorts for which they are available--due to a reporting issue,
we have limited data on the 2018 cohort. "High school admissions" includes variables related to students' transition scores. "Middle
school" variables describe students' middle schools. All middle school variables except the number of students are calculated
excluding the student of interest; that is, they characterize the student's peers. Variables under "High school track" are
characteristics of the student's track, and those under "Baccalaureate exam" relate to the student's performance on the
baccalaureate exam.


    Table 1 (page 8) describes key variables in the administrative data. One of the covariates
merits special comment. The minimum transition score (MTS) in a high school track is the
transition score of the track's lowest-scoring student. It is the track's admissions cutoff: students
with higher scores are eligible to attend the track, while those with lower scores are not. In
other words, the MTS measures a track's selectivity and is a proxy for the demand the track
experiences--tracks that are more popular reach capacity earlier in the allocation process and
thus have higher cutoffs. When the government announces the set of tracks that will be accept-
ing students in a given year, it provides the tracks' MTS from the previous admissions round.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that households pay attention to this information in determining
their track preference rankings.

0.3      Value added
We calculate value added for each track in each year. Tracks may add value in a number of
dimensions. We focus on their impact on a student's performance on the end-of-high-school
baccalaureate exam, as this test is salient and has high stakes. Students who pass the exam
receive a baccalaureate diploma. Even for students who do not pursue higher education, a
  14. Table A1 (page 54) shows the sample size by year. There is variation over time in the number of tracks,
reflecting factors such as student enrollment, instructor availability, and the emergence/demise of technical fields.

                                                                 8
diploma can be a strong labor market signal. A diploma is necessary for admission to any
university, public or private. At less selective universities, it is the only requirement. This is
even the case at some selective public schools, provided a student is willing to pay tuition, in
contrast to his higher-scoring peers. Aside from tuition-free admission, high scores help students
gain access to programs at prestigious universities (Borcan, Lindahl, and Mitrut 2017).15
    An important feature of the baccalaureate exam is that students choose whether to take
it, and whether to continue with other subjects if they fail the first.16 This means that value
added calculated on a student's score could be biased by sample selection. We deal with this by
calculating value added on two alternative outcomes. In the main analysis, we focus on value
added on the probability that a student passes the exam. We show that results are robust to
using valued added on the percentile rank of a student's exam performance. This latter outcome
is defined as the percent of students in an admissions cohort who perform worse on the exam
than the given student, with all students who do not pass being assigned a value of 0.17 We
consider these measures to be complementary. Value added on passing the exam relates to a
readily interpretable outcome and can be relatively easily explained to parents. Value added on
the percentile rank of performance allows more precise results for selective tracks in which large
shares of students pass.
    We estimate value added using a conventional selection-on-observables model (Rothstein 2010;
Angrist et al. 2017). For each student i, let pi be the outcome of interest. For value added on
passing the exam, pi is an indicator equal to 1 if i passes:

                                         pi = 1{i passes the bacc.},

with pi = 0 if i either fails or does not attempt the test. For value added on the percentile rank
of performance, pi is defined as discussed above.
    Let dij be an indicator equal to 1 if i attends track j , and let Xi be a vector of i's covariates,
  15. Rules for admission vary across time and programs. Importantly, they depend on a student's total score
on the baccalaureate exam, rather than on exam sub-components. For a limited number of programs at elite
universities (such as law or medicine) the baccalaureate plays a limited role, as these use additional admissions
tests. In the earlier years in our sample period, additional admissions tests were more common--but baccalau-
reate performance was still crucial. For instance, Borcan et al. (2017) report that for one elite university, the
baccalaureate score represented 50 percent of the admissions score in 2009 and 67 percent in 2010 and 2011, with
the rest based on grades and an additional test. Beginning in 2012, the baccalaureate score became the main
criterion in most programs.
  16. For the 2004-2014 admissions cohorts, 69 percent of high school students attempted the test, 53 percent
passed it, and 0.1 percent achieved a perfect score (Table 1). Figure A1 (page 49) shows how these values vary
with a student's transition score.
  17. The benefits of taking the baccalaureate exam are dependent on passing it. Consequently, students who take
the exam but fail to pass obtain the same result as those who do not take it. Since all of these students achieve
better than no other students, we assign them a percentile rank of 0. Next, students who receive the minimum
passing score are assigned a value equal to the percent of students in the cohort who do not pass. Finally, students
with higher scores receive values equal to the percent of students who perform worse.

such as gender and the components of the transition score. We estimate value added by regressing
pi on the set of track attendance dummies, dij , and on flexible controls for covariates, f (Xi ).18
We allow both value added and the effects of controls to vary by year. Thus, for each cohort, we
estimate:

                                pi = t · f (Xi ) +         Vjt · dij + ei , i  It .                              (1)
                                                       j


Here, It is the set of students in cohort t, and Vjt is the value added of track j for cohort t. With
finite data, we obtain value added estimates V  ^ jt .
    Equation (1) assumes that tracks exert a common effect on all students. However, a track's
value added might vary across student types. To allow for this possibility, we calculate value
added measures that let a track's effect differ by whether a student is male or female or by
whether the student scores more highly in math or language.19 Specifically, let g index the group
that a student falls into, either by gender or relative academic strength. We then fit the model:

                               pi = gt · f (Xi ) +         Vjgt · dij + ei , i  Igt .                            (2)
                                                       j


Here Igt  It is the set of students in cohort t who are in group g , and Vjgt is track j 's value
added for these students.20
    It turns out that our value added estimates are similar across all measures. In Table A2 (page
54), we correlate estimates for our main measure (track-year effects on passing) with those for
the alternative measures (track-year effects on the percentile rank of performance, and passing
by student gender or relative academic strength). In all cases, the correlation exceeds 0.9.
    Next, Table 2 (page 11), presents information on the magnitude of value added. The results
are for our main measure--track-year effects on passing the baccalaureate exam. Specifically,
                   ^ jt presents year-specific standard deviations for estimated value added.
the column labeled V
The column labeled Vjt displays standard deviations for the "true effects," also known as "sig-
  18. We specify f (Xi ) to include an indicator for female; cubics in the student's: i) middle school GPA, ii) score
on the math section of the transition exam, iii) score on the language section, and iv) middle school's enrollment;
interactions between female and i)-iv); and levels of variables about other individuals in the student's middle
school: a) the standard deviation of transition score, b) the average GPA, c) the average score on the math
section of the transition exam, and d) the average score on the language section.
  19. For the second partition, we standardize students' scores on the math and language components of the
transition exam and identify the one on which the student did better.
  20. There is an additional complication when calculating value added on passing the exam. For this measure, pi is
a binary variable, and (1) and (2) are linear probability models. These assume that a track exerts a constant effect
(either by year or by year/group) on a student's probability of passing, regardless of her baseline achievement.
This may be reasonable in some cases but is a poor assumption for students whose baseline achievement gives
them a high chance of passing or failing. To test the sensitivity of our results to this assumption, we have fit
versions of (1) and (2) using a logit. This assumes that a track exerts a constant effect on the index function for
the probability of passing the exam, rather than on the raw probability itself. The results are hardly changed.

nal" standard deviations (Chetty and Hendren 2018). These values are calculated by adjusting
                           ^ jt for measurement error.21 The column titled pjt lists standard
the standard deviations of V
deviations for track "pass rates"--the fraction of students in the track-year who pass the exam.

The table presents summary statistics for a track's value added on passing the baccalaureate exam. pjt is the pass rate in track j in

local linear forest (Athey et al. 2019). See sections 0.3 and 0.3.2 for details. Standard deviations and R-squared values are weighted
by student. R-sq is the fraction of the variation in Vjt that is predicted by VP jt . The values for the standard deviation of Vjt and for
R-squared are adjusted for measurement error; see Appendix A1. Due to a data reporting issue, we do not calculate values for 2018.


    Table 2 reveals that tracks vary widely in both pass rates and value added. We focus on
the 2004-2014 cohorts, the years for which we observe baccalaureate outcomes.22 Within this
set we also sometimes distinguish between the 2004-2007 and 2008-2014 cohorts.23 First, the
results for pjt show that pass rates vary widely across tracks. For the 2008-2014 cohorts, a 1
standard deviation increase in a track's pass rate is equal to a 37 percentage point increase in the
probability of passing the exam. For the 2004-2007 cohorts, the standard deviation is somewhat
smaller and more variable. The results for Vjt show that tracks also vary considerably in value
added. For the 2008-2014 cohorts, a one standard deviation increase in value added is equivalent
to a 14 percentage point increase in the probability of passing. Year-specific values range from
  21. Appendix A1 (page 69) describes the procedure.
  22. Section 0.3.2 explains why there are values in the column labeled Vjt for the 2015-2019 cohorts.
  23. In the first of these there were frequent instances of cheating. Beginning with the 2008 cohort, the government
cracked down on this by installing video surveillance in exam centers and by drastically increasing punishments.
These measures greatly reduced cheating for the later cohorts (Borcan et al. 2017). We find that dropping the
2004-2007 cohorts does not affect our main results. Consequently, we include them, with the caveat that a track's
value added in this period could reflect both effects on learning and opportunities for cheating.


                                                                   11
11 to 19 percentage points. Thus, in these years, value added explains between 9 and 26 percent
of the variation in pass rates. For the earlier period, a 1 standard deviation increase in value
added amounts to a 20 percentage point increase in the probability of passing. This can vary
from 16 to 21 percentage points. Thus, in this period, value added explains between 37 and 45
                                                                 ^ jt reveal that measurement error
percent of the variation in pass rates. Finally, the results for V
only slightly inflates the standard deviation of estimated value added.
0.3.1   Validating value added
Value added calculated relying on the selection-on-observables assumption may suffer from bias.
In particular, it will fail to capture the causal effect of attending a track if students' track choices
are correlated with the unpredictable component of their baccalaureate performance (Rothstein
2010; Angrist et al. 2017). Prior work has found that selection-on-observables value added
measures nevertheless often closely approximate causal effects (Rothstein 2010, 2017; Chetty,
Friedman, and Rockoff 2014; Deming 2014; Angrist et al. 2017). However, whether this holds in
any particular setting is an empirical question.
   Fortunately, Romania offers a natural experiment to test the validity of our value added
measure. As stated, the serial dictatorship creates an admissions cutoff for each track. We can
thus estimate the causal effect of being eligible to attend a track using a regression discontinuity
(RD) design that compares outcomes for students who score just above the cutoff with those of
students who score just below.
   Appendix A2 (page 71) explains how we assess the quality of our value added measure using
the structure of the RD effect. Intuitively, the RD effect for a particular track c is a weighted
sum of the local average treatment effects of attending the track versus each of the less-selective
tracks in the town. If there is no selection bias and if we appropriately capture treatment effect
heterogeneity, then the local average treatment effect of attending track c versus fallback track
f is equal to the difference in value added between the two tracks. In order to obtain a quantity
that is comparable with the RD treatment effect, one has to appropriately weight these value
added differences. We do this by running the RD on the value added of a student's track. Thus,
for each track, we calculate two RDs: the traditional one, on a student's own outcome, and a
non-traditional one, on the value added of the student's track. If the value added measure is
valid, these RDs are weighted sums of the same treatment effects and are calculated using the
same weights. Thus, they should be equal, at least up to measurement error.
   We test this equality in two ways. First, we calculate the fraction of the variation in the RDs
on students' baccalaureate outcomes that is explained by the RDs on the value added of students'
tracks. Second, we adapt an IV procedure developed by Angrist et al. (2017), which allows us
to test for bias using all tracks at once. The results (Appendix A2) suggest that our value
added measures closely match a track's causal effect. In addition, our main measure of a single


                                                  12
track-year effect performs as well as the measures that allow for treatment effect heterogeneity
by gender or by relative academic strength.24
0.3.2    Forecasting value added at the time of track choice
Our experiment aims to inform a household about what a track's value added will be for the
admissions cohort of its child. This is a non-trivial task because a track's value added for a given
cohort is not known when households make their choices--it cannot be observed until students
take the baccalaureate exam. To deal with this, we forecast value added using the information
available at the time of track choice. We obtain the forecasts using a local linear forest algorithm
(Athey et al. 2019).25 Our model incorporates current and lagged values of a large number of
track covariates, including past value added. Tables A3-A5 (pages 55-56) list the covariates and
lags we use: the first lists the covariates that relate to the track itself, the second displays the
covariates that relate to the track's high school, and the third lists covariates of the track's town.
    We make predictions, VP
                          jt , for the 2008-2019 admissions cohorts. These are the years for
which we have sufficient prior data to compute lagged values of covariates. The predictions are
"out-of-bag" in that they use only the trees in the forest that do not include the track-year being
predicted.26 The column labeled VP
                                 jt in Table 2 (page 11) lists the standard deviations of the
predictions by year. For the 2008-2014 cohorts, these are similar to, but slightly smaller than,
those of the true effects. Next, for the 2015-2019 cohorts, we use the standard deviations of the
predictions to compute standard deviations for the true effects.27 Reassuringly, these values are
similar to those for the cohorts that immediately precede 2015 (e.g., 2012-2014). Finally, for
the 2008-2014 cohorts, we can formally compare predicted and true value added. We do this
by calculating R-squared in predicting true value added using our predictions, as described in
Appendix A1.4 (page 70). The results, in the column labeled R-sq. in Table 2, show that our
model has substantial predictive power. Overall, our predictions account for 79 percent of the
variation in tracks' true value added.
  24. One might wonder why we do not focus our analysis on RD effects rather than value added. There are
two reasons. First, the RD effects are much noisier. In particular, the RD treatment effect of attending track c
is a local average treatment effect calculated by dividing the reduced-form RD treatment effect of being eligible
to attend track c by the first-stage RD treatment effect on the probability of attending the track. This value is
only for students with transition scores at the cutoff. For a single track-year, these quantities can be very noisy.
Second, as alluded to above, RD treatment effects have a complex interpretation: the RD treatment effect of
attending track c is a weighted average of pairwise treatment effects between track c and each of the less-selective
tracks in a town. It depends on both tracks' causal effects and on the probabilities that students "fall back"
to each of the less selective tracks if not admitted to c. If we had data on track preference rankings, we could
disentangle these factors, but we do not.
  25. This algorithm combines a random forest with a local linear regression. Athey et al. (2019) find that it
improves over a random forest when there is a smooth relationship between outcomes and covariates.
  26. We account for missing values of covariates by substituting the mean.
  27. Appendix A1.3 (page 70) elaborates on the procedure.

0.4     Baseline survey
The administrative data allow us to measure value added and to observe households' track
choices, but provide little insight into households' preferences or beliefs. We therefore conducted
a baseline survey and an experiment. In the survey, we interviewed parents of 8th graders to
collect: i) their beliefs about the attributes of tracks in their towns, and ii) their intended track
preference rankings. To do this, we visited information sessions organized by middle schools to
inform parents about the high school application process. These occur in May, about a month
before households submit their track preference rankings.
0.4.1    Sample selection
To select our sample, we had to choose towns and then middle schools within towns. We chose
towns using two criteria. First, we considered only moderately-sized towns, defined as those
that had between 7 and 28 tracks in 2018. We excluded towns with fewer than 7 tracks because
we wanted households to have a significant number of options; we dropped towns with more
than 28 tracks because larger towns are more likely to contain unobserved sub-markets based on
commuting distance. Next, among moderately-sized towns, we chose those in which value added
was most predictable. Specifically, for each town we calculated R-squared from predicting value
added, Vjt , using predicted value added, VP
                                           jt , over the 2008-2014 admissions cohorts. We then
selected the towns with the highest R-squared values. Finally, we chose middle schools which
had at least 15 students and in which it was logistically feasible for our surveyors to visit the
information sessions.
    Our target sample consisted of 228 middle schools in 49 towns. Some schools did not grant
us permission to conduct the survey, and thus our final sample covered 194 middle schools in 48
towns.28 The towns had an average R-squared of 0.77. For the 2019 cohort--the year in which
we conducted the survey--they had an average of 13 tracks and 412 students. We interviewed
the households of 3,898 students, with an average of 81 students per town.29
0.4.2    Survey questions
The baseline survey asked parents about their intended track preference rankings, and attempted
to recover their beliefs about the tracks in their towns.30 To capture beliefs, we asked parents to
score the tracks--on a scale of 1 to 5--on the dimensions listed in Table 3 (page 15). We first
  28. In order to minimize spillovers and general equilibrium effects, we visited only a fraction of middle schools
in each town. On average, we visited 11 percent of middle schools, and in no town did we visit more than a third.
  29. The information sessions are held separately for groups of about 30 students known as classrooms. In most
middle schools we visited the session for a single classroom. However, to increase the sample size, in 44 middle
schools we visited sessions for two classrooms. Table A6 (page 57) describes the towns included in the survey.
  30. A labor dispute caused the government to delay announcing the list of tracks that would be available in
2019. As a result, we lacked time to gather information on tracks that were newly created in 2019. Instead, we
asked households only about tracks that existed in both 2018 and 2019. This is not a major issue, as only 43 out
of 614 tracks in the survey towns existed in 2019 and not in 2018.


                                                        14
asked about two school attributes that research consistently indicates households care about:
location and peer quality. We also asked about our definition of value added ("this track will
help my child pass the baccalaureate exam"), as well as alternative dimensions of value added
related to college and labor market success. Finally, we asked parents to score tracks on teacher
quality, on whether their curriculum is a good fit for their child, and on whether the track is
attractive because it is also used by their child's siblings or friends.

                              Table 3: Track characteristics covered in the survey

     Characteristic                                                    Definition
   Location              This track has a convenient physical location (close to my home or preferred means of transport)
   Peer quality          This track attracts academically gifted students
   VA: pass the bacc.    This track will help my child pass the baccalaureate exam
   VA: college           This track will help my child go to the college that I would like for him or her
   VA: wages             This track will raise my child's earnings at age 30
   Teacher quality       This track has good teachers
   Curriculum            My child will enjoy this track's curriculum
   Siblings & friends    My child's siblings and friends also attend this track (or this track's school)
The table displays the definitions of the track characteristics covered in the baseline survey. Survey respondents were asked to score
tracks on these characteristics on a scale of 1 to 5.


    Table A7 (page 58) presents summary statistics for parents' scores. It shows that means and
standard deviations are similar for the various quality dimensions. Table A8 (page 58) presents
an across-dimension correlation matrix. Its values lend credibility to the scores. For instance,
the largest correlations are those among the three value added dimensions; the lowest are those
that include scores for a track's location or for whether the child's siblings/friends attend it.
    Finally, Table 4 (page 16) describes other variables in the survey data. It reveals a few notable
facts. First, households do not rank all tracks; they focus on only a subset of options. Namely,
on average households assigned ranks to 43 percent of the tracks in their town, and they assigned
scores to 35 percent. Appendix A4 (page 77) provides additional details on households' behavior
in this regard. Table 4 also shows that we were able to match 83 percent of students in the
survey sample with administrative data on the 2019 admissions cohort.31 For these students, we
observe official transition scores and track assignments.

0.5      Experiment
We conducted an experiment to explore whether households' choices can be influenced by pro-
viding information on value added. This took place at the end of the middle school information
sessions at which we implemented the baseline survey. We randomly split the middle schools into
  31. We matched students by name and middle school using a fuzzy matching procedure allowing for slight
misspellings of names. Students do not appear in the administrative data if they do not get assigned to a track.
This occurs when a student does not submit a track preference ranking or when the student does not rank any
tracks that he/she is eligible to attend. A small number of the unassigned students participate in a secondary
allocation that occurs at the end of the summer. These students get assigned to tracks that did not reach capacity
in the initial allocation. The remaining students either drop out of school or attend vocational schools.

score" are predictions that parents made during the information session.



treatment and control groups.32 We concluded the survey by distributing a flyer with information
on the high school application process.
    In the control middle schools, the flyer provided links to government websites, including one
listing the prior-year minimum transition score for each track. In the treatment middle schools,
the flyer also explained the concept of value added ("which tracks most effectively improve
students' chances of passing the baccalaureate exam relative to their 9th grade starting points")
and included a ranking of the tracks in the town by our prediction for value added. An example
treatment flyer is in Figures A2-A3 (pages 50-50). Control flyers were identical to Figure A2,
save for excluding the fourth bullet point. Respondents were allowed to keep the flyers.
    After the high school allocation occurred, we obtained students' track assignments from the
Ministry of Education. In addition, we conducted a follow-up (or "endline") phone survey. In
this survey, we collected the final track preference rankings that households submitted, asked
households to score tracks on a scale of 1 to 5 in terms of value added, and inquired about
households' experience with the admissions process. The data on track assignments allow us to
observe whether the information affected the tracks that students attend. The follow-up survey
allows us to probe the mechanics by which the information influenced choices.33
  32. We used a clustered randomization process. We first matched pairs of middle schools within towns based on
school characteristics. We then randomized within these matched pairs. Appendix A3 (page 77) provides details.
  33. In the time between our creation of the matched pairs and our baseline survey, some of the middle schools in
our sample withdrew their permission for our study. For every school at which this occurred, we still conducted
the baseline survey in the other middle school in its matched pair. However, we removed these other schools from

The table presents summary statistics and balance tests for the experimental sample. The sample consists of 3,186 students in 170
middle schools in 45 towns. "Matched with the administrative data" is an indicator for whether the student was found in the
administrative data. "Assigned to a track" is an indicator for whether the student was found in the administrative data and
assigned to a track in the high school allocation. The sample for the remaining variables is limited to the students for whom
"Assigned to a track" is equal to 1. "Coef." is the coefficient in a regression of the listed variable on the treatment indicator. It
measures the difference in the mean of the variable between treatment and control groups. Standard errors are clustered by the
middle school treatment-control pairs within which we conducted the randomization. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.



    Table 5 (page 17) presents summary statistics and balance tests for the experiment. The
first row displays the share of students in the experimental sample that we were able to match
with the administrative data. Students do not appear in the administrative data if they do not
participate in the high school allocation.34 In addition, it is possible that a small number of
students were not matched due to data issues, such as misspelled names. In total, 86 percent of
students were matched, with an insignificant difference of 2.2 percentage points between students
in the treatment and control groups. The second row shows the share of students for whom we
observe track assignments. These are students who appear in the administrative data and who
listed at least one track in their preference rankings that they were eligible to attend. Overall,
we observe track assignments for 85 percent of students, with an insignificant difference of 2.3
the experimental sample. In addition, we removed students who said that they did not intend to apply to high
school in the town of their middle school. Thus, while the survey sample includes 3,898 students in 194 middle
schools in 48 towns, the experimental sample includes only 3,186 students in 170 middle schools in 45 towns.
  34. Recall that students can instead attend vocational school, which involves a different application process.



                                                                 17
percentage points between treatment and control groups.
    The values in the remaining rows of Table 5 are calculated for the sample of students for whom
we observe track assignments. Comparing these values with those in Table 4 (page 16) reveals
that students in the experiment are representative of those in the baseline survey. Moreover, the
balance tests suggest that the randomization was successful: the differences between treatment
and control groups are small relative to the variables' standard deviations. Only one of these
differences is statistically significant (at the 10 percent level).
    We now use the above inputs to address the four questions that motivate this paper.

1     Do households choose tracks with high value added?
The first question we study is whether households choose tracks with high value added. This
question matters because it reveals whether households gain academic benefits from their choices.
It also reveals whether there is scope to increase their benefits by influencing their choices. We
note that our analysis of this question is descriptive. In particular, the results only illuminate
whether the tracks that households choose happen to have high value added. They do not reveal
whether households make choices based on value added.35
    We address this using the administrative data. We first examine whether a track's value
added is correlated with the demand it faces, as measured by the selectivity of its admissions
cutoff. We then exploit our knowledge of households' feasible choice sets to compare the tracks
that households choose with their available options. Notably, we calculate the amount of value
added that a household could gain by having its child switch to its best available option.

1.1     The relationship between value added and selectivity
We start by inspecting the relationship between a track's value added and its selectivity as
measured by its cutoff or MTS. This relationship will be positive if tracks with high value added
are popular and reach capacity early in the assignment process.36
    Figure 1 (page 19) displays this relationship for our main value added measure, a track-

standardized, the slope of this line equals the variables' correlation coefficient.37 The figure uses
  35. One way to understand this distinction is to imagine what would happen if a track were to invest in improving
its value added. If households make choices based on value added, then the track would become more popular.
However, if households choose based on other characteristics, then its popularity would be unchanged.
  36. We reiterate that a positive relationship need not imply that households choose tracks based on value added.
For example, more selective tracks have higher-achieving students and could thus have higher value added due to
peer effects or teacher sorting.
  37. Technically, this is true only for the full sample. For best-fit lines calculated on subsets of the sample, the

The figure summarizes the relationship between value added and selectivity. The best-fit line is from a linear regression of
standardized values of value added estimates, V ^ jt , on standardized values of minimum transition score, MTSjt . "Conditional mean"
plots predictions from a local linear regression, and "conditional 10th and 90th percentiles" from local quantile regressions. The
value added measure is a track-year effect on the probability of passing the baccalaureate exam. Variables are standardized by year,
and regressions weighted by student. The results are for the 2004-2017 and 2019 cohorts. For cohorts after 2014, they use predicted
value added, VPjt . Panel A presents results for the full set of towns, and Panel B for towns in the baseline survey.




all cohorts and provides results separately for the full set of towns (Panel A) and for the towns
in the baseline survey (Panel B). In each, there is an overall positive relationship between value
added and selectivity, as captured by the positively sloped best-fit lines.38 However, this overall
relationship obscures substantial nonlinearity. The relationship is strongly positive for less- and
moderately selective tracks but is flat or even negative for highly selective tracks.
    Table 6 (page 20) presents statistics that quantify the results in Figure 1: coefficients from
regressions of standardized value added estimates on standardized minimum transition score.
The values in the rows labeled "All tracks" match the slopes of the best-fit lines in Figure 1.
The remaining values are meant to capture the non-linearity in the figure--they are coefficients
from regressions that split the sample by tercile of selectivity. The table confirms that the overall
correlation between value added and selectivity is substantial. For the country as a whole, it
is 0.55; for survey towns, it is 0.64. However, this is driven entirely by tracks in the bottom
two-thirds of the selectivity distribution. For the most-selective third, an increase in selectivity
is associated with a decline in value added. Among all towns, this decline is 0.26 standard
deviations for a one standard deviation increase in selectivity; for survey towns, it is 0.17.
    These results are robust; they persist irrespective of the time period or value added measure
used. Table A9 (page 58) presents year-specific correlations, showing that these values are
slope can be interpreted as the increase in (full-sample) standard deviations of value added for one (full-sample)
standard deviation increase in selectivity.

weighted by student, and standard errors are clustered by town-year. See Figure 1 for additional details.



stable over time. Figure A4 (page 51) replicates Figure 1 for alternative value added measures,
displaying similar results.39
    Finally, we ask whether the results are affected by compositional changes in the share of
tracks with a given curriculum. In particular, it is possible that the relationship between value
added and selectivity is uniformly positive for tracks with the same curriculum, but that less-
and more-selective tracks tend to differ in curriculum. To examine this, we run the local linear
regressions in Figure 1 separately by whether a track focuses on humanities, math and science,
or technical subjects. The results are in Figure A5 (page 51). The relationship between value
added and selectivity within these track categories is broadly similar to that in the full sample.

1.2      Comparing households' choices with the available options
In order to further characterize choice behavior with regard to value added, we next take ad-
vantage of information on a household's feasible choice set. This is the set of tracks that a
student is eligible to attend, given the admissions cutoffs and the student's transition score. We
compare the value added of the track the household chooses with the value added of the other
  39. This latter finding mitigates one potential concern regarding Figure 1. In particular, it is conceivable that the
negative relationship between value added and selectivity for highly selective tracks reflects a mechanical constraint
on value added for these tracks. If students in highly selective tracks are certain to pass the baccalaureate exam
regardless of the track they attend, then there will be a cap on the tracks' estimated value added. However, this
cap is less likely to be binding for value added on the percentile rank of a student's exam performance. Figure
A4 shows that results are unchanged for this alternative measure. In addition, we have explored the relationship
between selectivity and a track's value added on a student's exam score. As discussed, we are generally hesitant
to use value added on exam score due to selection into exam-taking. However, selection is of limited concern for
highly selective tracks. Further, there is unlikely to be a ceiling on this value added measure, since only 0.1% of
students achieve a perfect score (Table 1). Reassuringly, we again find a negative relationship.


                                                                  20
options in this set. We also compute the amount by which a household could increase the value
added its child receives by switching to its highest-value-added option. As a comparison, we
present a parallel analysis for selectivity, asking whether households choose the tracks with the
highest-achieving students.
    To elaborate, for each household we calculate two quantities. First, the percentile rank of the
student's track among feasible tracks is the rank of the student's track (by either value added,
^ jt , or selectivity, MTSjt ) within the feasible set divided by the number of tracks in the set.
V
It represents the share of feasible tracks with values that are less than or equal to that of the
track the student attends.40 Second, the potential increase among feasible tracks is the difference
between the maximum value (of value added or selectivity) within the feasible set and the value
for the student's track. It captures how much of an improvement a household could obtain by
optimally switching its child's track.

The table presents summary statistics on households' track choices. Panel A displays the percent of students who are eligible for
only one track. Panels B and C show means for the "percentile rank of the student's track among feasible tracks" and the
"potential increase among feasible tracks". See Section 1.2 for definitions. The values in Panels B and C are calculated for students
with multiple feasible options. The sample includes the 2004-2017 and 2019 cohorts. Variables are standardized by year. A student
is defined as low- (high-) achieving if his/her transition score is in the bottom (top) half of the within-year distribution. The value
added measure is a single track-year effect on the probability of passing the baccalaureate exam.


    Table 7 (page 21) presents results for our main value added measure. It uses all cohorts of
data and provides estimates both for all towns (columns 1-3) and for towns in the baseline survey
(columns 4-6). Panel A lists the share of students who have only one track in their feasible set
and hence no choice over tracks. In the full sample, 2 percent of students are in this situation.
The remaining panels concern the students with choice. Panel B reveals that on average these
students attend tracks at the 68th percentile of value added among their feasible sets. Panel
C shows that they thus leave substantial value added on the table. If they were to switch to
their value added-maximizing options, they would gain, on average, 1 standard deviation of value
  40. A value of 100 indicates that the household chooses the best option by value added or selectivity within its
feasible set. A value of 100/Jie implies that the household chooses the worst option.



                                                                  21
added. Based on 2019 data, this is equal to a 13 percentage point increase in the probability of
passing the baccalaureate exam. Results for survey towns (column 4) are similar.
    The results for selectivity show that students are much closer to "maxing out" on this track
characteristic. Over the full sample, students on average attend tracks with selectivity at the
81st percentile among their feasible tracks. This amounts to an average potential increase in
selectivity of only 0.32 standard deviations. The results for survey towns are again similar.
    The remaining columns of Table 7 explore whether there is heterogeneity in choice patterns
based on a student's academic achievement. They present results separately for students with
transition scores in the bottom half ("low-achieving") and top half ("high-achieving") of the
within-year distribution. These columns suggest that there is limited heterogeneity.

                                    Figure 2: Choice patterns by transition score




The figure shows how choice patterns vary with a student's transition score. Specifically, it plots the relationship between the
percentile rank of the student's transition score and three choice-related variables. The blue line is the maximum value of value
added, V ^ jt , or selectivity, MTSjt in the student's feasible set. The purple line is the mean value in the feasible set, and the green
line is the value in the track the student attends. The lines are calculated using local linear regressions. The difference between the
blue and green lines is the mean potential increase for the given percentile rank. See Table 7 for additional details.


    This is visible in Figure 2 (page 22), which shows how the potential increase in value added
or selectivity varies with the percentile rank of a student's transition score. The figure plots the
relationship between the student's percentile rank and three variables: i) the maximum value (in

                                                                   22
standard deviations of value added or selectivity) in the student's feasible set, ii) the mean value
in the set, and iii) the value for the track the student attends. The difference between the lines
for the maximum and for the value of the student's track is equal to the mean potential increase
in value added or selectivity for students with a given transition score. For both outcomes,
these potential increases are relatively constant across the transition score distribution (they are
smaller for the lowest-achieving students, who have limited choice). We also find that the results
in this section are robust to a range of alternative specifications.41
    Finally, we investigate whether results are influenced by the fact that tracks differ in cur-
riculum. If households have strong curricular preferences, they may choose the best available
track within their preferred curriculum. In this story, households leave value added on the table
because they willingly exchange it for this other track characteristic. We find that this holds only
partially. Table A10 (page 59) replicates Table 7 while restricting a household's choice set to the
subset of feasible tracks whose curricula fall into the same category as that of its child's track.
It shows that for all towns the average student attends a track with value added (selectivity) at
the 65th (80th ) percentile among this restricted choice set (Panel B). On average, these students
could obtain increases in value added (selectivity) of 0.6 (0.3) standard deviations (Panel C).
In survey towns, the corresponding values are 0.5 (0.3) standard deviations. Thus, even within
curricular categories, households leave significant value added unexploited.

2     Do households have accurate beliefs regarding value added?
The previous section examined the consequences of household decision-making, asking whether
students end up at one of the tracks with higher value added among those in their feasible sets.
This section investigates a key aspect of the mechanics of decision-making. Namely, the accuracy
of households' beliefs regarding track value added.
    To do this, we use the baseline survey, in which we asked households to score tracks on a
variety of dimensions on a scale of 1 to 5 (Table 3, page 15). We analyze the accuracy of these
scores by comparing them with the values of track characteristics that we observe as researchers
(the "true values"). In particular, we compare households' scores for a track's value added
with our predictions for this characteristic, VP
                                               jt . As a benchmark, we also compare their scores
for a track's peer quality with the track's prior-year selectivity, MTSjt-1 . This benchmark is
noteworthy because selectivity is salient in Romania and households can view each tracks' prior-
year selectivity on the official admissions website. Thus, this benchmark represents the accuracy
of households' quality scores under a scenario of potentially full access to information.42
 41. Figure A6 (page 52) replicates Figure 2 using alternative value added measures, with similar results
 42. Arguably, households' peer quality scores should reflect a track's current-year selectivity, rather than its
prior-year selectivity. In determining peer quality scores, a rational household might combine the data on prior-
year selectivity with its knowledge of changes in tracks' characteristics from the prior year to the current year.
To explore this, we have calculated results using current-year selectivity and find that they are similar.



                                                       23
    We begin by simply regressing the true values of track characteristics on households' quality
scores. Since the scores are on a scale of 1 to 5, we transform the true values into corresponding
units by calculating their within-town quintile. Specifically, we estimate:

                                           quint(VP                   V
                                                  jt ) = 0,V + 1,V · sij + ij,V
                                                                                                                                 (3)

where quint(·) is a within-town quintile. Here 1,V is the association between a one point increase
in a household's quality score for value added, sV
                                                 ij , and within-town quintiles of our prediction
for value added, quint(VP
                        jt ). Similarly, 1,P Q is the association between a one point increase
in a household's score for peer quality, sP Q
                                          ij , and within-town quintiles of prior-year selectivity,
quint(MTSjt-1 ). Thus, if households' scores were fully accurate, then the slope coefficients and
R-squared would both equal 1.

The table presents regression results from equation (3). quint(·) is the within-town quintile of the given variable. The sample drops
student-track observations if the survey respondent did not score the track on both value added and peer quality. It also excludes
observations for 43 tracks that were newly created in 2019. Standard errors are clustered by middle school.


    The results from regression (3) are in Table 8 (page 24). The first two columns provide results
for all students; the remaining columns provide them separately for low- and high-achieving
students. The first column is for the regression with respect to value added; it shows that
households' scores are significant but imperfect predictors for this track characteristic. A one
point increase in a household's score for value added is associated with a 0.44 quintile increase
in our prediction for value added. The R-squared reveals that households' scores explain 17
percent of the variation in quintiles of predicted value added. The second column presents the
selectivity regression. It shows that households' scores are substantially more accurate in this
case: households' peer quality scores explain 33 percent of the variation in quintiles of prior-
year selectivity. The columns that distinguish by student achievement reveal that households
with high-achieving children have more accurate scores than those with low-achieving children.
Nonetheless, both types are better at evaluating selectivity than value added. For instance, for
households with high-achieving children, peer quality scores explain almost 40 percent of the

                                                                 24
variation in quintiles of prior-year selectivity; meanwhile, their value added scores explain only
20 percent of the variation in quintiles of predicted value added.
    These results are highly robust. Tables A11-A13 (pages 59-60) present alternative versions
of regression (3) that address various potential concerns. First, it is possible that the results in
Table 8 are impacted by the fact that most households score only a subset of the tracks in their
towns. Table A11 (page 59) restricts the sample to the 21 percent of households with no missing
scores, with similar results. Second, it may be that households gather information only on tracks
that their child is likely to be eligible for. In this case, the results in Table 8 would average over
accurate scores for tracks that are plausibly feasible and inaccurate ones for tracks that are out
of reach. Table A12 restricts the sample to tracks that a student would have been eligible to
attend in the prior year, again producing similar results. Finally, it may be that households had
not yet studied their options when the baseline survey took place. To investigate this, we restrict
the sample to the 43 percent of households that reported already being "very certain" of their
preference rankings during the baseline survey. The results, in Table A13, are still similar.43
    We next explore whether households are better informed about certain types of tracks. First,
we study how the accuracy of beliefs depends on a track's position within the town's distribution
of value added or selectivity. Figure 3 (page 26) shows how households' quality scores vary
with a track's within-town quintile, and how these relationships depend on the achievement
level of a household's child. Specifically, for tracks in each within-town quintile of value added
or selectivity, we plot separate local linear regressions of households' quality scores (for value
added and peer quality, respectively) on the percentile rank of a student's transition score. If
households' scores were fully accurate, each of the curves in Figure 3 would be a horizontal line
at the value of the given quintile; if scores were random, each of the curves would be a horizontal
line at a value of 3.
    Figure 3 confirms key takeaways from Table 8. Namely, households' peer quality scores are
more accurate in explaining selectivity (Panel B) than are their value added scores in explaining
value added (Panel A). Similarly, households with high-achieving children are better informed
than those with low-achieving children; however, the difference is particularly pronounced for
selectivity.44 The figure also provides insight into the source of the inaccuracies in households'
  43. We consider two additional potential concerns. First, households may assign scores based on the national
rather than within-town distribution of tracks. In results not shown, we estimate (3) using quintiles of true values
calculated using the national distribution. We find that R-squared values are slightly lower than those in Table
8. Second, the R-squared statistics we provide may be misleading. These are R-squared in terms of explaining
predicted value added, VP  jt . However, we are ultimately interested in R-squared in terms of explaining true value
added, Vjt . To investigate this distinction, we run a version of regression (3) that uses values of track characteris-
tics in standard deviation units, rather than within-town quintiles. For this alternative parameterization, we can
calculate R-squared in terms of explaining Vjt . We do this by adjusting the R-squared for VP      jt for forecast error
(Appendix A1.4 describes the procedure). The results are in Table A14 (page 60). They show that R-squared for
true value added, Vjt , is similar to but slightly lower than that for predicted value added, VP  jt .
  44. For instance, for households with children at the top percentile of the transition score distribution, peer

                     Figure 3: Mean quality scores by quintile of the track's true values




The figure displays mean household scores for tracks in different within-town quintiles of predicted value added, VP      jt , or prior-year
selectivity, MTSjt-1 . Specifically, for tracks in each quintile of value added or selectivity, it presents separate local linear regressions
of households' quality scores on the percentile rank of a student's transition score. "In top quintile" refers to the tracks in the
highest within-town quintile, and "In bottom quintile" indicates the tracks in the lowest within-town quintile. The sample drops
student-track observations if the survey respondent did not score the track on both value added and peer quality. It also excludes
observations for 43 tracks that were newly created in 2019.



beliefs. For value added, households on average are able to distinguish three groups of tracks:
those in the top two-fifths of the town's distribution, those in the middle fifth, and those in the
bottom two-fifths. However, they cannot differentiate any further.45 By contrast, for selectivity,
households' mean scores increase almost monotonically with a track's quintile.
     Finally, we explore whether beliefs are more accurate for the tracks that households rank
highly. If households spend more time researching these tracks, they may score them more
accurately. However, they may also assign inappropriately high scores to these tracks in order
to rationalize their preference for them. Table 9 (page 27) presents the results. Its first three
columns refer to all tracks, and the rest to the two tracks the household ranked the highest in
the baseline survey.46
     Panel A explores accuracy, displaying the mean absolute difference between a household's
score and the within-town quintile of a track's true value. It reveals that households' scores for
their most-preferred tracks are only slightly more accurate than their scores for all tracks. Among
all students and over all tracks, households' value added scores have a mean absolute error of
quality scores are nearly accurate for all tracks except those in the bottom quintile of selectivity.
 45. In fact, households with the highest-achieving children mistakenly believe that tracks in the fourth quintile
have higher value added than those in the top quintile.
 46. As noted in Appendix A4, over 95 percent of households believe their child will attend one of these tracks.


                                                                    26

The table presents statistics on the accuracy of households' quality scores. Panel A reveals the mean absolute difference between a
household's quality score and the within-town quintile of the associated track characteristic. Panel B exhibits the mean difference
between these quantities. "Low-achieving" ("High-achieving") students are those with transition scores in the bottom (top) half of
the national distribution. "`Top two most-preferred tracks" are the two tracks that the household ranked the highest in the baseline
preference ranking. The sample drops student-track observations if the survey respondent did not score the track on both value
added and peer quality. It also excludes observations for 43 tracks that were newly created in 2019.



1.1 quintiles; for their top two most-preferred tracks, households' scores are off by an average of
1 quintile. For selectivity, the corresponding values are 0.9 and 0.8 quintiles. Broadly speaking,
these patterns do not depend on whether a household has a low- or high-achieving child.47
      Panel B explores bias, displaying the mean difference between a household's score and the
within-town quintile of a track's true value. It indicates that households overestimate the qual-
ity of their most-preferred tracks. Among all tracks, households' value added scores are biased
upwards by an average of 0.4 quintiles. By contrast, for their most-preferred tracks, house-
holds' value added scores overestimate by 0.6. This again does not depend on their student's
achievement level. On the other hand, results for peer quality do vary by student achievement.
For households with low-achieving students, peer quality scores are too high by 0.4 quintiles
among all tracks and 0.7 quintiles among the top two most-preferred tracks. For households
with high-achieving students, these values are only 0.1 and 0.2 quintiles.
      In short, households are only partially informed about track value added. Interestingly, many
households are also imperfectly aware of track selectivity, despite access to information on this
trait. Finally, households are only slightly more knowledgeable about their most-preferred tracks
than about the others, and they seem to over-estimate the quality of these tracks.

3       Does providing information change households' choices?
The previous sections suggest that households may lack information on track value added. In
particular, households leave value added on the table when choosing tracks, and have beliefs on
this attribute that are only partially accurate. In this section, we use our experiment to test
whether informing households about value added can influence their track choices. This could
 47. The only exception is that for households with low-achieving students, peer quality scores are actually less
accurate for their most-preferred tracks.



                                                                27
occur if information causes households to update their beliefs (e.g., the mean or precision), or if
it alters their preferences over track characteristics (e.g., by making value added more salient).
    We begin by presenting our main reduced-form treatment effect, revealing whether providing
information caused students to attend tracks with higher value added. We then make use of
the follow-up survey and examine effects on beliefs and track preference rankings. We use these
results to explain the heterogeneity we find. Finally, we investigate tradeoffs, asking whether
students were induced to give up other track attributes in exchange for value added.

3.1      Effects on the value added of students' tracks
Our main outcome of interest is the value added of the track that a student attends. This
outcome affects students' learning during high school and their chances of progressing to higher
education. In order to calculate the treatment effect on this outcome, we estimate:

                                         sd(VP t ) = 0 + 1 · Ti + X · Xi + i .
                                             ji                                                                                  (4)

Here, sd(VP t ) is the predicted value added of the track of student i in standard deviation units,
          ji
Ti is an indicator for whether i is in the treatment group, and Xi is a vector of i's covariates.48
The coefficient of interest is 1 . It captures the average treatment effect of providing information
on the value added of the track a student attends.

The table presents results from regression (4). "Effect in percentage points" is the magnitude of the treatment effect in terms of the
probability that a student passes the baccalaureate exam. This is calculated by multiplying the effect in standard deviation units by
the 2019 standard deviation of true value added, Vjt . The "Predicted pass rate" is the share of students in the regression sample
who are predicted to pass. This is calculated in two steps. First, we predict the probability of passing for each student by
calculating the share of students with the same transition score percentile rank who passed in the 2004-2014 admission cohorts.
Second, we average these values over the students in the regression sample. Low-achieving (high-achieving) students are those with
transition scores in the bottom (top) half of the national distribution. Standard errors are clustered by the middle school
treatment-control pairs within which we conducted the randomization.


    Table 10 (page 28) presents the results. The first column is for all students and shows that,
over the full sample, providing information had only a modest effect. It caused students to attend
  48. Due to the randomization, covariates are not necessary for identification but may increase precision. In our
main specification, Xi includes (i) an indicator for whether the student ranked a feasible track in the baseline
survey and (ii) the value added of the track to which the student would have been assigned based on their baseline
preference ranking. This latter covariate is calculated as the value added of the feasible track that the student
ranked highest in the baseline survey. It is set to zero if the student did not rank any feasible tracks in this survey.

                                                                 28
tracks with value added that was higher by an average of 0.05 standard deviations (significant
at a 10 percent confidence level). This amounts to an increase in the probability of passing
the baccalaureate exam of 0.56 percentage points, which is small relative to the 63 percent
predicted pass rate. The second and third columns differentiate by student achievement and
reveal that the main effect is driven entirely by low-achieving students--those with transition
scores in the bottom half of the national distribution. For these students, the treatment effect is
0.12 standard deviations (significant at a 5 percent level). This is a 1.4 percentage point increase
in the probability of passing, as compared to a 29 percent predicted pass rate. By contrast, for
high-achieving students, the treatment effect is virtually zero and statistically insignificant.
    The results in Table 10 are robust. Table A15 (page 61) presents results from alternative
versions of regression (4), including some that control for different sets of covariates and others
that employ a difference-in-difference design. The treatment effects are not sensitive to these per-
turbations. We also assess whether the treatment effects are confounded by spillovers. Namely,
it is possible that treated households shared information with others in the town, including, some
in the control group. If so, then the treatment effects would be biased toward zero. Appendix
A5 (page 82) tests for spillovers by examining whether treatment effects are larger in towns in
which we visited a smaller fraction of middle schools. We find no evidence that they are.
    We next investigate whether treatment effects vary based on whether a student was eligible
for the tracks they preferred in the baseline survey. As noted in Appendix A4 (page 77), over
95 percent of households expected their child to be admitted to at least one of the two tracks
that they ranked highest in the baseline. Thus, it is possible that households were more willing
to change their choices over the other tracks, given that they did not expect those choices to
be relevant for their track assignments. Under this scenario, treatment effects would be larger
for students who did not end up being eligible for their two top baseline choices and smaller for
those who did. Importantly, almost a quarter of students fall into the former group.

The table presents results from regression (4) for subsets of students by eligibility for the tracks that students ranked highly in the
baseline survey. "Most-preferred" is the set of students who were eligible for their most-preferred baseline track. "2nd-most-
preferred" is the set who were eligible for the track that they ranked second highest in the baseline, but not for the track they
ranked highest. " 3rd-most-preferred" is the set who were not eligible for either of their two most-preferred tracks, and so on. See
the notes to Table 10 for additional details.

    Table 11 (page 29) presents the results, showing treatment effects for subsets of students
who differ in eligibility for their top baseline choices. The first column refers to students who
scored above the admissions cutoff for their most-preferred baseline choice. The second column
is for students who scored above the cutoff for their second-most-preferred track in the baseline,
but not for their top choice. The remaining columns are for students who were eligible for only
their third-most-preferred baseline choice or worse, their fourth-most-preferred baseline choice or
worse, etc. The results corroborate the story in the previous paragraph. The first two columns
show that treatment effects are statistically insignificant and close to zero for students who were
eligible for one of their two top baseline choices. By contrast, the remaining columns reveal that
treatment effects are large and statistically significant for the rest. Depending on the sample, the
effects for these students range from 0.17 to 0.19 standard deviations. These effects translate into
increases in the probability of passing the exam of 2-2.25 percentage points, which are substantial
relative to predicted pass rates of 28-33 percent.

The table presents results from regression (4) for subsets of students. The subsets represent the interaction between student
characteristics (achievement, gender, or mother's schooling) and whether the student was eligible for at least one of the two tracks
s/he listed as most preferred in the baseline survey. Low-achieving (high-achieving) students are those with transition scores in the
bottom (top) half of the national distribution. See the notes to Table 10 for additional details on the regressions.


    Finally, we examine how this heterogeneity interacts with student characteristics. We esti-
mate regression (4) for different types of students, always distinguishing between those who were
eligible for their two top baseline choices and those who were not. The results are in Table 12
(page 30). Panel A refers to students who did gain admission to their top baseline choices. For
these individuals, treatment effects are small and statistically insignificant regardless of achieve-
ment, gender, or mother's schooling. Panel B concerns the other group--those rejected by their
top baseline choices. Even within this group, treatment effects are driven by low-achieving stu-
dents. For them, the effect is 0.2 standard deviations (significant at a 1 percent level), an increase

                                                                   30
in the probability of passing the exam of 2.4 percentage points over a predicted pass rate of 25
percent. Meanwhile, treatment effects for high-achieving students (Panel B) are close to zero and
statistically insignificant. The remaining columns in the panel indicate that treatment effects do
not vary by a student's gender or by his/her mother's schooling.
   In short, this subsection shows that the treatment had heterogeneous effects. It had little
impact for high-achieving students or for low-achieving students admitted to one of their top
baseline choices. By contrast, for low-achieving students who were rejected by these choices, the
treatment had large effects. It caused these students to attend tracks with value added that was
higher by 0.2 standard deviations. In the next two subsections, we probe these patterns further
by using the follow-up survey to investigate effects on beliefs and track preference rankings.

3.2    Effects on beliefs regarding value added
In this subsection, we explore whether the treatment affected households' beliefs regarding track
value added. In particular, we assess whether it caused an increase in the accuracy of households'
quality scores for this track characteristic.
   Before turning to results, we note that there are two ways this analysis of quality scores
may understate treatment effects on beliefs. First, it is possible for information to influence
the precision of households' beliefs without changing their quality scores. Second is an issue
of timing. The follow-up survey took place a few weeks after households submitted their track
preference rankings. It is possible that households had turned their attention to other topics
by this point and had forgotten some of what they knew when they were deciding their track
preferences. This lag may have introduced measurement error in the follow-up quality scores.
While acknowledging these caveats, we believe that treatment effects on quality scores are a
useful proxy--and a possible lower bound--for those on beliefs.
   To conduct the analysis, we estimate:

                         |quint(VP       V
                                 jt ) - sij,fs | = 0 + 1 · Ti + X · Xij + ij .                      (5)

Here, |quint(VP       V
              jt ) - sij,fs | is the absolute difference between: i) the predicted value added of track
j in units of within-town quintiles, quint(VP
                                            jt ), and ii) household i's quality score for the track's
value added from the follow-up survey, sV
                                        ij,fs . As in regression (4), the coefficient of interest is 1 .
It represents the average treatment effect on the absolute error of households' quality scores. If
the treatment caused households' scores to become more accurate, then 1 will be negative.
   Table 13 (page 32) presents the results. The first column provides results for all tracks,
while the others distinguish by a track's position in a household's baseline preference ranking.
Specifically, the second and third columns are for the tracks that households listed, respectively,
as most- and second-most-preferred. The fourth through seventh columns are for the tracks that


                                                  31
households listed as third-most-preferred or worse, fourth-most-preferred or worse, etc.

The table presents results from regression (5). The columns provide results for different sets of tracks. "Most-preferred" refers to
the track that a household ranked highest in the baseline survey. "2nd-most-preferred" is the track that a household ranked second
highest in this survey. " 3rd-most-preferred" are all tracks other than the two that the household ranked highest. The remaining
columns are defined analogously. The regressions include indicators for the value of the absolute difference between: i) the
within-town quintile of a track's predicted value added, quint(VP  jt ), and ii) the household's baseline score for the track on this
dimension, sVij . In calculating these indicators, we create a separate group for the tracks for which the household did not provide
scores in the baseline survey. "Mean abs. difference: baseline" is the mean absolute difference between quint(VP         V
                                                                                                               jt ) and sij for the
sample. Similarly, "Mean abs. difference: follow-up" is the mean absolute difference between quint(VP         V
                                                                                                    jt ) and sij,fs . Standard errors
are clustered by the middle school treatment-control pairs within which we conducted the randomization.


    The results indicate that the treatment increased the accuracy of households' scores, but
only for their less-preferred tracks. For the full set of tracks, the treatment led to a statistically
insignificant improvement in accuracy of 0.06 quintiles. This is a small effect relative to the mean
inaccuracy of about one quintile.49 For the tracks that households' ranked highest and second-
highest in the baseline survey, treatment effects are even smaller. By contrast, for the remaining
tracks, the treatment induced sizable improvements in accuracy. These effects (columns 4-7),
are all significant at either the 1 or 5 percent confidence level. The improvements appear to be
larger for tracks farther down a household's baseline preference ranking. For instance, for tracks
other than a household's two top baseline choices, the improvement is 0.1 quintiles; for tracks
other than a household's five top baseline choices, the improvement rises to 0.2 quintiles.
    Tables A16 and A17 (page 61) replicate Table 13, examining whether effects differ for house-
holds with low- and high-achieving children. The results are similar for both types of households.
Providing information improved the accuracy of quality scores only for tracks that households
did not prefer in the baseline survey. For these tracks, treatment effects are twice as large for
households with low-achieving children as they are for households with high-achieving children.
For households with high-achieving children, effects are always of expected sign but small in
magnitude. Only one of them is significant at the 10 percent confidence level.
    To summarize, this subsection shows that the treatment was only partially successful at
influencing beliefs. It impacted households' quality scores for tracks that they did not initially
  49. Specifically, the mean absolute difference between households' scores and quint(VP
                                                                                       jt ) was 1.02 quintiles in
the baseline survey and 1.00 quintiles in the follow-up survey.


                                                                 32
prefer. Even for these tracks, it had small effects for households with high-achieving children.

3.3     Effects on track preference rankings
We next analyze effects on households' track preference rankings. We examine whether infor-
mation caused households to assign higher preference ranks to tracks with higher value added.
Specifically, we calculate the treatment effect on the association between the within-town per-
centile rank of a track's value added and the percentile rank of the track in a household's pref-
erence ranking. We estimate:

                     pprij,fs = (1 + 2 · Ti ) · pr(VP
                                                    jt ) + (X,1 + X,2 · Ti ) · Xij + ij .                         (6)

In this regression, pprij,fs is household i's percentile preference rank for track j , as reported in
the follow-up survey.50 It is calculated by dividing a track's rank in the household's preference
ranking by the number of tracks in the town. The variable is ordered such that a value of 1
indicates a household's most-preferred track.51 Next, pr(VP
                                                          jt ) is track j 's within-town percentile
rank of value added. It is calculated by dividing the track's within-town value added rank by the
number of tracks in the town. To be consistent with pprij,fs , it is ordered such that a value of 1
indicates the town's best track by value added. Xij is a set of indicators for track j 's position in
household i's baseline preference ranking. The coefficient of interest is 2 ; it measures the effect
of the treatment on the association between value added and preference ranks.52
    Table 14 (page 34) presents the results from regression (6). These exhibit a pattern that is
similar to that for effects on the accuracy of quality scores from Section 3.2. The first column
provides results for the full set of tracks. It shows that, overall, providing information caused a
modest increase in the association between value added and preference ranks. A one percentile
increase in value added is associated with an increase in preference ranks that is higher by 0.05
percentiles for the treatment group than for the control. This difference is significant at a 10
percent confidence level. The remaining columns show that treatment effects exist only for tracks
that households did not initially prefer. Namely, the second column reveals that for the two tracks
that a household ranked highest in the baseline survey, the treatment effect is insignificant and
has the wrong sign. By contrast, the third column shows that after excluding these tracks, the
treatment effect rises to 0.06 percentiles and becomes significant at the 1 percent confidence level.
  50. At the time of the baseline survey, we told households that we would contact them after the allocation for
a follow-up survey. We requested that they save a copy of their official track preference rankings in preparation
for this. When we conducted the follow-up, we asked households to find their copy and read off the ranking. We
therefore believe that the preference rankings reported in the follow-up reasonably approximate those submitted.
  51. We set pprij,fs equal to 0 for tracks that households do not rank, since students cannot be assigned to these
tracks. In particular, if a household ranks all Ji tracks in its town, its least-preferred track has pprij,fs = 1/Ji .
Unranked tracks should thus have a value of pprij,fs that is less than 1/Ji ; we choose 0.
  52. By including Xij , 1 measures the average slope of conditional-on-Xij best-fit lines between pprij,fs and VP jt
for households in the control group. 1 + 2 measures the average slope of these lines for treated households.


                                                         33
Effects continue to grow for tracks that were farther back in the baseline preference ranking. For
instance, for tracks other than a household's five top baseline choices, the effect is 0.07 and
significant at a 1 percent confidence level.

The table presents results from regression (6). The values in the row labeled "Value added: treated" are the estimates and standard
errors for 2 . The columns provide results for different sets of tracks. "Two most-preferred" refers to the two tracks that households
ranked highest in the baseline survey. " 3rd-most-preferred" are all tracks other than the two that are most preferred. The
remaining columns are defined analogously. The regressions include indicators for the interaction between a track's position in a
household's baseline preference ranking and whether the household is in the treatment group. In calculating these indicators, we
create separate groups for tracks that households left unranked in the baseline survey. "Association: baseline" is the slope
coefficient from a regression of the percentile preference rank from the baseline survey, pprij,bs , on pr(VPjt ). "Association:
follow-up" is the slope coefficient from a regression of pprij,fs on pr(VP
                                                                         jt ). Standard errors are clustered by the middle school
treatment-control pairs within which we conducted the randomization.


    Tables A18 and A19 (page 62) replicate Table 14 for households with low- and high-achieving
children. These again display patterns similar to those in Section 3.2. For both groups of
households, treatment effects are insignificant for the two tracks that households ranked highest
in the baseline survey. For the remaining tracks, effects are small and mostly insignificant for
households with high-achieving children; meanwhile, they are sizable and significant at a 1 percent
confidence level for households with low-achieving children.
    Thus, the story with regard to treatment effects on preference rankings matches that with
respect to effects on beliefs. Providing information caused households to re-order their preference
rankings only for tracks other than their two top baseline choices. In addition, these effects were
small for households with high-achieving children.

3.4      Interpreting the effects on the value added of students' tracks
The results for beliefs and preference rankings help to explain the heterogeneity in treatment
effects on the value added of students' tracks. For high-achieving students, providing information
had little impact on beliefs or preference rankings. As a result, it did not cause these students
to attend tracks with higher value added. For low-achieving students, the information did affect
beliefs and preference rankings, but only for tracks that were initially less preferred. Thus, for
this group, treatment effects differ depending on whether a student was eligible for his or her top
baseline choices. The treatment had little influence on track assignments for students who were
eligible for one of these choices, while it had significant effects for students who were not.

                                                                 34
    As mentioned in Section 3.1, the fact that households were more receptive to information for
tracks other than their top baseline choices is likely a consequence of the approach that they used
to rank tracks. The tracks that households ranked highest were ones that they thought would
be feasible and that they thus expected their child to attend.53 It may be that households were
less attached to their beliefs and preference rankings for the other tracks because they did not
think those tracks would be relevant.
    A separate question is why responses were larger for households with low-achieving children
than for those with high-achieving children. One possible explanation is that households with
high-achieving children may have been more certain of their beliefs and preference rankings at
the time of the baseline survey. If so, our intervention may have come too late in their decision-
making process. To assess this story, we calculate the share of each type of household reporting
(in the baseline survey) that they were uncertain, somewhat certain, or very certain of their
preference ranking. The results are in Table A20 (page 62). They reveal that households with
high-achieving children were relatively more certain, but not by a large amount. Namely, for
this group, 48 percent reported being very certain and 6 percent reported being uncertain; for
households with low-achieving children, these percentages are 36 and 11, respectively.
    A second candidate explanation is that households with low-achieving children may be more
trusting of information provided by outside authority figures. If this were the case, then treatment
effects would be larger for low-achieving students even after conditioning on certainty. Table A21
(page 63) presents results for these effects. It displays effects on beliefs and preference rankings for
subsets of students defined by the interaction of achievement and certainty.54 The results reveal
two points. First, effects are larger for households who reported being uncertain or somewhat
certain than for those who were very certain. Second, even within these groups, effects are larger
for low-achieving students than for high-achieving ones.
    Thus, the evidence suggests that both stories play a role in explaining why households with
low-achieving children were more receptive to the information. These households were less likely
to have settled on their beliefs and preference rankings when the intervention occurred. In
addition, they exhibited larger responses conditional on their degree of certainty.

3.5     Effects on other characteristics of students' tracks
We conclude this section by examining whether the treatment affected other characteristics of
students' tracks, in addition to value added. We are interested in whether households made
tradeoffs in order to attend higher-value added tracks.
    To do this, we re-estimate (4) using a variety of track characteristics as outcomes. Table 15
  53. Recall that more than 95 percent of households expected their child to be admitted to at least one of their
two top baseline choices (Appendix A4, page 77).
  54. In Table A21, the sample of tracks excludes a household's two top baseline choices. This is because the
intervention generated no response for these choices, as discussed previously.

The table presents results from regression (4) for a variety of outcome variables. The outcomes in columns 1 and 2 are, respectively,
predicted value added and minimum transition score. These are both in standard deviation units. The outcome in column 3 is a
household's baseline score for a track's location quality. Finally, the outcomes in columns 4-5 relate to a track's curricular focus.
Regressions control for values of the outcome variable for the track that a household would have been assigned to based on their
baseline preference ranking. This is the feasible track that the household ranked the highest in the baseline survey. The regressions
include indicators for students who did not rank any feasible tracks in this survey. Standard errors are clustered by the middle
school treatment-control pairs within which we conducted the randomization.



(page 36) presents the results. Column 1 is for the valued added of a student's track, replicating
results in Section 3.1. Column 2 is for the track's selectivity, MTSjt , and column 3 is for the
household's baseline quality score for the track in terms of location, sL
                                                                        ij . Columns 4-6 capture
the track's curricular focus--humanities, math and science, or technical subjects. Panel A is for
students who were eligible for one of their two top baseline choices; Panel B is for students who
were not.
    Panel A reveals that the treatment had no impact on any track characteristic for students
who were admitted to one of their top baseline choices. Panel B indicates that the treatment
also had limited effect on characteristics other than value added for students who were rejected
by their top choices. In particular, the treatment caused these students to attend tracks with
0.2 standard deviations worth of additional value added. Yet, it did not affect the selectivity or
location quality of their tracks. The only tradeoff that students were forced to make had to do
with a track's curricular focus. The treatment caused students in Panel B to be 7 percentage
points less likely to attend a technical track. The reason for this is that, conditional on selectivity,
technical tracks tend to have lower value added than humanities or math and science tracks.55

4      How do preferences for other track characteristics affect de-
       mand for value added?
We next explore how demand for value added is constrained by preferences for other track
characteristics. While the analysis in this section is non-experimental, it helps to interpret the
causal results from Section 3.
 55. The relationship between value added and selectivity by curricular focus is in Figure A5 (page 51).


                                                                   36
    We study two questions. First, we attempt to disentangle the relative contributions of pref-
erences and beliefs in causing households to leave value added on the table. Specifically, we
ask, holding fixed households' preferences for track characteristics, how would their track choices
change if they had fully accurate beliefs about value added? Second, we assess how strongly held
are households' preferences. In particular, we examine whether providing information on value
added causes households to care more about this track characteristic--such as by signaling its
importance. If so, then providing information could have larger effects than would be predicted
via its impact on beliefs alone.
    We investigate these questions in three steps. First, we estimate households' preferences
for track characteristics. Second, we predict households' track choices under accurate beliefs.
Third, we gauge to what extent the experimental treatment effects operate through impacts on
preferences rather than beliefs.

4.1        Estimating preferences for track characteristics
We start by estimating households' preferences for track characteristics. We do so by using their
baseline track quality scores to explain their baseline preference rankings.
    Specifically, we write household i's utility from track j , Uij , as a linearly separable function
of its scores for the track, sq
                              ij , on quality dimensions q :


                                             Uij =        q · sq
                                                               ij +   ij .                                        (7)
                                                      q


q is the increase in utility associated with a one-unit increase in a household's quality score,
and   ij   is the idiosyncratic component of utility that is not explained by the household's scores.
Importantly, households' quality scores represent their beliefs about track characteristics, not
the true values of these characteristics. Thus, by using quality scores, the q coefficients directly
measure preferences. If, instead, we were to use true values, then the q coefficients would reflect
a combination of preferences and the correlation between beliefs and true values.56
    We assume that        ij   is independent and follows a Type-1 Extreme Value distribution, and
fit equation (7) to households' preference rankings using a rank-ordered logit.57 Table A22
  56. There are two ways in which equation (7) may fail to recover preferences. First, there may be an omitted
quality dimension that causes ij to be correlated with the sq   ij covariates. In this case, the q coefficients will
capture a combination of the effects of the included and omitted track characteristics. We do not think this is a
major issue because we have quality scores on a large number of relevant dimensions. Second, the q coefficients
will also be biased if utility depends on the precision of beliefs. For instance, if a household's utility is strictly
concave in the score for a track's value added, then the household will gain more utility from a track that it knows
has a score of 4 than from one that it believes has a score of either 3 or 5 with equal probability. We ignore this
issue because we do not have data on the precision of households' beliefs.
  57. A rank-ordered logit is a series of multinomial logits corresponding to each choice in a preference ranking.
In practice, we do not use all the constituent multinomial logits in estimation. Instead, we use just those for
a household's two top choices. That is, we maximize the probability that a household prefers track ri1 to all
other tracks in the town times the probability that the household prefers track ri2 to all other tracks except ri1 .


                                                          37
(page 64) presents the results. The coefficients indicate that households care about a variety of
track characteristics. Column 1 presents a specification that includes quality scores for a track's
location, whether it is used by a student's siblings and friends, its peer quality, its curriculum, and
its value added on passing the baccalaureate exam. All coefficients are statistically significant.
Four are similar in magnitude: those for location (0.28), siblings and friends (0.37), peer quality
(0.34), and value added (0.34). However, these are only a third the size of the coefficient for
curriculum (0.93).
    Next, Columns 2-4 substitute scores for alternative dimensions of value added: value added
on attending a good college, value added on labor market wages, and teacher quality. Column
5 presents the horse race, including scores for all value added dimensions at once. The results
suggest that households care about each type of value added, but are especially interested in
value added on college quality and wages.58 Throughout all specifications, the coefficients for
the other track characteristics remain stable.
    Finally, columns 6 and 7 supplement the quality scores by controlling for the true values of a
few track characteristics that households can easily observe. Column 6 adds controls for a track's
curricular focus, interacted with the student's gender.59 Column 7 adds the absolute difference
between the track's selectivity and the student's transition score.60 These additional covariates
generate a slight improvement in explanatory power. However, they cause little change in the
coefficients for households' quality scores.
    Next, we explore whether there is heterogeneity in preferences based on a student's academic
achievement. Tables A23 and A24 (pages 65 and 66, respectively) replicate Table A22 for low-
and high-achieving students. The results for the two groups are mostly similar, but there are a few
notable differences. First, the coefficients on peer quality are large and statistically significant for
high-achieving students, but small and insignificant for low-achieving ones. Next, high-achieving
students like math and science tracks the most, while low-achieving students like these tracks
the least. Finally, the models have different degrees of explanatory power for the two groups.
Specifically, this likelihood is:
                                                                  2
                                                                            exp[   q   q · sq
                                                                                            iril ]
                            Pr[ri1 , ri2 |Ji , {sq
                                                 ij }q,j ]   =                                                   .   (8)
                                                                       kJi \{rim :m<l}   exp[   q    q · sq
                                                                                                          ik ]
                                                                 l=1

We maximize the sum of the log of (8) over the set of survey households. We focus on only the first two choices
because most households appear to have thought carefully about these by the time of the baseline survey. As we
discuss later, our main conclusions are not sensitive to how many choices we include.
  58. For instance, the horse race puts equal and statistically significant coefficients on value added on college
quality and wages and small and statistically insignificant coefficients on the other value added dimensions.
  59. Households can observe a track's curricular focus just by reading the track's name. Thus, it is reasonable
to assume that they have correct beliefs about this track characteristic.
  60. We include this covariate in an attempt to capture the phenomenon that, for their top choices, households
tend to choose some of the more selective tracks among those that they think will be feasible. We have shown
previously that households' beliefs about track selectivity and about their own child's transition score are not
fully accurate. Nonetheless, households still seem to have a strong sense of this covariate.


                                                                       38
Depending on the specification, we explain about 40 percent of the variation in track choices for
high-achieving students, and only about 20 percent for low-achieving ones.
    Finally, one concern in estimating equation (7) is that few households provide quality scores
for all the tracks in their towns. Missing scores could introduce bias if households' propensity
to score tracks depends on how much they like them. Table A25 (page 67) gauges the impact
of missing scores. It compares the results in Tables A22-A24 with those for two alternative
specifications: one in which we use only the subset of households without missing scores and
another in which we impute the missing scores using a random forest.61 The results reveal that
the coefficients are similar across specifications.

4.2     How would track choices change under accurate beliefs?
We next examine to what extent households' track choices are distorted by the inaccuracy of
their beliefs. To do this, we use the preference model to predict the value added of the tracks
students would attend under alternative sets of beliefs. By comparing these predictions, we can
calculate how much of the value added that households leave on the table is due to beliefs and
how much is due to caring about other features of tracks.62
    Specifically, we consider three sets of beliefs. The first set, "baseline scores" (BS), captures
beliefs at the time of the baseline survey; it simply uses household's baseline quality scores.63 The
second and third sets approximate beliefs at the time that households submit their preference
rankings. "Correct peer" (CP) reflects the information available to households in the control
group. It uses baseline scores for all quality dimensions except peer quality. For peer quality,
it substitutes the within-town quintile of a track's selectivity. "Correct peer and pass" (CPP)
reflects the information available to households in the treatment group. It replaces scores for
both peer quality and value added on passing the baccalaureate exam with the corresponding
within-town quintiles of these track characteristics.
    We predict the value added of students' tracks by combining the preference estimates from
equation (7) with a given set of quality scores. In particular, we calculate a weighted average
of the value added of each track in a household's feasible set. The weights are equal to the
  61. For each quality dimension, we predict a household's score for a track using covariates including: i) charac-
teristics of the track, ii) characteristics of the student, and iii) quality scores for the track from other households
in the same town or middle school as the student. We replace missing scores with these predictions.
  62. Importantly, the analysis in this section holds constant households' feasible choice sets. Thus, it disentangles
the roles of preferences and information in driving choice behavior in the current choice setting. If households
were somehow made to have correct beliefs, the choice setting would change due to dynamic effects on track
selectivity, teacher sorting, value added, etc. We leave these dynamic effects for future work.
  63. For missing quality scores, we substitute the predictions from the random forest.

probability that the household prefers the track, given the scores. For "Baseline scores", this is:

                                                                  exp[    ^q · sq

                                                                                        ik


The formulas for "Correct peer", Vi,CP , and "Correct peer and pass", Vi,CPP , are similar, but
with the alternative sets of scores.
    Before turning to results, we validate our approach comparing our predictions with house-
holds' observed choices. Specifically, we compare Vi,BS with the value added of the track a
student would attend under the household's baseline preference ranking.64 For households in
the control group, we compare Vi,CP with the value added of students' actual tracks.65 We
show these comparisons for three versions of the preference model. Our preferred specification,
"Preferred," uses the model from Column 7 of Table A22. "No transition score distance" drops
the absolute difference between the track's selectivity and the student's transition score (using
the model from Column 6 of Table A22). Finally, "Just quality scores" drops all the true track
characteristics (using the model from Column 1 of the table).66 Figure A7 (page 53) presents
the comparisons. It reveals that Vi,BS and Vi,CP closely match the value added of the tracks
that households choose. The fit is considerably better for our preferred specification than for the
other two.67 As a result, we use this specification in the main results.
    The main results are in Figure 4 (page 41) and Table 16 (page 42). Figure 4 is similar to
Figure 2 in Section 1.2. It displays the value added of students' tracks in relation to the options
in their feasible choice sets. Further, it shows how these patterns vary based on a student's
academic achievement.68 Table 16 provides the corresponding summary statistics.
    The results indicate that inaccurate beliefs play only a limited role in accounting for why
households leave value added on the table. First, correcting households' beliefs about peer
  64. This is the value added of the feasible track that the student ranked the highest in the baseline survey.
  65. The analogous exercise for households in the treatment group would compare Vi,CPP with the value added of
students' tracks. However, this would be inappropriate because the treatment did not fully influence households'
beliefs about value added. For instance, it had no effect on beliefs regarding the two tracks that households
ranked the highest in the baseline survey.
  66. In reality, the specifications differ in two ways from those in Table A22. First, we allow coefficients to vary
based on whether a student is low- or high-achieving, as in Tables A23 and A24. Second, we estimate the models
after imputing missing quality scores with the predictions from the random forest, as in Table A25. Thus, the
coefficients for our preferred specification are those from columns 6 and 9 of Table A25.
  67. For instance, for Vi,BS , for our preferred specification, the line of best fit has a slope coefficient of 0.98 and
an R-squared of 0.61. For "Just quality scores", the slope and R-squared are, respectively, 0.91 and 0.55.
  68. In particular, Figure 4 presents local linear regressions of a variety of variables on the percentile rank of a
student's transition score. The blue line is for the value added of the track with the maximum value added in the
student's feasible set, and the purple line is for the mean value added in the set. The green, gray, and brown lines
are for our predictions for the value added of students' tracks for the three sets of beliefs. These are, respectively,
Vi,BS , Vi,CP , and Vi,CPP . The differences between the green, gray, and brown lines represent the mean change in
value added due to changes in beliefs. The difference between these lines and the blue line is the mean potential
increase in value added for a given set of beliefs. In the figure, the green line, "Baseline scores", and the gray
line, "Correct peer", overlap almost perfectly.

               Figure 4: The value added of students' tracks for alternative sets of beliefs




The figure shows the value added of students' tracks under alternative sets of beliefs. Specifically, it plots the relationship between
the percentile rank of the student's transition score and the following variables. The blue (purple) line is for the maximum (mean)
value of value added in the student's feasible set. The green, gray, and brown lines are for Vi,BS , Vi,CP , and Vi,CPP , respectively.
The lines are calculated using local linear regressions. The green and gray lines are nearly identical. The sample is similar to that for
the experimental treatment effects from Section 3. However, it excludes 15 students who did not score above the admissions cutoffs
for any of the tracks that existed in both 2018 and 2019. (These students were assigned to tracks that were newly created in 2019.)



quality would have almost no effect on the value added of students' tracks. Table 16 shows that
the mean difference between Vi,CP and Vi,BS is 0.004 s.d. for low-achieving students and 0.023 s.d.
for high-achieving ones. By contrast, correcting beliefs about value added would have a modest
effect. The mean difference between Vi,CPP and Vi,CP is 0.131 s.d. for low-achieving students and
0.107 s.d. for high-achieving ones. Thus, even with correct beliefs about both peer quality and
value added, households would still leave substantial value added on the table. For low-achieving
students, the mean potential increase in value added is 0.713 s.d. for baseline scores (BS), 0.710
s.d. for correct peer (CP), and 0.579 s.d. for correct peer and pass (CPP). Meanwhile, for high-
achieving students, the analogous values are 0.983 s.d., 0.960 s.d., and 0.852 s.d. We assume
that "Correct peer" represent households' choices in the normal institutional context in which
households are not provided with information on value added. Thus, for low-achieving students,
inaccurate beliefs about value added account for 18 percent of the value added that is left on the
table. For high-achieving students, the corresponding share is 11 percent.69
  69. Table A26 (page 68) tests the sensitivity of the results to alternative specifications of the preference model.
It provides results for "no transition score distance" and "just quality scores". It also provides results for models
using different numbers of choices in estimating the rank-ordered logit. For each specification, the table presents
the mean difference between Vi,CPP and Vi,CP . It reveals that this difference is insensitive to the number of choices

The table presents summary statistics on our predictions for the value added of students' tracks under alternative sets of beliefs.
"Change in VA" is the mean difference between the listed variables. "Potential increase in VA" is the mean difference between (i)
the maximum value of value added in students' feasible sets and (ii) the listed variables. The sample is similar to that for the
experimental treatment effects from Section 3. However, it excludes 15 students who did not score above the admissions cutoffs for
any of the tracks that existed in both 2018 and 2019. (These students were assigned to tracks that were newly created in 2019.)



    The results in Table 16 may seem small given the size of the treatment effects in Section 3. For
instance, for the students for whom the treatment had an impact--low-achieving students who
were not admitted to their top two baseline choices--the treatment effect was 0.2 s.d. This value
is larger than the mean difference between Vi,CPP and Vi,CP for low-achieving students (0.131
s.d.).70 A possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the treatment may affect choices
via channels other than the accuracy of households' beliefs. In particular, it may also affect
the precision of beliefs or households' preferences for track characteristics. These effects would
operate through changes in the nature of the preference model itself, rather than in the values
of the quality scores. We explore this explanation in the next section.

4.3      Was the treatment effect due to changes in beliefs or preferences?
This section examines whether the treatment effect operated via changes in beliefs or preferences.
If the treatment operated through beliefs, then it would cause treated households to update
their track preferences in accordance with our preference model. These households would engage
in a reasoning process where they, in effect, calculate new values of utility for each track by
multiplying the preference coefficients, q , by new values of track quality scores. By contrast,
if treatment operated via other channels, then households' track preferences would diverge from
the predictions of the preference model. Notably, if the treatment caused households to care
more about value added, then their track preferences would align with this characteristic more
tightly than predicted.
    We explore this distinction by running a horse race. We evaluate whether households' final
track preference rankings are better explained by predictions from the preference model or by
raw values of track value added. Specifically, we do the following. First, we predict preference
rankings under "Correct peer and pass." As discussed, this set of quality scores reflects the infor-
used. However, the difference is somewhat sensitive to which covariates are included in the model. Namely, the
difference is slightly larger for "no transition score distance" and significantly larger for "just quality scores."
Nonetheless, in all specifications, the difference is still quite modest--the largest value is 0.23 s.d.
 70. In fact, for low-achieving who were not admitted to their top two baseline choices, the mean difference
between Vi,CPP and Vi,CP is even smaller: 0.094 s.d.



                                                                42
mation available to treated households at the time they submit their final preference rankings.71
Next, we calculate a percentile preference ranking, pprij,CPP , by dividing our predicted ranking
by the number of tracks in the town. Finally, we assess whether the treatment effect on preference
rankings is more associated with pprij,CPP or with the percentile rank of value added, pr(VP
                                                                                           jt ).
    Namely, we run a modified version of equation (6) that includes both pprij,CPP and pr(VP
                                                                                           jt ):


    pprij,fs = (1 + 2 · Ti ) · pr(VP
                                   jt ) + (3 + 4 · Ti ) · pprij,CPP + (X,1 + X,2 · Ti ) · Xij + ij .            (9)

Here, 1 and 3 capture how control households changed their preference rankings between the
baseline and endline surveys. These coefficients will be non-zero if control households learned or
reasoned in a way that caused their preference rankings to become more correlated with pprij,CPP
or pr(VP
       jt ). Next, 2 and 4 represent the additional change in preference rankings for treated
households due to the treatment. If this additional change is relatively more associated with raw
values of value added, then 2 will be larger than 4 . Conversely, if the additional change is better
captured by our predicted preference rankings under correct beliefs, then 4 will be larger.72
    Table 17 (page 44) presents the results. The values are for versions of regression (9) that
exclude a household's two top baseline choices.73 The first column replicates the results from
Section 3.3. It includes only pr(VP                                                        P
                                  jt ), as in equation (6). The second column replaces pr(Vjt ) with
pprij,CPP . Finally, the third column is the horse race; it includes both variables simultaneously.
The results reveal that, for the full sample of students, the treatment effect is better explained
by the predicted preference rankings, pprij,CPP , than by raw value added, pr(VP
                                                                               jt ). In the horse
race, all of the effect loads onto the former variable.
    However, the remaining columns reveal important differences between low- and high-achieving
students. For low-achieving students, the treatment caused substantial and statistically signifi-
cant increases in both the extent to which households preferred tracks with higher value added
(Column 4) and in the association between actual and predicted preference ranks (Column 5).
Further, in the horse race, all of the treatment effect loads onto pr(VP
                                                                       jt ) (Column 6). For high-
achieving students, the treatment significantly increased the association with predicted preference
ranks (Column 8), but exerted little impact on demand for value added (Column 7). Moreover,
in the horse race, all of the treatment effect loads onto pprij,CPP (Column 9).
  71. We predict preference rankings using a simulation procedure. First, we calculate a household's utility for a
track under ij = 0 by multiplying the preference coefficients by the given set of quality scores. Call this quantity
uij,CPP . Second, we draw independent Type-1 Extreme Value (T1EV) errors for each track and add them to
the uij,CPP values. Third, we rank the tracks according to the resulting utilities. This generates a simulated
preference ranking under the given draw of T1EV errors. Fourth, we repeat Steps 2 and 3 for a large number of
draws. Finally, for each track, we average its simulated ranks.
  72. Further, if preference rankings for treated households mirror pprij,CPP , then 3 + 4 will be 1 and 1 + 2
will be 0. By contrast, if their preference rankings mimic the value added rankings that we provided, then 1 + 2
will be 1 and 3 + 4 will be 0. In practice, neither of these will happen because few households rank all tracks.
  73. Recall that the treatment had no effect on households' beliefs or preference ranks for these tracks.

The table presents results from regression (9). The regressions include indicators for the interaction between a track's position in a
household's baseline preference ranking and whether the household is in the treatment group. In calculating these indicators, we
create separate groups for tracks that households left unranked in the baseline survey. Columns 1, 4, and 7 replicate the third
columns of Tables 14, A18, and A19, respectively. The sample is equal to the set of students in the follow-up survey. Standard
errors are clustered by the middle school treatment-control pairs within which we conducted the randomization.



    In short, the results suggest that for households with high-achieving students, the treatment
mainly impacted beliefs. These households were more likely to reason through changes in their
preference rankings by combining updated beliefs with stable preferences for track characteristics.
Owing to the small effect of the treatment on their beliefs and to the multi-dimensional nature of
their preferences, the treatment hardly affected whether they preferred high-value added tracks.
By contrast, for households with low-achieving students, the treatment impacted both beliefs
and preferences. Thus, it caused a sizeable change in their demand for track value added.

5      Conclusion
Friedman (1955) argued that giving households freedom to choose schools would improve educa-
tional performance. At first pass this is a straightforward claim, since it extends standard results
from markets for consumer goods to education. Yet rigorous empirical work has produced mixed
results on Friedman's prediction. For example, voucher experiments suggest that choice can
impact students' measured skills in ways that are highly positive (Bettinger et al. 2017), highly
negative (Abdulkadiroglu, Pathak, and Walters 2018), or modest (Muralidharan and Sundarara-
man 2015). Considering analogous mixed evidence on the effects of access to selective schools,
Beuermann and Jackson (2020) observe that "the lack of robust achievement effects of attending
schools that parents prefer is something of a puzzle."
    We have brought new types of data and an experiment to bear on two possible explanations for
this puzzle. The first is that a lack of information prevents households from choosing high value
added schools. Analogous possibilities arise in recent work considering frictions in other markets
in which households make choices with long term implications, such as selecting neighborhoods

                                                                  44
(Bergman, Chan, and Kapor 2020). The second is that households have preferences that lead
them to prioritize school attributes other than value added. This possibility arises in theoretical
and empirical work suggesting this may be rational when school quality is multidimensional
(MacLeod and Urquiola 2019; Beuermann et al. 2019).
   Our results suggest that at least in Romania, both of these possibilities are relevant. First,
we find that essentially all types of households make school choices that leave value added on the
table. Second, our experiment shows that distributing information can affect households' school
rankings, placements, and value added. While the overall effect is modest, it is substantial
for households unable to access their top two choices, i.e., those with lower-achieving children.
Finally, our preference estimates and simulations suggest that this heterogeneity originates in
three factors: First, the treatment had a larger effect on beliefs for lower achieving households;
second, this affected only rankings for choices outside the top two; third, the treatment also
affected preferences for low-achieving households.
   Overall, these findings are consistent with conclusions that emerge elsewhere. For instance,
Abdulkadiroglu, Angrist, and Pathak (2014) and Abdulkadiroglu et al. (2020) find that there
is an overall correlation between value added and selectivity in New York City, although not
necessarily among elite schools. Our key results are also consistent with work finding that
information on value added may affect school markets less than data on absolute achievement
(Mizala and Urquiola 2013; Imberman and Lovenheim 2016).
   That said, the effects of information could be larger or smaller in other settings. On the
one hand, Romanian public schools are relatively homogenous in terms of resources. This may
make it difficult for households to observe value added. On the other hand, the towns we studied
contain fairly standardized markets, with a clear value added measure and few other constraints
on choice, such as cost or distance. This suggests that the market mechanism may work even
less well in other settings.
   Finally, we note some issues left for further research. First, the effects of information might
be larger and of a general equilibrium nature if information can be delivered in greater doses and
in a more sustained fashion than we did. Second, our results suggest that at least in Romania,
households attach a lot of weight to their top school choices. This might generalize to other
settings, where at least anecdotally households tend to focus on "favorite" schools. The origins
and implications of such behavior may be relevant to understanding school markets. Third,
our results leave open questions on whether information interventions change only students'
information sets, as opposed to affecting their preferences; these might have different implications
in terms of wellbeing and schooling outcomes.

    Figure A4: The rel. between V.A. and selectivity: robustness to alternative V.A. measures




The figure replicates Figure 1 for alternative value added measures. Specifically, it presents local linear regressions of standardized
values of various value added measures on standardized values of minimum transition score, MTSjt . The value added measures are:
(i) "VA-pass": a track-year effect on the probability of passing the baccalaureate exam; (ii) "VA-percentile rank": a track-year effect
on the percentile rank of a student's exam performance; and (iii) track-year effects on the probability of passing the exam that vary
by a student's gender or relative academic strength. See Section 0.3 for definitions of each value added measure. See Figure 1 for
additional details on methodology and sample construction.



         Figure A5: The relationship between value added and selectivity by track category




The figure presents the relationship between value added and selectivity for subsets of tracks by a track's curriculum. Specifically, it
replicates the local linear regressions in Figure 1 separately for tracks with curricular focuses in humanities, math and science, or
technical subjects. See Figure 1 for additional details on methodology and sample construction.




                                                                   51
 Figure A6: Choice patterns by transition score: robustness to alternative value added measures




The figure replicates Figure 2 for alternative value added measures. The dotted lines represent local linear regressions of the
maximum value of value added in the student's feasible set versus the within-year percentile rank of the student's transition score.
The solid lines are local linear regressions of the value of value added in the track the student attends versus the student's percentile
rank. The value added measures are: (i) a track-year effect on the probability of passing the baccalaureate exam, (ii) a track-year
effect on the percentile rank of a student's exam performance, and (iii) track-year effects on the probability of passing that vary by a
student's gender or relative academic strength. See Section 0.3 for definitions of each value added measure and Figure 2 for details on
methodology and sample construction.




                                                                  52
     Figure A7: Comparing our predictions with the value added of students' observed choices




The figure shows how our predictions for the value added of students' tracks compare with the value added of students' observed
choices. The plots in column 1 compare Vi,BS with the value added of the track a student would attend under the household's
baseline preference ranking. The plots in column 2 are just for students in the control group. They compare Vi,CP with the value
added of students' actual tracks. The three rows represent different specifications of the preference model. See Section 4.2 for
definitions of "Preferred", "No transition score distance", and "Just quality scores". The black line is a 45-degree line, and the blue
line is the line of best fit. The slope coefficient and R-squared for the line of best fit are shown in the bottom-right corner of each plot.
The sample is similar to that for the experimental treatment effects from Section 3. However, it excludes 15 students who did not
score above the cutoffs of any of the tracks that existed in both 2018 and 2019. (These students were assigned to tracks that were
newly created in 2019.) In addition, the plots in column 1 exclude students who did not rank any feasible tracks in the baseline survey.

The table presents summary statistics on the administrative data by year. It restricts the sample to towns that have at least two
tracks in the given year. "Mean" is the average number of the listed quantity during 2004-2019. "Total" is the sum of the quantity
over those years. "Distinct" is the number of distinct towns, high schools, tracks, and students. The sample varies year to year
because tracks go in and out of existence reflecting factors like changes in student enrollment, the emergence of technical fields, and
instructor availability.

The table presents correlations between estimates for our main value added measure with those for alternative measures. The main
measure is a track-year effect on a student's probability of passing the baccalaureate exam. The alternative measures are: i) a
track-year effect on the percentile rank of a student's performance, and ii) track-year effects on the probability of passing the exam
that vary by student gender or relative academic strength. See Section 0.3 for details. Correlations are weighted by student.

The table presents summary statistics on towns included in the survey. R-squared is the fraction of the variation in value added, Vjt ,
explained by predicted value added, VP
                                     jt , for the town during 2008-2014 (see the notes to Table 2). "Two-class schools" indicates the
number of middle schools in which we visited two classrooms.

The table presents year-specific correlations between a track's value added and its selectivity. Specifically, it displays coefficients from
                                                             ^ jt , on standardized values of minimum transition score, MTSjt . The
regressions of standardized values of value added estimates, V
sample includes the full set of towns. See Figure 1 and Table 6 for additional details on methodology and sample construction.

This table replicates Table 7 but uses a different choice set. The choice set in Table 7 is the set of tracks that a student is eligible to
attend (i.e., the student's "feasible set", Jie ). By contrast, the choice set in this table is the subset of feasible tracks whose curricula
fall into the same category as that of the student's track. Curricular categories are humanities, math and science, and technical
subjects. See Table 7 for additional details on variable definitions and sample construction.

The table presents results from regressions of predicted value added, VP    jt , and prior-year selectivity, MTSjt-1 , on households' quality
scores. The regressions are similar to those in equation (3). However, the outcome variable is in standard deviations, rather than
within-town quintiles. "R-sq." is the R-squared from explaining the listed outcome variable. "R-sq.: Vjt " adjusts for the fact that we
observe only a prediction for value added, VP jt , not the true value, Vjt . See Appendix A1.4 for an explanation of how we calculate
"R-sq.: Vjt ". See Table 8 for additional details on sample construction. Standard errors are clustered by middle school.

The table presents results from various versions of regression (4). In the first column, the outcome variable is the value added of the
feasible track that the student ranked the highest in the baseline survey. The regression in this column is thus a balance test. In the
columns labeled "Final", the outcome variable is the value added of the track the student attends. The results in Column 4
correspond to those in the first column of Table 10. Finally, in the columns labeled "Change", the outcome is the difference between
the value added of the track the student attends and the value added of the feasible track that the student ranked the highest in the
baseline survey. These columns thus represent difference-in-difference regressions. The covariates in each specification are listed under
"Controls". Standard errors are clustered by the middle school treatment-control pairs within which we conducted the randomization.

The table presents treatment effects on beliefs and preference rankings, distinguishing by a household's degree of certainty in their
preference ranking at the time of the baseline survey. "Uncert. or somewhat certain" are households who reported being uncertain or
somewhat certain of their preference rankings during this survey. "Very certain" are households who reported already being very
certain. Panel A presents results from regression (5), as in Table 13. Panel B presents results from regression (6), as in Table 14. The
sample is for tracks other than a household's two top baseline choices. See the notes to Tables 13 and 14 for additional details.

The table presents results from the preference model, equation, (7). The model is estimated by maximizing the log-likelihood
corresponding to equation (8). "Households' baseline quality scores" are the quality scores that households assign to tracks in the
baseline survey. "True track characteristics" are true values of track characteristics. The first four variables under "True track
characteristics" are interactions between a track's curricular focus and a student's gender. Humanities: female and Humanities: male
are the dropped groups. The sample is limited to students in experimental middle schools. Standard errors are clustered by middle
school.

The table shows whether the coefficients from the preference model, equation (7), are robust to missing values for households' baseline
quality scores. "No imputations" are specifications that ignore missing scores. They correspond to Columns 7 of Tables A22-A24.
"Scored all tracks" are specifications that restrict the sample to households without any missing scores. "Imputations" are
specifications that impute the missing scores using a random forest, as described in Section 4.1. See the notes to Table A22 for
additional details on estimating the preference model.

The table presents the mean difference between Vi,CPP and Vi,CP for alternative specifications of the preference model. See Section
4.2 for definitions of "Preferred", "No transition score distance", and "Just quality scores". The columns represent models in which we
use different numbers of choices in estimating the rank-ordered logit. "Top 1" uses just a household's top choice, "Top 2" uses the
household's two top choices, and analogously for "Top 3" and "Top 4". The sample is similar to that for the experimental treatment
effects from Section 3. However, it excludes 15 students who did not score above the admissions cutoffs for any of the tracks that
existed in both 2018 and 2019. (These students were assigned to tracks that were newly created in 2019.)




                                                                 68
A1      Adjusting for measurement error
This section describes the strategies that we use to adjust for measurement error.
A1.1     The standard deviation of Vjt based on Vjt
                                                      ^ jt , rather than the true values, Vjt . Suppose
With finite data, we obtain estimates of value added, V
that the estimates are equal to the true values plus independent measurement error:
                                             ^ jt = Vjt + jt ,
                                             V

with jt  Vjt . By independence, we have:
                                       ^ jt ] = Var[Vjt ] + Var[jt ].
                                   Var[V
                                                                                ^ jt estimates.
Var[jt ] can be estimated as the average of the squared standard errors for the V
Thus, we can calculate the standard deviation of true value added as:

                                  SD[Vjt ] =           ^ jt ] - Var[jt ].
                                                   Var[V

This involves simply subtracting the average squared standard error from the variance of estimated
value added and taking the square root. For tracks in set S , we thus use the finite-sample formula:
                                                                                   1/2
                                                 Njt ^          Njt ^ 2
                    SD[Vjt |jt  S ] =               [(Vjt -         Vjt ) - 2
                                                                            jt ]
                                                                                         ,
                                           jtS   NS         jtS NS

where Njt is the number of students in track j in cohort t, NS is the total number of students in
S , and 2                                    ^
        jt is the squared standard error for Vjt .

A1.2     R-squared for predicting Vjt using VP
                                             jt
In assessing the quality of the predictions, we are interested in how well they predict true value
added, not estimated value added. Specifically, the metric that we want is R-squared in predicting
true value added:

                                       2   E[(Vjt - VP    2
                                                      jt ) ]
                                     R =1-                   .
                                              Var[Vjt ]
Var[Vjt ] can be estimated using the approach explained in the previous subsection. The other
term can be obtained via the following derivation:
                                  ^ jt - VP )2 ] = E[(Vjt + jt - VP )2 ]
                               E[(V       jt                      jt

                                                = E[(Vjt - VP   2
                                                            jt ) ] + Var[jt ].

                               E[(Vjt - VP   2       ^      P 2
                                         jt ) ] = E[(Vjt - Vjt ) ] - Var[jt ].

Thus, for tracks in set S , we calculate R-squared using the following finite-sample formula:
                                                Njt ^       P 2     2
                          2                jtS NS [(Vjt - Vjt ) - jt ]
                         RS   =1-          Njt ^            Njt ^
                                                                                   .
                                       jtS NS [(Vjt -   jtS NS Vjt ) -
                                                                    2       2
                                                                            jt ]

Here, again, Njt is the number of students in track j in cohort t, NS is the total number of students
in S , and 2                                     ^
           jt is the squared standard error for Vjt .

A1.3     The standard deviation of Vjt based on VP
                                                 jt
For the 2015-2019 admissions cohorts, we cannot estimate value added and instead only have
predictions, VPjt . We would like nonetheless to calculate the standard deviation of the true effects,
SD[Vjt ], for these years. To do this, we assume that the true effects are equal to the predictions
plus independent forecast error:

                                            Vjt = VP
                                                   jt + jt ,


with jt  VP                                                              P
               jt . We calculate the variance of Vjt by assuming that Vjt has an R-squared in

use the following derivation:

For tracks in set S , we thus use the following finite-sample formula:

In Section 2, we are interested in assessing how well households' beliefs about value added reflect
a track's true value added. However, we observe only a track's predicted value added, not its true
                                                                 P

                    ij be the fitted value from a regression of Vjt on sij . We calculate R-squared
with respect to explaining true value added as follows. R-squared is:

                                       2   E[(Vjt - pV   2
                                                     ij ) ]

                                              Var[Vjt ]

Var[Vjt ] can be calculated using the approach described in Section A1.3. The other term is:
                                       P
                E[(Vjt - pV   2                   V 2
                          ij ) ] = E[(Vjt + jt - pij ) ]

                                = E[(VP     V 2              P     V
                                      jt - pij ) ] + 2 · E[(Vjt - pij ) · jt ] + Var[jt ]

                                = E[(VP     V 2             V
                                      jt - pij ) ] - 2 · E[pij · jt ] + Var[jt ].


E[(VP     V 2
    jt - pij ) ] can be calculated from the data. Var[jt ] can be calculated as:


                                   Var[jt ] = Var[Vjt ] - Var[VP
                                                               jt ].


                                                   70
Finally, we assume E[pV
                      ij · jt ] = 0; that is, households' scores are not correlated with the unfore-
castable component of track value added.74 Thus, we calculate R-squared as:

                                                     E[(VP     V 2

A2       Validating value added
In this section, we use admissions-cutoff RDs to validate our selection-on-observables value added
measures. We first define the admissions-cutoff RD and then explain how it can be used to compare
value added estimates with causal effects. We finally present results.
A2.1       The admissions-cutoff RD
As discussed by Kirkeboen, Leuven, and Mogstad (2016) and Dahl, Rooth, and Stenberg (2020),
the admissions-cutoff RD captures a complicated treatment effect. To see this, consider the
admissions-cutoff RD for track c in town l(c) in cohort t. Let Ftc be the set of "fallback" tracks to
track c in cohort t. These are tracks in town l(c) with admissions cutoffs (or minimum transition
scores) that in cohort t are lower than that of track c: MTSf t < MTSct  f  Ftc . Calculate a
running variable, mc i , for student i in town l (c) and cohort t as the difference between the student's
transition score, TSi , and the track's minimum transition score: mc           i  TSi - MTSct . Next, let
 c
zi  {0, 1} be an offer to attend track c, which the student receives if his or her value of the
running variable is positive, mc  i > 0.
                                          75
                                             Finally, let dc
                                                           ij (z ) denote whether student i would attend
track j under zic = z .
    In our setting, the only way receiving an admissions offer can change track attendance is by
inducing the student to attend track c. As a result, students can be classified as one of two types.
"Type-f compliers" prefer track c to all fallbacks, followed by track f . These students attend track
f if they do not receive an offer and attend track c if they do: dc                 c
                                                                          if (0) = dic (1) = 1. By contrast,
"type-f never-takers" prefer track f to track c. Thus, these students attend track f regardless of
whether they receive an offer: dc             c
                                   if (0) = dif (1) = 1.
    The admissions-cutoff RD is the difference in observed outcomes between students who score
just above and just below the cutoff. Consider the RD for admissions to track c for students in
cohort t. For reasons that will be apparent later, consider the RD only for students who fall into
  74. This assumption need not hold. However, we think it is reasonable based on the evidence with respect to
households' scores for peer quality. Specifically, we found that households' scores for peer quality are not more
predictive of a track's current-year minimum transition score than they are for the track's prior-year value. This
suggests that households do not have information on trends in peer quality that is not observable to researchers.
Our assumption is that this is also the case for value added.
  75. Students with mic = 0 receive an offer with probability between 0 and 1. We cannot observe which of these
students receive the offer and choose not to attend the cutoff track and which do not receive the offer. As a result,
we exclude these students from the analysis.



                                                              71

                       0

Here, y represents a generic outcome and Il(c)gt is the set of students in town l(c) in cohort t
who are in group g . The RD can be rewritten in terms of potential outcomes. Let yij be the
potential value of outcome y if student i attends track j . Also, for notational simplicity, omit the
conditioning on Il(c)gt . Then the admissions-cutoff RD can be rewritten:

     lim {E[yi |mc      c               c       c

         f

Define the type-f treatment effect as the difference in a student's potential outcome at the cutoff
track relative to track f : yic - yif . Then, in words, the admissions-cutoff RD is a weighted sum
of type-f local average treatment effects for type-f compliers at the cutoff. Weights,
                                    c         c         c           c

are equal to the share of students at the cutoff who are type-f compliers.76
A2.2         RDs on two outcomes
Our strategy for validating the value added measures involves calculating RDs on two different
outcomes. First, we calculate the RD on a student's performance on the baccalaureate exam: pi .
This is the traditional admissions-cutoff RD. Second, we calculate an RD on the value added of
                                       ^ j  gt . These RDs capture the following quantities:
the track ji that the student attends: V  i

                                     f

                      RDV       =         ^ cgt - V
                                         (V       ^ f gt ) ·  c .
                        cgt                                  f gt
                                     f


Here, pij is the potential baccalaureate outcome from attending track j , V        ^ jgt is track j 's value
                                                      c
added for students in group g in cohort t, and f        gt are weights. If our value added measure does

  76. In the derivation, the first equality is due to the definition of potential outcomes. The second equality is from
the RD identification proof of Hahn, Todd, and Van der Klaauw (2001). The third equality is due to the fact that
students are either type-f compliers or type-f never-takers. The fourth equality is a simple manipulation, and the
final equality is due to the law of total expectation.

A2.3     Multi-year RDs
In practice, a track-specific RD for students of a particular type in a single year will be very noisy.
In order to gain statistical power, we calculate RDs that aggregate over each group and cohort.
As shown in the appendix to Cattaneo et al. (2016), these RDs are:

                        RDm
                          c =             RDm                     c
                                            cgt · Pr[i  Il(c)gt |mi = 0, i  Il(c) ]
                                  t   g


for m  {p, V}. These RDs maintain the same structure as in the previous subsection. As before,
if the value added measure is valid, then RDs on the two outcomes (p and V ) should be equal.
A2.4     Estimation
We estimate the RDs using a local linear regression with a uniform kernel. We use a bandwidth
equal to one standard deviation from the nation-wide transition score distribution in each cohort.
Specifically for each cutoff c, we run the regression:

                                      i + 1{mi  0} · (0 + 1 · mi ) + ui
                        yi = t + 1 · mc      c                 c


for i  Il(c) with |mc             c                                                          c
                     i |  1 and mi = 0. Here, t is an intercept that varies by cohort, 1 · mi +
1{mc               c
     i  0} · 1 · mi is a linear spline in the running variable, and 0 is the RD treatment effect
     y
(RDc for outcome y ).
A2.5     Comparing RDs
We then compare the RDs for the two outcomes. Figure A8 plots estimated RDs for baccalaureate
outcomes, RD ^ p , versus those for the value added of students' tracks, RD ^ V . The figure includes
               c                                                               c
plots for a variety of combinations of baccalaureate outcomes and value added measures. The
top-left, bottom-left, and bottom-right plots are for the baccalaureate outcome of whether the
student passes the exam. These plots use value added measures of, respectively, a single track
effect by year on the probability of passing, track effects on this probability that vary by year and
gender, and those that vary by year and relative academic strength. The top-right plot is for the
percentile rank of a student's exam performance and uses a value added measure of a single track
effect by year on this alternative baccalaureate outcome.
    In the plots, each dot represents a different cutoff. The grey diagonal line is a 45-degree line,
and the blue line is a line of best fit from a linear regression. If the RDs on value added are an
unbiased predictor of the RDs on baccalaureate outcomes, then the best fit line will equal the
45-degree line. If the RDs on the two outcomes were always equal, then all the dots would fall on
the 45-degree line. It can be seen that in each plot the best fit line closely matches the 45-degree
line, but that the dots exhibit dispersion around these lines. Importantly, much of this dispersion
could be due to noise in estimating the RDs.
    In Table A27, we assess the similarity of the RDs using an approach that allows us to account
for noise. Specifically, we calculate R-squared from predicting RDs on baccalaureate outcomes
using RDs on value added. We present two different versions of R-squared. The first version is
R-squared for the estimated RDs. This quantity is presented in the first column of the table. It
captures the dispersion represented in Figure A8 and does not account for noise. It is:

                                            Figure A8: Admissions-cutoff RDs




The figure plots estimates of admissions-cutoff RDs on baccalaureate outcomes, RD    ^ p
                                                                                       c , versus those on the value added of students'
         ^ V
tracks, RDc . The grey line is a 45 degree line, and the blue line is a best fit from a linear regression. Values are weighted by the
number of students with transition scores within 1 standard deviation of the cutoff. See Section A2.5 for additional details.



Here, Nc is the number of students in the estimation sample for cutoff c (i.e., i  Il(c) with
|mc             c
   i |  1 and mi = 0), and N is the sum of the number of students in each cutoff's estimation
sample. Next, the second version is R-squared for the true RDs. This quantity is presented in the

Here, (y   2
        c ) is the squared standard error for the estimated RD for cutoff c on outcome y , and

c · c is the covariance in the measurement error for the cutoff's RDs across the two outcomes.77

    The values in Table A27 suggest that RDs on value added are highly similar to those on
baccalaureate outcomes. Further, they indicate that much of the dispersion seen in Figure A8
  77. As described in Appendix C.3.2 of Chandra et al. (2016), the covariance term can be calculated by stacking
the RD regression equations for each outcome for cutoff c and selecting the appropriate element of the variance-
covariance matrix.

is due to measurement error. The values in the first row of the table are for the baccalaureate
outcome of passing the exam and a value added measure of a single track effect on this outcome.
For this specification, the estimated RDs on value added explain 74.8% of the estimated RDs on
passing. However, most of the unexplained variation is noise. After adjusting for measurement
error, the R-squared jumps to 0.994. The next two rows keep the same baccalaureate outcome but
use value added measures that vary by student type. They show that allowing value added to vary
by a student's gender generates a slight improvement (adjusted R-squared of 0.996), while allowing
it to vary by the student's relative academic strength causes a slight deterioration (adjusted R-
squared of 0.986). The final row is for an alternative baccalaureate outcome. It uses the percentile
rank of the student's exam performance, and the value added measure is a single track effect on
this outcome. For this outcome, the adjusted R-squared remains extremely high (0.964).
A2.6         Comparing RDs using an IV approach
The second strategy that we use to compare the RDs is an adaptation of the procedure developed
by Angrist et al. (2017). This involves using the admissions offers that students receive due to
scoring above a cutoff as instruments in a regression of pi (a baccalaureate outcome) on V       ^ j  gt
                                                                                                    i
(the value added of the student's track). In this regression, we stack observations for all cutoffs
and include cutoff-year fixed effects and cutoff-specific controls for the running variable. The
admissions offers generate exogenous variation in V    ^ j  gt due to the fact that some students who
                                                          i
receive an offer attend the associated track. If on average over all cutoffs, an increase in value
added due to scoring above a cutoff improves outcomes by the same amount, then the coefficient
on V^ j  gt will equal 1. In addition, Angrist et al. (2017) note that a researcher can use an over-
       i
identification test to examine whether each cutoff would generate the same coefficient on its own.
Thus, the procedure allows a researcher to both quantify the average bias and to examine whether
there is heterogeneity in the bias across cutoffs.
    Table A28 (page 76) presents results. With our large dataset, this exercise is computationally
burdensome. Thus, we provide results only for our main value added measure of a track-year effect
on the probability of passing the baccalaureate exam. In addition, we divide the cutoffs into ten
random groups and calculate results separately for each group. The results in the table indicate
that value added is unbiased on average, with IV coefficients that hover around 1. However, the
results for the over-identification test generally allow us to reject that each cutoff would generate
the same IV coefficient if used on its own.
    In short, the results from our validation exercises indicate that our value added measures
closely approximate causal effects. However, statistically speaking, the amount of bias is larger
than what would be predicted by noise alone.

     The table presents results from the strategy of Angrist et al. (2017), described in Section A2. Results are for the value added measure of a track-year effect on the probability of
     passing the baccalaureate exam. Cutoffs are divided into ten random groups, and results are presented separately for these groups. The "IV coefficient" is the coefficient on V        ^ j  gt in

                                                       i
     to 1. "Overidentification" is the Sargan-Hansen test of over-identifying restrictions. It tests whether each instrument would generate the same IV coefficient if used on its own. The IV
     regression is estimated using two-stage least squares. All values are robust to heteroskedasticity.

A3      Details on the randomization
We conducted a clustered randomization that involved matching pairs of middle schools within
towns, and then randomizing within pairs. We began with a target sample of 228 middle schools
in 49 towns. Schools in the sample had either one or two classrooms.
    We first conducted the randomization for the two-class schools. In our sample, towns had no
more than two two-class schools. There were 25 towns with two two-class schools. In these towns,
we paired the two-class schools and randomly selected one for treatment. Next, in two towns, there
was one two-class school. In one of these towns, there was one two-class school and one one-class
school. These were matched into a pair, with one school randomly assigned to treatment. In the
other town, there was one two class-school and two one-class schools. These were matched into a
three-school pair, with the one two-class school and the two one-class schools being restricted to
have a different randomly assigned treatment.
    We next randomized the one-class schools. We calculated the Mahalanobis distance among all
one-class schools in each town, using as covariates: i) the number of students in the school, ii)
the average transition score of students in the school, iii) the share of students in the school that
were assigned to academic high-school tracks, and iv) the share of students in the school that were
assigned to tracks with Romanian language of instruction. We then selected treatment-control
pairs sequentially. In each iteration of the matching algorithm, we created a pair by selecting the
two schools in the town with the lowest distance among the schools that did not already form part
of a pair. Finally, we randomly assigned one element of the pair to treatment.
    One complication for the matching algorithm was that some towns had an odd number of one-
class schools. In these towns, we stopped the matching algorithm when there were three remaining
one-class schools. We calculated the Mahalanobis distance of the covariates for each school in the
triple to the average of the covariates of the other two schools in the triple. We split the triple
into two groups based on which school had the lowest Mahalanobis distance to the average of the
two other schools. We then randomly assigned one of the two groups in the triple to treatment.
    In the target sample, the treatment and control groups each consisted of 114 schools. Some
of these schools did not agree to participate in the survey, and in some schools there were issues
with implementation of the survey. When there was an issue with one school in a matched pair,
we dropped the entire pair. Thus, the final experimental sample included 173 middle schools in 46
towns, of which 88 middle schools were in the treatment group and 85 were in the control group.

A4      Households' preference rankings and quality scores
This section presents stylized facts about how households ranked and scored tracks. We are
interested in whether households' track preference rankings truthfully reflect their preferences and
whether the household's town is the appropriate unit of analysis for its choice set.
    First, we investigate how carefully households had thought about their track preference rank-
ings at the time of the baseline survey. The survey occurred about a month before households
were required to submit their rankings. Further, it occurred in information sessions that are used
to explain the admissions process. It is thus possible that during the survey households had not
yet seriously considered their options. We find that this is not the case. In particular, a large
share of households self-report already being certain of their preference rankings. Table 4 (page
16) shows that 43 percent of households report being "very certain" and 50 percent report being


                                                 77
"somewhat certain".78

            Figure A9: Households' certainty about their baseline track preference rankings




The figure presents information on the share of survey households who, at the time of the baseline survey, report being somewhat
certain or very certain of their track preference rankings. The category "Somewhat or very certain" is the sum of the categories
"Somewhat certain" and "Very certain". The lines represent local linear regressions of the listed variables on the percentile rank of a
student's transition score.


    Figure A9 (page 78) examines whether there is any point in the distribution of student achieve-
ment where a large fraction of households report being uncertain. The figure plots the shares of
households who are somewhat certain, very certain, or either somewhat or very certain against
the national percentile rank of the student's transition score.79 It indicates that households with
low-achieving students are more likely to be somewhat certain, while those with high-achieving
students are more likely to be very certain. However, over the entire transition score distribution,
more than 85 percent and as many as 98 percent of households are either somewhat or very certain.
    Second, we inspect the share of tracks that households rank and score. As noted in Section
0.4.2, households tend to assign preference ranks and quality scores to only a subset of the tracks
in their towns. Namely, households rank an average of 43 percent of tracks and score an average
of 37 percent on peer quality and 35 percent on value added on passing the baccalaureate exam
(Table 4). Table A29 (page 79) provides additional statistics on this topic. Its first column shows
that most households rank a significant share of tracks. 63 percent rank over a quarter of tracks,
and 22 percent rank over three quarters. Only 8 percent of households rank no tracks. The fourth
column displays the share of tracks that a household scores.80 It can be seen that this distribution
is more bimodal than that for the share of tracks that a household ranks, with most households
assigning scores to either a small or large share of the tracks in their towns. Specifically, 60 percent
  78. The remaining 7 percent chose either "somewhat uncertain" or "very uncertain".
  79. As noted in Section 0.4.2, we were only able to match 83 percent of students in the baseline survey with the
administrative data. For the 17 percent of students who were not matched, we cannot obtain official transition
scores. Fortunately, in the survey we asked respondents to predict their children's scores. We impute missing
transition scores using these predictions, and thus have scores for all but 152 students.
  80. We define a household as scoring a track if it assigns scores for both peer quality and value added on passing.


                                                                  78
of households score a quarter of the tracks or fewer, with 37 percent scoring no tracks. On the
other hand, 28 percent score over three quarters of the tracks.

The table describes the share of tracks that a survey household scores and/or ranks. A household is said to score a track if it assigns
scores for both value added on passing the baccalaureate exam ("pass") and peer quality ("peers"). A household is defined as ranking
a track if it includes it in its preference ranking. "Mean share of tracks scored/ranked" is the average share of tracks that a household
scores or ranks. The remaining rows display the fraction of households that score or rank none of the tracks in their towns, 1-25
percent, 26-50 percent, 51-75 percent, and more than 75 percent. Low-achieving (high-achieving) students are those with transition
scores in the bottom (top) half of the national distribution. The sample drops 152 students with missing values for both official
transition score and respondent's prediction of transition score. As a result of dropping these students, values for "Mean share of
tracks ranked / scored" differ from those in Table 4 (page 16). Households' choice sets exclude tracks that newly created in 2019.


    Figure A10 (page 80) and the remaining columns of Table A29 show how the share of tracks
ranked or scored varies with the student's transition score. They reveal that households with
low-achieving students are more likely to not assign scores to any track. However, behavior is
otherwise relatively similar across the transition score distribution.
    The third question we ask is whether households with low- and high-achieving children differ
in the selectivity of the tracks that they rank and score. The fact that the serial dictatorship is
incentive compatible means that it is weakly dominant for a household to assign a rank to each
track that it prefers to the outside option of vocational school. Moreover, the dominance is strict
if there is a non-zero chance that the student will be assigned to the track, conditional on ranking
it. In practice, however, households may find it costly to evaluate tracks. As a result, they may
consider only tracks that they believe their children are likely to attend. In this case, the relevant
choice set for a household would not be the full set of tracks in a town, but instead a subset of
them by selectivity, with the particular subset depending on the student's achievement.81
    In contrast, we find that households rank and score tracks from across the selectivity distri-
bution. Figure A11 summarizes the composition of the tracks that a household ranks and/or
scores by the tracks' prior-year minimum transition scores.82 The figure shows that households
with low-achieving students assign ranks and/or score to tracks from each within-town quintile of
selectivity at almost uniform rates. Households with high-achieving students are more likely to
rank and/or score selective tracks than non-selective ones--among this group, on average about
  81. For instance, a household with a low-achieving child may not rank and/or score highly selective tracks.
Similarly, a household with a high-achieving child may not rank and/or score non-selective tracks if it cares about
peer quality and thinks its child will be admitted to one of its top choices.
  82. We use the prior-year (2018) value of minimum transition score as the measure of selectivity because this
variable is observable by households at the time of the information sessions. Households can remember it from the
2018 allocation. In addition, it is published by the government when it announces the year's list of available tracks.
Thus, it is likely to be more closely related to a household's beliefs about track selectivity than is the current-year
(2019) version. Furthermore, the 2019 version may be influenced by our experiment.


                                                                  79
Figure A10: The share of tracks that a household ranks and/or scores by student transition score




The figure shows how the share of tracks that a survey household ranks and/or scores varies with the student's transition score.
Specifically, households are assigned to groups based on whether they ranked and/or scored none of the tracks in their towns, 1-25
percent of the tracks, 26-50 percent, 51-75 percent, or more than 75 percent. The colored areas in the figure represent the fraction of
households in each group. The dividing lines are calculated using local linear regressions of indicators for group membership on the
national percentile rank of student's transition score. See the notes to Table A29 for details on sample construction.



40 percent of the tracks that a household ranks and/or scores fall into the top quintile. However,
these households still rank and score significant fractions of non-selective tracks, with on average
about 20 percent of ranked and/or scored tracks coming from the bottom two quintiles.
    Finally, we examine a household's behavior with respect to its most-preferred tracks. We
explore whether households tend to select "reach" tracks that they do not believe will be feasible,
or whether they instead choose options that they expect their child to be eligible to attend.83 We
also assess the accuracy of households' expectations. Figure A12 provides the results. The first
panel of the figure shows results for a household's highest-ranked track, and the second panel shows
them for its two highest-ranked tracks. The figure shows that a large majority of households select
options that they expect to be feasible. Depending on the student's transition score, between 84
and 94 percent of households believe their child will be admitted to their most-preferred track and
between 93 and 97 percent think their child will be admitted to at least one of their two most-
preferred tracks. Consistent with their expectations, households with lower-performing students
choose less selective tracks than do those with higher-performing ones. However, households tend
to be overly optimistic about track feasibility. For students with transition scores in the bottom
half of the distribution, only 40 percent would have been eligible for their top-ranked track based
on the track's prior-year minimum transition score. Similarly, only 54 percent would have been
eligible for one of their top two choices. Not until about the 70th percentile of the transition score
distribution does the probability that a student is eligible catch up to households' expectations.
    The evidence presented in this subsection thus broadly supports the assumptions that house-
holds truthfully rank tracks and that the town is the appropriate unit for defining a choice set.
It also suggests that households overestimate the academic performance of their children when
determining their track preference rankings.

  83. We highlight that the latter pattern of behavior does not imply that households are deviating from truthful
revelation of preferences. Notably, it could be that households prefer tracks that are a "good fit" in terms of their
child's achievement level.


                                                                  80
       Figure A11: The selectivity of ranked and/or scored tracks by student transition score




The figure provides information on the selectivity of the tracks that survey households consider. Specifically, among either the tracks
that a household includes in its preference ranking (Panel A) or among those that the household scores on both peer quality and
value added on passing the baccalaureate exam (Panel B), the figure summarizes the shares of tracks that fall into each within-town
quintile of 2018 minimum transition score, MTSjt-1 . The dividing lines in the figure represent local linear regressions of a
household's cumulative shares against the national percentile rank of the student's transition score. The sample drops respondents
who didn't score any tracks on both peer quality and value added on passing the baccalaureate exam, as well as those who didn't
include any tracks in their preference rankings. Respondents' choice sets exclude tracks that were newly created in 2019.

  Figure A12: Summary statistics on a household's most-preferred tracks by student transition
                                            score




The figure provides information on the selectivity of households' most-preferred tracks. Panel A refers to each household's top-ranked
track, and Panel B to its two highest-ranked tracks. The green lines describe the shares of households that expect their child to be
eligible for their most-preferred track (Panel A) or for one of their two most-preferred tracks (Panel B). The blue lines describe the
shares of households whose children would have been eligible based on selectivity in 2018. A household is in this latter group if the
student's transition score is greater than or equal to a track's 2018 minimum transition score, MTSjt-1 . The purple line describes the
mean 2018 selectivity of a household's most-preferred tracks in standard deviations, MTS  jt-1 . We drop respondents who did not
score any tracks on both peer quality and value added, as well as those who did not include any tracks in their preference rankings.

A5        Testing for informational spillovers
In this section, we investigate whether the experiment suffered from informational spillovers. In
particular, it's possible that treated households shared the information on track value added with
households in the control group. If so, treatment effects would be biased toward zero.
    Our experimental set-up included factors that both decreased and increased the likelihood of
spillovers. First, we tried to limit spillovers by visiting only a fraction of middle schools in each
town. Across towns, we visited an average of 11% of middle schools and a maximum of 29%. On the
other hand, our method for distributing information potentially facilitated spillovers. We provided
treated households with informational flyers, which we allowed households to keep. Households
may have given these flyers to others in their towns.
    We test for spillovers by examining whether treatment effects differ in towns in which we visited
a smaller or larger fraction of middle schools. If there are spillovers, then, all else equal, treatment
effects should be smaller in towns where this fraction is larger. In these towns, there is more
interaction between treated and control households and more opportunity for the information to
be shared. Importantly, our test will be confounded if there are third factors that are correlated
with both the fraction of schools that we visited and the magnitude of treatment effects. We
think this is unlikely to be the case. In particular, we decided what fraction of schools to survey
based on i) the share of schools with at least 15 students and ii) logistical considerations, such
as whether the date of a school's information session was convenient for our surveyors. These
variables have no obvious relationship with the magnitude of treatment effects, except via their
effect on spillovers.
    Specifically, to conduct the test, we partition the sample based on whether a student's town
is in the bottom or top half by the share of schools surveyed. We then calculate treatment effects
on the value added of students' tracks (regression (4)) separately for these two groups.

The table presents results from regression (4) for subsets of students by whether a student's town was in the bottom ("Bottom") or
top ("Top") half by the share of middle schools surveyed. The columns for "All towns" replicate results from Section 3.1.
"Low-achieving" are students with transition scores in the bottom half of the national distribution. "Low-achieving and ineligible" are
low-achieving students who did not gain admission to either of their two top baseline choices. See the notes to Table 10 for additional
details on the regressions.


    The results are presented in Table A30. In the table, the first three columns are for the
full sample of students and the remaining columns are for sub-samples that were found to have
non-zero treatment effects in Section 3.1. The columns labeled "All towns" replicate results from
Section 3.1, while the other columns distinguish between the share of schools surveyed. The results
in the table provide no evidence of spillovers. Instead, treatment effects are shown to be similar
in magnitude for each group of towns.
