                       EMPLOYMENT, UNEMPLOYMENT AND DEMAND SHIFTS
                                 IN LOCAL LABOR MARKETS


                                          ABSTRACT


        This paper analyzes the effects of demand shifts within and between

local   labor markets    on unemployment and employment levels and changes observed

in those markets.       Between-market demand shifts are measured by the means of

sales growth for firms in each market, while within-market shifts are measured

by variances    in each.    The variances    are also decomposed into between-industry

and within-industry components.          Some firm-level   evidence    on job applicants,

training and wage and employment adjustments         in growing and declining firms is

presented   as well.

        The results show that demand shifts between markets account for large

fractions   of the observed variation in unemployment and employment rate levels

and changes across markets.          Within-area shifts cause much smaller and

insignificant   amounts    of unemployment if they are between-industry,         while

shifts within areas and industries         (accounting   for the vast majority of demand

shifts across firms) have no clear effects.          The results therefore      suggest

that the unemployment effects of demand shifts depend on adjustment costs,

which appear to be greatest for shifts between markets.               Nonlinearities in

estimated   effects and growing dispersion of unemployment rates across areas

also suggest that demand shifts may have raised aggregate unemployment in the

U.S. in recent years.

I. Introduction

          Labor economists have long been concerned with the problem of sorting

out different kinds of unemployment.        More specifically,    the need to

distinguish "frictional" or "structural" unemployment from that which arises

due to deficient aggregate demand has critical policy importance.

          One potential    source of structural problems that has recently been

considered    involves    shifts in demand across various   sectors of the economy.

In particular, Lilien (1982) found that the variance of employment growth

rates across industries contributed       to high unemployment rates in the

1970's.     He interpreted    this as evidence of a structural unemployment problem,

caused by sectoral shifts in labor demand.         In contrast,   Abraham and Katz

(1986) found that the variance of employment         growth is also correlated

negatively with job vacancy rates over time (where the latter is proxied by

the Conference Board's Help-Wanted Index).         Their finding suggests    that high

variance in employment growth reflects low aggregate demand, caused perhaps by

a greater sensitivity       of low-growth industries   to cyclical   downturns.   Recent

papers by Rogerson (1987) and Davis (1987) have helped to keep the debate

alive, and to extend it into discussions         of "real business cycles" as well.1

          Furthermore,    Leonard (1986, 1987), Evans (1987), and Dunne et. al.

(1989) have recently analyzed variations         in employment growth across firms,

both within and between industries.        Leonard (1987) raises the question of how

such variation contributes       to frictional   and/or structural unemployment.      He

calculates    some potential    effects (based on assumptions regarding     average

turnover and unemployment durations),       but no direct evidence is provided.

          In this paper I analyze the relationship between

unemployment/employmentoutcomes and sales growth variation within and between

local labor markets.        More specifically, we use sales growth measures at the
                                            2



firm level   to -calculate various measures of product and/or labor demand shifts

which are then used to explain a variety of employment outcomes in local labor

markets.

         Unlike the papers mentioned above, the focus here Is on differences              in

local   unemployment and employment -growth rate-s     at a   point In   time rather than

aggregate rates over time. The study of demand shifts between areas- thur
builds on that of Topel (1986), among others.2 Given the use of firm-Level
data within these areas, several types of shifts can be considered hsre They
includet  U shifts in demand between local labor markets; 2) shifts in demand
within   local markets but between industries; and 3) shifts wIthin locaL
markets and within    industries
         The different -types of   shIfts might have very different        implications

for employment and unemployment,      since the costs of labor market adjustment to

these shifts should differ as well.       For instance,       the -costs of worker

-migration in response to shifts between markets may be substantially            greater

than adjustment costs    to shifts   within markets.     Also,   shifts between
                                                                                           -

industries may involve greater adjustment costs than those within, if

industry-specific skills    are important    and costlier to replace than are firm-


specific ones.    Search costs scroas areas and industries may also be higher

than those within them.     The relative magnitudes of the employment and

unemployment effects for different types of shifts should thus enable us to

determine where -the costs of adjustment are greatest.3

         The sales growth data used to calculate       these shifts are from the


Employment Opportunity Pilot Project (EOPP) Survey of Firms in 1980 and

1982.    This sample of about 3400 firms represents 28 local labor market sites

at which The tOPP experiments were being run.4          Of these, thirteen sre in

SMSAts ant the rest are groups of counties.5
        The analysis below begins with data at the firm-level and then proceeds

to consider data at the level of the local labor market.           The firm-level

analysis includes a comparison of job applicant rates, training, and

employment and wage adjustments at firms with growing and declining sales.

        We then compute aggregated measures of sales and employment growth at

the site level and merge     them with published Census data on unemployment rates

and various industrial and demographic characteristics.           We use differences     in

mean   sales growth across local areas to measure shifts in labor demand between
local markets and variances to measure shifts within these markets. The
latter are also   decomposed   into between-industry    and   within-industry
components. The effects of these shift, measures on unemployment and
employment growth    levels and across areas are then estimated.
        Because   of some limitations   on the size and representativeness      of the

EOPP sites, we also perform a similar analysis using Census of Industry data

across states from 1972, 1977, and 1982.       Real sales growth measures at the

industry level and a variety of employment and unemployment data for each

state are used in this part of the analysis.

        The results of this study can be briefly summarized here.          We find that

demand shifts across local markets are negatively related to unemployment

rates and positively to employment      growth rates, thereby indicating major

employment effects of demand shifts between areas.        Though only a small part

of the total variation     in sales growth across firms, these differences      explain

fairly large fractions     of the total variation    in unemployment and employment

rates and changes across areas.      Within-area    demand shifts have small and

generally insignificant     positive effects on unemployment and negative effects

on employment if they are shifts between industries, while those within

industries   (accounting   for most of the sales growth variation)     have no clear
                                             4



effect3. The results therefore suggest that the unemployment effects of

demand shifts are high only when adjustments involve costly migration between

markets. Wage rigiditIes which are observed at declining firms and training

needs at growing ones might also contribute to these effects.         Finally,

estimated nonlinearities in employment effects and rising dispersion in

unemployment across areas also suggest that demand shifts may have raised

aggregate unemployment in the U.S. in recent years.

         The rest of the paper is outlined as follows:       Section II contains a

longer description of the data and some micro evidence on growth in sales,

employment,    and wages   (among other characteristics)   across fIrms.   Section III

presents    evidence at the local market level from the EOPP data, while Section

IV presents similar results using Census of Industry data.         Section V

concludes    the paper.



II.     Data and Micro-Level Evidence on Sales and Faployaent Grovth



         The 1982 follow-up to the EOPP Survey of Firms asked the following

questions:     "After adjusting for price changes in your product, were your unit

sales    in 1981 higher,   lower or about the same as in 1979?    Approximately what

was the percentage change?"       It is this variable that will be used to measure

sales growth across firms.

          We can also calculate employment and wage growth at the firm for these

years.     Both the 1980 and 1982 surveys also asked for the number of full-time

and part-time employees      in the firms.   In the 1980 survey this question was

asked for the current time (i.e., at the time of the survey) as well as for

July and December of 1979.       In the 1982 survey employment size was also gauged

for the current time and for July and December of 1980 and 1981.           Using the

employment figures for December of 1979 and 1981, it is therefore possible to
                                            5




calculate     employment growth rates during the same period as that used for

sales growth.       As for wage growth, firms were asked for their average

percentage increase in wages between 1979 and 1981.

          A few words   are in order regarding the interpretation of sales growth
as   a measure of labor demand shift.     Differences in sales growth across firms

presumably reflect differences in output growth, assuming that inventories

adjust relatively quickly to their equilibrium levels.         Output changes can

reflect shifts on the supply-side or demand-side of the product market, where

the former might be caused by changes in technology        and/or relative factor

prices.     Exogenous   changes in output prices, such as occurred for the oil and

petrochemical industries during the oil shocks of the 1910's, can also result
in these changes.

          All of these forces will create shifts in labor demand through the

standard "scale effects" on employment which move in the same direction as the

output change.       While changes in other factor prices can also have

 substitution effects" on labor demand, these would generally move in the

opposite direction from the output changes.         Thus we can infer the relative

importance of these effects from the sign of the correlation between sales

growth and employment or unemployment;      if sales   growth and employment growth

are positively correlated (or sales growth and unemployment are negatively

correlated),      then the "scale effects" dominate and the labor demand-shift

interpretation is correct.
          Labor   supply shifts and/or exogenous   wage changes can also result in

changes    in sales growth and unemployment,    both of which would therefore be

endogenous.       But the correlation between sales and wage growth must be

negative in order for exogenous labor supply shifts or wage changes (i.e.,

those which do not occur in response      to demand shifts)   to   be the cause of the

observed results.       In fact, the positive correlations observed below between
                                            6



sales, wage, and employment growth across firms (as well as positive

correlations of sales growth with vacancies)        confirm   that sales growth does,

in fact,    reflect exogenous   shifts in labor demand.

         In Table I we present some evidence on sales growth at the firm

level.     In addition to the mean and standard deviation of this measure we

present the fractions of the total variation of the log of (l+% sales growth)

that are explained by various groups of industry and/or site dummies.           These

fractions represent the "between-industry" and "between-area" components of
that variation. The fractions are measured by the It2 and adjusted It2 measures
for   regression equations containing the site and industry variables.        The F-

statistics for those sets of dummies are also presented to test for the joint

significance of the between-industryand between—area effects.

         The results of Table I contain two basic findings.        On the one hand,

the F-statistics tell us that the industry and area differences          in sales

growth are significant.       All of the sets of dummies are significant at the .05

level except for the interaction      effects after site and industry are already

included    (   the critical value here   is about 1.1).   The marginal F-values show

us that industry differences      are significant within areas and area effects are

significant within industries.       Thus neither set of different effects fully

account for the other.

         On the other hand,     the between-area and industry effects    (including

interactions)     together explain only very small fractions of the total

variation in sales growth across firms.         This implies that the vast majority

of sales growth variation is within-area and within-industry. This may partly

reflect some measurement-error in the sales growth measure or random "noise"

in the data.      But these results are consistent with those of Leonard (1987)

and Dunne et. al. (1989) who find that most of the variation of employment

growth at the firm-level is within-area and industry.

          Before we move on to consider the effects of these different types of

output shifts on local unemployment rates, it seems worthwhile to consider a

bit more evidence on fin-level responses          to these   shifts.   In Table 2 we

consider several characteristics of firms with either growing or declining

sales:     namely,   their wage and employment growth as well as applicant rates

and training    levels for new positions.       These results should help to shed

light on the characteristics       and responses of firms facing positive and

negative demand shifts.

          For instance, comparisons    of employment growth across       the two sectors

(and especially their respective responses         to unit changes     in sales growth)

show us whether employment growth at growing firms is more sluggish than

decreases    at declining firms.    This, in fact, would be the case if adjustment

costs are serious problems      (see Footnote 3).     Wage growth comparisons     show us

the extent to which downward wage rigidity at declining           firms may further


impede the adjustment process by raising the magnitudes of employment declines

and perhaps by encouraging     queuing for the more limited number of jobs in that

sector.     In fact, we can use applicant levels for new positions as a proxy for

worker queues facing each type of firm.          Furthermore,   the amounts of training


provided to newly hired workers provide a rough measure of necessary skill

attainments which might impede adjustment as well if they are higher in the

growing sectors.

          We present two types of data in Table 2.       The first includes means for

each of these variables for firms with growing and with declining             sales (zero


growth firms are included in the latter).          The second includes coefficients

from regressions in which wage and employment growth appear as dependent

variables and sales growth appears as the independent variable.              These

equations measure the responsivenessof wages and employment in firms facing

positive and negative demand shifts.
                                                   B




         As noted above, the employment and wage growth variables reflect the

1979—81 period      (    as does sales growth) and are measured as the log of (1+ the

growth rate).       Training is measured by the hours of formal and informal

training    provided      to the most recently hired employee of the firm, while

applicant queues are measured as applicants                for the job of the last person

hired.

         The means of Part A in Table 2 suggest several interesting              features of

growing and declining firms.              Employment and wage growth are significantly

higher for firms with growing sales than for those with declining sales,

though the difference in wage growth over two years in only about two

percent.6     Hours of formal and informal training are both higher for growing

firms, though only the informal             training difference is significant.     These

differences    suggest greater training or skill requirements (and perhaps more

inelastic supplies of labor) for growing firms in the short-run.7                 But as for

applicants we find no significant differences in worker queues per available

job between sectors.

         Furthermore,       the regression     results of Part B show fairly comparable

enployment responses         to unit differences       in sales growth within each sector.

In other words, we see no tendency for employment growth to be more sluggish

in growing firms overall.              This suggests that, if employment adjustment

problems do exist, they         cnay    be limited to shifts across specific    types or

groups of firms (e.g., those across areas) and are not a more general

phenomenon.     Finally,      the wage growth regressions show significant

responsiveness to sales growth variation               in the growing firms but not the

declining   ones,       thus providing     some evidence    of wage rigidity within the group

of firms facing declining          sales.8

         Overall,       then, the firm—level     data suggest    the presence of significant

demand shifts between areas and industries,                though most demand shifts are

within both.     While at least some evidence     of wage rigidity appears   in firms

with declining sales as well as higher amounts of training for those with

growing sales, we find employment responsiveness         across firms within the


growing sales sector to be significant and generally comparable to that in the

declining sales sector.      The implications of these varied demand shifts and

firm responses    for employment and unemployment rates in local labor markets

need now to be considered.




III.    Sales Growth and Uneaploy.ent/EsployaentEffects at the Site Level




          In this section of the paper we analyze the relationship between sales

growth,    unemployment and employment growth at the local labor market level.

Firm-level data on sales and employment growth are aggregated to the site

level, of which there are 28 in the EOPP data.         These data are then merged

with Census data on unemployment rates and other labor market characteristics

for the same areas.

          In aggregating   sales growth measures to the site-level, we have sample-

weighted and firm size-weighted these measures.         Sample-weightingis used to

counteract the oversampling in the EOPP survey of large, low-wage firms within

each site.     Sampling weights     thus create a random sample of firms within each

site.     Size-weighting is then used to generate measures which accurately

reflect the labor force in each local market.

          In analyzing   these data we will consider both the means and variances

of growth rates for each market.        Differences   in means of sales growth can be

interpreted as    between-market     shifts in demand while variances are interpreted
as within-market shifts.      The    latter is consistent with the interpretation
given   by Lilien and Abraham and Katz to variances      in employment growth across
                                                         10



industries,         though here the variances are within the local market.                       In

contrast,         the means measure differences                   in the total level of demand growth

which the local market faces.

          In addition,         the variance measures are then decomposed into between-

industry and within-industry shifts across firms in each local area.                                This is

accomplished by using separate firm-level regressions                              of log sales growth at

each site on a set of I-digit industry dummies.                               Since the adjusted R2 for

each equation gives us the fraction of the total variation in sales growth

that    is explained      by differences between industries, we use the following

formula:




(I)                   =
                          a23 + ai              =             +   (1
                                                                       -if)   4
where             is the total (weighted)               variance in the log of sales growth in the

ith   local   market and                  and           are the between industry and within-

industry components            respectively.9

          In Table 3A we turn to estimates of the effects of sales growth on

unemployment rates and in Table 33 we have estimates of their effects on

employment growth across local markets.                           We have estimated the following

equations:

          Employment growth rates are firm—size and sample-weighted means

calculated from the 1982 EOPP Survey. (where employment growth is again

measured from December 1979 to December 1981).               The unemployment rates are

published rates based on the 1980 census.               Clearly, we would            prefer that the

dependent    variables   in both equations         be measured as changes rather than

levels.     But we focus on unemployment rate levels in 1980 since they are not

available for non-SMSA sites in 1979 or 1981.               This focus         is,   however,

consistent with that of Lilien and of Abraham and Katz, who estimated

unemployment rate equations;       and also with the standard "Okun's Law" estimates

of output growth effects on unemployment rates.              When analyzing census of

Industry data below, we will consider sales growth effects on both levels and

changes of unemployment rates.

          All equations are estimated using Weighted Least Squares, where the

weights are (labor force size)       1/2   •b0     Both dependent and independent variables

appear in log form.11       In some specifications,         we use each component of

       separately,   due to their high coorelations           (r =    .66).
          The control variables     include the following:           1)    the log of the


unemployment rate for 1970 (U70), which should capture a long-run equilibrium

component of local unemployment;           2)    a variety of demographic and financial

variables,    which include:      a) the ratio of average weekly Unemployment

Insurance    benefits to weekly wages in the state b) the fraction of the
population aged    25 and over with college degrees; c) the log of the median age

of   the labor force; and    d)   the fraction female in the labor force;                 3)    the
average    wage premium of firms in the local market; and                 4)   the fractions      of


employed individuals who work in the manufacturing and service sectors.

          The UI, average wage and demographic variables are designed to control

for determinants     of "equilibrium"       unemployment across areas (e.g., Hall

(1970)), while industry employment might capture both cyclical and equilibrium
                                              12




components (through differences In wages, turnover, etc. as well as the

different cycliral sensitivities         of these industries).

       The 1970 unemployment rstes and the educational,             labor force and

industrial distributions     are published Census data, while the statewide ratios

appear in Department of Labor publications.            The wage premium is calculated

from the EOPP Survey of Firms in 1980, and represents a welghted mean of

residuals    from a log wage equation on various human capital characteristics              in

each site. 12

       The results of Table 3A show that mean growth rates In sales have

significantly negative effects on unemployment rate levels.                Estimates   of

elasticities are approximately 3.0-3.5.            Comparisons with roughly similar

estimates    computed at the aggregate level suggest that these are reasonable

estimatesj3       For the total sample, a standard deviation change in sales

growth generates a change in log unemployment rate levels of about three

quarters    of a standard deviation. 14 In fact, the estimated R2 for these
equations suggest that     mean   sales growth explains about       60%   of the total
variation in     unemployment rates across all sites.        Adding a variety of control

variables    reduces   the mean sales growth effect by only a small amount.

       As for variance of sales growth, we find positive but insignificant

effects of the between-industrycomponent on unemployment rates.                 A ona-

standard-deviation rise in between-industry           variance raises unemployment rates

by less than 10% of a standard deviation.            In contrast,   the within-industry

component of variance appears       to   have negative but insignificant       effects on

unemp Idyment.

       The employment growth equations of Table 33 show results that are

consistent with those of Table 3A.         Mean sales growth effects on employment

growth are positive and generally significant, with elasticities in the region

of .8-1.0.      Both between- and within-industry components         of variance generally
                                                13




reduce employment growth, but once again these effects are not significant                       and

are sensitive     to the Inclusion    of control variables.         The explanatory power of

these equations      are lower than those of the unemployment equations,              due

perhaps     to greater measurement error in the employment growth variable (based

on EOPP rather than Census data).

          It thus appears as though the small fraction of demand shifts across

firms which occurs between      local labor markets       generally    has large employment

and unemployment effects while        shifts within local markets create much less.

There is some evidence of structural-type            unemployment and employment problems

caused by shifts that occur between industries and within areas,                   though the

estimated     effects are generally    Insignificant    and relatively     small in

magnitude.

          These results therefore confirm our earlier conjectures about                  tite


relative costs of labor market adjustment in response to different                  types of

demand shift. Adjustments to shifts between local markets appears to be
costlier than adjustments within markets. Those costs and responses manifest
themselves    in unemployment rate differences across areas which may persist for

several    yearsJ5
          A number of important points must be mentioned            regarding   these

findings.     For one thing, it is possible that the sales growth effects on

employment and unemployment primarily reflect the different sensitivities                       of

local areas to the business     cycle of 1981-2 (which should be partly captured

by sales growth in 1979-81).         However,   it is unlikely that the cycle explains

the entire effect.      Unemployment rates for 1980 are not heavily influenced by

the cycle,16 and industry     control variables       do not greatly reduce the

magnitudes of estimated effects.

          Another possible problem with these results         is    the potential

endogenelty    of the sales growth measure with respect            to employment    or
                                              IA




unemployment.     Exogenous   population or labor force changes could directly

affect employment or unemployment and thereby lead to sales growth changes.

        But the negative effect of sales growth on unemployment makes              this


interpretation unlikely, since exogenous population or labor force changes

which raise sales growth should also raise unemployment rates.             The positive

correlations between sales growth, vacancy rates and wage growth (as well as

employment growth) at the site level all suggest that sales growth differences

reflect exogenous    shifts in labor demandj7

        We also note that the functional forms of these estimated            relationships

are important    determinants of aggregate changes in employment and unemployment

caused by demand shifts,        If employment changes in growing areas are smaller

than those in declining       areas,    this would be reflected   in a quadratic   (or

other convex) functionj8         Such a function would indicate that rising

dispersion    in sales growth (which could be caused by shifts from declining             to


growing areas) would result in lower aggregate employment or higher

unemploymentj9      It would also suggest that employment adjustment problems for

growing areas may be greater than they are for growing firms (since there was

no evidence of employment adjustment problems in          the sample of all growing

firms   in the previous   section).

        The results of estimated equations containing quadratic            terms in sales

growth show the correct signs on coefficients for these terms, though they are

generally    not significant.2°        More evidence on these functional    forms is


provided below.

        Finally, we note that labor demand shifts across areas should only

cause employment     growth and unemployment rate changes in the short-run.

Eventually,     wage and price adjustments      as well as migration should re-

equilibrate     these markets (Topel, 1986).       In fact, the positive correlation

between sales growth, employment growth and wage growth described above
                                            15




confirms this.   There is also some evidence of migration towards growing areas

and away from declining ones.21     However,     these adjustments    do not appear to

occur quickly enough to eliminate     the effects of sales growth on employment

and unemployment in the short-run.



IV.   Cemsus of Industry Results



       The EOPP Survey has the advantage of providing micro-level            firm data


from which we could calculate    within and between industry variances in real

sales growth and analyze    their effects    on unemployment and employment growth.

       But the small number and non-random nature of the EOPP sites raise some

                                   Potential     births and deaths of firms within
questions about these results.

the sample are also a problem.     We therefore     turn to the U.S. Census of


Industry for additional evidence.
        For each state, we have calculated employment-weighted           means and


variances (between-industries)     of real sales growth for 1972-77 and for 1977-

82.   The industries included are those for which Census data are available-

                     durable and nondurable manufacturing, construction,             mining,
i.e., agriculture,

wholesale and retail trade, services, and government.         Nominal sales in each

year were measured by the value of shipments (mining and manufacturing),

                           and services),   sales (agriculture,      wholesale   and retail
receipts   (construction

                                                       These nominal values are
trades), and direct expenditures (government).

deflated by CNP industry deflators,     though similar results have also been

obtained using a combination of PPI and other GNP deflators.22

        The means and variances of l+the real sales growth rate (or the ratios

of values for 1982 to 1977 and 1977 to 1972) are used as independent

variables. Dependent variables      include unemployment rates and employment-to-

                                                                  in

unemployment rates and employment rates for 1972-77 and 1977_82.23               The two


sample periods enable us to check for whether or not cyclical effects dominate

the results     for the early 1980 s.24 All equations       are weighted by (state


emp loymen t)1"2.

         The results for these estimated equations appear in Table          4.   Two

functional     forms are presented:     logarithmic   and quadratic.    The logs of the

levels and the ratios (i.e., levels and differences            of logs) are thus

compatable to the measures used with the EOPP data above.              But the quadratic

case here, variances        are omitted from the equations     due to their high

correlations with the means.25

         Unemployment rates for 1970 are used as the base year for changes in

the earlier period,       since published   annual averages by state are not available

before 1975.        The employment rates are based on household rather than

establishment data, since the latter omit agricultural employment (that may be

empirically     important in various states).     We also focus on employment-to-.

population ratios rather than overall employment,            since sales (or output)

growth is more likely endogenous with respect          to   population growth than to

growth in employment out of the population.           However,   most results discussed

below hold for both measures.

         A number of results appear in Table 4 which are quite comparable              to

those presented       above for the EOPP data.    For one thing, mean sales growth has

large and significant        negative effects on unemployment and positive ones on

employment.         This is true for both levels and changes.      Judging by R2, we

generally find that sales growth has greater explanatory power for changes

than for levels.         In fact, about 40% of the variation in unemployment changes

and over 50% of that for employment changes are explained              by these equations

for   the 1977-82 period.
                                           17




        The effects for this period are obviously much larger than those for

1972—77.   At least partly (though perhaps not exclusively)         this must reflect

the business cycle in the later period.         The very comparable   results between

unemployment rate equations      for 1980 and 1982 also suggest     that the business

cycle   does not account   for the entire difference between      the two periods.

Explanatory power for either of these equations is a bit lower than for

comparable equations using the EOPP data.

        The effects of between—industry     variances   in sales growth are generally

positive for unemployment and negative for employment, as would be expected

from a model in which such shifts are costly.         However,   these effects are not

significant   in any equation.

        The quadratic   terms in the second set of equations       show positive

coefficients for unemployment and negative ones for employment.           Most are

significant   by conventional standards,    though this is less true for ratios in

the earlier period.     Comparable results are also obtained from segmented

linear equations, estimated for positive and negative sales growth in the

later period.26    As noted above, these effects imply      that greater dispersion

across areas in sales growth will produce not only greater dispersion          in but

also higher (lower) aggregate unemployment (employment).           In fact, dispersion

in sales growth was higher for the 1977-82 period than for the 1972-77, and

dispersion in unemployment rates grew consistently between 1970 and 1982.27

These results therefore suggest that demand shifts across areas may have

helped raise aggregate unemployment rates in the U.S. in the 1980's.

        A few other points should be mentioned here as well.          For one thing, we

have estimated equations comparable      to those of Summers     (1986) and Murphy and

Topel (1987) in which sales growth is considered separately for high-wage             and

low-wage industries as well as for manufacturing and non-manufacturing.              While

results are sometimes      stronger for the high-wage and manufacturing cases, the
                                                    18




others are generally significant as well.28                   A variety of other estimates,

using the different sets of price indices and both with and without the

government sector, produced comparable results to those of Table 4.                     Finally,

equations    containing lagged and lead terms suggest that the endogeneity of

sales growth with respect to the employment or unemployment rates used here

may not be too severe.29           Consequently,         the results presented   using Census of

Industry data largely confirm our findings obtained from the EOPP data and

described above.



V.   Conclusion



          In this paper I analyze the relationship between unemployment rates and

demand shifts in local labor markets.                Three    types of demand shifts are

distinguished here:         1)   Those between local labor markets;         2)   those within

local markets     but between industries;           and 3) those within local markets and

within industries.        The first of these is measured by differences               in mean

sales growth of firms in various            local    labor markets while the second and

third are measured by components            of the variances across firms in each

market.     Some firm-level evidence on job applicants,               training, and wage and

employment adjustments in growing and declining firms                  is presented   as well.

          The estimated     results show that demand shifts between local markets,

which account for only a very small fraction of sales growth variation across

firms, have very substantial          impacts on observed unemployment and employment

growth rates.      Shifts within local markets appear to have much smaller effects

on unemployment,     with only those between industries showing some small but

generally     insignificant      positive   effects.       The estimated unemployment effects

continue    to hold after controlling         for a variety of factors which should

reflect     "equilibrium"    or cyclical differences           in unemployment rates.    The
                                             19




results    thus suggest that the unemployment effects of demand shifts are high

only when adjustments      involve costly migration between markets.       The observed

wage rigidities at declining firms and training needs in growing ones may also

contribute to these results in some cases.

          Finally, estimated nonlinearities in the effects of sales growth on

employment across local areas and evidence of rising dispersion in local

unemployment rates suggest that aggregate unemployment have risen as a result

of demand shifts in the late 1970's and 1980's.          This   last finding suggests

that greater discussion of policies which lower adjustment costs or

uncertain-ties for workers     (e.g., government subsidies      for worker relocation,

greater provision of information      on job vacancies in local markets, etc.) is

warranted    at this   time.

          1The literature which stresses sectoral shocks as potential

explanations for observed aggregate movements in output and employment dates

back to Lucas and Prescott (1974).          More recent examples include Long and

Plosser (t983).

          2While several authors have analyzed the response of local unemployment

rates   to aggregate   demand shifts (e.g., Browne (1978), Murphy and Hofler

(1985), Rones (1986)), there have been no studies which provide           direct

evidences    on shifts between and within local areas for the U.S.         Altonji and

Ham (1986) do, however, consider      the    role of aggregate,   industry and   p..

           3These   issues could easily be analyzed within the simple labor supply

and demand shift model of Freeman (1977), in which the adjustment costs would

model, wage rigidities andfor queuing for jobs

would further limit employment adjustments.              Topel (1986) presents a model       of
demand shocks and migration which allows for expectations,               migration costs,

and different age cohorts and time periods across labor markets.

           4While about 5200 firms were part of the original sample in 1980, only

about two-thirds were interviewed again in 1982.

            9The use of adjusted rather than actual R2 here reflects the problem                of-


 small     sample sizes in certain sites.          Sample sizes range from about 60 to 300

 across sites.         The adjusted R2 "corrects" for these sample size differences,

 since a fixed number of independent variables will otherwise have relatively

reported in certain cases.

            10weighting by labor force size assumes that errors are directly

proportional to such size.            The weighting should therefore      limit problems of


heteroscedasticity caused by markets of different size.

            -1The employement growth variables          are thus measured as differences       in

logs of employment.            The variances are actually measured as log         (1   +      and


log     U   + u),       since some of the          were based on negative adjusted R2 and

wer     therefore     negative    themselves.    The logarithmic function along with this

adjustment did not qualitatively             change any results.

                    variables    except for the Ut measures were calculated from county-

level data in the City and Country Data Book (1983).                 The Ut data appear in

the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Handbook No. 394 (1983).

            13Estimates    of "Okun's Law" relate percentage        point changes in

unemployment to percent changes in the ratio of actual to potential CNP.

Recent      estimates    (e.g., Gordon (1982)) of this relationship are in the .4-.5

range.       These suggest elasticities of unemployment with respect to output of

about 5-7.

                standard deviation      change in the log of sales growth is weighted in

the same manner as the regressions              is .18 while that for the log of

unemployment is         .83.


            15Adjustment speeds      to regional    demand shifts and unemployment are

considered in Marston (1985) and Tiller and Bednarzik                (1985).   Marston uses a

recursive      error components model and calculates very rapid adjustments                (i.e.,

within one year).          Tiller and Bednarzik,        using spectral methods,    find much

lengthier adjustment periods.

            16Aggregate    unemployment for 1980 averaged approximately 7% for the

year.

            17The correlation      between   sales growth and vacancy rates       (both in log

          18The issue of non-linear functions in a cross-section          is related to

that of partial adjustments      in time-series employment change equations             (e.g.,

Nickell (1986)).      However,   the partial adjustment models assume that


adjustment in either direction is costly, while the quadratics imply an

asymmetry between costs for growing and declining firms.

          19Evidence of rising dispersion in state—wide unemployment rates

appears in Abraham (1987).       She uses estimates      of quadratic Beveridge Curves

(i.e., unemployment-vacancyrelationship)          to   argue that shifts across areas

helped raise aggregate unemployment in the 1970s and 1980's.               On the other

hand,   the evidence of rising dispersion in uenmployment is disputed in Murphy

(1985).     Finding   such a quadratic   effect of sales growth on employment or

unemployment would also be equivalent to finding a positive effect of the

variance of sales growth across local markets on aggregate unemployment rates

in time-series      data (if it were available for sales growth).

          20The coefficient and standard errors on the quadratic sales growth

term in the unemployment equation are .523 and           .597   respectively.     For

employment growth equations       the comparable numbers are -4.79 and 5.77.

          21Labor   force growth between 1970 and 1980 was positively           related   to

sales   growth, while median age of the labor force was negatively              related (both

effects    significant).    Assuming younger workers migrate more frequently than

older ones, both findings suggest migration to growing areas.

          221n these alternative estimates, PPI deflators are used for

manufacturing and mining while GNP deflators           for the farm and government

sectors,    goods, and services are used elsewhere.         Estimated   results using      the

alternative measures were very similar.          Of course, both sets of deflators

abstract from industry-specific      variation in inflation across areas.

         23The relevant annual averages for states are published          in various

issues of Employment and Earnings and in the State and Metropolitan Area Data

Books.

         24The mid-1970's recession is not as much of a problem for the earlier

period as is the 1981—2 recession for the later period, since the economy had

significantly    recovered by 1977.     Aggregate unemployment rates were 5.5% in

1972, 6.9% in 1977, and 9.5% in 1982.

         25The correlation between means and variances (in logs) across states

is .61 for 1977—82 and .70 for 1972-77.

         26Sales growth was positive for all areas during the 1972—77 period.

         27The standard deviation of sales growth across states (weighted          by

employment 1977) was .072 for 1972—77 and .100 for 1977-82.            Standard

deviations    in unemployment rates across rates were .011, .015, and .022 for

1970,    1977, and 1982 respectively.

         28Sales growth in high-wage     industries   generally   had larger effects     on


unemployment rates and changes in both periods, but for employment-to-

population ratios the evidence is more mixed.         Effects     of manufacturing one

generally lower than those for non-manufacturing,         though those clearly may

reflect differences    in sector size.     The correlations between sales growth In

manufacturing and non-manufacturingare .574 for the early period and .808 for

the later one,

          29Unemployment   equations   for 1970 and 1977 which contained     lead sales

growth measures for 1972—77 and 1977—82 respectively generally produced

incorrect signs on estimated coefficients.        In contrast, equations      containing

lagged sales growth measures (e.g., 1972-77        sales growth in equations      for 1982


unemployment rates) generally had correct signs, though with substantially

smaller coefficients       than on the more contemporaneous     sales growth measures.
