Commodity Price Forecasts, Futures Prices and Pricing Models

JEL No. G13,G17

                                           ABSTRACT

Even though commodity pricing models have been successful in fitting the term structure of
futures prices and its dynamics, they do not generate accurate true distributions of spot prices.
This paper develops a new approach to calibrate these models using not only observations of oil
futures prices, but also analysts’ forecasts of oil spot prices.

We conclude that to obtain reasonable expected spot curves, analysts’ forecasts should be used,
either alone, or jointly with futures data. The use of both futures and forecasts, instead of using
only forecasts, generates expected spot curves that do not differ considerably in the short/medium
term, but long term estimations are significantly different. The inclusion of analysts’ forecasts, in
addition to futures, instead of only futures prices, does not alter significantly the short/medium
part of the futures curve, but does have a significant effect on long-term futures estimations.

1.      Introduction
Over the last decades, commodity pricing models have been very successful in fitting the term
structure of futures prices and its dynamics. These models make a wide variety of assumptions about
the number of underlying risk factors, and the drift and volatility of these factors. [Gibson, R. &
Schwartz, E.S. (1990); Schwartz, E.S. (1997); Schwartz, E.S. & Smith, J. (2000); Cortazar, G. &
Schwartz, E.S. (2003); Cortazar, G. & Naranjo, L. (2006); Casassus, J. & Collin-Dufresne, P. (2005);
Cortazar, G., & Eterovic, F. (2010); Heston, S. L. (1993); Duffie, D., J. Pan, & K. Singleton (2000);
Trolle, A. B. & Schwartz, E. S. (2009); Chiang, I., Ethan, H., Hughen, W. K., & Sagi, J. S. (2015).]

The performance of commodity pricing models is commonly assessed by how well these models fit
derivative prices. It is well known that derivative prices are obtained from the risk neutral or risk
adjusted probability distribution (e.g. futures prices are the expected spot prices under the risk neutral
probability distribution). These models also provide the true or physical distribution of spot prices,
but this has not been stressed in the literature because they have mainly been used to price derivatives.
However, as Cortazar, Kovacevic & Schwartz, (2015) point out, the latter is also valuable and is used
by practitioners for risk management, NPV valuations, and other purposes.

Despite the diversity of commodity pricing models found in the literature, they all share the
characteristic of relying only on market prices (e.g. futures and options) to calibrate all parameters.
In these models the risk premium parameters are measured with large errors and typically are not
statistically significant, making estimations of expected prices (which differ from futures prices on
the risk premiums) inaccurate.

To solve this problem Cortazar et al. (2015) propose using an Asset Pricing Model (e.g. CAPM) to
estimate the expected returns on futures contracts from which the risk premium parameters can be
obtained, which results in more accurate expected prices. However, these prices depend on the
particular Asset Pricing Model chosen.

This paper develops an alternative way to estimate risk-adjusted and true distributions that does not
rely on any particular asset pricing model. The idea is to use forecasts of future spot prices provided
by analysts and institutions who periodically forecast these prices, such as those available from
Bloomberg and other sources. Thus, by calibrating the commodity pricing model with both futures
prices and analysts’ forecasts, two different data sets are jointly used to calibrate the model.

Analysts’ forecasts have been previously used in finance, but mostly for corporate earnings. For
example, O’Brien (1987) studies forecasts of earnings per share as predictors of earnings in the U.S.
stock market. O’Brien (1990) measures the predictive power of individual analysts comparing their

                                                                                                        3
estimations with realized earnings in nine industries. Hail and Leuz (2006) use stock earnings
forecasts to calculate the implied cost of capital of companies. Zhang (2006) uses stock target price
forecasts dispersion to measure information uncertainty. Bonini et al. (2010) and Bradshaw et al.
(2012) study the predictive content of target price forecasts in the stock market, under different
measures of accuracy.

Analysts’ forecasts have also been used in other areas and markets. For example, Pesaran and Weale
(2006) use survey information on short-term forecasts of macroeconomic variables to develop an
analysis on how respondents shape their expectations on inflation, consumer sentiment or consumer
spending. Bachetta et al. (2009) measure the predictability of returns in stock, foreign exchange, bond
and money markets in different countries using surveys.

The use of analysts’ forecasts in commodity markets, which is of interest in this paper, has been
scarce and, in general, neglected. However, Bloomberg’s Commodity Price Forecasts have been
subject to some analysis (Atalla et al. (2016), Haugom et al. (2016)). Berber and Piana (2016) state
that this data set is useful because price forecasts are a direct approximation to the market’s
expectations since they are made by individual analysts that are experts in each specific commodity
market. They use these price forecasts to test their predictive power for realized returns in the crude
oil and copper markets.

Another valuable source of commodity forecasts is the EIA (U.S. Energy Information
Administration). Baumeister and Kilian (2015) use these data to test the predictive power of short-
term oil price forecasts by comparing them with a model that uses a combination of forecasts to
estimate future spot prices. A similar study is made by Wong-Parodi et al. (2006), assessing if the
short-term forecasts from EIA are good predictors of spot prices, in comparison to traded futures
prices. Furthermore, Haugom et al. (2016) focus on forecasting long-term oil prices, and use the EIA
forecasts as a reference for their own estimations provided by a model that is built on the fundamental
relationships between demand and supply. Auffhammer (2007) analyzes the rationality of EIA short-
term forecasts. Bolinger et al. (2006), using only EIA reports from 2000 to 2003 natural gas contracts,
estimate empirical risk premiums.

Other analysis on forecasting of commodity prices include Pierdzioch et al. (2010) and (2013b) on
oil price forecasts published by the European Central Bank, Pierdzioch et al. (2013a) extending the
anti-herding evidence to nine metals, Singleton (2014) on the disagreement among forecasters and
the level of WTI oil price, and Atalla et al. (2016) on the fact that analysts’ disagreement on oil price
forecasts reflects realized oil price volatility.



                                                                                                       4
In this paper, by proposing to use both market data (futures prices) and analysts’ forecasts (expected
prices) to calibrate a commodity pricing model, several related objectives are pursued. The first one
is to formulate a joint-estimation model that considers both sets of data and show how to estimate it
using the Kalman Filter.

Acknowledging that analysts’ price forecasts are very volatile, both because at any point in time there
is great disagreement between them, and also because their opinions change greatly over time, our
second objective is to build an analysts’ consensus curve that optimally aggregates and updates all
their opinions.

Our third objective is to improve estimations for long-term futures prices. This is motivated by current
practice which consists in calibrating commodity pricing models using futures with maturities only
up to a few years and then is silent about whether the model will behave well for longer maturities.
However, there is evidence that extrapolating a model calibrated only with short/medium term prices
to estimate long term ones is unreliable [Cortazar, G, Milla, C. & Severino, F. (2008)]. In this paper,
long term futures price estimations will be obtained by using also information from analysts’
forecasts.

Finally, the fourth objective is to estimate the term structure of the commodity risk premiums. This
can be done by comparing the term structure of expected spot and futures prices.

The paper is organized as follows. To motivate the proposed approach, Section 2 provides empirical
illustrations of some of the weaknesses of current approaches. Section 3 describes the model and
parameter estimation technique used, while Section 4 describes the data set. The main results of the
paper are presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.



2.        The Issues
In what follows some of the issues that will be addressed in this paper are described. The first issue,
already pointed out in Cortazar et al. (2015), is that expected prices under the true distribution are
unreliable when calibrating a commodity pricing model using only futures contract prices. As an
illustration, Figure 1 shows the futures and expected oil prices for 02-05-2014 using the Cortazar and
Naranjo (2006) two-factor model1. It can be seen that while the 4.5 year maturity futures price is 77.9
US$/bbl., the model’s expected price, for the same maturity, is 365.8 US$/bbl. To justify that this


1   As shown in Cortazar and Naranjo (2006) this two‐factor specification is equivalent to the Schwartz
and Smith (2000) model, but may easily be extended to N‐factors.

                                                                                                          5
expected price is unreasonable, the Bloomberg’s Analysts´ Median Composite Forecast for 2018,
which amounts to only 96.5 US$/bbl., is also plotted.

Figure 2 shows the model expected spot prices, futures prices and analysts’ forecasts for a contract
maturing around 07-01-2018 during the year 2014. It can be seen that the model expected spot prices
are for the whole year around three times higher than the futures prices and analysts’ forecasts.

Given that we will make use of a diverse set of analysts’ forecasts, a second issue is how to optimally
generate and update an analysts’ consensus curve, as new information arrives. Figure 2 illustrates
how the mean price forecasts for 2018 changes every week as new analysts provide their forecasts
during 2014. It also shows that these forecasts are close to the corresponding futures prices, but the
expected prices from the two-factor commodity model, when estimated using only futures, are much
higher. Some efforts to provide an analysts’ consensus curve have already been made (the Bloomberg
Median Composite, also plotted in Figure 2), but in general they are computed using only simple
moving averages of previous forecasts.

07-01-2018 maturity. The model is calibrated using weekly futures prices (01/2014 to 12/2014).



Another and related issue is how to obtain credible estimations of commodity risk premiums. When
expected spot prices are unreliable, risk premiums are also unreliable.

The final issue that will be addressed is how to obtain long-term futures price estimations that exceed
the longest maturity contract traded in the market, using the information contained in long term
analysts´ forecasts. Cortazar et al. (2008) already showed that extrapolations are unreliable: even if
commodity pricing models fit well existing data, contracts with longer maturities are estimated with
large errors.

To illustrate the point discussed above, a two factor model is calibrated using three alternative data
panels of oil futures: all futures including maturities up to 9 years (100%), futures only up to 4.5 years
(50%), and futures only up to 2.25 years (25%). For each data panel pricing errors for the longest
observed futures price are computed. Table 1 shows that the longer the extrapolation, the higher the
errors2 .

3.      The Model

3.1.    The N-Factor Gaussian Model

The Cortazar and Naranjo (2006) N-factor model is chosen to illustrate the benefits of using analysts’
forecasts, in addition to futures prices. This model nests several well-known commodity pricing
models (e.g. Brennan and Schwartz (1985), Gibson and Schwartz (1990), Schwartz (1997), Schwartz
and Smith (2000), Cortazar and Schwartz (2003)) and lends itself easily to be specified with any
number of risk factors.

Following Cortazar and Naranjo (2006), the stochastic process of the (log) spot price ( ) of a
commodity is:

                                                   log                                                      (1)

where    is the (1        ) vector of state variables and      is the log-term price growth rate, assumed
constant. The vector of state variables follows the stochastic process:

                                                                                                            (2)

where    and      are (         ) diagonal matrices containing positive constants (with the first element of
 ,      0 , and           is a set of correlated Brownian motions such that                                 , with
each element of      being         ∈    1,1 . The risk adjusted process followed by the state variables is:

                                                                                                            (3)

where   is a (1      ) vector containing the risk premium parameters corresponding to each risk factor,
all assumed to be constants.

                                                                                                                  8
Under the N-Factor model, the futures price at time , of a contract maturing at , can be obtained by
computing the conditional expected value of the spot price, under the risk-adjusted measure:

                                                      , ,                         ,                              (4)

As shown in Cortazar and Naranjo (2006), this boils down to:

                                            , ,           exp           ,                    ,                   (5)

where,

Note that the only differences between the futures and expected spot dynamics are the risk premium

In this paper analysts’ forecasts are assumed to be noisy proxies for expected future spot prices.

3.2.    Parameter Estimation

A Kalman filter that incorporates futures prices and analysts’ forecasts into the process of estimating
all parameters is applied. The Kalman Filter has been successfully used with incomplete data panels
in commodities (Cortazar and Naranjo (2006)) and bond yields (Cortazar et al. (2007)), among others.
Let’s define      as the time-variable number of observations available at time .

The application of the Kalman Filter requires two equations to be defined:

o       The transition equation, which describes the true evolution of the                 1 vector of state
variables (      over each time step (∆ ):


                                                                                                     (13)
                                                      ~             ,

where     is a        matrix,     is a     1 vector and       is an     1 vector of disturbances with mean 0
and covariance matrix       .

o       The measurement equation, which relates the state variables to the log of observed futures
prices and analysts’ forecasts:


                                                                                                     (14)
                                                      ~             ,



where    is a        1 vector,     is a        matrix,        is a      1 vector and    is a     1 vector of
disturbances with mean 0 and covariance matrix            .

Analysts provide their price forecasts as an annual average, instead of a price for every maturity, as
is the case for futures. Thus, Equations (5) and (8) become

                                         log    , ,             ,             ,                      (15)




                                                                                                         10
                                                          1
                           log          ,           log         exp     ,               ,              (16)


Notice that in order to measure the analysts’ forecast observations we numerically approximate the
mean annual price as the mean of            observations evenly spaced over the same year of the estimation.
As can be observed, unlike futures prices, price forecasts are not a linear function of the state
variables.

In order for expected spot prices to be normally distributed, under the N-Factor model, the log
must be represented by a linear combination of the state variables. This can be achieved by linearizing
the measured log             ,      when computing each measurement step of the Kalman Filter3.

If       and      are defined as the number of observations of futures prices and analysts’ forecasts at
time , the matrices corresponding to the measurement equation are:


                                                                                                       (17)


where          is a       1 vector containing the futures observations and                  is a     1 vector
containing the price forecasts observations.

Let


                                                                                                       (18)


and


                                                                                                       (19)


where          is a        matrix and        is a         1 vector containing the measurement equations for
the futures data and         is a             matrix and       is a         1 vector containing the linearized
measurement equations for the price forecasts data.

Finally,


                                                                                                       (20)

4.      The Data

4.1.    Analysts’ Price Forecasts Data

Analysts´ price forecasts are obtained from four sources: Bloomberg, World Bank (WB),
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

The first source is the Bloomberg Commodity Price Forecasts. This data base provides information
on the mean price of each following year, up to 5 years ahead, made by individual analysts from a
wide range of private financial institutions. Even though the data has not been analyzed extensively
in the literature, it has been recently recognized as a rich and unexplored source of information
[Berber and Piana (2016), Bianchi and Piana (2016)].

The next three sources (WB, IMF, and EIA), provide periodic (monthly, quarterly or annually) reports
with long-term, annual mean price estimations up to 28 years ahead. Most historical data is available
since 2010. Among these three sources, the last one has received more attention in the literature. In
particular, Berber and Piana (2016) and Bianchi and Piana (2016) use it for oil inventory forecasts,
while Bolinger et al. (2006), Auffhammer (2007), Baumeister and Kilian (2015) and Haugom et al.
(2016) focus on price forecasts. Finally, Auffhammer (2007) and Baumeister and Kilian (2015) claim
this source is widely used by policymakers, industry and modelers.

Figure 3 shows the analysts’ price forecasts from all four sources, between 2010 and 2015. It can be
seen that short-term forecasts are more frequent, in contrast to long-term forecasts which are issued
in a less recurring, but periodical, basis.




                                                                                                  12
Fig. 3: Oil analysts’ price forecasts from 2010 to 2015 provided by Bloomberg’s Commodity Price
Forecasts, World Bank (WB), International Monetary Fund (IMF) and U.S. Energy Information
Administration (EIA).

Analysts’ price forecasts are made for the average of each year. Thus, for each forecast its maturity
is computed as the difference (in years) between the issue date and the middle of the year of the
estimation (01-July of each year). Price forecasts are grouped into weeks ending on the following
Wednesday, and then averaged4. Forecasts for the same year, which include past information, are
discarded as in Bianchi and Piana (2016). Table 2 summarizes the data.




4   This is similar to what Berber and Piana (2016) or Bianchi and Piana (2016) do when averaging
forecasts corresponding to the same period of estimation.

                                                                                                    13

4.2.    Oil Futures Data

Oil futures data is obtained from the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). Weekly futures
(Wednesday closing), with maturities for every 6 months, are used. There are from 17 to 19 contracts
per week. Futures data is much more frequent than analysts’ forecasts, as can be seen by comparing
Figures 3 and 4. Table 3 summarizes the futures data by maturity buckets with similar number of
observations.

4.3.      Risk Premiums Implied from the Data

As explained in Section 3.1, empirical risk premiums can be derived directly form the data by
comparing analysts’ forecasts with futures prices of similar maturity5. Since oil futures contracts
longest maturity does not exceed 9 years, it is not possible to calculate the data risk premiums
exceeding this term. Then, if         is a price forecast at time , for maturity , and   ,    is its closest
futures (in maturity) for the same date, following Equation 10 the data risk premium corresponding
to that time is computed as:




                                                      log
                                                              ,                                     (21)
                                                 ,




The mean data risk premiums for each maturity bucket is presented in Table 4. Notice that the annual
data risk premium is decreasing with maturity.




5   Forecasts with more than one year of difference with the nearest future contract are not used to
calculate data risk premiums.

                                                                                                        15

5.      Results
This section presents the results from calibrating the Cortazar and Naranjo (2006) N-factor model,
described in Section 3, using different specifications and calibration data. Model specifications
include two and three risk factors. In terms of the calibration data, two sets are available: futures
prices (F) and analysts’ forecasts (A). Results using jointly both data sets (FA-Model), only-analysts’
data (A-Model), and the traditional only-futures data (F-Model), are presented. The behavior of the
futures curve, the expected spot price curve and the risk premiums are analyzed.

5.1.    Joint Model Estimation (FA-Model)

The Joint Model estimation, FA-Model, uses both the analysts’ price forecasts and futures data to
calibrate the N-Factor Model for two and three factors. To motivate the discussion, Figures 5 and 6
illustrate the results for the futures and expected spot curves, under different specifications and
calibrations, for two specific dates, one, on 04-14-2010, in the in sample period and the other, on 07-
22-2015, in the out of sample period. Notice that in all cases the curves fit reasonably well the futures
prices and analysts’ forecasts observations when using the FA-Model. On the contrary, when using
the traditional F-Model, the expected price curves are well below the analysts’ forecasts.

Tables 5 and 6 present the parameter values obtained using the Kalman filter and using weekly data
from 2010 to 2014, for the two- and three-factor FA-Models, respectively6. It is worth noticing that
by using this new FA approach most risk premium parameters λi are now statistically significant.

6   Measurement errors for both data sets are assumed to be the same, estimating a single parameter.
However, this assumption can be relaxed to allow different measurement errors for futures and
forecasts, consequently affecting the parameter estimation process.             Furthermore, different
measurement errors can be used for different maturity buckets in each data set, as shown in Cortazar et
al. (2015) or in Cortazar et al. (2007).

As discussed previously, the F- and FA-Models estimate both the true and the risk-adjusted
distributions, from which futures prices and expected spot prices can be obtained. Futures price and
analysts’ forecast errors for both models are computed and presented in Tables 7 to 10.


Tables 7 and 8 show the mean absolute errors between analysts’ forecasts and model expected spot
prices generated by the FA-Model versus the F-Model. It is clear that the FA-Model has a
significantly better fit for all time windows and buckets, for both the two and the three factor models.

Furthermore, Tables 9 and 10 show the mean absolute errors between observed futures prices and
model futures prices. As expected, the benefit of obtaining a better fit in the expected spot prices, by
including analysts’ forecasts, comes at the expense of increasing the mean absolute error on the
futures prices. Nevertheless, the error increase is only 1%.




                                                                                                     19
In summary the FA-Model has the advantage of generating a more reliable expected spot curve, with
only a moderate effect for the goodness of fit for the futures 7 . The three-factor model performs
moderately better than the two-factor model.

7 Moreover, the tradeoff between both effects can be modified by setting different specifications for the
measurement error variances for futures and forecasts when implementing the Kalman Filter. As
explained in Section 3, our results use a single ξ parameter for both futures and forecasts observations
at all maturities. However, this assumption can be relaxed to allow different measurement error
variances according to the nature of each observation included in the parameter estimation process.

5.2.      Analysts’ Consensus Curve using only Analysts’ Forecasts (A-Model)

In the previous section, futures and expected spot curves for the FA-Model, calibrated using both
futures and analysts’ forecasts, were presented. In that setting each curve is affected by both sets of
data. In this section we calibrate the model using only analysts’ forecasts, modeling only the dynamics
of the spot price. Thus, the expected spot curve represents an analysts’ consensus curve that optimally
considers all previous forecasts. Given that futures data is not used, no futures curve or risk premium
parameters are obtained. Table 11 shows the A-Model parameters values for the two and three factor
models.




                                                                                                    21

Given that the model is only required to fit analysts’ price forecasts, and not futures prices, the
expected spot curve fits better in the A-Model than in the FA-Model, and much better than in the F-
Model. For example, Figures 7 and 8 show the expected spot curves for both models and compares
them with those of the F-Model, for two specific dates, one, on 04-14-2010, in the in sample period
and the other, on 07-22-2015, in the out of sample period.

Tables 12 and 13 compares the mean absolute errors of the analysts’ consensus curve in both models,
for two and three factors, respectively. As expected, the A-Model that only uses analysts’ forecast
data fits better this data than the FA-Model which includes also futures prices. This holds for every
time window and maturity bucket.

Table 14 reports the expected spot mean price and annual volatility of the two-Factor FA- and A-
Models, for each maturity bucket between 2010 and 2015. The first two columns of Table 14 show
that for the two-factor model the mean expected spot prices for the FA- and A- models are similar,
especially for short term maturity buckets8. The last two columns report the volatility of expected
prices obtained for the two models. Since the analysts´ forecasts are very noisy, the A-Model
generates an analysts’ consensus curve which is between 3 and 7 times more volatile than the one
from the FA-Model. Table 15 reports the results for the three-factor model, which are similar to the
ones in the two-factor model.



8   In fact, differences in mean prices are significant at the 99% level for maturity buckets over 10 years.

                                                                                                               22
In summary, the analysts’ consensus curve can be obtained from the FA or the A-Models. The former
has the advantage of generating a less volatile curve, while the latter generates a better fit. The
difference between the means of both curves increases with maturity.

5.3.     Long-Term Futures Price Estimation using also Analysts’ Price Forecasts (FA-
Model)

As has been argued earlier, estimation of long term futures prices done by extrapolation is subject to
estimation errors. Also, oil futures’ longest maturity is around 9 years, while there are oil price
forecasts for maturities of over 25 years. In this section, the impact on long-term futures prices of
using analysts’ price forecasts, in addition to traded futures, is explored.

To motivate this section Figures 9 and 10 show futures curves from the two factor FA- and F-Models,
for two specific dates, one, on 04-14-2010, in the in sample period and the other, on 07-22-2015, in
the out of sample period, and compares them to the analysts’ forecasts for the same dates. It can be
seen that both futures curves for long maturities are very different. On the other hand, both curves are
very similar for short and medium term maturities, for which there is futures data. Figures 11 and
12 present a similar situation for the three-factor model. Given that there are no long term futures to
validate any of the curves, we present the FA-Model futures curve as a valuable alternative to the
traditional F-Model curve, which takes into consideration analysts’ opinions.

Table 16 and Table 17 show the mean price and annual volatility of the futures curves (FA- and F-
Models) for every maturity, for the two and three factor models, respectively. As the tables show,
the inclusion of expectations data, when using the FA-Model, significantly affects the mean futures
curve in the long-term, without considerably changing it in the short-term. Again, as was the case for
the expected spot curves in the previous section, the longer the maturity the greater the difference




                                                                                                     26
between both curves9. Given the fact that analysts’ forecasts are very volatile, the effect of using them
almost doubles the volatility of the futures curves when using the FA-Model.

5.4.    Data Risk Premium Curves

Having reliable expected spot and the futures curves allows for the estimation of the term structure
of risk premiums implied by their difference. As stated earlier the calibration of the F-Model provides
statistically insignificant risk premium parameters, thus expected spot curves are unreliable. On the
contrary, adding analysts´ forecast data addresses this issue.

Figure 13 shows the model term structure of risk premiums implicit in the difference of the expected
spot and futures curves for the two and three factor FA- and F- Models. In these models the risk

                                                                                                    30
premium depends only on maturity and not on the state variables, so there is a constant risk premium
curve for each model over the whole sample period. The figure also shows the data risk premiums,
obtained directly from the difference between price forecasts and their closest future price
observation, averaged for each maturity over the whole sample period 2010 and 2015, along with the
99% confidence interval.

Several insights can be gained from Figure 13. First, the FA-model risk premiums are very close to
the mean data risk premiums. Second the three-factor model fits better the risk premiums than the
two factor model, especially for short term maturities. Third, the term structure seems to be
downward sloping, with annual risk premiums in the range of 2 to 10%. Finally, as expected, the F-
Model is not able to obtain a credible estimation of risk premiums.

6.      Conclusion

Even though commodity pricing models have been successful in fitting futures prices, they do not
generate accurate true distributions of spot prices. This paper proposes to calibrate these models
using not only observations of futures prices, but also analysts´ forecasts of spot prices.

The Cortazar and Naranjo (2006) N-factor model is implemented for two and three factors, and
estimated using the Kalman Filter. Each implementation is calibrated using the traditional only-
futures data (F-Model), an alternative only-analysts’ data (A-Model), and a joint calibration using
both sets of data (FA-Model). Futures data is from NYMEX contracts, and analysts´ forecasts from
Bloomberg, IMF, World Bank, and EIA. Weekly oil data from 2010 to 2015 is used.

There are several interesting conclusions that can be derived from the results presented. The first is
that in order to obtain reasonable expected spot curves, analysts´ forecasts should be used, either alone
(A-Model), or jointly with futures data (FA-Model). Second, using both futures and forecasts (FA-
Model), instead of using only forecasts (A-Model), generates expected spot curves that do not differ
considerably in the short/medium term, but long term estimations are significantly different and the
volatility of the curve is substantially reduced. Third, the inclusion of analysts´ forecasts, in addition
to futures, in the FA-Model, instead of only futures prices (F-Model) does not alter significantly the
short/medium part of the futures curve, but does have a significant effect on long-term futures
estimations, and increases the volatility of the curve. Finally, that in order to obtain a statistically
significant risk premium term structure, both data sets must be used jointly, preferably using a three
factor model.

The information provided by experts in commodity markets, reflected in analysts’ and institutional
forecasts, is a valuable source that should be taken into account in the estimation of commodity
pricing models. This paper is a first attempt in this direction.
