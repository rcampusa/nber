Monetary Rules for small, open, emerging economies

JEL No. C51, E31, E52

                                         ABSTRACT

This paper develops a variant of the IMF's Global Economic Model (GEM) suitable to analyze
macroeconomic dynamics in open economies, and uses it to assess the effectiveness of Taylor rules
and Inflation-Forecast-Based (IFB) rules in stabilizing variability in output and inflation. Our

findings suggest that a simple IFB rule that does not rely upon any direct estimates of the
equilibrium real interest rate and places a relatively high weight on the inflation forecast may

perform better in small open economies than conventional Taylor rules.

1       Introduction

Generations of policymakers have long emphasized an “impossible trinity” of policy objec-

tives. Attempts to simultaneously maintain fixed exchange rates, perfect capital mobility,

and independent monetary policy are bound to end either with a whimper or a bang. Over

the 1990s, the intellectual underpinnings of the monetary frameworks adopted by central

banks around the world have assigned increasing emphasis to a rather different trinity, one

that is “both feasible and desirable” in the words of John Taylor (2000): this is the trinity

of flexible exchange rates, an inflation target, and a monetary policy rule.

     The idea that policy rules originally designed to fit the specific economic and institu-

tional features of large and relatively closed economies may be successfully imported by

small, trade-dependent countries is nowadays taken for granted. The key open question is

what kind of modifications are needed to fit the complex reality of monetary policymaking

in economies with less developed financial markets, more vulnerability to external sources

of uncertainty, strong movements in productivity and relative prices, and destabilizing ex-

posure to volatile capital flows.

     With respect to Taylor-style interest rate rules, a frequently asked question is whether the

size of the response of the instrument to inflation and output gap changes systematically with

the degree of openness and the size of the country. Another recurrent theme in the literature

is what role, if any, should be played by interest rate inertia.1 Finally, a controversial point

concerns the desirability of exchange rate targets in monetary rules.2

     This paper contributes to this debate in a number of respects. First, we set up a stochas-

tic dynamic general equilibrium model (SDGE) of sufficient complexity to provide a satisfac-

    1 See   e.g. Woodford (1999).

    2 As    the focus of the paper is on the “feasible and desirableÔ trinity mentioned above, we abstract from

the issues underlying the choice of a fixed versus flexible exchange rate regime. For a recent analysis of these

issues in the context of a similar theoretical apparatus see Ghironi and Rebucci (2002) and its references.

tory representation of trade and macroeconomic interdependencies between a large indus-

trialized country and a small open economy. Next, we calibrate the model with particular

attention to its ability to simulate realistic dynamic responses of relevant macroeconomic

variables to a variety of shocks. Specifically, we show that the model is able to repli-

cate closely the empirical properties of the monetary transmission mechanism, as estimated

by central banks using institution-specific tools for policy evaluation. Finally, we com-

pare the performance of alternative interest rate rules — Generalized Taylor rules versus

Inflation-Forecast-Based ones — in stabilizing variability in inflation and output across the

two economies of the model.

   A few caveats should be immediately emphasized. The main focus of our contribution is

to examine and contrast the implications of alternative monetary rules in economies that dif-

fer substantially in their size and degree of openness. From this vantage point, our analysis

is broadly applicable to small, open economies regardless of their degree of industrialization

and development. The specific reference to emerging economies is perhaps more controver-

sial. Needless to say, the term “emerging” market applies to a highly heterogeneous array of

institutional and economic realities, and any unqualified search for common policy prescrip-

tions has a very good chance of being dismissed as quixotic from its very onset. In fact, in

this paper we deliberately abstract from some considerations that would appear germane in

setting monetary policy in many emerging economies, including central bank independence,

potential fiscal constraints, credibility and time-consistency problems in adhering to rules,

liquidity constraints on household or firm borrowing, and balance sheet effects of exchange

rate fluctuations.

   Nevertheless, most so-called “emerging” markets share a number of features that we

believe our framework is fit to capture well. Emerging economies according to our charac-

terization are sufficiently diversified and not exclusively dependent on exports of primary

commodities and raw materials. Their securities markets are sufficiently developed to allow




                                              2
for a meaningful comparison of their macroeconomic properties with the ones observed in

advanced industrialized countries. At the same time, their reliance on trade makes them

more exposed to external fluctuations than their advanced counterparts. Also, they are

intrinsically more vulnerable to a variety of shocks, both on the demand and the supply

side, than their advanced counterparts.

   To provide a specific example, in our simulation exercise we identify the large coun-

try with the Euro area and the small economy with the Czech Republic, a representative

transition country in Central Europe that fits our definition of an emerging economy.3 In

the light of the considerations above, by no means should our results be generalized to the

vast majority of emerging markets without controlling for country-specific and institutional

factors. Yet, our findings are meant to provide a benchmark for the analysis of monetary

rules across heterogeneous economies, over which further research is expected to take off.

   The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our two-country model. Section 3

discusses the calibration of the model to stylized facts for transition economies and the Euro

area. Section 4 employs the model to investigate the potential role of Taylor and Inflation-

Forecast-Based rules for stabilizing output and inflation in both large and small economies.

Finally, Section 5 presents our main conclusions and outlines directions for future work.

  3 Since   our objective is to build a logically consistent two-country framework to study the implications

of strong trade linkages between small and large economies, it is important to state at the outset that

the calibration exercise is not meant to represent a complete model of either the Euro area or the Czech

Republic. Because the calibration only models trade flows between the Czech Republic and the Euro area,

we significantly underestimate the absolute degree of openness of both economies. Also, the addition of

a “rest-of-worldÔ block to the model may be helpful to study issues such as the perspective accession of

Central European countries into the European Union and their transition toward full EMU membership.

For a recent analysis of institutional issues in Central Europe within a SDGE framework see Natalucci and

Ravenna (2002).

2     The model

2.1     General structure

The theoretical framework we adopt in our analysis is a variant of the “Global Economy

Model” (GEM ), the new multi-country simulation model currently under development at

the Research Department of the International Monetary Fund.4 The basic structure of the

model is outlined in this section and illustrated in Figure 1.

    The world economy consists of two countries, Home (small) and Foreign (large). Foreign

variables are indexed with a star. In each country there are households, firms, and a

government.

    Each household is infinitely lived. Each household consumes a single nontradable final

good (A). Each household is the monopolistic supplier of a differentiated labor input (`) to

all domestic firms. Wage contracts are subject to adjustment costs (nominal wage rigidities).

Households own domestic firms, non-reproducible resources (land L), and the domestic

capital stock (K), which they rent to domestic firms. The markets for land and capital are

competitive. Capital accumulation is subject to adjustment costs. Labor, capital and land

are immobile internationally. Households trade a short-term nominal bond, denominated

in Foreign currency, and issued in zero net supply worldwide. There are intermediation

costs for Home households entering the international bond market. No other asset is traded

internationally.

    Firms produce the final good, a continuum of differentiated nontradable intermediate

    4 GEM   provides an extension of the stylized models considered in the “New Open-Economy Macroeco-

nomicsÔ theoretical literature such as Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995, 2000), Corsetti and Pesenti (2001a,b),

Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2000), Tille (2001), Devereux and Engel (2001), Corsetti and Dedola (2002),

Benigno and Benigno (2003), and builds on empirical SDGE open-economy applications such as Kollmann

(2001), Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2002), Smets and Wouters (2002a), Batini, Harrison and Millard

(2001), Benigno and Thoenissen (2002), Gali and Monacelli (2002). For a detailed presentation of GEM see

Pesenti (2003).



                                                   4
goods (N ), a continuum of differentiated tradable intermediate goods (T ), raw and semi-

finished materials (TO ), and provide distribution and other intermediation services.

   In each country, the final good is produced by perfectly competitive firms that use

all intermediate goods (domestic nontradable goods, NN , domestic tradable goods, Q, or

imports, M ) as inputs. The final good can be consumed (by domestic households, C, or by

the government, GA ) or used for investment (I).

   Each intermediate good is produced by a single firm under conditions of monopolistic

competition. Each intermediate good is produced by using domestic labor inputs, domestic

capital, and a combination (O) of raw and semi-finished materials, both produced domesti-

cally (QO ) and imported (M0 ). The nontradable intermediate goods can be purchased by

the government (GN ), used directly in the production of the nontradable final good (NN ),

or used in the distribution sector to make tradable intermediate goods available to firms

producing the final good. Prices of intermediate goods are subject to adjustment costs

(nominal price rigidities).

   Firms in the distribution sector operate under perfect competition. They purchase trad-

able intermediate goods worldwide (at the producer price) and distribute them to firms

producing the final good (at the consumer price). Local nontradable goods are the only in-

put in the provision of distribution services. Firms produce tradable raw and semi-finished

materials (TO ) using labor, capital, and land. The market for raw materials is competitive.

Prices of raw materials are flexible and the law of one price holds internationally.

   Government spending falls exclusively on nontradable goods, both final and intermediate.

Government spending is financed through tax and seigniorage revenues. The government

controls the national short-term nominal interest rate. Monetary policy is specified in terms

of interest rate rules.




                                              5
2.2        Final goods production

There is a continuum of symmetric Home firms producing the Home final good. Each firm is

indexed by x ∈ [0, s], where 0 < s < 1 is a measure of country size. World size is normalized

to 1, and Foreign firms producing the Foreign final good are indexed by x∗ ∈ (s, 1].

    Home firm x’s output at time (quarter) t is denoted At (x).5 The final good is produced

with the following nested CES technology:

                               n           1            1      1
                                                                 h 1           1− 1
                       At (x) = (1 − γ t ) ε NN,t (x)1− ε + γ tε ν εQM Qt (x) εQM
                                                                                       ) ε
                                   1
                                                              1−  1  i ε εQM−1 (1− 1ε ) ε−1
                                                                        QM
                       + (1 − ν) εQM [Mt (x) (1 − ΓM,t (x))] εQM                                         (1)


Three intermediate inputs are used in the production of the final good: a basket NN of

Home nontradable goods, a basket Q of Home tradable goods, and a basket M of imported

Foreign tradable goods. ε > 0 is the elasticity of substitution between tradable goods and

nontradable goods, and εQM > 0 is the elasticity of substitution between domestic and

imported inputs. The (log of) tradable goods weight γ t is subject to an auto-correlated

disturbance term around a steady-state mean.6 These shocks are isomorphic to shifts in

Home residents’ preferences from tradable goods to nontradable goods.

    To model realistic dynamics of imports volumes (such as sluggish adjustment to changes

in relative prices) we assume that it is costly to change the share of the imported goods in

total production.7 Imports are subject to external adjustment costs ΓM , where:
                                                    ²                       ³2
                                               φM       Mt (x) Mt−1
                                  ΓM,t (x) ≡                  /     −1                                   (2)
                                                2       At (x) At−1

   5 The   convention throughout the model is that variables which are not explicitly indexed (to firms or
                                                                                    Rs
households) are expressed in per-capita (average) terms. For instance, At ≡ (1/s)   0    At (x)dx.

   6 See   Table 2 for a description of the assumptions about the shocks.

   7A   similar specification appears e.g. in Erceg, Guerrieri and Gust (2002). For analytical simplicity we

assume that a firm finds it costly to adjust its current imports/output ratio Mt (x)/At (x) relatively to the

past aggregate imports/output ratio Mt−1 /At−1 .




                                                        6
Like all other adjustment costs in the model, they are treated as local services provided at

zero cost: all revenue from adjustment is rebated in a lump-sum fashion to the country’s

residents.

     The basket NN is a CES index of differentiated Home intermediate nontradable goods,

defined over a continuum of mass s. Each good is produced by a single Home firm indexed

by n ∈ [0, s]. Defining as NN (n, x) the demand by firm x of an intermediate good produced

by firm n, the basket NN (x) is:
                                    "² ³ 1 Z                         θ
                                                                  # θ−1

                         NN,t (x) =           NN,t (n, x)      dn                                   (3)
                                      s     0


where θ > 1 denotes the elasticity of substitution among intermediate nontradable goods.

Similarly, the baskets Q and M are CES indexes of differentiated intermediate tradable

goods, respectively produced in the Home country and imported from the Foreign country.

Each good is produced by a single firm. Home firms in the tradable goods sector are indexed

by h ∈ [0, s], Foreign firms in the tradable goods sector are indexed by f ∈ (s, 1]:
                                    "² ³ 1 Z                       θ

                      Mt (x)   =                                Mt (f, x)        df             .   (5)

     The cost-minimization problem of Home firm x can be split in two parts. First, each

firm takes as given the prices of the nontradable differentiated goods p(n) and minimizes
Rs
 0
     pt (n) NN,t (n, x) dn subject to (3). The cost-minimizing price of one unit of the nontrad-

able basket, PN , is equal to:
                                          ´² ³ Z s                 1
                                                                µ 1−θ

                                            s   0


Similarly, we can derive the cost-minimizing prices of the baskets of intermediate goods Q

and M , respectively PQ and PM . Next, each Home firm takes the prices of the intermediate

baskets PQ , PM and PN as given and minimizes PQ,t Qt (x) + PM,t Mt (x) + PN,t NN,t (x)

subject to (1). As the final good sector is perfectly competitive, each firm x takes the price


                                                    7
of the final good P as given and equates its marginal cost to the price. Foreign variables

are similarly defined.



2.3          Demand for intermediate goods and the distribution sector

The above cost-minimization conditions imply that Home firm x’s demand for input h is:
                              ²            ³−θ ² Z s                      θ

                                  pt (h)        1             1− θ1              pt (h)     Qt (x)
              QD
               t   (h, x) =                          Qt (h, x)      dh       =                            (7)
                                   PQ,t         s 0                               PQ,t        s

Aggregating across firms we obtain the following demand schedule for Home tradable inter-

                                           Z    s                    ²            ³−θ
                                                                         pt (h)

Similar considerations hold for MtD (x), the demand of Foreign tradable intermediate goods

f.

      To derive the demand schedule for nontradable intermediate goods, we need to take into

account the different uses of the n inputs in the Home economy. First, as we have seen,

nontradable goods enter directly in the production function of final goods through the basket

NN . Second, nontradable goods can be consumed by the government. Third, nontradable

goods are used in the distribution sector according to the following assumptions.

      Firms producing the final good cannot purchase the intermediate tradable goods directly

from the producers. Instead, firms in the distribution sector purchase tradable goods both

domestically and abroad and distribute them to the firms producing the final good. The

distribution technology is Leontief: to make one unit of an intermediate good available to

downstream producers, firms in the distribution sector require η ≥ 0 units of the nontradable

goods basket N . There are no distribution costs for nontradable goods.8

      Firms in the distribution sector are perfectly competitive. Because of distribution costs,

there is a wedge between producer (wholesale) and consumer (retail) prices. We denote

     8 The   specification of the distribution sector builds on Corsetti and Dedola (2002). See also Erceg and

Levin (1996) and Burstein, Neves and Rebelo (2003).



                                                               8
with p the consumer price (that is, the price paid by Home firms producing the final good)

and with p̄ the Home-currency producer price (that is, the price paid by Home firms in the

distribution sector) of an intermediate good. It follows that:


              pt (n) = p̄t (n),         pt (h) = p̄t (h) + ηPN,t ,              pt (f ) = p̄t (f ) + ηPN,t    (9)


   Denoting government spending on nontradable goods by GN,t , we can now derive the

demand for Home nontradable goods n as:

                     Z    s                        ²            ³−θ
                               D                       pt (n)
                              NN,t (n, x) dx +                          [η (Qt + Mt ) + GN,t ]
                      0                                PN,t
                          ²             ³−θ
                               pt (n)
                     =                        [NN,t + η (Qt + Mt ) + GN,t ]                                  (10)
                               PN,t

Foreign variables are similarly characterized.



2.4      Supply of intermediate goods

In this section we focus on the supply of Home nontradable goods, with the understanding

that the derivation of the other intermediate goods at Home and abroad follows similar

steps.

   Nontradable goods n are produced by symmetric firms using the following CES technol-

ogy:
                                        º                                                   1
                                                                 1
                                                                                1− ξ1                1− ξ1
                NtS (n)
                                                                                           ξ
                              = ZN,t (1 − αN − γ N ) ξN `t (n)                      N   + αNN Kt (n)     N



                      1
                                                                     » ξ ξN−1
                                                                        N
                     ξN                                  1− ξ1
                 +γ N [Ot (n) (1 − ΓO,t (n))]                   N                                            (11)


Firms use labor `(n), capital K(n) and a basket O (n) of two tradable inputs (raw materials)

produced in the Home and in the Foreign country respectively. ξ N > 0 is the constant

elasticity of input substitution, and ZN is a stochastic process for productivity common to

all producers of nontradable goods. Changes in O(n) are subject to adjustment costs ΓO

similar to equation (2) above.




                                                           9
   Differentiated labor inputs in both countries are defined over a continuum of mass equal

to the country size: Home labor inputs are indexed by j ∈ [0, s], Foreign labor inputs by

j ∗ ∈ (s, 1]. Each firm n uses a CES combination of labor inputs:
                                            "² ³ 1 Z                    φ
                                                                     # φ−1
                                              1 φ s             1
                                   `t (n) =           `(n, j)1− φ dj                                          (12)
                                              s     0


where `(n, j) is the demand of type-j labor by the producer of good n and φ > 1 is the

elasticity of substitution among labor inputs.

   O(n) is a basket of raw materials defined as:
              º    1
                                                                                                      » ε εON−1

                  εON          1− ε                                                           1− ε
  Ot (n) =     νN       QO,t (n)      ON   + (1 − ν N )   εON
                                                                [MO,t (n) (1 − ΓM O,t (n))]      ON




                                                                                                              (13)

where QO (n) denotes Home firm n’s use of domestic raw materials and MO (n) denotes firm

n’s imports of raw materials from Foreign. Home and Foreign materials are combined with

elasticity of substitution εON > 0. Once again, imports MO (n) are subject to adjustment

costs ΓM O (n).

   Firms producing intermediate goods take the prices of labor inputs, capital and raw

materials as given. Cost-minimization in the intermediate sector implies that the demand

for labor input j by firm n is a function of the relative wage:
                                                  ² ³²        ³−φ
                                                   1   Wt (j)
                                    `D
                                     t (n, j)   =                 `t (n)                                      (14)
                                                   s    Wt

where W (j) is the nominal wage paid to Home labor input j and the wage index W is

defined as:
                                          ´² ³ Z s                 1
                                                                µ 1−φ
                                            1            1−φ
                                     Wt =          Wt (j)    dj                                               (15)
                                            s   0

   Denoting by R the Home nominal rental price of capital, by PQO the Home-currency

price of one unit of QO and by PM O the Home-currency price of one unit of MO , firms in the

Home nontradable goods sector minimize their costs Wt `t (n) + Rt Kt (n) + PQO,t QO,t (n) +

PM O,t MO,t (n) subject to (11) and (13). Cost-minimization yields expressions for `D
                                                                                    t (n),


KtD (n), QD         D
          O,t (n), MO,t (n) and the marginal cost M C(n).



                                                      10
    Similar considerations hold for the production of Home tradable goods. We denote by

T S (h) the supply of each Home-country intermediate tradable h. Using self-explanatory

notation, we have:
                                   º                                 1
                                                     1

                          1

                                                       ξT −1      T
                         ξT
                     +γ T [(1 − ΓO,t (h)) Ot (h)]       ξT
                                                                                                     (16)


Following the same steps as above it is possible to derive input demands and marginal costs

in the tradable goods sector. We proceed analogously in the case of Foreign nontradable

goods n∗ and Foreign tradable goods f .



2.5      Price setting in the intermediate sector

Consider now profit maximization in the Home country’s intermediate nontradable goods

sector. Each firm n takes into account the demand (10) for its product and sets the nominal

price pt (n) by maximizing the present discounted value of real profits. There is sluggish

price adjustment due to resource costs measured in terms of total profits. The adjustment

cost is denoted ΓP N,t :
                                                  ²                       ³2
                                             φN       pt (n)/pt−1 (n)
                              ΓP N,t (n) ≡                            −1                             (17)
                                              2       PN,t−1 /PN,t−2

where φN ≥ 0. This specification builds on Rotemberg’s (1982) quadratic cost of price

adjustment. Drawing from Ireland (2001), the adjustment cost is related to changes in firm

n’s price inflation relative to the past observed inflation rate in the nontradable goods sector

as a whole. This allows the model to reproduce realistic inflation dynamics encompassing

nominal inertias and staggering.9

   9A   variant of the model adds another quadratic term to the adjustment cost, penalizing changes of the

nominal price pt (n)/pt−1 (n) relative to a parameter π, which is equal to the gross steady-state rate of

inflation π > 0.




                                                      11
    The price-setting problem is then characterized as:
                                      ∞ n
                                      X                                           θ
                          max∞ Et        Dt,τ (pτ (n) − M Cτ (n)) pτ (n)−θ (PN,τ )
                       {pτ (n)}τ =t
                                      τ =t


                       ∗ (NN,τ + η (Qτ + Mτ ) + GN,τ ) (1 − ΓP N,τ (n))}                                (18)


where the discount rate Dt,τ (with Dt,t = 1) is the intertemporal marginal rate of sub-

stitution in consumption of the representative household, to be defined below. Note that

when prices are fully flexible (φN = 0), the optimization problem collapses to the standard

markup rule:
                                                         θ
                                             pt (n) =       M Ct (n)                                    (19)
                                                        θ−1

where the fixed gross markup θ/ (θ − 1) is a negative function of the elasticity of input

substitution.

    Consider now the price-setting problem in the Home tradable goods sector. Each firm h

has to set two (wholesale) prices, p̄(h) in the Home market and p̄∗ (h) in the Foreign market.

Denoting the nominal exchange rate as E (defined as Home currency per unit of Foreign

currency), firm h sets its prices by maximizing its profits as follows:
                             ∞
                                       (                         ²                 ³−θ

                                                PM,τ                      s                    

where the costs ΓP Q,t (h) and Γ∗P M,t (h) are the analogs of (17).

    If nominal rigidities in the export market are highly relevant, the prices of Home goods in

the Foreign market will be characterized by significant inertia.10 In this case, exchange rate

pass-through in the Foreign economy will be rather low due to the fact that prices are sticky

in the consumer currency, that is, exports are invoiced in Foreign currency. However, it is

worth emphasizing that in our model exchange rate pass-through may be low for reasons

unrelated to nominal rigidities.

  10 Substantially,   this is the “local currency pricingÔ scenario analyzed by Devereux and Engel (2000),

Corsetti and Pesenti (2001a) and others.

      To clarify this point, note that in the absence of price stickiness prices would be equal

to:

                      θ              η                                     θ              η∗
         p̄t (h) =       M Ct (h) +     PN,t ,            Et p̄∗t (h) =       M Ct (h) +         ∗
                                                                                             Et PN,t             (21)

The presence of distribution services intensive in local inputs implies that the elasticity of

demand for any brand is not necessarily the same across markets. As a result, firm h will

in general charge different prices at Home and abroad. As stressed by Corsetti and Dedola

(2002), exchange rate pass-through is less than perfect (that is, ∂ log p̄∗t (h)/∂ log Et < 1) and

the law of one price does not hold (that is, p̄t (h) 6= Et p̄∗t (h)) even if wholesale prices are fully

flexible. Asymmetries in relative productivity, relative wages, or relative costs of capital

drive a wedge between Home and Foreign prices of a good h. Markups in both markets

are state-contingent and vary as functions of productivity and demand shocks.11 Foreign

variables are similarly characterized.



2.6        Tradable inputs

In this section, we model tradable upstream inputs used up in the production of downstream

intermediate goods. These inputs can be thought of as raw and semi-finished materials or

parts. It is assumed that market power in these sectors is negligible, and there is no price

discrimination across countries.

      Notational conventions and modeling strategy are very similar to the ones adopted above.

Symmetric Home firms producing raw materials are indexed by o ∈ [0, s]. Raw materials

are produced with labor, capital, and land L (non-reproducible resources):

where ZO is a productivity disturbance term.

 11 Similar      considerations apply to the retail (consumer) market.

   Firm o takes all prices as given, including the price of land PL , and minimizes Wt `t (o) +

Rt Kt (o) + PL,t Lt (o) subject to (22), obtaining expressions for `D       D           D
                                                                    t (o), Kt (o), and Lt (o).


The Home price of Home raw materials, PQO , is equal to firm o’s marginal cost:
                           h                                            i 1−ξ1

                 PQO,t =                                                                  (23)
                                                           ZO,t

and, in the absence of pricing to market, the law of one price holds:

                                           ∗
                                          PM O,t = PQO,t /Et                              (24)


Similar considerations hold in the Foreign country.



2.7    Household optimization

In each country there is a continuum of symmetric households. Home households are indexed

by j ∈ [0, s] and Foreign households by j ∗ ∈ (s, 1], the same indexes of labor inputs.

   Households’ preferences are additively separable in consumption and labor effort. De-

noting with Wt (j) the lifetime expected utility of Home agent j, we have:

                                         ∞
                                         X
                           Wt (j) ≡ Et          β τ −t [U (Cτ (j)) − V (`τ (j))]          (25)
                                         τ =t


where β is the discount rate. There is habit persistence in consumption according to the

specification:
                                                                       1−σ
                                                 (Ct (j) − bCt−1 )           −1
                               Ut (j) = ZU,t                                              (26)
                                                           1−σ

where Ct−1 is past per-capita Home consumption and 0 < b < 1. The term ZU is a

preference shock common to all Home residents. The parametric specification of V is:

                                                           `t (j)1+ζ
                                         Vt (j) = ZV,t                                    (27)
                                                             1+ζ

where ζ > 0 and ZV,t is a shock to labor disutility. Foreign agent j ∗ ’s preferences are

similarly specified. The discount rate β is assumed to be identical across countries.




                                                      14
    The individual flow budget constraint for agent j in the Home country is:

                              ∗
                 Mt (j) + Et Bt+1 (j) + Bt+1 (j) ≤ Mt−1 (j) + (1 + i∗t ) [1 − ΓB,t ] Et Bt∗ (j)

                 +(1 + it )Bt (j) + Rt Kt (j) + PL,t Lt (j) + Wt (j)`t (j) [1 − ΓW,t (j)]

                 −Pt Ct (j) [1 + ΓS,t (j)] − Pt It (j) + Φt − N ET Tt (j)                               (28)


    Home agents hold domestic money M and two bonds, B and B ∗ , denominated in Home

and Foreign currency, respectively. The short-term nominal rates it and i∗t are paid at

the beginning of period t and are known at time t − 1.12 The two short-term rates are

directly controlled by the national governments. Only the Foreign-currency bond is traded

internationally: the Foreign bond is in zero net supply worldwide, while the Home bond is

in zero net supply at the domestic level.

    The financial friction ΓB is introduced to guarantee that net asset positions follow a

stationary process and the economies converge asymptotically to a steady state.13 Home

agents face a transaction cost ΓB when they take a position in the Foreign bond market.

This cost depends on the average net asset position of the whole economy and is zero only

when Home agents do not hold any Foreign-currency assets. Specifically, we adopt the

following functional form:

                                                      ∗
                                                               ¡

                                                      ∗
                                          exp φB2 Et BH,t+1 /Pt + 1

                               ∗
                                                          Rs

holdings of the Foreign bond.

          ∗
    When BH is zero, ΓB = 0. When Home is a net lender and holdings of the Foreign bond

go to infinity, ΓB rises from zero to φB1 , implying that Home households lose an increasing

  12 We   adopt the notation of Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996, ch.10). Specifically, our timing convention has

Bt (j) and Bt∗ (j) as agent j’s nominal bonds accumulated during period t − 1 and carried over into period t.

  13 A   similar modeling strategy is adopted by Benigno (2001). Alternative approaches to guarantee sta-

tionarity rely on parametric assumptions as in Corsetti and Pesenti (2001b) or demographic dynamics as in

Ghironi and Rebucci (2002).



                                                     15
fraction of their Foreign bond returns to financial intermediaries.14 Similarly, when Home is

a net borrower and holdings of the Foreign bond go to minus infinity, ΓB falls from zero to

−φB1 implying that Home households pay an increasing intermediation premium on their

debt. This guarantees that in a non-stochastic steady state Home agents have no incentive to

hold Foreign bonds and net asset positions are zero worldwide. The parameter φB2 controls

the flatness of the ΓB function, hence the speed of convergence to the steady state. The

variable ZB,t is a noise term: uncertainty in international financial intermediation plays in

GEM the same role that “uncovered interest parity shocks” or risk-premium fluctuations

play in other open-economy models (such as McCallum and Nelson (1999) or Kollmann

(2001)).

   Home agents rent land to Home firms at the nominal rate PL and accumulate Home

physical capital which they rent to Home firms at the nominal rate R. The supply of land

is exogenous, say Lt (j) = Lt (j). The law of motion of capital is:


                              Kt+1 (j) = (1 − δ) Kt (j) + Ψt Kt (j)                 0<δ≤1                         (30)


where δ is the depreciation rate. To simulate realistic investment flows, capital accumulation

is subject to adjustment costs. The specific functional form we adopt is quadratic:
                                          ²                        ³2    ²               ³2
                          It (j)  φ           It (j)                  φ    It (j)   It−1
              Ψt ≡               − I1                − δ(1 + ZI,t ) − I2          −                               (31)
                          Kt (j)   2          Kt (j)                   2   Kt (j) Kt−1

where φI1 , φI2 ≥ 0 and ZI,t is a temporary shock (an unexpected increase in ZI,t is equivalent

to an increase in the rate of capital depreciation that raises investment relative to baseline).

   Each household is the monopolistic supplier of a labor input j. Using (14) and its

analogs, total demand for type j input is:

                 Z    s                   Z   s                   Z   s                   ²            ³−φ

rebated to Home households in a lump-sum fashion.

where `t is per-capita total labor in the Home economy. Each household sets the nominal

wage for input type j accounting for (32). Following Kim (2000), there is sluggish wage

adjustment due to resource costs that are measured in terms of the total wage bill. The

adjustment cost is denoted ΓW,t , with:
                                                 ²                          ³2
                                            φW       Wt (j)/Wt−1 (j)
                               ΓW,t (j) ≡                            −1                                (33)
                                             2        Wt−1 /Wt−2

where φW ≥ 0. As was the case for prices above, wage adjustment costs are related to

changes in wage inflation relative to the past observed rate for the whole economy.

   Consumption spending is subject to a proportional transaction cost ΓS that depends on

the household’s money velocity v, where vt (j) ≡ Pt Ct (j)/Mt (j). Agents choose their stock

of real money holdings M/P optimally, so that at the margin shopping costs measured

in terms of foregone consumption are equal to the benefits from investing in yield-bearing

assets.15

   Home agents own all Home firms and there is no international trade in claims on firms’

profits. The variable Φ includes all profits accruing to Home households, plus all Home-

currency revenue from nominal and real adjustment rebated in a lump-sum way to all Home

households, plus revenue from financial intermediation, which is assumed to be provided by

Home firms exclusively.

   Finally, Home agents pay lump-sum (non-distortionary) net taxes N ET Tt (j) denomi-

nated in Home currency. Similar relations hold in the Foreign country, with the exception

of the intermediation frictions in the financial market.

   The representative Home household chooses bond and money holdings, capital and con-

sumption paths, and sets wages to maximize its expected lifetime utility (25) subject to (28)

 15 Following   Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2003), the particular functional form for the transaction cost is:

                                                          φS2    p

The above expression is the risk-adjusted uncovered interest parity equilibrium, accounting

for the fact that the return on lending to Foreign is reduced (and the cost of borrowing from

Foreign is increased) by the costs of intermediation ΓB .16 In a non-stochastic steady state,

the interest differential (1 + i) / (1 + i∗ ) is equal to the steady-state nominal depreciation

rate of the Home currency, and 1 + i = π/β, where π is the gross steady-state inflation rate

and 1/β is the steady-state gross real rate of interest (equal to the rate of time preference).

    The first-order conditions with respect to Mt (j), Kt+1 (j) and Wt (j) are standard. Real

money balances M/P are a positive function of consumption and a negative function of the

nominal interest rate. Capital accumulation is linked to the behavior of the real price of

capital R/P . In steady state, 1 + R/P is equal to the sum of the rate of time preference,

1/β, and the rate of capital depreciation, δ. Also, in steady state the real wage W/P is equal

to the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure, V 0 /U 0 , augmented

by the markup φ/ (φ − 1) which reflects monopoly power in the labor market.

    Optimization implies that households exhaust their intertemporal budget constraint: the

flow budget constraint (28) hold as equality and the transversality condition is satisfied:


             lim Et Dt,τ [Mτ −1 (j) + (1 + iτ ) Bτ (j) + (1 + i∗τ ) (1 − ΓB,τ ) Eτ Bτ∗ (j)] = 0     (36)

Similar results characterize the optimization problem of Foreign agent j ∗ .

Public spending falls on nontradable goods, both final and intermediate. In the model, GA is

per-capita public purchases of Home final goods (a random variable in our simulation), and

GN is per-capita public purchases of Home intermediate nontradable goods. Governments

finance public expenditure through net lump-sum taxes and seigniorage revenue. The budget

constraint of the Home government is:

where the left-hand side is the annualized interest rate, it is the lagged interest rate (with 0 <

In the expression above, Pt+τ /Pt+τ −4 is the year-on-year gross CPI inflation rate τ quarters

into the future, and Πt+τ is the year-on-year gross inflation target τ quarters into the future.

The term Θ is a function of a set zt of observable variables (output gap, exchange rate,

etc.) expressed as deviations from their targets, determining feedback rules for the nominal

interest rate.17

   Foreign variables are similarly characterized. Any steady-state discrepancy between i and

i∗ (thus, between π and π ∗ ) determines the steady-state rate of exchange rate depreciation

(for π > π ∗ ) or appreciation (for π < π ∗ ).

 17 In   a steady state with constant inflation target Π we have π = (Pt /Pt−4 )0.25 = Π0.25 = β (1 + it+1 ) =

3         Solution, calibration and model properties

3.1        Solution methods

To solve the model we first rely upon Newton-based techniques to obtain the steady-state

solution of the nonlinear model. The model is then linearized and we use the standard tools

that have been developed in DYNARE to study the properties of linear SDGE models.19

The particular technique used to evaluate the steady-state solution is a DAC (Divide-And-

Conquer) algorithm. The basic strategy behind DAC algorithms is to solve complex nonlin-

ear problems by breaking them down into a series of less complicated problems. The DAC

algorithm exploits the robustness and efficiency properties of Newton-based algorithms and

has been designed explicitly to deal with large models like GEM in which important non-

linearities arise directly from the model’s theoretical structure.20 The DAC algorithm is

used extensively to calibrate the initial steady-state baseline solution as well as to study the

nonlinear model’s properties in response to permanent shocks.21

    The steady-state solution strategy with the DAC algorithm involves two steps. First,

we start with a parameterization of the model that guarantees an “easy” solution with

a Newton-based algorithm. This will be the case when the model is approximately lin-

ear.22 Second, after obtaining an initial set of values for the endogenous variables, we then

  19 The    DYNARE toolbox derives the reduced-form representation of the model and then provides stan-

dard moments based on assumptions about the stochastic forcing processes. In addition, it automatically

provides stability and eigenvalue analysis, plots impulse response functions, and computes the contribution

of variability in the stochastic forcing processes to each endogenous variable.

  20 For   more details on the tools that have been developed to study SDGE models and how we obtain the

steady-state solution of the model see Juillard and Laxton (2003).

  21 The    permanent disinflation shocks reported below were derived using a Newton-based perfect-foresight

simulation algorithm available in portable TROLL. For the properties of these algorithms see Armstrong et

al. (1998) and Juillard et al. (1998).

  22 If   the model is exactly linear, Newton’s method is guaranteed to find the solution in one iteration if a




                                                       21
gradually adjust the parameters and exogenous variables towards their desired values in

sufficiently small steps that allow Newton’s method to find solutions extremely rapidly.23



3.2        Estimates of macroeconomic variability and calibration of the

           stochastic processes

While the model introduced in the previous section shares many characteristics with other

recent SDGE models, it also exhibits a number of relatively novel features (such as the

two-stage trade structure, the inclusion of nontradable goods, the presence of a distribution

sector) not unique to the model but still non-standard in the literature,24 and encompasses

a large number of sources of uncertainty. These features provide greater flexibility to fit the

data and simulate realistic interdependencies between a small “representative” transition

country (the “Home” country of our quarterly model) and the block of Euro countries (the

“Foreign” country), as we discuss in what follows.

    Table 1 provides some estimates of macroeconomic variability based on standard devia-

tions of detrended data for both the Euro area and the Czech Republic.25 As shown in the

table, real GDP has been about twice as volatile in the Czech Republic as it has been in

the Euro area. Table 1 also includes estimates of variability for consumption, investment,

government absorption, exports and imports. For the Euro area these measures suggest

solution exists. If the model is approximately linear, Newton’s method will find the true solution in a few

iterations provided the user has provided reasonable initial guesses for the endogenous variables.

  23 While    Newton’s method is not foolproof and does require some understanding of both the algorithm

and the model that is being studied, we have found that in practise it works extremely well for building

large nonlinear SDGE models like GEM.

  24 It   is worth noticing that most models of this genre have a single productive sector.

  25 With    the exception of the measures of inflation, interest rates and the ratios of net exports to GDP,

all of the measures in Table 1 have been detrended with the HP filter using a smoothness parameter of

1600. The measures for the Euro are based on data from 1970Q1 to 2001Q4 and the measures for the Czech

Republic are based on data from 1973Q1 to 2002Q4.

that imports are the most volatile component of real GDP expenditures (with a standard

deviation of 3.1 percent), followed by investment (2.7) and exports (2.4). The data also

indicate that, over the long sample period covered in our analysis, detrended consumption

expenditures and government absorption have displayed less variability than real GDP.26

    The measures for the Czech Republic tell a different story as regards the degree of vari-

ability in the transition countries. Indeed, since 1993 all expenditure components — includ-

ing consumption and government absorption — have been significantly more volatile than

aggregate real GDP. Also, fluctuations of investment relative to GDP have been significantly

wider in transition countries: investment has been 3.5 times more volatile than real GDP in

the Czech Republic compared to 2.7 times in the Euro area. Data for Hungary and Poland

present a similar pattern and suggest similar considerations about the nature of shocks to

these economies. All three transition countries have experienced increases of real investment

around 10-15 percentage points of GDP since 1993, and the current investment/GDP ratios

are well above the aggregate ratio in the Euro area.

    Measures of variability in interest rates and exchange rates are also included in Table

1. Variability in nominal interest rates has been quite high in these countries, mainly

reflecting the process of disinflation. The real effective exchange rate has approximately the

same degree of variability as the nominal effective exchange rate, a feature shared by many

other emerging and advanced economies. A fairly strong link between productivity and

the real exchange rate provides evidence in support of the Balassa-Samuleson hypothesis,27

 26 This   feature of lower variability in consumption expenditures in advanced economies such as the Euro

area is not robust to the sample period chosen. For example, over the 1990s several industrial countries

have recorded greater variability in consumption expenditures than in their real GDP measures.

 27 For   instance, Halpern and Wyplosz (2001) provide econometric evidence of a Balassa-Samuelson effect

in Eastern and European countries, according to which strong productivity growth in the tradables sector

results in higher real wages in both the tradables and nontradables sectors, a trend increase in the price

of nontradables relative to tradables, and a strong upward trend in CPI-based real exchange rates. The

original contributions are Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964).




                                                    23
although other driving factors, such as a shift in tastes in more advanced economies towards

the types of goods produced by transition countries, may have played a key role in affecting

real exchange rate movements.28

    A key stylized fact for the transition countries has been the enormous increase in the

degree of openness over the time period covered by Table 1, with both the export and import

ratios rising between 20 and 30 percentage points. The strong correlation between exports

and imports in the transition countries reflects several factors: higher investment in the

tradable goods sectors, as well as the effects of structural reforms and a production shift

toward higher-quality goods in demand from more advanced economies; the intensive use

of imported intermediate inputs in the production of tradable goods, as well as constraints

(capital controls) that may have limited the magnitude of current account imbalances in

these countries. The two-stage trade structure of our model helps rationalize these elements.

    In the light of the above considerations, the model encompasses several types of stochastic

shocks in both countries, as well as a “risk premium” shock ZB . The assumptions about the

shocks are reported in Table 2. These include shocks to productivity in all the sectors (ZT ,

ZN , ZO ) as well as shocks to aggregate investment (the depreciation rate ZI ), consumption

(the marginal utility of consumption ZU ), labor effort (the marginal disutility of labor effort

ZV ), government spending (GA ) and a preference shifter that affects the weight of tradable

goods in final good production (γ). The productivity shocks are perfectly correlated in all

sectors in each country. The distributions of the shocks have been calibrated to match some

of the moments reported in Table 1. For example, based on these assumptions the model

generates about twice as much variability in GDP in the Czech Republic than in the Euro

Area, and the absolute degrees of variability in GDP are consistent with our measures of

variability in the historical data. However, there are several important differences between

  28 Lipschitz,   Lane and Mourmouras (2002) suggest that the real exchange rate may have been very low

at the start of the transition because of insufficient market penetration and product reputation in Western

markets.




                                                    24
the model’s estimates of variability and the historical measures provided in Table 1.

   Relative to the historical data, the model generates considerably less variability in in-

flation (and interest rates). This is to be expected because a maintained assumption of

the analysis is that monetary policy is being governed by either an explicit (or implicit)

inflation-targeting regime, where interest rates are adjusted to provide an anchor for infla-

tion expectations. The base-case assumption for the calibration of the model assumes a

Generalized Taylor rule29 with an interest rate smoothing parameter of 0.5 and a weight

on inflation equal to one. As noted above, inflation and interest rate variability is consider-

ably lower than in the historical data because the latter were affected by the disinflationary

strategies pursued by the monetary authorities.

   Also, the model’s measure of the real exchange rate is considerably more volatile than the

historical data for the Czech republic. In fact, monetary policy regimes in place before the

adoption of inflation targeting in May 1997 were designed to explicitly reduce variability in

the exchange rate. The sample period is rather limited, but variability in the detrended real

exchange rate has been significantly higher since 1997. In GEM, shocks to the risk premium

induce significant variability in the components of aggregate demand and this may explain,

for example, why consumption variability can be significantly higher than variability in real

GDP in emerging economies.



3.3       Baseline parameters

We now discuss the key aspects of our base-case calibration. The Home country size s

relative to World is measured in terms of (relative) GDP. We set s at 5 percent. The

discount rate β (the reciprocal of the steady-state real interest rate) is similar in the two

countries. A typical yearly calibration for the real interest rate is 3-4 percent. We follow

Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (1999) and set β = 1.03−0.25 .

 29 See   Section 4 below.




                                              25
   The elasticities of substitution among differentiated intermediate goods, θ and θ∗ , are

evaluated to match existing estimates of steady-state price markups such as θ/ (θ − 1).

Martins, Scarpetta and Pilat (1996) estimate the average markup for manufacturing sectors

at around 1.2 in most OECD countries over the period 1980-92. Some authors rely on

lower estimates (for instance Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2002) choose 1.1), while other

authors30 suggest that a range between 1.2 and 1.7 may be plausible. We set θ/ (θ − 1) = 1.2

or θ = 6 in both countries.

   The elasticities of substitution among differentiated labor inputs, φ and φ∗ , are related

to the wage markup. According to Gali, Gertler and Lopez-Salido (2002), values between

1.15 and 1.4 for the sum of the steady-state wage and price markups can be thought of as

“falling within a plausible range”. However, higher values may be appropriate for the euro

area. For instance, Benigno and Thoenissen (2002) estimate φ at 5.1 for the UK, and 4.0

for the Euro area. Our parameterization takes φ = φ∗ = 4 in both countries.

   The choice of γ, ν, ν N , ν T and their Foreign equivalents highlight the differences in the

degrees of openness among the two economies on which our exercise is focused. We set

γ = .25, γ ∗ = .50, ν ∗ = ν ∗N = ν ∗T = .98, ν = ν N = .05, ν T = .02. Our calibration implies

that in the Home country the import share of downstream intermediate goods is equal

to 19.9 percent and the import share of upstream raw materials is equal to 17.4 percent,

roughly equally distributed among tradable and nontradable goods.31

   For the Foreign country, we assume that the weight of capital in production is the same in

both sectors that produce intermediate goods for final consumption and set a∗N = α∗T = 0.33.

We assume a relatively higher value for the weight of capital in the Home country based on

estimates provided by the Czech National Bank (aN = αT = 0.40).                  The weights of raw

materials are γ ∗N = γ ∗T = 0.3, γ N = 0.1, and γ T = 0.5. The production of raw materials and

 30 See   e.g. Morrison (1994) or Domowitz, Hubbard and Petersen (1988).

 31 These   import shares figures are based on recent estimates by the Czech National Bank of the trade

volumes between the Czech Republic and the Euro area.




                                                   26
semi-finished goods is assumed to use a non-reproducible resource (referred to as “land”)

in exogenous supply. In both countries the combined income share of capital and land is

assumed to be 0.3, with two-thirds of this income stream accruing to capital and one third

to land (αO = α∗O = 0.20 and γ O = γ ∗O = 0.10). These parameters values interact with

the import shares and generate steady-state labor shares in total GDP of about 65 percent

both in the Euro area and in the transition country.

   The elasticity of substitution between tradable goods and nontradable goods in final

good production ε is set at 1.1 in both countries. The elasticity of substitution between

intermediate exportables and importables in the Home country is also set at 1.1, but is

significantly higher in the Foreign country, where ε∗QM = 4. These choices are broadly in

line with other studies, although the range of plausible options is rather large. Empirical

studies of the price elasticity of import demand such as Hooper and Marquez (1995) report

a median value of 0.6 for Japan, Germany and UK. Gali and Monacelli (2002) choose ε = 1

as their baseline. Other studies (including Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2002), and Smets

and Wouters (2002a)) set the elasticity of substitution between Home and Foreign goods at

1.5.

   The elasticities of input substitution in the production of intermediate tradable goods

and nontradable goods and raw materials (ξ N , ξ T , ξ O ) are all set at .75 in both countries,

significantly below the customary unit elasticity associated with Cobb-Douglas production

functions. This choice allows us to simulate a lesser response of capital to interest rate

changes than would be the case under a Cobb-Douglas calibration. As opposed to labor

and capital, domestic and imported raw materials are highly substitutable in production.

Correspondingly, we set the elasticities (ξ ON , ξ OT ) at 3 in both countries.

   Burstein, Neves and Rebelo (2003) highlight the link between η and the wholesale/retail

margin and set the parameters η and η ∗ equal to 1. However, in our model the whole-

sale/retail margin is a function of other structural parameters such as the demand elas-




                                               27
ticities, and the choice of the distribution parameter η also affects the degree of exchange

rate pass-through. Our baseline is η = .2 in the Home country and η ∗ = .35 in the euro

area, implying ceteris paribus a higher degree of pass-through in the emerging economy,

consistent with empirical evidence.32

   The parameterization of the marginal utility of consumption relies on a combination

of high habit persistence (b = .95) and high intertemporal substitution (σ = 1/3). This

specification is unorthodox but certainly not unprecedented: for instance, Rotemberg and

Woodford (1998) adopt σ = 0.16 coupled with the assumption that households choose their

index of purchases Ct at time t − 2, thus making expenditures decisions predetermined with

respect to the timing of interest rate shocks. Experiments with alternative parameters are

conducted in sensitivity analysis.

   The marginal disutility of labor effort is V 0 = `ζ . Micro-data estimates of ζ consider

[3, 20] as a reasonable range. For instance, Gali, Gertler and Lopez-Salido (2002) take ζ = 5

as their baseline. But other authors, e.g. Kollmann (2001), choose ζ = 0 (linear disutility

of labor) following the real business cycle literature. Our benchmark parameterization is

ζ = 2.5 in both countries.

   Aggregate data suggest an annual depreciation rate for capital of about 10 percent, so

δ = δ ∗ = 0.025. The adjustment cost parameters for capital accumulation, φI1 and φI2 , are

chosen as to match the fact that the standard deviation of investment is typically observed

to be 3-4 times larger than the standard deviation of GDP.

   The transaction-cost parameters in the bond market are φB1 = 0.05 and φB2 = 0.1,

leading to a very slow reversion of the net asset position between Home and Foreign to

its steady-state value. This feature guarantees that in the short and medium term the

properties of the model — especially the degree of persistence of bond holdings and the

dynamics of the current account — are virtually unaffected by the asymptotic convergence

 32 See   Campa and Goldberg (2001).




                                             28
condition. Money demand plays a residual role in our model. We follow Schmitt-Grohe and

Uribe (2001) and set φS1 = 0.011 and φS2 = 0.075 in both countries, consistent with their

estimates of money demand in the US.

    As ratios of steady-state GDP, government spending GN is set at 10 percent and GA is

set at 5 percent in the two countries, broadly in line with the observed shares of government

consumption (assumed to fall exclusively on intermediate nontradable goods) and investment

(assumed to have the same composition of private investment).

    The base-case calibration of the model assumes a significant degree of structural infla-

tion persistence in wages and prices of the intermediate goods in both the tradable goods

and nontradable goods sectors (controlled by φN , φT , φW and their Foreign analogs). The

adjustment cost parameters that determine the degree of structural inflation persistence

were calibrated to be consistent with a sacrifice ratio of 2.1 in the Foreign country and 1.1

in the Home country.33 This assumption implies values for φN , φT , φW around 400 in the

Home country and twice this magnitude for the Foreign country. In addition, the base-case

calibration of the model assumes that export prices respond instantaneously to changes in

exchange rates (φM = φ∗M = 0): as discussed above, because of the presence of a distri-

bution sector there will be incomplete pass-through of the exchange rate to the prices of

intermediate goods even when export prices are fully flexible. Yet, in sensitivity analysis

we consider the effects of lowering short-run pass-though by increasing the adjustment costs

for export prices φM and φ∗M .

  33 The   sacrifice ratio is defined as the cumulative annual output gap that is required to permanently reduce

inflation by one percentage point.     Estimates of sacrifice ratios are typically smaller in emerging market

economies than in relatively closed economies like the Euro area. The estimate of a 1.1 sacrifice ratio for the

Home country was based on the results of a simulation conducted at the Czech National Bank, suggesting

that this is a plausible estimate of the transitory output costs of disinflation. A sacrifice ratio around 2.0

for the Foreign country is well within the range of estimates produced by other models of the Euro area.




                                                       29
3.4     Simulating the monetary transmission mechanism

As mentioned earlier, our model has been calibrated to mimic closely the empirical features

of the monetary transmission mechanism as estimated and relied upon for forecasting and

policy analysis by central banks. In most empirical models of the monetary transmission

mechanism, it is not possible for the monetary authority to change the target rate of inflation

without having significant short-run effects on real variables in the economy. In addition,

in the same empirically-based estimates of the monetary transmission mechanism, hikes in

interest rates do not usually result in instantaneous jumps in real activity, but require several

quarters to work their effects through the economy. Similar features, both qualitatively and

quantitatively, appear in our simulations.

   To illustrate differences and similarities between the two economies of our model, in

this section we study the dynamic adjustment patterns in response to two types of policy

shocks: a permanent one-percentage point disinflation shock, and a 100 basis point hike in

the short-term policy rate.


3.4.1   Permanent reduction in the target rate of inflation


Figure 2 reports the results of an experiment where the inflation target in the Foreign country

is reduced permanently by 1 percentage point. In each panel, the solid line refers to the

Home country and the dashed line refers to the Foreign country. As can be seen in the two

top panels of Figure 2, the presence of stickiness in the inflation process requires an increase

in the nominal interest rate and leads to an appreciation of the real exchange rate. This

results in a hump-shaped profile for real GDP that troughs after about four quarters, when

monetary conditions ease to prevent an undershooting of the new inflation target. Since the

Foreign country’s external trade is relatively small (our two-country setup ignores any trade

linkages between the Euro area and the rest of the world outside the emerging country),

the response of real GDP is mainly determined by the response of aggregate consumption




                                               30
and investment expenditures. The response of investment to this type of aggregate demand

shock is approximately three times the response of aggregate GDP, whereas consumption

responds slightly less than GDP over the cycle.

    The cumulative quarterly effect on the output gap in the Foreign country is 8.5, imply-

ing a sacrifice ratio of around 2.1, consistent with a fairly large body of empirical evidence

according to which disinflation results in significant output costs in the short run.34 The

appreciation of the real exchange rate in the Foreign country results in a loss in competi-

tiveness and a deterioration in real exports of the Foreign country. Note, that because the

Home country has significant trade linkages with the Foreign country, the overall spillover

effects are contractionary on both investment and consumption in the Home country.

    When conducting the same type of experiment in the Home country, real GDP in the

Home country declines by a similar amount as real GDP in the Foreign country when

the shock originates in the Foreign country, but in this case the cycle is significantly less

protracted. Indeed, in this experiment the quarterly output gap of the Home country

cumulates to 4.5 percent, implying a sacrifice ratio of 1.1. As the Home country is small,

the Home shock has no discernible effect on the levels of consumption and investment in the

Foreign country.35

    Figure 3 compares our results for a disinflation shock in the Home country with the

same experiment conducted on the Czech National Bank’s Quarterly Projection Model

(CNB-QPM ). In the panels of Figure 3, the solid line refers to the Home country as

considered in GEM, while the dashed line refers now to the Home country as considered

in CNB-QPM.36 To make the results more easily comparable across models, the interest

  34 Micro-founded   models like GEM also feature interesting asymmetries where the temporary output gains

associated with inflating are actually less than the temporary output losses associated with disinflation.

  35 These   results as well as other sensitivity analysis are available upon request from the authors.

  36 We   thank Jan Vlcek and his colleagues at the CNB for supplying us with these simulation results from

CNB-QPM.




                                                       31
rate response in GEM has been tuned to equal the response from CNB-QPM for the first

three-quarters of the simulation horizon. The bottom lower panels compare the responses

of real GDP and CPI inflation. As Figure 3 shows, the GEM ’s theory-based dynamics

fits quite well the reduced-form impulse responses at the CNB, and provides a satisfactory

representation of the monetary transmission mechanism as embedded in the tools for policy

evaluation currently in use in the Czech Republic.37 Notice that the responses of real GDP

and inflation occur slightly earlier in GEM because expenditure choices are not subject

to any decision lags. The introduction of predetermined expenditure38 would be necessary

in GEM to explain the type of dynamics that are quite common in empirically-motivated

reduced-form models.



3.5       Dynamic effects of a temporary interest rate hike

Table 3 reports the responses of key macro variables in our model to a 1-year hike in

the policy rate in the Foreign country, followed by reversal to the base-case Taylor rule.

Fagan, Henry and Mestre (2001) consider the same experiment by using the ECB’s Area-

Wide Model (AWM ), whose empirical apparatus does not build upon a choice-theoretic

structural model. For comparison purposes, Table 3 also reports their estimates. As shown

in the Table, the responses for many aggregates display a very similar profile and there are

only three noteworthy exceptions.

   First, the response of investment is significantly longer-lived in AWM, reflecting signif-

icant accelerator effects that are not uncommon in empirical reduced-form models of the

monetary transmission mechanism. Such effects may be difficult to mimic in choice-theoretic

models of the business cycle and indeed may reflect a misattribution of the role of supply

 37 In   future versions of GEM, the strategy of estimation will consider information provided by models like

CNB-QPM as priors, and then use Bayesian techniques to adjust these priors according to available data.

See Smets and Wouters (2002b) for an application of this approach to an SDGE model of the Euro area.

 38 See   Woodford (2002) for a textbook treatment.




                                                      32
shocks in reduced-form models that cause more persistent movements in investment, but

this remains an issue that needs to be addressed in future research.

    The second difference is the response of the exchange rate. In GEM the exchange rate

jumps more in the very short run than it does in AWM, reflecting rational behavior by

forward-looking market participants as opposed to the ad-hoc treatment of expectations in

empirical models. The third difference is the response of imports, which is considerably

weaker in GEM than in AWM. This is not a surprise: the two-country GEM can only

account for bilateral trade between the small and large economies, while the simulation of

plausible imports dynamics in the Euro would require an analytical framework in which

trade linkages with third markets play a key role.39




4         Monetary policy rules

4.1        Taylor rules and Inflation-Forecast-Based rules

Over the last decade, the literature on the performance of interest rate rules in macroeco-

nomic models has principally focused on two types of rules, both extensively used in research

and policy analysis in central banks. The first one is universally referred to as the Taylor

rule, following the seminal contribution by Taylor (1993) in which a simple interest rate re-

action function — which depended on contemporaneous values for inflation and the output

gap — provided a useful paradigm for thinking about monetary policy issues.40 The second

type of monetary policy rule has come to be known as an Inflation-Forecast-Based (IFB)

  39 A    potentially problematic aspect that may deserve further study is the assumption in GEM that interest-

rate sensitive demand components such as investment expenditures have the same import propensity of

less-interest rate sensitive components. This extension may be incorporated into future versions of the

model.

  40 In   simulation experiments with policy rules it is usually assumed that the policymaker knows the

contemporaneous values for inflation and the output gap, although in the real world even these variables

need to be estimated on the basis of available information.



                                                       33
rule, although IFB rules are simply more “forward-looking” versions of the Taylor rule, as

the short-term policy rate is assumed to respond to a forecast of future inflation rather than

the contemporaneous level of inflation.41

   Recalling expression (38) above, the specific forms of the Taylor and IFB rules considered

in this paper can be nested into our general rule once we take into account the output gap.

We therefore define Θ (zt ) = ω 2 ygapt in equation (38), where ω 2 ≥ 0 and the output gap

ygap is defined as the deviation of real GDP from the steady-state level implied by the

model. Note that, when ω 1 , ω 2 = 0.5, and ω i and τ are set to zero, expression (38) becomes

the original Taylor (1993) rule. Because the original contribution did not allow for inertia

in the interest rate, we will refer to Taylor rules with inertia (ω i > 0) as Generalized Taylor

rules, or simply GT rules. By contrast, when τ > 0 we will refer to the rule as an IFB rule,

as the interest rate in this case depends on a forecast of the year-on-year inflation rate τ

quarters into the future.

   Taylor-style rules shed light on the fundamental role of monetary policy under a flexible

exchange rate regime, which is to adjust the policy rate in response to movements in inflation

as to provide an anchor for inflation and inflation expectations. Specifically, in a class of

linear rational expectations models the asymptotic response of the policy rate with respect

to inflation has to be greater than one for these models to be saddle-point stable, and

response coefficients below one are associated with poor macroeconomic performance. This

stability property is sometimes referred to as the Taylor principle.42 In this paper we will

be relying upon linearized versions of GEM that satisfy the Taylor principle. Given our

 41 Based   on some initial work at the Bank of Canada in the early 1990s, IFB rules have been used

extensively in central banks that have implemented inflation-targeting frameworks — see Laxton, Rose and

Tetlow (1993) and Black, Macklem and Rose (1997). For a critique of IFB rules and Taylor rules as well as

an alternative framework see Svensson (2003) and Svensson and Woodford (2003).

 42 See   McCallum (2002) and Woodford (1999).




                                                   34
specification, a necessary and sufficient condition is that ω 1 > 0.43

    A fairly comprehensive study by Levin, Wieland and Williams (2001) (hereinafter LWW)

examined the robustness of IFB rules in five macroeconomic models of the US economy. The

basic conclusion of their analysis was that IFB rules should respond to a one-year-ahead

forecast of inflation and the current output gap, and incorporate a substantial degree of

policy inertia. Indeed, the degree of inertia in the models that they studied was estimated

to be approximately 1, so LWW went on to formulate a very simple IFB rule of the following

form:
                                                       ´            µ
                             4
                                  h
                                            4
                                                i        Pt+4
                 (1 + it+1 ) − 1 = (1 + it ) − 1 + 0.4        − Πt+4 + 0.4 (ygapt )                            (47)
                                                          Pt

We will refer to this simple rule as the LWW rule. A potentially important advantage of

the LWW rule is that it does not depend on any direct measure of the equilibrium real

interest rate, which could be a significant advantage for emerging economies that typically

experience large real interest rate fluctuations.44



4.2        Comparing optimally calibrated GT and IFB rules for the Home

           country

Table 4 reports the results for GT rules in the Home country, optimally calibrated to min-

imize a standard loss function Λ that depends on the unconditional variances of inflation,

  43 The   stability conditions in nonlinear models are more complicated.          For example, using a nonlinear

model, Isard and Laxton (1999) show that the economy may enter the region of instability if the weight

on the output gap is too high relative to the weight on inflation, even if the weight on inflation is greater

than one. The emphasis on the Taylor rule and the Taylor principle has been instrumental in improving the

methodology that is used to build models for monetary policy analysis. For example, it was not uncommon

even as late as the 1980s to find models in policy institutions that could be simulated with exogenous interest

rates. Such models by definition did not satisfy the Taylor principle.

  44 To   the extent that measures of the equilibrium real interest rate are useful for forecasting future inflation,

or even measuring the output gap, it is not clear whether problems associated with uncertainty in the

equilibrium real interest rate can be overcome entirely by the simple LWW rule.




                                                          35
output gap, and the first difference of interest rates.45 In the loss function the weight on

inflation variability is 1 and the weight on interest rate variability (Λi ) is 0.5. The four rows

in Table 4 report estimates that are based on varying the weight on the output gap (Λygap )

in the objective function from 0.5 to 2.0 in increments of 0.5. As can be seen in the Table,

optimally calibrated GT rules result in significant inertia in the policy rate (estimates of ω i

range from 0.91 to 0.93) and plausible coefficients on inflation and the output gap. Relative

to the Taylor (1993) rule and the LWW rule, the main difference is that these rules place a

significantly higher weight on inflation vis-à-vis the output gap.

   Table 5 repeats the same exercise for an IFB rule that assumes that the policy rate

depends on the one-year-ahead forecast of future inflation — that is, τ = 4 in equation (38)

above. These results are interesting for a number of reasons. First, as in the LWW rule,

the parameter on the lagged interest rate term approaches its upper bound of 1.0. Second,

and unlike the LWW rule, which has equal weights on both inflation and output, this

rule suggests a considerably higher weight on the inflation forecast (the values of ω 1 range

from 1.78 to 1.92) than the output gap (the values of ω 2 range from 0.23 to 0.55). Third,

the outcomes for inflation and output variability do not vary significantly over different

specifications of preferences, and in all cases the model generates almost the same variability

for inflation as it does for output. The only significant difference is that a higher weight

on output variability in the objective function (Λygap ) results in a slightly higher level of

interest rate variability — which rises from 0.76 to 0.84 when Λygap rises from 0.5 to 2.0.

   Comparing the values of the loss functions in Table 4 and Table 5, it can be seen that

the IFB rule strictly dominates the GT rule46 and the difference becomes wider the larger

the weight that is placed on output variability in the objective function. However, as can

be seen in the Tables, the IFB rule does not offer a substantial improvement over the GT

 45 The    loss function is Λ = σ 2(Pt /P       + Λygap σ 2(ygap) + Λi σ 2(i           .

 46 This   result is consistent with the findings of Batini, Harrison and Millard (2001).

rule when one examines the underlying improvement in macro variability. This result is

consistent with other studies that find that IFB rules offer a fairly small improvement over

GT rules in linearized models of the economy.47



4.3        Taylor efficiency frontiers

Figure 4 summarizes the main results of our paper. The curves plot the trade-off between

output and inflation variability in both the Home and Foreign countries, based on the

GT rule that allows for interest rate smoothing. To make the trade-offs plausible and

comparable to other studies, they have been constructed based on an assumption that the

degree of interest rate variability (measured by the standard deviation of it+1 − it ) is less

than some critical level σ ∆i . We set the value for σ ∆i equal to 0.8 because this is roughly

consistent with the measures reported in Tables 4 and 5 under different assumptions about

preferences.48 The curves were generated by choosing the most efficient pairs of standard

deviations for inflation and output by searching over thousands of combinations of ω i , ω 1

and ω 2 that were varied in increments of 0.01.

    The implications of openness can be seen clearly in Figure 4. Moving upward and

eastward from the origin, Figure 4 first plots the Taylor frontier for the Foreign country,

under our base-case set of assumptions for the distributions of the disturbance terms reported

in Table 2. Next, we find the Taylor frontier for the Foreign country under the assumption

that the distributions of the shocks is the same as in the Home country.49 Finally we plot

  47 See   for example Levin, Wieland and Williams (2001) and Taylor (2000). However, IFB rules have been

found to perform significantly better than Taylor rules in the presence of significant nonlinearities — see

Isard, Laxton and Eliasson (1999).

  48 This   measure for interest rate variability is also roughly consistent with the degree of variability in

short-term interest rates in countries that have been successful in implementing either explicit or implicit

inflation targeting strategies.

  49 We    discuss these results in Section 4.4.

the Taylor frontier for the Home country. Because the Foreign country is assumed to be

relatively closed and exposed to smaller disturbances than the Home country, it is possible

for the GT rule to deliver much lower variability in both output and inflation in the Foreign

country than in the Home country.


4.3.1   Results for the relatively-closed Foreign country


The results reported in Figure 4 are consistent with previous studies of the robustness of

the LWW rule in different models of the US economy. First, the generalized Taylor rule

delivers low variability in both inflation and output. Second, and more importantly, the

simple LWW rule lies very close to the efficiency frontier of our economy. This provides

another confirmation that a simple IFB rule which places a weight of 0.4 on both inflation

and output is robust across simulation models of a relatively closed economy, not necessarily

confined to the US case.

   Figure 4 also shows the values for output and inflation variability in the Foreign country

based on the original Taylor (1993) rule. As can be seen in the Figure, the Taylor rule

lies further away from the efficiency frontier than the LWW rule. Because the original

Taylor (1993) rule did not include interest rate smoothing, the distance between the point

associated with the original Taylor (1993) rule and the frontier can be interpreted as the

benefits that can be derived by generating optimal inertia in the policy rate, as discussed

by Woodford (1999).


4.3.2   Results for the relatively-open Home country


We can now assess how rules designed for large and relatively closed economies perform

in a small and relatively open economy. The first striking result is that both the original

Taylor (1993) rule and the LWW rule appear to be consistent with policy preferences that

place a very high weight on stabilizing output relative to inflation. Second, in this case the

LWW rule strictly dominates the Taylor (1993) rule. In fact, the LWW rule lies within the



                                             38
efficiency frontier that is generated on the basis of a generalized Taylor rule that allows for

inertia in the policy rate.

    Figure 4 also includes another IFB rule with ω i = 1, where the weights on output and

inflation have been optimized to minimize a standard loss function Λ that places equal

weights of 1 on both output and inflation variability and a weight of 1/2 on interest rate

variability (see row (2) of Table 5). We refer to this specification as the “optimized” LWW

rule. Relative to the original LWW rule, this calibration process produces a smaller weight

on the output gap (0.18) and a much larger weight on the deviation of one-year-ahead

inflation from target (1.87). According to the optimized LWW rule, the one-year-ahead

inflation forecast already embodies sufficient information about the output gap, making the

output gap less important as a separate argument in the reaction function. Figure 4 shows

that the optimized LWW rule yields a significantly better macroeconomic performance than

GT rules.50

    One obvious question remains to be answered before moving to the sensitivity analysis.

If rules designed for relatively closed economies do not result in good macroeconomic perfor-

mance in small, open economies, how do rules designed for small open economies perform in

relatively closed economies? Point A in Figure 4 provides a preliminary answer to this ques-

tion. It takes the LWW rule that has been optimized for the Home country and asks how

it might perform in a relatively closed economy such as the Foreign country of our model.

As can be seen in the Figure, the rule is efficient in the sense that it lies along the efficiency

frontier, but the aggressive response of this rule to inflation would only be consistent with

preferences that place a high weight on inflation variability relative to variability in output.

  50 Similar   results characterize other studies of policy rules in emerging markets. For instance, in their

model of the Argentinian economy Ghironi and Rebucci (2002) show that, within the class of GT rules,

rules that place a large coefficient on inflation perform better.

4.4     Some sensitivity analysis

4.4.1   What accounts for a less favorable trade-off in the small open economy?


To understand what accounts for the less favorable trade-off in the relatively open economy

we regenerated the efficiency frontier for the relatively closed Foreign economy after imposing

the same assumptions on the stochastic disturbances that we used in the calibration of the

Home country. As can be seen in Figure 4, this shifts the efficiency frontier for the relatively

closed economy about two thirds of the distance toward the efficiency frontier derived for the

Czech Republic. The remaining gap reflects openness, or more precisely the larger effects

that “risk premium” financial shocks have on the Czech Republic as well as the effects of

disturbances that originate in the Euro area and are transmitted to the Czech Republic

through trade and macroeconomic linkages.


4.4.2   Different assumptions about the sensitivity of consumption to interest

        rate changes


While our base-case assumptions for the intertemporal elasticity of substitution σ and habit

persistence b help to match closely the properties of reduced-form, empirically-based models

of the monetary transmission mechanism, they are non-standard in the relevant literature,

which usually assumes an intertemporal elasticity of substitution close to one and signifi-

cantly lower habit persistence. The calculations reported in Table 4 were recomputed after

raising σ from 1/3 to 0.99 and reducing the habit persistence parameter b from 0.95 to

0.85. Our results were not significantly affected by these changes. On balance, the new

parameterization reduces the lags in the monetary transmission mechanism and makes it

easier for monetary policy to deliver lower variability in output.




                                              40
4.4.3    Is there a role for the exchange rate in monetary policy rules?


Several experiments were performed adding measures of exchange rate depreciation to the

set zt in (38), to evaluate if policy responses to exchange rate movements are able to

improve macroeconomic performance as measured by the loss functions in Tables 4 and

5. Thus far, the results suggest that there is a very small role for the exchange rate to

play in the linearized version of GEM even when there are significant adjustment costs to

export prices and short-run pass-through is relatively low. It may even be counterproductive

for monetary policy to react strongly to movements in the exchange rate, the information

content of which is already captured by either current or expected CPI inflation. These

results are prima facie consistent with other recent studies that have attempted to identify

a role for the exchange rate in reaction functions, but more work needs to be done to assess

whether or not this result is robust under alternative assumptions about the structure of

the economy and the form of the loss function that is used to evaluate alternative monetary

policy rules.




5       Conclusion

We have found that rules that perform well in models of the US economy also perform well

in our simulation model of a relatively closed economy. But some of these rules — such as

the original Taylor (1993) rule and the simple LWW rule — may be inefficient when they are

applied to small open economies because they respond too weakly to forecasts of inflation

and too strongly to movements in the output gap. However, we have shown that a simple

modified LWW rule that responds more strongly to the forecast of inflation may produce

better macroeconomic performance in small, open, emerging economies.

    A number of extensions and refinements are left to future research. First, it may be

worthwhile to study the implications of alternative measures of the output gap based on

a flexible-price measure of potential output. Second, to be consistent with the historical


                                            41
data, our model was calibrated to account for high degrees of structural persistence in the

inflation process. However, as argued by Erceg and Levin (2001), estimates of inflation

persistence based on historical data, which cover periods of large disinflations, may overes-

timate the degree of structural inflation persistence, as the observed inflation inertia may

stem partly from a slow adaptation of expectations to the shift from a high to a low infla-

tion regime. Therefore, further sensitivity analysis should consider this issue explicitly by

studying alternative calibrations with significantly lower structural inflation persistence.

   Finally, the development of perturbation methods has progressed sufficiently that formal

welfare analysis on the non-linear version of the model, regardless of its analytical complex-

ity, may soon become feasible. Looking forward to these developments, this study may

provide a useful benchmark to compare differences between formal welfare analysis, based

on the non-linear version of the model, and the more conventional analysis presented here,

based on a simple loss function and the linearized version of the model.
