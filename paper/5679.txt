       Wage subsidies to private employers have often been proposed by economists as a potentially

flexible and efficient method to improve the earnings and employment of low-wage workers. This

paper lays out the basic economics of wage subsidies; examines issues arising in the design of

alternative forms of wage subsidies; and reviews evidence on the effectiveness of recent U.S. wage

subsidy programs and demonstration projects. Wage subsidies to employers to hire disadvantaged

workers appear to modestly raise the demand for labor for those workers. Stand-alone wage

subsidies (or employment tax credits) that are highly targeted on very specific groups (such as

welfare recipients) appear to have low utilization rates and may (in some cases) stigmatize the

targeted group. But new evidence based on an examination of changes in eligibility rales for the

Targeted Jobs Tax Credit, the major U.S, wage subsidy program for the economically disadvantaged

from 1979 to 1994, suggests modest positive employment effects of the TJTC on economically

disadvantaged young adults, Policies combining wage subsidies with job development, training, and

job search assistance efforts appear to have been somewhat successful in improving the employment

and earnings of specific targeted disadvantaged groups.

I. INTRODUCTION

        Growing disparities in the economic fortunes of American families over the past

twenty years have been associated with large increases in wage in~uality and rising gaps in

labor market outcomes between more- and less-skilled workers.      The real earnings of many

groups of workers, particularly less-educated young men, have fallen since the early 1970s.

Much research suggests that a major contributor to these changes has ban a substantial

decline in the relative demand for the less-educated and those doing more routinized tasks

compared to the relative supply of such workers (e. g., Bound and Johnson, 1992; Katz and

Murphy, 1992). The shift in relative demand against the less-skilled appears to be driven by

both skill-biased technological change--the computer revolution--and the increased

internationalization of economic activity. While much debate exists concerning the relative

importance of different underlying causes of the decline in demand for the less-skilled, the

underlying trends do not appear likely to quickly reverse themselves.       In summary,

the U.S. labor market has experienced a sustained twist against disadvantaged workers--those

with limited education or skills and)or from impoverished families and neighborhoods--that

has greatly diminished their earnings prospects.

       Market incentives for increased educational investments and skill upgrading can play

some role in alleviating growing wage inequality. Evidence from U.S. time series and cross-

country studies strongly suggest that rapid expansions of the supply of more educated

workers narrow earnings differentials and improve the labor market position of the less-

skilled (Freeman and Katz, 1994). But the process of supply adjustment can take many

years, and many disadvantaged individuals face financial and informational barriers to

pursuing further education and training and are likely to be left behind.
                                                  2

       This prospect motivates an examination of policies that dd       directly with the market

shifts adversely impacting less-skilled workers by improving their skills and/or stimulating

employment opportunities through direct job creation in the public sector or the subsidization

of their employment in the private sector. Much recent work has evaluated the effectiveness

of alternative education and training policies for improving the labor market prospects of the

disadvantaged.     Increased access to schooling at mainstream educational institutions (high

schools, community colleges, and universities) for those from low-income families appear to

have a reasonably high payoff (Card, 1994).       Public sector-sponsored training programs

have a mixed record with strong positive returns for disadvantaged adults (particularly adult

women) and a more disappointing results in evaluations of programs for disadvantaged out-

of-school youths (Heckman, Roselius, and Smith, 1993; Katz, 1994; and Wnde,             1995).

       Much less recent research attention has focused on micro demand-side policies to

offset the decline in demand for the less-skilled. Wage subsidies to private employers have

often been proposed by economists as a relatively flexible and efficient method to improve

the earnings and employment of the less-skilled,      In a wage subsidy program, job creation

and hiring decisions remain in the hands of private firms, but the cost is partially borne by

government.      Firms are likely to respond to wage subsidies by increasing their utilization of

workers in the targeted population.     The extent to which this response raises the wages and

employment of the targeted group and has impacts on non-subsidized workers is an empirical

question that depends on the relevant labor demand and supply parameters as well as

administrative aspects of the design of the subsidy program.     The U.S. has experimented

with a variety of tax credit programs to encourage firms to change their hiring patterns in the
                                               3

past and several demonstration projects using variants of wage subsidies have been evaluated.

Most other OECD nations also have experience with private sector employment subsidies.

       In this paper, I first lay out briefly the basic economics of wage subsidies and issues

arising in the design of alternative forms of wage subsidies. I then review the available

evidence on the effectiveness of private sector wage subsidies as a tool to improve the labor

market prospects of less-skilled workers and provide some new evidence on the employment

effects of the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit, a targeted wage subsidy program that operated in the

United States from 1979 to 1994. Finally I derive lessons for policy-design from past

experience with wage subsidies. 1

       I conclude that there exists much uncertainty concerning the likely effects of a general

graduated wage subsidy for low-wage or low-skill workers, but the existing evidence

suggests it is a policy worthy of some further experimentation.   Stand-alone wage subsidies

(or employment tax credits) that are highly targeted on very specific socioeconomic groups

(such as welfare recipients or ex-convicts) appear to be somewhat less-effective than more

broadly targeted subsidies and may (in some cases) stigmatize the targeted group. Policies

using an intermediary (a public employment agency, nonprofit training organization, etc. )

that combine job development, job search assistance, training, and wage (or employment)

subsidies appear more successful for targeting on specific disadvantaged groups.



II. THE ECONOMICS AND DESIGN OF WAGE SUBSIDIES

       The basic idea behind (employer-side) wage subsidies is to reduce the costs to

employers of employing the targeted group of workers thereby stimulating demand for these
                                               4

workers and raising their employment rates and earnings. A substantial literature has

examined the analytics of the impacts of wage subsidies on employment and wages in both

standard competitive labor market models and in models with various types of wage rigidities

or other market imperfections that generate structural unemployment (e.g., Kaldor, 1936;

Hamermesh, 1978; Phelps, 1994b; and Snower, 1994). Phelps (1994a) makes a particularly

strong case for wage subsidies for low-wage workers based on equity considerations; the

social costs of inefficiently high unemployment; and the possible negative spillover effects of

poor labor market performance by the disadvantaged on their neighbors, children, and

younger siblings.



The Desi~n of Wape Subsidies

       Employer-side wage subsidies (programs that subsidize efforts to create jobs in the

private sector) can take a variety of forms (Hamermesh, 1978; OECD, 1982). A wage

subsidy can be applied to all employment, to net changes in employment (a marginal or

incremental employment subsidy), or to gross flows into employment arising from new hires

or layoffs. Subsidies based on toti employment (or, often in practice, on the total wage bill)

apply during the entire time a workers is employed with a firm and create “windfalls” to

employers on that part of employment that would exist in the absence of the subsidy. True

marginal employment subsidies could eliminate these windfalls (and reduce the net costs of

job creation/wage increases) but such a policy would require information on what

employment levels would be in the absence of the subsidy. Actual incremental employment

subsidies can somewhat reduce windfalls by providing subsidies only for employment growth
                                                5

beyond some base employment level, but such policies can create perverse incentives for

employment variation and changes in organizational form and can become administratively

quite complex. Many OECD wage subsidy programs are hiring subsidies that provide

temporary wage subsidies for selected groups of new hires. Such programs can generate

incentives for higher turnover and disproportionately benefit sectors with high turnover and

more variable employment. Some U.S. programs have attempted to mitigate these incentives

by barring employers who systematically fail to retain subsidized workers.    Some OECD

nations have attempted to provide subsidies to “struggling” firms to avert layoffs, but such

policies can create moral hazard problems with firms’ threatening layoffs to gain a subsidy.

       Wage subsidies can also be either general or categorical.   Categorical subsidy

(targeted wage subsidies) are paid on the employment or hiring of only certain specific

categories of workers (e. g., economically disadvantaged youth, public assistance recipients,

the disabled, dislocated workers, or the long-term unemployed).    Targeted wage subsidies are

often motivated by desires to affect the composition of employment and aim program benefits

at specific groups of workers whose employment opportunities are viewed as particularly in

need of improvement.    But targeting on the basis of sociodemographic categories of which

employers may have negative views may serve to stigmatize participating job-seekers and

limit employer interest in the program.   If categorical subsidies are successful in expanding

employment opportunities for target group members, one must worry about the horizontal

equity of potentially displacing workers with similar labor market prospects who are not

eligible for the program.   General wage subsidies with caps on the amount of subsidy per

worker or with a graduated structure may be able to increase the incentives for employing
                                                6

low-wage workers without the stigmatizing potential of categorical programs.

       Two other considerations in the design of wage subsidies are the geographic extent of

the subsidies and the administrative operation of the program,    Wage subsidies can either

operate nationally or be place-based programs with eligibility restricted to certain regions or

local labor markets. Place-based targeting based on location of residence may be less

stigmatizing than targeting on the basis of demographic groups. Place-based subsidies may

largely serve to redistribute employment levels across areas with small impacts on aggregate

employment opportunities for the targeted groups if firm and/or worker migration is

significant in response to labor market incentives.   Subsidies can also be run through the tax

system (employment tax credits as in the New Jobs Tax Credit and the Targeted Jobs Tax

Credit) which can reduce administrative burdens but only provide incentives to firms with

positive tax liabilities (although they can be designed with generous loss carryovers), or they

can be directly paid to employers (which may require new information requirements and an

administering agency).

       In a simple Coasian world without transaction costs or imperfwt information, it

should not matter whether wage subsidies are provided to employers or equivalent earnings

supplements provided to workers. There are many reasons why the side of the market in

which the subsidy is provided could matter in practice.   For example, employee earnings

supplements (such as the Mned     Income Tax Credit) may allow better targeting on the basis

of family income without the stigma of sociodemographic targeting in categorical employer

subsidies. When wages are rigid because of a binding minimum wage law or other

impediments to wage adjustment, employ~-side wage supplements will be more effective in
                                                7

raising take-home earnings and employer-side subsidies more effmtive at increasing

employment.    The choice of the side of the market to place a subsidy may depend on the

immediate deeision-maker one is trying to affect. Employer-side subsidies hiring subsidies

for targeted groups are more likely to be salient and affect their recruiting patterns towards

those groups, while employee-side wage supplements or re-employment bonuses may have a

greater affect on worker search behavior.



The SimDle (Partial- ~uilibrium)      Analvtics of Wage Subsidies

       An employer-side wage subsidy for low-wage workers shifts out the labor demand

curve for low-wage workers.      In a situation of structural unemployment in which the

effective supply of labor is infinitely elastic (Figure 1A), a (proportional) wage subsidy (s)

will not affect the wages of but will expand the employment of low-wage workers in

proportion to the (absolute value of the) elasticity of labor demand for low-wage workers.

More generally the impact on wages and employment of the targeted group depends on the

effmtive wage elasticities of labor demand and labor supply for the group (Figure lB). The

impact of a proportional wage subsidy (s) for low-wage workers on the employment (L) and

wages (W) of low-wage workers starting from a point of zero subsidy is given by the

standard formulas:



(1)            dlnL   =     nE
                ds         q+E



(2)            dlnW =     A
                 ds       q+E
                                                  8


where q is the absolute value of the labor demand elasticity for low-wage labor and ~ is the

effective labor supply elasticity, Thus the greater is the effective labor supply elasticity, the

greater will be the effmt of a wage subsidy on employment and the smaller the effect on

wages. More elastic labor demand implies larger wage and employment effects of a subsidy.

The impact of an actual wage subsidy will depend not only on the relevant labor supply and

demand parameters but also on design issues such as its administrative costs to utilize,

whether the subsidy stigmatizes eligible groups, and the extent to which employers are aware

of the program.

        Much uncertainty exists concerning the magnitude of the relevant labor supply and

labor demand elasticities for quantitatively assessing the likely impact of a wage subsidy for

low-wage or low-skilled workers in the U.S. labor market. Most research suggests at least

fairly substitial    positive labor supply elasticities for low-wage workers. Juhn, Murphy, and

Topel (1991) interpret the decline in employment rates for low-wage adult U.S. males in the

1980s as reflecting a downward shift in labor demand for less-skilled workers combined with

a stable labor supply curve. Their estimates (based on both cross-section and time-series

variation) of the gross wage elasticity of the labor supply of low-wage men (those in the

bottom quintile of the wage distribution) range from 0.3 to 0.4. Many studies conclude that

labor supply elasticities for teenagers and low-wage women are likely to be at least as large

as these estimates for low-wage men, although Moffitt (1992) argues for lower wage

elasticities of around 0.2 for single female household heads.

        Even less consensus exists concerning the relevant labor demand elasticity for low-

wage workers.       The empirical labor demand literature that attempts to estimate labor demand
                                               9

elasticities using “exogenous” supply shifts concludes that own-wage elasticities are

particularly high for less-skilled workers in the range of -0.5 or even greater in magnitude

(Hamermesh, 1993). But much of the literature estimating the impact of minimum wages on

low-wage (particularly teenage) employment suggests small to negligible adverse employment

impacts that could be interpreted as implying the demand for low-wage labor is quite

inelastic (Card and Krueger, 1995). One possible reconciliation of these findings is the

“dissipation effect” of estimated minimum wage effects. Since many t=nage workers do not

have their wages changed by a minimum wage increase, the percentage increase in the toti

labor costs of employing teenagers rises by less than the percentage increase in the minimum

wage. Thus standard elasticities of a minimum wage increase on teenage employment-

population ratios of -0.05 to -0.20 could be consistent with labor demand elasticities for

teenagers in the -0.10 to -0.60 range (since Card and Krueger (1995) estimates suggest that

average teenage wages appear to rise proportionately by a third to a half as much as

increases in the minimum wage). Furthermore, if employers have some wage setting power

in low-wage labor markets, as in certain efficiency wage models and search models, then

even exogenous minimum wage increases cannot easily be used to estimate labor demand

elasticities for low-wage labor (Manning, 1995). Increases in toti labor costs may be less

than proportional to observed wage increases since, for example, turnover costs might be

reduced by a higher minimum wage. Administrative burdens and lack of employer

awareness of some targeted wage subsidies suggests the “effective labor demand elasticity” in

response to such a wage subsidy might be lower than for an “equivalent” wage decline.

       My best guess at “reasonable” parameters for simulating the likely medium-term
                                               10

impact of a general wage subsidy for U.S. low-wage workers is a labor supply elasticity of

approximately 0.4 and a labor demand elasticity of approximately -0.5. Substituting these

guesses into equations (1) and (2) yields the prediction that a general 10 percent wage

subsidy for low-wage workers would expand their employment by approximately 2 percent

and increase their hourly wages by approximately 5 to 6 percent. Thus evaluations of wage

subsidies focusing only on employment effects may miss the possibly larger effect of such

policies on the wages of the targeted group. But, as I noted above, substantial uncertainty

surrounds these predictions and “reasonable” choices of elasticities based on existing

evidence could lead to very different estimates. If the labor demand elasticity were -0.1 (as

suggested by the minimum wage literature) along with a labor supply elasticity of 0.4, then a

10 percent subsidy produces a 0.8 percent increase in employment and 2 percent increase in

wages. If the labor supply elasticity is really much larger as might be the case for groups

facing substantial structural unemployment (such as disadvantaged inner-city t~nagers),      then

more of the focus on employment effects is reasonable.    This wide range of scenarios

suggests a possibly more fruitful approach to assessing the likely effectiveness of a wage

subsidy policy is to examine the outcomes observed in past attempts at using wage subsidies

and in demonstration projects designed to test alternative employment-subsidy strategies. 2



III. U.S. EXPERIENCE      WITH WAGE SUBSIDIES

       The United States has experimented over the past three decades with various forms of

categorical wage subsidies to increase private employment opportunities for the disadvantaged

and with an incremental employment tax credit as part of a fiscal stimulus package. The
                                               11

three major efforts have been the New Jobs Tax Credit, the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit, and

some aspects of Title II of the Job Training Partnership Act. Two early attempts were the

contract component of Job Opportunities in the Business Sector (JOBS), a late 1960s-early

1970s effort to train and hire disadvantaged workers; and the WIN tax credit (WINTC), a

1970s subsidy paid on the wages of AFDC recipients enrolled in the work-incentive program.

       The JOBS program started as a voluntary effort by the National Alliance of Business

(NAB) to place young and less-educated workers from impoverished backgrounds in private

employment.    To assist NAB in placing participants, the federal government offered contracts

that would reimburse businesses for part of the costs of employment ($3200 per placement on

average).   Despite this fairly large hiring subsidy and much publicity, surprisingly few of the

employers who cooperated with NAB and accepted placements (those employing about one

third of the JOBS enrollees) actually took advantage of it (Hamermesh, 1978). The JOBS

program provided subsidies to approximately 93,000 positions at its peak in 1971, and it was

eliminated with the introduction of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act

(CETA) in 1973. Data from the WINTC program indicate low utilization with never more

than 20 percent of the WIN individuals who were known to have entered employment during

the year being claimed by firms as tax credits (0’ Neill, 1982). The JOBS and WINTC

experiences suggest some reluctance on the part of employers to hire under a highly targeted

subsidy the rquires   paperwork not normally part of the hiring process.



New Jobs Tax Credit

       The United States has tried one noncategorical employment subsidy, the New Jobs
                                               12

Tax Credit (NJTC) which was in effect from mid-1977 to the end of 1978. Its main

objective was counter-cyclical--to spur private employment expansion and speed up the

recovery that was already under way.

       The relatively simple idea was to provide a tax credit of fifty percent of the first

$4200 of wages per employee for increases in employment of more than two percent over the

previous year. But attempts to close loopholes and limit the share of tax benefits accruing to

large employers meant the NJTC ended up being fairly complicated (Ashenfelter, 1978).

Subject to various limitations, the NJTC entitled employers to a tax credit equal to 50 percent

of the excess of wages covered by federal unemployment insurance (FUTA) over 102 percent

of FUTA wages (the first $4200 of annual wages paid to each individual employee summed

over all employees on the payroll at any time during the year) for the previous year. The

total credit could not exceed $100,000 for any one firm (a maximum of approximately 47

employees) so that no marginal incentives were provided for large growing firms.

       The NJTC was not explicitly targeted on any sociodemographic group. But because

the NJTC only applied to the first $4200 of wages per employee (a maximum credit of

$21OO),it provided a greater relative incentive for the hiring of low-wage, more

disadvantaged and part-time labor than for the hiring of high-wage and full-time labor.

While the NJTC was a marginal credit affecting “incremental” hirings rather than a wage

subsidy covering all employment, the maximum allowable credit implies that the NJTC

provided only a lump sum credit and no marginal wage subsidy to firms with planned

employment growth in the absence of the NJTC that is greater than the employment growth

subsidized by the credit. Contracting firms also faced no marginal change in incentives.
                                               13

The credit’s employment incentives may also have been limited by its complexity.

       The NJTC appears to have been fairly widely claimed on corporate tax returns

especially in 1978, although it is unclear the extent to which firms were aware of the credit

at the time they were making employment decisions. The Treasury estimates that the direct

reduction in tax revenues ansing from the NJTC was $5.7 billion for 1977 and 1978

combined (U. S. Departments of Labor and Treasury, 1986). Bishop (1981) estimates that at

least 1.1 million employ=s were subsidized in 1977, and at least 2.15 million in 1978.

       Two studies have attempted to evaluate the effects of the NJTC on employment

growth, Perloff and Wachter (1979) use data from a large employer survey to compare the

1976 to 1977 employment growth of firms which knew about the NJTC to that of firms

unaware of the NJTC. Only 34 percent of the firms in their sample knew of the program

although almost all large firms did. They find (from employment growth regressions with

controls for firm-size, one-digit industry, region, and tax filing status) that firms which knew

about the credit increased employment by over 3 percent more than similar firms that were

ignorant of the program.   The proportional increase in employment from knowledge of the

program decreased with firm size, a finding consistent with the lower likelihood that the

NJTC would produce marginal employment incentives for large firms. Nevertheless, one

should be somewhat critical of these results since firms with growing employment had a

much greater incentive to learn about the program and knowledge of the tax code may be

correlated with other characteristics associated with more successful, growing firms.

       Bishop (1981) estimates labor demand equations in which employment is related to a

measure of employer awareness of the NJTC, current and lagged output, and current and
                                                14

lagged measure of wages and other inputs using time series data for the construction,

wholesale, and retail trade industries. Bishop’s estimates imply that the NJTC increased

employment in construction and retail from 150,00 to 670,000 (equivalent to an economy-

wide employment increase of 0.2 to 0.8 percent) over the mid-1977 to mid-1978 period.

While one worries that it may be difficult to sort out the effects of the NJTC from other

cyclical factors affecting the economy, the existing evidence suggests that a temporary,

noncategorical, incremental employment subsidy has some potential for stimulating

employment growth.



Tarpeted Jobs Tax Credit

       The Targeted Jobs Tax Credit (TJTC) was enacted in 1978 to replace the NJTC and

remained in effect during almost dl of the 1979 to 1994 period.3 The TJTC offered a tax

credit to employers hiring certified target group individuals.   The target groups in the TJTC

have varied over time but have included various groups of economically disadvantaged

youths, public assistance and SS1 recipients, Vietnam-era veterans, certain ex-convicts, and

disabled individuals undergoing vocational rehabilitation.   The TJTC originally provided a

w credit amounting to 50 percent of first year and 25 percent of second year wages up to

$6000 for employers who hired individuals certified as members of a target group. Target

group individuals could attain vouchers at the Employment Service which they could provide

to employers to allow them to receive the credit. The TJTC appears to have b~n mainly

utilized by large firms in the retail and service sectors who contract with management

assistance companies to review the eligibility of all new hires and arrange for the
                                               15

Employment Service to voucher retroactively and certify those found eligible (Lorenz, 1995).

       The federal government increasingly restricted eligibility and reduced the value of the

credit starting in the mid- 1980s. The tax credit for the second year of employment was

eliminated in late 1986 and the subsidy rate for the first year of employment was

simultaneously reduced to 40 percent for the first $6000 of qualified wages. The age range

for eligible economically disadvantaged youth reduced from 18 to 24 years to 18 to 22 years

starting on January 1, 1989. The real value of the maximum credit declined by 75 percent

over the course of the program.   Table 1 illustrates that the number of TJTC certified

workers (number of jobs receiving a tax-credit from the TJTC) reached a peak of 622,000 in

1985 and then declined to 364,000 in 1992 in the face of program changes. A recent survey

of TJTC-certified workers indicates that the median duration of a TJTC job was 6 months in

the early 1990s (U.S. Department of Labor, 1994). This suggests that the stock of

individuals in TJTC jobs at a point in time was approximately hdf the total number of TJTC

certifications in a year. Thus the TJTC may have subsidized approximately 0.4 percent of

private employment at its peak in 1985. Tax expenditures on the TJTC were approximately

$500 million (in 1991 dollars) in the mid-1980s and declined to $245 million in 1991 (U.S.

Office of Management and Budget, 1992).      Thus the TJTC paid approximately $570 per

starting participant in 1991 ($245 million divided by 428 thousand participants).   The mean

TJTC worker earned approximately $5.00 per hour and worked close to 30 hours per week

in 1992 (U.S. Department of Labor, 1994). Thus the TJTC appears to have reduced

employer wage costs by approximately 15 percent for the typical TJTC participant in a job of

six month duration in the early 1990s.
                                               16

       The TJTC has played a modest labor market role for disadvantaged youths and

welfare recipients, who together accounted for more than 80 percent of the total tax credits.

Economically disadvantaged youth represented the majority of TJTC certifications throughout

the life of the program.   Table 1 provides a comparison of the level of TJTC certifications

and an estimate of the number of employed ~onomically disadvantaged youths for whom

firms could theoretically collect the TJTC.4   The estimates in the table imply that from the

mid- to late- 1980s approximately 9 percent of economically disadvantaged youth who were

eligible and employed had been hired under the credit. This take-up rate is a bit higher than

the under 5 percent rate estimated by O’Neill (1982) for the first year of program operation.

       One possibility for low utilization of the TJTC is regulatory burden and the lack of

support for the program by its administering agencies the Department of Labor and the state

Employment Services. An alternative explanation is the stigma that targeting may attach to

workers whose employment the government seeks to advance. The stigma hypothesis gains

support from the results of a controlled experiment conducted in Dayton, Ohio in 1980-81 to

try to test the effectiveness of two targeted wage subsidy plans (Burtless, 1985). Welfare

(AFDC and general assistance) recipients, all eligible for the TJTC, were randomly assigned

to three groups. The first group received vouchers that could be presented to prospective

employers for direct cash rebate subsidies. The second experimental treatment group were

given tax credit vouchers that allowed prospective employers to receive either the WIN tax

credit or the TJTC. Participants in these first two groups were encouraged to distribute

explanatory material about the wage subsidies (tax credits) to employers they contacted

during their job search. Members of the third group while technically eligible for the WIN
                                               17

or TJTC tax credits received no vouchers and were not informed of their eligibility for these

programs.   The striking result of this experiment is that job seekers given experimental

vouchers in both treatment groups were significantly less likely to find employment than

were job seekers without vouchers.    One interpretation is that vouchers indicating eligibility

for a targeted wage subsidy but also indicating that the individual is a welfare recipients ae

more of a stigma that a help in job search. Hollenbeck and Willke (1991) report that in a

second similar random assignment experiment (conducted by the Wisconsin Department of

Health and Social Services) the target group members (welfare, ex-offenders, and

handicapped), who were trained to announce their eligibility for the TJTC to employers, also

fared worse than the controls. It is unclear whether the results from these two studies from

the early 1980s for welfare recipients are transferable to the largest TJTC group,

economically disadvantaged youth.

       Several nonexperimental studies have attempted to estimate the impacts of the TJTC

on the earnings and employment of eligible workers and on net job creation, but the sources

of identifying information have not been very persuasive.    Hollenbeck and Willke (1991) find

greater regional availability and usage of the TJTC is associated with positive labor market

impacts for nonwhite male youths and small negative impacts on other eligible race/sex

groups, but the results are fairly sensitive to specification choice. Lorenz (1988) finds

positive impacts of the TJTC on earnings in the year the credit is received, but the control

group of those vouchered and not obtaining TJTC jobs is likely to bias him towards finding

positive results. Bishop and Montgomery (1993) use a survey of 3500 private employers

from the early 1980s to determine whether use of the TJTC alters a firms employment level
                                               18

and/or whom the firm hires. They compare hiring patterns and employment growth in firms

that do and don’t use the TJTC. They conclude that each subsidized hire generates between

0.13 and 0.3 new jobs to a participating firm and that program use induces shifts in

employment towards workers under age 25. But they do not present a convincing solution to

the endogeneity of TJTC usage arising from the likelihood that fast growing firms and those

using the youth labor market are simply more likely to use the TJTC.



Evaluating   the Effect of T.lTC Eligibility on the Em~loyment    of Disadvantaged     Youth

       Legislative changes in the eligibility rules and generosity of the TJTC provide a

possibly more plausible and exogenous source of variation to try to identify the impacts of

the TJTC on the labor market outcomes of the target groups. A major change occurred on

January 1, 1989 when economically disadvantaged youths aged 23-24 were made ineligible

for the TJTC while those aged 18-22 maintained their eligibility. Table 1 shows that the

number of TJTC certifications for economically disadvantaged youths fell by over 50,000 in

from 1988 to 1989 and averaged 93,000 less per year in 1989-90 than in 1987-88. This 30

percent decline in certifications for disadvantaged youth from 1987-88 to 1989-90 is similar

to the share of total employment of disadvantaged youth of individuals aged 23-24.

       An analysis of the employment rates of disadvantaged individuals aged 23-24 before

and after this legislative change can potentially help us assess the employment impacts of the

TJTC. If the TJTC buoyed the employment of these youths, then its removal should have

lowered the employment of disadvantaged youths aged 23-24 in 1989-90 relative to their

employment in earlier years. But since other factors (e. g., business cycle conditions) are
                                                 19

also likely to have caused changes in employment of young adults over this period, it is

critical to account for these. One useful approach is to compare the employment experience

of disadvantaged 23-24 year olds with the employment experiences of other 23-24 year olds

over the same time period. The gap in the before/after change in employment rate of

disadvantaged 23-24 year olds to others aged 23-24 provides a differences-in-differences

estimate of the impact of TJTC eligibility on the employment of the target group. This

differences-in-differences estimate does not take into account non-TJTC factors that

differentially affect the labor market prospects of disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged

workers.    Since disadvantaged 18-22 year olds (who remained covered by the TJTC after

1988) and disadvantaged 25-29 year olds (who were never eligible) were not affected by the

legislative change, the changes in their employment rates relative to non-disadvantaged

individuals of the same age provides an estimate of the magnitude of non-TJTC factors

differentially affecting the employment of disadvantaged young workers over this period. If

one subtracts the differences-in-differences estimate of disadvantaged-specific employment

factors for the “placebo” groups (18-22 and 25-29 year olds) from the differences-in-

differences estimate for the “experimental” group (23-24 year olds) then one has a

differences-in-differences-in-differences   (DDD) estimate of the employment effect of the

TJTC on disadvantaged youth aged 23-24. This DDD estimate adjusts the simple

before/after change in employment of the group losing TJTC eligibility for generaJ labor

market trends affecting young workers and for those specifically affecting economically

disadvantaged individuals.

       Such an analysis also requires a designation of the appropriate “before” and “after”
                                               20

periods.   The macroeconomic environment was reasonably stable in the period surrounding

the legislative change from early 1987 to early 1990, TJTC rules were unchanged during

1987 and 1988. The TJTC was much more generous in the period prior to 1986, and the

program expired at the beginning of 1986 with uncertainty concerning its reauthorization

prior to late 1986 when it was retroactively reauthorized.   The labor market for

disadvantaged youth was affected in the period after March 1990 by increases in the Federal

minimum wage in April 1990 and April 1991, and by a rwession that could substantially

change the composition of individuals imputed to be economically disadvantaged.      Thus I

focus on 1987-88 as the before period and 1989-90 as the after period.

       Table 2 presents estimates calculated from the March Current Population Surveys of

the employment rates of disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged youths and young adults from

1984 to 1992 for the experimental group (those aged 23-24) and the two placebo groups

(those aged 18 to 22 who aged 25 to 29). The employment rate of disadvantaged 23-24 year

olds is lower in 1989-90 than in 1987-88, while, in contrast, the employment rate for non-

disadvantaged 23-24 year olds increased over this period, Table 3 shows that these

employment rate patterns imply a simple differences-in-differences estimate of a marginally

statistically significant -.030 indicating a 3 percentage point decline in the employment of

disadvantaged to non-disadvantaged 23-24 year olds after elimination of eligibility for the

TJTC of this age group. Tables 2 and 3 show similar declines in the relative employment of

the economically disadvantaged did not occur for those aged 18-22 and 25-29. Figure 2

further illustrates that the gap in employment rates between non-disadvantaged and

disadvantaged 23-24 year olds expanded relative to the analogous two control groups in
                                               21

1989-90 period versus the 1987-88 period. The DDD estimate (presented in Table 3)

comparing the change in the gap in employment rate for disadvantaged and non-

disadvantaged individuals in the experimental group with the average of the change in the

two placebo groups from 1987-88 to 1989-90 implies the TJTC boosted the employment rate

of disadvantaged 23-24 year olds by 0.043 (with a standard error of 0,020).

       This basic DDD estimate fails to account for changes in the composition of the

treatment groups (the disadvantaged) and control groups (the non-disadvantaged) that could

affect their employment rates. A simple regression framework allows one to adjust the DDD

estimates for changes in the observed individual characteristics.   The regression equation -- a

linear probability model for employment (E) -- is estimated on pooled March Current

Population Survey data from 1987 to 1990 for individuals aged 18 to 29:




where i indexes individual, t indexes time, a and the @‘sare the parameters to be estimated,

X is a vector of observable covariates (e. g., years of schooling, race dummies, mariti

status, region), DIS is a dummy variable taking on a value of 1 for disadvantaged

individuals, ~ equals 1 in 1989-90 and O in 1987-88, AGED equals 1 for those aged 23-24

and O otherwise, and ~ is an error term. The coefficient on the third-level interaction term

(~~) captures variation in employment specific to the disadvantaged (relative to the non-

disadvantaged) in the experimental age group (relative to the placebo age groups) in the after
                                                22

period (relative to the before period). This provides an adjusted DDD estimate of the effect

of the TJTC on the employment of disadvantaged 23-24 year olds. The bottom row of Table

3 presents the adjusted DDD estimate from a specification of the form of equation (3)

including a substantial number of demographic controls, state dummy variables and region-

specific trends. The adjusted DDD estimate indicates a 3.4 percentage point (or 7.7 percent)

decline in employment associated with removal of eligibility from the TJTC.      Since wage

costs were reduced approximately 15 percent on average by the TJTC in this period, a 7.7

percent employment effect suggests an own-wage labor demand elasticity of -0.5 (under the

restrictive assumption that the labor supply of the affected group was effectively infinite).

        A 3.4 percentage point decline in the employment rate for economically disadvantaged

23-24 year olds in 1989 represents a decline of 39,000 jobs relative to a base of possibly

100,000 annual certifications for this group in 1987-88. Employment durations for certified

23-24 year olds were likely to have been a bit longer than for the typical younger TJTC

recipient.   My crude guess at the typical TJTC job duration for 23-24 year olds is 9 to 12

months. This implies a (point-in-time) stock of approximately 75,000 to 100,000 jobs that

received the TJTC. The adjusted DDD estimate suggests that 40 to 52 percent of the jobs

getting TJTC subsidies reflected net employment additions for economically disadvantaged

23-24 year olds at a cost of $1500 (1991 dollars) or so per net job created.

        There are reasons to be cautious in interpreting these DDD estimates of the

employment effects of the TJTC, Figure 2 and Table 2 suggest the relative decline in the

employment of disadvantaged 23-24 years actually started in 1988, a year before elimination

of TJTC eligibility for this group. Thus other unmeasured factors differentially affecting
                                              23

disadvantaged 23-24 year olds could be present. 5 But the elimination of TJTC subsidy for a

second year of employment which was put into place in 1987 and could have been more

important for 23-24 years olds who are likely to have more stable labor force attachment

than 18-22 year olds. Thus the TJTC does appear to have had modest positive employment

effects on economically disadvantaged young adults.



Temporarv   Wage Subsidies for On-the-Job     Traininp under JTPA Title II

       The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) replaced CETA as the major federally

sponsored employment and training program for the disadvantaged in 1983. The JTPA,

unlike CETA, has no provision for adult public service employment, but it does emphasize

on-the-job training (OJT) and provide temporary wage subsidies of 50 percent of wages for

up to six months of employment to encourage firms to hire and train JTPA participants.

Employers receiving wage subsidies under JTPA are expected to provide long-term

employment opportunities for OJT participants, and employers exhibiting a pattern of failing

to retain OJT participants lose eligibility for future subsidies. Wage subsidies under JTPA

have been most important for economically disadvantaged adults (who are not public

assistance recipients) since this group has not been eligible for the TJTC. In 1993, JTPA

Title II (excluding the summer youth employment program) enrolled about 550,000 new

participants of whom 310,000 were adults, and approximately 18 percent of the adult JTPA

Title II participants received on-the-job training (U.S. Department of Labor, 1995),

       Thirty month follow-up results from a large-scale, random assignment evaluation of

JTPA Title II, the National JTPA Study, provide estimates of the impacts of JTPA services
                                               24

on the earnings of JTPA enrollees (Bloom et al., 1994). Twenty thousand JTPA applicants

at sixteen sites were randomly assigned to either a treatment group which could use JTPA

services or a control group which could not use JTPA services but could make use of non-

JTPA training and education services. The applicants (both those becoming treatments and

controls) were classified by local JTPA staffs into service strategy groups prior to

randomization.   Thus one can estimate the impact on future earnings of a strategy focused on

OJT by examining differences in outcomes between treatments and controls for whom OJT

was the recommended strategy (denoted the OJT/JSA subgroup since many of the treatment

group members were enrolled in job search assistance while searching for a subsidized OJT

position or an unsubsidized job). The OJT/JSA service strategy group included the most

“job-ready” JTPA eligibles, approximately 39 percent of JTPA applicants.

       The National JTPA Study findings indicate that JTPA has substantial and sustained

positive effects on earnings for adults enrolled in a service strategy emphasizing placement in

subsidized OJT positions with private employers (Bloom et al., 1994). The OJT/JSA strategy

is estimated to increase the earnings of adult women by a highly statistically significant 15

percent ($2292) and adult men by a marginally significant 10 percent ($2109) over thirty

months. Positive program impacts on earnings are present both during the six months of

program participation and in the first two post-program years. In fact, both men and women

in the OJT/JSA strategy showed statistically significant earnings gains of over $1000 (17

percent for women and 13 percent for men) in the second post-program ym.          The OJT/JSA

service strategy for adults appears to have substantial net benefits for both enrollees and

society even when ignoring any possible sustained impacts on earnings beyond the thirty
                                              25

months so far analyzed in the National JTPA Study (Bloom et al, 1994). Unfortunately the

JTPA evaluation indicates this same strategy has no impacts on the earnings or employment

prospects of out-of-school disadvantaged youth.

       A mixed strategy providing job search assistance, job development, and a temporary

wage subsidy s=ms to be a successful approach to substantially improving the earnings of

disadvantaged adults (particularly adult women). But, like other non-intensive strategies that

have been evaluated, it dose not appear very effective for out-of-school youth from poor

families. The JTPA evaluation estimates provide estimates of the marginal impacts of JTPA

services above the impacts of non-JTPA training services available to control group

members. The OJT wage subsidy was a more important marginal service for adults than for

youths since economically disadvantaged youth eligible for JTPA in the control group were

eligible for a wage subsidy from the TJTC. Thus the importance of a temporary wage

subsidy could play some role in explaining the more positive program impacts for adults than

youth. The extent to which the positive JTPA impacts on participants come at the expense of

displacement effects on other workers can’t be determined from the JTPA evaluation.



IV. EVALUATIONS OF U.S. WAGE SUBSIDY DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS

       Further information on the likely effectiveness of private-sector employment subsidies

can be gleaned from evaluation studies of several U.S. demonstration projects testing policies

with wage subsidy components to improve the employment and earnings of disadvantaged

youth, AFDC recipients, and unemployment insurance recipients.
                                                26

Youth Incentive Entitlement     Pilot Proiect

       The Youth Incentive Entitlement Pilot Projwt (YIEPP) was a demonstration active

from late 1978 to early 1981 that guaranteed full-time summer jobs and part-time school year

jobs to disadvantaged youth agti 16 to 19 in selected communities provided that they stay in

school (Farkas et al., 1982; U.S. Department of Labor, 1995). All the jobs offered paid the

minimum wage. The project directly created jobs in the public and non-profit sectors and

dso offered 100 percent wage subsidies to private sector for-profit firms to encourage them

to hire disadvantaged in-school youth. Thus the YIEPP represented a saturation job creation

program for in-school youth in poor neighborhoods that attempted to use both private and

public sector employers.    Twenty-nine percent of the program jobs were with private, for-

profit employers with retail trade being the largest category of private sector employers.

       The program does appear to have substantially increased the earnings and employment

rates of youths in the treatment communities relative to those in four “comparable” cities that

were used as control sites (Farkas et al., 1982, 1984). School year employment rates

doubled from about 20% to 40%, while summer employment rates increased from about

35% to 45%.    Minority employment rates under YIEPP were raised up to those of whites in

the same areas. School-year earnings were estimated to have increased by 46 to 161 percent

in the different years of operation of the program, and summer earnings were raised by

approximately 50 percent.    Most of the in-program earnings gains arose from increases in

employment rates and hours worked per week rather than higher wages; this is not surprising

since the program only funded minimum wage jobs. Private sector employment for the

youth increased by 18 percent (representing an increase of 3.1 percentage points in the
                                                27

employment- population ratio) on average during the operation of the program.       While the

employer take-up rate was low, substantial wage subsidies combined with job development

efforts by an intermediary did substantially expand private employment for difficult to

employ poor youth. Comparisons of the treatment effect on private sector employment with

the total number of private sector jobs subsidized implies a fifty percent displacement rate for

YIEPP private sector job slots so that it took 2 private sector slots to expand employment of

YIEPP participants by one.

       Despite the linkage of employment opportunities to school enrollment, YIEPP did not

appear to increase the school enrollment rate of eligible youth. Nevertheless, the YIEPP

does suggest the importance of demand-side barriers to employment of poor minority youth

and the potential for mixed public-private employment creation efforts to improve the

situation. Furthermore, Farkas et al. (1984) find a positive and statistically significant post-

program overall weekly earnings effect of 39 percent (and a modest but statistically

insignificant 5 percent increase in hourly wages) in the year following program termination.



Subsidized   Emplovrn ent for AFDC Reci~ients

       Several evaluations suggest that subsidized employment combined with training and

other support services appears to be a promising and particularly effwtive strategy to

improve the earnings of adult female AFDC recipients.      The strongest positive earnings

impacts of the OJT/JSA service strategy in the JTPA Title 11evaluation were found for adult

female AFDC recipients (U.S. Department of hbor,        1995). Similarly, state work-welfare

demonstrations in New Jersey and Maine, which emphasized on-the-job training with
                                               28

subsidized wages, showed earnings impacts of over $1000 per year (Gueron and Pauly,

1991). The National Supported Work Demonstration (NSW) of the late 1970s provided

single parents who were long-term welfare recipients with extensive support services and 12

to 18 months of subsidized employment on projects (sheltered workshops) directly developed

and managed by the demonstration’s operators.       A random assignment evaluation of the

NSW found large in-program annual earnings increases during the period of subsidized

employment of over $6000 (300%) on average. Earnings increases of over 20% were

apparent in the first two post-program years, and substantial earnings impacts of over $400

per year remained in the sixth through eighth post-program years (Gueron and Pauly, 1991;

Couch, 1992).

         The Homemaker-Home Health Aide Demonstrations (HHHA) of the mid- 1980s

provided “job ready” AFDC recipients with four to eight weeks of training and up to twelve

months of subsidized employment under close supervision as home health aides with private

and quasi-public nursing homes and home health care agencies. The HHHA demonstrations

were implemented with a random assignment design in seven states and, unlike the NSW,

made substantial use of subsidies for employment with private-sector employers operating in

a “rd”    market (Bell and Orr, 1994). The HHHA demonstrations produced significant

earnings gains for participants in five out of the seven states in which they were carried out.

The earnings gains averaged around $2000 annually in the first two years of the program and

sustained gains of approximately $500 annually were sustained during the fourth to fifth

years after exit from the program (U.S. Department of Labor, 1995). Bell and Orr (1994)

estimate positive net social benefits in six of the seven states experimenting with HHHA,
                                                29

       Thus welfare-to-work programs that combine training, job development, employment

subsidies to private-sector employers, and support services appear to be a cost-effective route

to producing substantial and sustained ~nings     increases for AFDC recipients.   But the low

earnings base for this population implies that such program by themselves do not produce

large enough earnings gains to move such families out of poverty.    Furthermore the extent to

which modest-sized demonstration projects emphasizing subsidized employment can be

successfully implemented as operations of the scale necessary for a work program associated

with currently popular time-limited welfare proposals is very much an open question.



Wage Subsidies for ,Tob Losers

       Many recent random assignment experiments have evaluated alternative approaches to

improve the re-employment prospects of U.S. unemployment insurance (UI) recipients.

Some evidence on the effectiveness of hiring subsidies for UI recipients can be extracted

from the Illinois Re-employment Bonus experiments (Woodbury and Spiegelman, 1987).

In one of the experiments (the Employer Bonus Experiment), a random sample of UI

claimants were told that their next employer would qualify for a cash bonus of $500 if they,

the claimants, found a job within eleven weeks of filing the UI claim, and if they retained

that job for four months. Participation in the experiment was voluntary for the treatments

and about one-third of the subjects refused to take the subsidy voucher offered to them. The

participation rates were lower for higher-skilled workers suggesting possible perceived

stigmatic effects of the vouchers.   Under the assumption that the treatment had no effect on

those not participating (not accepting the vouchers), the availability of the wage subsidy
                                               30

reduced the weeks of insured employment by approximately one week on average and

reduced UI benefits paid over the benefit year by a modest, marginally statistically significant

amount (Dubin and Rivers, 1993). The number of employer bonuses claimed were quite

small (only 3 percent of the sample) and the impacts of the employer hiring bonus were

smaller than the estimated effwts of a claimant bonus treatment in which the UI recipient

could earn the $500 bonus and did not have to provide any information about the bonus to an

employer.   The employer subsidy appears less powerful than the claimant re-employment

bonus in speeding up re-employment.     Nevertheless, Meyer (1995) reports mixed results

concerning the impacts of re-employment bonuses in a series of other experiments and

expresses skepticism about the efficacy of a permanent re-employment bonus program.



V. EXPERIENCES       OF OTHER OECD COUNTRIES               WITH EMPLOYER          SUBSIDIES

       OECD countries have experimented with a variety of subsidies for private-sector

employment, although few formal evaluations of the impacts of non-U. S. programs have

been performed.b Many countries implemented marginal (incremental) employment

subsidies of some type during the 1970s. Canada operated an Employment Tax Program

from 1978 to 1981 that was similar to the U.S. NJTC. Gera (1987) estimates the job

creation and net costs per job created of this Canadian program were quite similar to

estimates for the NJTC. Evaluations of 1970s marginal employment subsidies in other

countries are not terribly convincing and typically based on surveys asking employers

whether they altered their behavior in response to the subsidy. OECD (1982, p. 11)

concludes on the basis of this type of evidence that marginal employment subsidies can be a
                                               31

reasonably efficient employment-promoting device on a temporary basis during a recovery.

       More recently many OECD nations have attempted to use wage subsidies to spur the

employment of targeted groups, particularly the long-term unemployed and unemployed

youth. OECD (1993) concludes from the existing evaluations that targeted recruitment

subsides are likely to have substantial displacement effects and large deadweight losses, but

none of the studies summarized are particularly compelling.   A caeful nonexperimental

evaluation of two Dutch wage subsidy schemes for the long-term unemployed suggests they

may have increased re-employment rates for the long-term unemployed by up to 10 percent

but at the cost of substantial displacement of the employment of other workers (de Koning,

1993). Further evaluations of the variety of private-employment subsidy programs being

implemented outside the U.S. could greatly increase our understanding of the efficacy of

wage subsidies.



VI. CONCLUSIONS

       Despite the substantial experience of advanced nations with private-sector employment

subsidies, the lack of formal evaluation evidence leaves much uncertainty concerning the

likely impacts of such policies. Table 4 summarizes the characteristics and estimated impacts

of the major U.S. wage subsidy programs and demonstrations trageted on the economically

disadvantaged.    The current evidence suggests that wage subsidies combined with training

and job development are effective in improving the earnings and employment of

disadvantaged adults, particularly AFDC recipients.   Stand-alone targeted wage subsidies

appear to hampered by stigma and low employer utilization when the eligible groups are
                                               32

those with negative connotations for employers.     But some new evidence presented in this

paper indicates that the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit may have modestly improved the

employment rates of economically disadvantaged youth. The evidence from the YIEPP also

suggests that a saturation job creation strategy that combines direct public job creation and

private-sector subsidies can play an important role in improving the employment and earnings

of disadvantaged youth. A non-categorical wage subsidy for low-wage workers appears at

least worthy of a demonstration project that compared outcomes for low-wage workers in

comparable communities with and without the availability of such a policy.

       Two new U.S. experiments with employment tax credits were initiated with the

passage of the 1993 Budget Reconciliation Bill. The bill has led to the designation of six

urban and three rural Empowerment Zones in which a 20 percent tax credit will be

applicable on the first $15,000 of wages and training expenses for employees who live and

work in a zone. The second is the transformation of corporate tax incentives to locate in

Puerto Rico under Section 936 partially into an employment tax credit (with the maximum

credit available affected by labor compensation paid in Puerto Rico). The impacts of the

incentives introduced by these two new initiatives deserve careful evaluation.

1. Since there exists a burgeoning literature examining the effects of employee-side earnings
supplements such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (e.g. Hoffman and Siedman, 1990; and
Eissa and Liebman, 1996) in the United States and the Self-Sufficiency Project in Canada
(Card and Robbins, 1996), I limit my focus to employer-side wage subsidies.

2. An alternative approach is to simulate the effats of wage subsidies in more fully
developed (but still highly stylized) general equilibrium labor market models, See Mortensen
(1994) for an interesting attempt to simulate the effects of a general new hire subsidy; and
Davidson and Woodbury (1995) for an ambitious simulation model to analyze wage-rate
subsidies for dislocated workers.

3, The most recent authorization of the TJTC expired at the end of 1994. The TJTC has
expired several times in the past and then b~n reauthorized. It is unclear at this date
whether the TJTC will once again be resurrected by Congress in some form.

4. An individual qualified as “economically disadvantaged” under the TJTC if he or she had
a family income in the six months prior to starting a job that on an annual basis would be
less than seventy percent of the Bureau of Labor Statistics “lower level standard income
level” (LLSIL) for his or her gmgraphic region. The LLSIL varies by family size,
metropolitan area status, and across the four Census regions. Seventy percent of the LLSIL
is approximately 125 percent of the poverty line for a family of four in the average
geographic area. I use the March Current Population Surveys (CPSS) to estimate the toti
number of economically disadvantaged youths aged 18-22 and 23-24 and their employment
rates in each year from 1984 to 1992. Information on annual family income for the previous
calendar year, residential location (state and metropolitan area), age, and family size
available in the March CPS is used to impute whether an individual would been classified as
economically disadvantaged at the time of the survey. The employment rates are based on
employment status information from the March survey reference week. Since family income
varies over a calendar year, the number of individuals imputed to be eligible for the program
using annual income from the March CPS is likely to be somewhat of an underestimate of
those actually eligible on the basis of their family income over the previous six months.
Information on the LLSIL by region and metropolitan areas was kindly provided by David
Lah of the Employment and Training Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor,
Individuals residing in Alaska and Hawaii are excluded from the analysis because of
incomplete information on the official LLSIL levels for these states.

5. Contamination effects leading to an overestimate could be present if the employment rates
of non-disadvantaged 23-24 year olds were increased when they became cheaper relative to
disadvantaged 23-24 years; an opposite contamination bias leading to an underestimate could
arise if the employment rates of disadvantaged 18-22 year and 25-29 year olds were bolstered
by the policy change.

Sources:    Numbers of TJTC Certifications              (in millions) are from U.S. House of Representatives (1 993,
p. 1073)   and from unpublished tabulations             provided by the U.S. Department   of Labor, Employment   and
Training Administration.  Data on certifications for 1984 and 1985 cover fiscal years (October                                         of the
previous year to September of the listed year); data for 1986 covers October 1985 to December                                          1986;
data for 1987    to 1992    cover calendar       years. The low number               of certifications        in 1986    partially    reflects
the suspension     of the program        from January      to late October           1986.

Employment      levels of economically       disadvantaged     youth are the author’s                 tabulations       for March     of each
year from the March      Current   Population  Surveys                     (CPS) using CPS basic sampling     weights.
Economically disadvantaged   status for each individual                   aged 18 to 24 in the March CPS’S from March
1984 to March 1992 was imputed                using the available information   on family income in the previous
calendar year and family structure            combined with information     on the relevant Lower Income Living
Standard Level by geographic  region and metropolitan  area of residence.    Residents    of Alaska and
Hawaii are excluded from the employment  totals.  Economically disadvantaged    individuals aged 18 to
24 were    eligible for the TJTC       during the 1984      to 1988        period;      eligibility   was restricted        to those aged
18 to 22 from     1989     to 1992.

Employment        rates by economically     disadvantaged          status     and age group are estimates            from the March
Current    Population   Surveys     (CPSS) for 1984         to 1992        based on current     employment          status     for March
of year.   Each observation       is weighted      by its CPS basic sampling          weight.     Cell sample        sizes vary from
599   to 11442.      Standard     errors are in parentheses.


Economically  disadvantaged  status for each individual aged 18 to 29 in the March CPS’S from March
1984 to March 1992 was imputed using the available information       on family income in the previous
calendar year and family structure combined with information     on the relevant Lower Income Living
Standard  Level by geographic region and metropolitan                        area of residence.         Residents     of Alaska       and
Hawaii are excluded from the samples.

Notes   to Table    3:


Cells contain mean employment   rates for the identified group and time period from the March Current
Population Surveys (CPSS) for 1987 to 1990.     Standard errors are in parentheses.   Each observation
is weighted      by its CPS basic sampling         weight.    The DDD estimate            is the difference-in-difference            from
panel A minus that in panel B. Economically disadvantaged status for each individual aged 18 to 29
in the March CPS’S was imputed using the available information   on family income in the previous
calendar     year and family        structure   combined     with     information       on the relevant      Lower    Income     Living
Standard Level by geographic  region and metropolitan                       area of residence.           Residents   of Alaska        and
Hawaii are excluded from the samples.


The   adjusted     DDD       estimate   is the coefficient        on the third-order       interaction     term    of a time     period
(before/after)      dummy with an age group dummy (age 23-24         equals 1 ) and a disadvantaged      status
dummy in an individual level employment          regression of the form given by equation      (3) in the text
covering all 18 to 29 year olds for pooled March CPS data covering                1987 to 1990,     The other
covariates     included are 3 individual year dummies; a disadvantaged     status dummy; 11 age dummies;
2 dummies         for the interaction   of age group (1 8-22   and 25-29)     with disadvantaged     status;   a
before/after     dummy         interacted   with   disadvantaged         status;    2 interactions        of age     group     and    the
before/after     dummy; dummy variables for sex, marital status, and race; 4 education group dummies;
interactions     of the sex dummy with the race, marital status, and educations dummies; interactions of
the before/after     dummy       with the education,    race, and sex dummies;             50 state dummies;         and 8 dummies
for interactions     of the before/after        dummy      with    census    division    dummies.        The sample      size for the
regression     is 103,600.       The regression     was estimated         using CPS basic sampling            weights,
