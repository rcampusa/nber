        The environment     for business creation is central to economic policy, as entrepreneurs           are

believed to be forces of innovation,    employment    and economic dynamism.              We use data from

the National Longitudinal    Surveys (NLS) to investigate the relative importance of financial and

human capital exploiting     the variation provided by intergenerational         links.     Specifically,   we

estimate the impacts of parental wealth and human capital on the probability               that an individual

will make the transition from a wage and salary job to self-employment.

        We find that young men’s own financial              assets exert a statistically     significant,   but

quantitatively   modest effect on the transition to self-employment.          In contrast, the capital of

parents exerts a large influence.   Parents’ strongest effect runs not through financial means, but

rather through human capital, i.e., the intergenerational     correlation in self-employment.        This link

is even stronger along gender lines.

1.      Introduction


        In recent years, the contribution     of entrepreneurs to the success of market economies has

emerged as a central focus of economic policies.         But who becomes an entrepreneur?         The

determinants     of the processes by which individuals enter entrepreneurship,        grow and survive, or

even depart from an entrepreneurial       venture are not thoroughly understood.       To the extent that

entrepreneurs     are of interest, it is essential to understand the individual steps by which people

become and remain entrepreneurs.

        Because credit rationing can emerge even when all agents optimize (e.g., Stiglitz and

Weiss (198 1)), one line of inquiry has explored the hypothesis that capital markets constrain

entrepreneurs.     Viewed from this perspective, an interesting empirical phenomenon           is the greater

propensity of the offspring of the self-employed        to become entrepreneurs.      One possible source

of this correlation is that successful entrepreneurs may also be more able and willing to transfer

financial wealth to their offspring, thereby relaxing capital market constraints.         In short, family

credit markets may substitute for formal access to funds. However, an alternative explanation is

that self-employment      is correlated across generations because parents transmit to their offspring

valuable experiences or other managerial human capital. After all, the survival process may

serve to identify only the better-qualified     entrepreneurs.     Because policies designed to augment

financial capital do not necessarily increase human capital (and vice versa), it is essential to

distinguish between these potential effects.

        Previous research that has focused on liquidity constraints has followed a simple line of

reasoning.     Initial capital is required for a new enterprise.    If individuals are price takers in the

credit market, then the ability to obtain capital and start the enterprise will be independent of the

entrepreneur’s    personal finances.    However, in cross-sectional     work, Meyer (1990) found that

this prediction was rejected; the probability of being self-employed          increased with an
individual-s net worth, ceteris paribus.        Likewise, Blanc hflower and Oswald’s (1990) study of

British young men indicated that a receipt of a ~5,000 inheritance doubled the probability of

setting up a business.

        Unfortunately,     in a cross-section   a positive sign on assets could both suggest either that

wealth permits entrepreneurship       or that entrepreneurs accumulate more wealth. Thus, Meyer

(1990) and others have argued that longitudinal data are preferable because explanatory variables

may be dated prior to the time of the decision, reducing the chances that the explanatory

variables are consequences,      not causes, of being self-employed.       Using panel data, Evans and

Leighton (1989) and Evans and Jovanovic (1989) analyzed transitions to self-employment.                  In

each case, the coefficient on assets was positive and statistically significant, pointing to the

presence of liquidity constraints.     Meyer (1990) also examined transitions from wage-earning to

self-employment      and found that from a statistical point of view, assets were significant, but their

quantitative    impact was quite minor. Finally, in a pair of studies Holtz-Eakin,       Joulfaian and

Rosen (1994a, 1994b) found that receipt of an inheritance increased the probability of becoming

self-employed,     raised the capital invested in a new enterprise, enhanced the survival probability

of extant sole-proprietors,    and increased the gross receipts of existing entrepreneurs.      Thus, a

general pattern has emerged in which a windfall of capital relaxes capital market constraints and

eases the transition to entrepreneurship,       but the quantitative impact remains somewhat unsettled.

        A second related line of research focuses directly on the intergenerational         transmission      of

labor market status. Recent studies (Altonji and Dunn (1 991 ), Solon (1 992) and Zimmerman

(1992)) have estimated a larger intergenerational           income correlation (about 0.40) than previously

documented      (e.g., Becker and Tomes (1986)). However, few studies have looked at the

underpinnings     of these correlations.   Altonji and Dunn estimate strong correlations in the work

hours, wages and earnings of fathers and sons, and of mothers and daughters.             They show also,



                                                      -2-
among other things, that the probability that a young man belongs to a union is higher when his

father is a union member.     Looking directly at the question of interest in this study, Lentz and

Laband ( 1990) show that the probability that a young man is self-employed          is significantly

higher when his father is self-employed.

        To summarize, the previous literature suggests a role for both financial and human capital

in explaining the intergenerational    correlation in self-employment.     Our goal is to determine in a

more direct way the separate effects of family financial resources and family human capital on

the likelihood of a young adult becoming self-employed.

        The remainder is organized as follows. In Section 2, we develop the framework for our

analysis, while in Section 3 we describe briefly the data used in our analysis.       Section 4 analyzes

the transition from wage and salary jobs to self-employment.         Section 5 summarizes our findings

with particular emphasis on the relative importance of financial and human capital.

        To anticipate the results, we find that parental human capital has a strikingly large and

statistically significant effect upon the propensity to become self-employed.        This influence

emerges even afier controlling for the positive influence of access to capital through the

individual and/or his parents, as well as general education.      Thus, to the degree that these results

correctly characterize the entrepreneurial    environment, those policies that provide business-

specific human capital will be the most successful in enhancing the entry into self-employment.


2.      Framework for Analysis


        The model on which we base our empirical work begins by examining a potential new

entrepreneur’s   demand for capital and its interaction with becoming an entrepreneur. 1 We

initially abstract from intergenerational    or other family links. For each individual, let utility

depend on income (Yi) and a vector (Zi) of personal characteristics      such m those available in our



                                                    -3-
data: education, race, marital status, number of children, and number of siblings.                    If earnings

ability in a wage and salary job is Wi,assets are Ji and the net rate of return r, then income as a

wage-earner is     Wj +   ~Aj.



        As a self-employed         entrepreneur, the individual’s gross earnings are eiflki)c, where~()               is

a production function using capital (ki), Oi is the individual’s unobserved ability as an

entrepreneur and c is a random element.           Abili~, Oi, has a distribution        across individuals and is

not revealed to the individual until after becoming an entrepreneur.               It is also likely influenced by

the human capital acquired by the individual from parents and other sources; we return to this

below. We assume c has a mean of one and finite variance, and that e is independent of ei. After

investing in the business, the individual has Ai - ki available to earn capital income, and the

individual’s   net entrepreneurial      income is eif(ki)c     + r (Ai - ki). By definition, if ki > Ai, then ki-

Ai is the amount of capital financed by borrowing.             Previous research suggests limits to such

borrowing; we summarize any capital market constraints that limit borrowing according to the

individual’s   net assets via a liquidity constraint:        ki s l~(Ai).

        If the individual becomes an entrepreneur, his optimal amount of capital maximizes

expected entrepreneurial         income subject to the liquidity constraint.       The solution to this problem

implies that ki” = g (A i, 0~ ) , where (3; is the individual’s expected ability as an entrepreneur.

The impact on k,” of changing Ai depends on whether the entrepreneurial                    venture is liquidity
                                                                 dk,”                                  dki”
constrained.   If so, ki” = 1~(A j), leading directly to —              = /[(A, ) >0.    Otherwise,    —       = o.
                                                                 dA ,                                   dA ,
These predictions form the basis of tests for liquidity constraints.

        So far we have discussed behavior conditional on being an entrepreneur.                    The individual

cannot know for sure his fortunes as an entrepreneur, both because he is not able to forecast

business conditions and due to uncertainty about his ability. He will, however, opt for

entrepreneurship     if expected utility is higher in that setting. That is, if



                                                        -4-
        E(u([eij(k,”)c        + r(.4, -k,”)   ];z,    )}>   E{u([wi+rA,   ];z,   )}.                            (1)


As (1) indicates, the decision to become an entrepreneur depends on relative (expected) ability in

each mode, resources, and tastes. This suggests an empirical implementation                 of the form:




where Pil is the probability that individual i becomes self-employed              during year t and Pit is a

stochastic error term.

        One would expect parental linkages to affect the decision-making                process in two ways.

First, it is possible that the offspring of wealthy parents have better access to capital assets

through the influence of their parents’ wealth.2 If so, it suggests that equation (2) should include

parents’ assets as well as the individual’s          assets. That is,



                                                                                                                (3)


where A~ denotes parents’ assets.

        As noted above, financial capital is only one possible intergenerational             linkage.   Lentz

and Laband (1990, 1993) and others have argued that the probability that an individual is self-

employed increases if his or her parents were also self-employed.                This propensity may derive

from similarities among family members in attitudes or preferences for autonomy, or the

transmission    of human capital (general managerial expertise or job-specific            knowledge).

Moreover, there may be other attributes of families-hard-working,                 disciplined, independent,

etc .—that will be correlated both with family wealth and with the probability of becoming self-

employed.      In these circumstances,   a finding that parental wealth “matters” may reflect not the

role of access to capital, but rather the value of this human capital.



                                                            -5-
        In terms of the formal model, ability ((3) may be influenced by parents’ experiences as

self-employed     entrepreneurs.   Expanding our specification to accommodate           this feature yields:



        P,, = p(zi,,w,,,    A,,, A,:, e:,,q,   u,{)    .                                                       (4)


In our empirical work below, access to matched family member data allows us to exploit these

links between children and their parents, permitting more reliable estimates of the impact of

human and financial capital as determinants           of entrepreneurship.

        To transform (4) into a form suitable for statistical analysis requires that we make some

assumptions     regarding the properties of the error term, pil. We assume that the pil are distributed

according to a Weibull distribution,       yielding the conventional     logit statistical model.


3.      Data


        Our data are drawn from the National Longitudinal             Surveys of Labor Market Experience

~LS).    Specifically, we work with the samples of young men who were aged 14 to 24 in 1966,

mature women who were aged 30 to 44 in 1967, and the sample of older men who were aged 45

to 59 in 1966. The young men were surveyed 12 times between 1966 and 1981, while the older

men were surveyed 11 times over the same period. The mature women were also surveyed 11

times through 1982, the last year of their data we use. We restrict our analysis to the subset of

young men who can be matched to a parent in either of the older cohorts.3 We further restrict our

attention to observations    for young men to years in which they were not enrolled in school and

did not return to school in a subsequent year. We keep observations             for the parents in the older

cohorts until the parent reaches age 65 or first reports being retired.4

3.1      Self-Employment          in the NLS


         To gain a feel for our data, we present a preliminary look at the propensity for self-

employment      as revealed by the NLS. We count an individual as self-employed         in a particular

survey year if his “class of worker” category for the current or most recent job is “own fm            or

business,” incorporated    or otherwise .5 For parents, we have a class of worker report for

whichever parent is a member of the older NLS cohorts.         We lack a direct report of whether the

parent’s spouse is self-employed,    so we rely on an affirmative response to whether the spouse

had income from a farm, business or professional practice.        Table 1 shows selected year-by-year

rates of self-employment    for the three groups in our data.b

         As shown in the first column of the table, the rate of self-employment       for sons rises

steadily as the cohort ages. The rate increases from 2 percent in 1966 to 15 percent in 1981.

Also shown at the bottom of the table are several measures of the overall propensity toward self-

employment.      Using these measures, 18 percent of the sons reported being self-employed         at least

once during the 1966-1981 period, with the mean age of first self-employment           being roughly 27

years. Using a slightly different metric that captures intensity of self-employment,        on average 8

percent of the working years of sons in the sample were devoted to self-employment.            This

computation     includes, however, those who were never self-employed.       Restricting the sample to

those (18 percent) who reported self-employment         at some point during the sample, the fraction of

time devoted to self-employment      rises to 43 percent. In short, self-employment     experiences are

an important aspect of the careers of young men. Self-employment          touches nearly one-fifih of

the sons, occupying nearly one-half of their early careers.

        The next two columns report our self-employment          measures for the parents. Not

surprisingly,   self-employment   rates are higher and more stable among the fathers, rising only

from 22 percent to 24 percent over the period. Equally unsurprising,       these rates exceed those

                                                  -7-
among mothers, which range from 5 percent to 9 percent. 7 Measuring the incidence from a

broader perspective,   30 percent of the fathers and 16 percent of the mothers experience at least

one year of self-employment     over the survey years. Moreover, fathers who are ever self-

employed spend nearly three-quarters     of their working time during the survey period in that state.

The summary provided in Table 1 leaves little doubt as to the substantial self-employment

activity among both the sons and their mature parents in the samples



3.2     Interaenerational        Links in Self-Employment


        Table 1 views the self-employment      experiences of sons and parents in isolation.        Table 2

presents the first steps toward analyzing the intergenerational     linkages by presenting the self-

employment     rates of sons based upon the self-employment       histories of their parents.    Consider,

for example, the entries for 1971 shown in the second row of the table. The entries show that

7 percent of those sons whose fathers were ever self-employed         were themselves self-employed          in

1971. In contrast, among sons whose fathers were not ever self-employed            during the survey, the

rate was only 4 percent.    Of course, a father’s self-employment     is not the only possible source of

intergenerational   links; the next two columns display similar comparisons       using mothers’ self-

employment    experiences as the key event. As shown, in 1971 the self-employment               rate among

sons of mothers with self-employment      experience (6 percent) is twice as high as for those sons

whose mothers were not self-employed       (3 percent).   Moreover, there is nothing special about

1971 in this regard. A similar pattern prevails in each of our selected survey years.

        The differences are even more striking using our broader measure of the incidence of self-

employment.     For example, among the sons of self-employed        fathers, 32 percent experienced

some self-employment,      compared with only 12 percent for the other sons. A similar, if




                                                  -8-
quantitatively     less dramatic, difference prevails among the sons whose mothers had different

labor force experiences.9

        One possible concern is that the apparent intergenerational      linkage in self-employment         is

instead an artifact of sons following in their parents’ occupations.     It may be that some

occupations are characterized by greater self-employment        (e.g., doctors, plumbers, farmers).       If

occupational     following is strong in these professions, then our intergenerational     rate of following

in self-employment       may simply mirror the occupational following rate. The data, however,

reveal little support for this possibility.   Among sons who became self-employed,           10 percent

entered into the same occupation as their fathers. 10 This is virtually identical to the 10.3 percent

occupation following rate for sons who did not become self-employed,          Stated differently, 90

percent of self-employed      sons entered occupations other than that of their fathers.

        Another possible concern is that our self-employment        linkages reflect family businesses.

The data do not allow us to directly identify self-employment       resulting from entering an existing

family business.     A reasonable assumption is that a son who inherits or enters a family business

enters self-employment      with the same occupation and industry classifications       as his father.

Using this definition (and very broad industry and occupational classifications),         only 10 percent

of sons who became self-employed         would be classified as entering a family business.      (This

compares to an industry-and-occupation        following rate of 4.6 percent for sons who never became

self-employed.)’     1

        Thus, the pattern of self-employment      rates appears not to derive from either similar

occupations or, more directly, from family businesses.       Instead, Table 2 reveals that in any given

year the self-employment      rate for sons is much higher whenever either parent has a history of

self-employment      than otherwise.   Also, using “any self-employment”    as our measure of the

incidence of self-employment      summarizes the overall tendency quite well. On the whole, this



                                                    -9-
self-employment     measure is on the order of twice as high whenever a parent has been self-

employed.   The final rows of the table indicate that father’s experiences also raise the intensity of

self-employment     (fraction of years spent self-employed       conditional upon self-employment)         and

lowers by 1.5 years the age at which self-employment            begins, ‘z As a bottom line, the table

displays clearly the positive intergenerational       correlation in self-employment     and emphasizes the

greater propensity to become self-employed           at all, i.e., on the entry into self-employment.

        A final piece of suggestive evidence comes from looking at brothers in the NLS, where

we find that the strong positive influence of parents’ self-employment           is common to brothers.         In

Table 3 we divide our sample based on the number of brothers, and compare the prevalence of

self-employment     within families based on the parents’ self-employment           experience.   Consider,

for example, the fmilies      shown in the middle section of the table, each of which contributed two

sons to our data. In the 259 families where neither parent was self-employed,             one of the two

sons was self-employed       in only 12.0 percent of the cases, and both sons were self-employed           in

only 3.5 percent.   In contrast, the corresponding       computations   for the families where parents had

self-employment     experience are 28.2 percent and 16.1 percent, respectively.          A similar pattern of

higher prevalence rates show up in families with three sons, as well. 13 In short, sons are more

likely to be self-employed     and more sons are likely to be self-employed        in families where a

parent had some self-employment        experience.


3.3     Self-Employment            and Intergenerational            Access to Wealth


       Previous research has highlighted the role of access to capital in augmenting transitions to

self-employment.     One might conjecture that those parents who survive as entrepreneurs may

have greater access to financial capital and are able to influence their children’s employment

choices by example or by providing start-up capital. Indeed, the self-employed              parents in our



                                                      -1o-
sample are wealthier than their counterparts.       Their mean (median) non-business       assets are

$49,000 ($3 1,500), which are substantially       larger than the corresponding    values of $33,700

($2 1,600) for the never-self-employed        parents. Moreover, if we cast the net more widely and

include business assets and liabilities, the difference in the means (and the medians) triples.

Hence, in parallel with our focus on human capital, it is usefil to focus briefly on the pattern of

self-employment    and wealth accumulation        in the NLS.

        We show in Table 4 the links across generations in assets and self-employment.

Specifically, we show the propensity for self-employment          among sons based upon the location of

their parents in their wealth distribution.     Under the hypotheses that children have access to their

parents’ wealth, and that greater financial assets enhance the transition to self-employment            and

survival of new businesses, one would expect to find a positive relationship between parents’

wealth and self-employment        among children.

        Consider panel (a), in which entries indicate the fraction of sons who are self-employed

in the given year according to the net asset holdings of their parents. 14 As the panel indicates, in

each year there is a moderate positive relationship between self-employment            and parental wealth,

with the largest effect concentrated in the difference in self-employment         rates for the sons whose

parents are in the third versus the fourth quartile of the total asset distribution.

        A potential concern about the computations         in panel (a) is that parents’ assets maybe

dominated by their ownership of businesses.         If so, the self-employment    among sons may reflect

more the assumption of responsibility      for a family business, and less the role of parents’ assets in

relaxing liquidity constraints.    As discussed earlier, the data do not suggest a strong role for

family businesses in the self-employment        process. Nevertheless,   we control for this possibility

by removing all business assets and liabilities from our parental wealth measure.          The results of

this procedure are shown in panel (b) of the table. Although the relationship is noisier, the



                                                    -11-
positive relationship   between parents’ assets, especially in the upper tail, and son’s self-

employment     survives virtual ly unchanged.



3.4      Multivariate Analvses


         Thus fm, we have examined the influences of parental human and financial capital in

isolation.   However, the discussion surrounding equation (4) emphasizes the importance of

personal characteristics     (Zil), as well as the role of the sons’ financial and human capital. What

data are available regarding these attributes?     NLS respondents answer a wide variety of labor

market, demographic        and family structure questions in each survey year, providing us with rich

panel data for both sons and parents.      We employ a standard set of demographic variables: age,

race, marital status, number of dependents, number of siblings, whether the individual lives in

the South or in an SMSA, and spouse’s income,

         We proxy human capital through the use of age and education measures.           Specifically, we

use yearly enrollment and highest grade completed reports to construct a measure of educational

attainment (a series of indicator variables for less than high school, high school graduate, some

college, college graduate, and post college).     Descriptive statistics for our data are shown in

Table 5.

        With these data at our disposal, we may examine the degree to which the positive

correlations with parents’ self-employment       and wealth survive a multivariate   analysis.    In

conducting our analysis, we analyze transitions from wage and salary employment to self-

employment.     As noted at the outset, focusing on transitions rather than the probability of self-

employment per se eases concerns regarding the simultaneity of asset accumulation           and

entrepreneurship   in a cross-section by including variables that are dated at a time prior to the

entry into self-employment.      We begin with a specification that focuses on the young men’s own



                                                   -12-
financial assets and human capital (age and education), and then successively augment the

equation with variables capturing the potential contributions      of their parents’ financial and

human capital.




        In our sample, the amual transition rate from a wage and salary job to self-employment

is 3.1 percent. 15 We begin our analysis of this process using the baseline estimate shown in

column (1) of Table 6. In addition to the variables shown, this (and all other) specification

includes the following control variables: year dummy variables, four indicators of educational

attainment,   age, age squared, number of siblings, number of dependents, spouse’s earnings, and

indicators for black, married, residence in an SMSA and residence in the south. The Appendix

shows the entire baseline specification.

        We begin in column (1) by replicating previous work showing the link between

individuals’ assets and transitions to self-employment.      In our sample, the effect of the young

man’s own assets (measured in thousands of dollars) on the transition into self-employment           is

estimated to be 0.0078, with a p-value of 0.002, ‘b This coefficient implies that a $10,000

increase in own assets raises the probability of entering self-employment       by 0,0015, a finding

consistent with the literature indicating the limited importance of capital market constraints on

the entry into entrepreneurship.   17

        We turn next to the role of parents’ variables on sons’ transitions into self-employment.

Columns (2) to (4) focus on financial assets. The second column shows the results of

augmenting the baseline specification      with parents’ net-of-business   assets. These assets enter

with a coefficient ~-value)    of 0.0037 (0.027) suggesting a positive link. Using total assets

instead of non-business   assets (column 3) gives a slightly stronger and more significant estimate.



                                                   -13-
The larger coefficient on total assets confims      our expectation that parent’s business assets might

be more strongly related to their son’s self-employment         plans. Still, even if one accepts this

estimate the overall impact is not great, To get a sense of magnitudes, a $10,000 increase in

parents’ total assets raises the probability of a son’s transition into self-employment       by 0.0009,

which is small relative to both the sample transition probability of 0.031 and the sons’ own-asset

impact.

          One possibility    is that the evolution of parents’ assets maybe influenced by sons’

transitions to self-employment;      i.e., it may be the case that parents’ assets may be endogenous.

To control for the possibility,     in column (4) we measure parents’ assets in 1966, rather than in

the contemporaneous         year. We choose 1966 because it is the beginning of the sumey period.

The sons are quite young or still in school, thus lessening the possibility that parental asset

accumulation     is driven by the children’s business plans. Although the logit coefficient is larger,

the marginal effect of parents’ assets remains small.

          We turn next to investigating    the role of human capital. These results are presented in the

remaining columns of Table 6. In column (5) we consolidate the self-employment               experiences

of the parents into a single variable, PARENTS, our indicator for whether either parent was ever

self-employed    over the survey years. As shown in column (5), the strong correlation evident in

Table 2 survives; the variable has a strong positive effect when entered by itself. Moreover, the

statistical significance of parental human capital remains intact in a multivariate       analysis even

when it is entered along with their net-of-business       assets (column (6)) or their total assets

(column (7)).

          At the same time, including PARENTS reduces the positive effect of parents’ assets.

Thus, the temptation to ascribe positive intergenerational       correlations in self-employment      to

financial sources may be misleading.       However, financial capital is not entirely unimportant;



                                                   -14-
witness that the sons’ own asset effect is unchanged.      How large is the parents’ human capital

effect? Using the results from column (5) and holding the son’s characteristics          at the mean

values, switching the parents” self-employment       indicator from zero to one raises the probability

of a transition from 0.016 to 0.031, an increase of 0.015, which is quite large compared to the

sample transition probability of 0.031.’8

        In short, parents’ assets exert a positive, but quantitatively     small influence on sons’ self-

employment.       On the other hand, parents’ self-employment     experience has very large and

significant effects, just about doubling the probability of the son’s entering self-employment.

        The final column of the table permits separate influences of fathers’ self-employment               and

mothers’ self-employment       on their sons. Why might we expect these effects to be different?

One possibility    is that sons observe and take as their example the labor supply of the parent with

the stronger labor force attachment.     In these cohorts, the older men’s labor force participation            is

on average much higher than the women’s, so we would expect the father’s effect to be stronger.

Another possibility    is that, given the relative infrequency of female self-employment,          it maybe

the case that a mother’s self-employment      has a disproportionate     effect on the children.     If so, we

would expect that it would show up as a stronger predictor of son’s self-employment                propensity

than would the father’s self-employment.

       To examine these conjectures we decompose the PARENTS variable into the variables

FATHER, MOTHER, and BOTH.               These indicate, respectively, whether the father only, mother

only, or both parents were ever self-employed.       The results show that in isolation fathers have a

strong influence and mothers a weak influence on son’s self-employment.             However, having two

self-employed     parents has the strongest effect. 19

4.1     Alternative          Specifications


        These results suggest a very important role for parents’ human capital and a modest role

for parents’ financial capital, but a smaller effect of sons’ own assets than found in some

previous studies.    One possibility    is that the ability to control for the parents’ role in the

transition to self-employment       leads to these smaller effects. Alternatively,   they may derive from

our choices regarding estimation and specification.         To investigate this, we first checked the

statistical foundations by assuming probit and linear probability model specifications.           The

choice of statistical model had little effect on the basic character of the results.      (Estimates are

available from the authors.)      Next, we relaxed the linear specification of sons’ assets by adopting

a quadratic specification,     with little effect. (The implied increase in the transition probability

associated with a $10,000 increase in assets is 0.0018, which compares to 0.0015 calculated from

the linear specification.)     In addition, we permitted a negative asset position to have a different

effect than positive assets, but no significant difference was found.

        Thus, we find our estimates to be robust to several alternative specifications.        This

suggests that the inability to control for parents’ financial and human capital may impart an

upward bias to previous estimates.       With the exception of Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian, and Rosen

(1994a, 1994b) and Fairlie (1 994) few previous studies have been able to include controls for

parents’ entrepreneurship.

        Another possibility is that the significance of parents’ self-employment         does not reflect

the transmission    of skills or other aspects of human capital, but rather the convergence of tastes

for autonomy or a self-employment         lifestyle. Notice, however, that if the correlation reflects the

transmission   of skills, one would expect that more highly-skilled,       successful parents would have

a larger impact on their son’s transition.     In contrast, if the main effect is observing self-




                                                     -16-
employment per se, one would not expect variations in parental success to be important, once we

have controlled for their self-employment.

           To discriminate   between these alternatives, we measured parental “success” in two ways:

as the average value of self-employment         income during the period obsewed in our data and as

the average value of business assets during the sample period. Either greater flows of income or

greater accumulation       of business capital are both indicative of successful self-employment.      We

then augmented our transition equation with a variable computed as the interaction of our

indicator for any parental self-employment         (PARENTS and the measure of success. In both

cases, the interaction variable is positive and statistically significant.     That is, using either

business income or assets as a measure of success, one finds that sons of more successful

entrepreneurs     are more likely to enter self-employment      than sons of less successful

entrepreneurs,    conditional upon the common tastes and so on, captured by the parents’ self-

employment       indicator itself.



5.         Summa~


           Recent research has focused on the importance of liquidity constraints and human capital

accumulation     in the determination    of self-employment.     Clearly, the intergenerational

transmission     of parental financial assets and job market experiences is a potentially crucial aspect

of the process the generates and sustains entrepreneurs.         Our investigation   of data from the NLS

suggests important roles for intergenerational       transfers of financial and, especially, human

capital.    Specifically, the results reported above indicate that the financial assets of young men

exert a statistically   significant, but quantitatively   modest effect on the transition into self-

employment.       Using this as our metric, we find a relatively small impact of capital market

constraints in the NLS.



                                                     -17-
        In contrast, parents exert a large influence.    While parental wealth per se has a small

positive effect on the transition for sons, the strongest parental effect does not run via financial

channels.   Rather the most dramatic influence occurs through intergenerational      correlation in

self-employment    that runs most strongly along gender lines. Thus, these data suggest strong

roles for human capital per se and the transmission of these skills within families in enhancing

the probability of making a transition to entrepreneurship.

Notes:          Self-employment rates are conditional upon working at all and are unweighed. Numbers in
                parentheses are standard deviations; those in brackets are sample sizes, “Sons” are aged 14 to 24
                in 1966 and must have completed schooling. “Fathers” are aged 45 to 59 in 1966 and must be
                younger than 66 years old and not previously have reported being retired. “Mothers” are aged 30
                to 44 in 1967.

                                           Notes


1.   See Evans and Jovanovic (1 989) or Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian, and Rosen (1 994a).

2.   Altonji, Hayashi. and Kotlikoff ( 1992) examine resource sharing within extended
     fmilies.   Cox (1990) and Cox and Jappelli (1990) find that intergenerational cash
     transfers are targeted toward liquidity constrained individuals. Englehardt and Mayer
     (1995) find that cash transfers from parents allow home buyers to afford larger down
     payments, purchase earlier and buy a larger home.

3.   There are two possible ways to match fathers’ information to sons’ records. First, the
     father may appear in the older men’s sample. Alternatively, the sons’ mothers maybe in
     the mature women sample. If so, we rely on the mothers’ report of her husband’s
     information. Similar rules apply to matching mothers and sons.

4.   It is not obvious how eliminating observations for individuals based on retirement affects
     the measured prevalence of self-employment. Fuchs (1982) shows that the self-employed
     retire later than the non-self-employed and that many people become self-employed after
     retiring from a wage and salary j ob. The first effect would tend to raise measured self-
     employment, while our age and retirement restrictions will exclude the switchers and
     lower our measure of self-employment.

5,   Survey participants were not asked about dual jobs in every survey year. Hence, we are
     unable to gauge the importance of self-employment as a secondary j ob or of part-time
     self-employment.

6.   We employ the NLS-provided     weights to provide population estimates.

7.   Devine (1994) studies the recent growth in female self-employment    rates.

8.   A natural question arises as to whether the NLS reports of self-employment are indicative
     of self-employment in the population as a whole. To shed some light on this issue, we
     present (below) the self-employment rates for similarly defined age groups calculated
     from the March Current Population Survey (CPS) in the corresponding years. While the
     cross-sectional nature of the CPS precludes checking for transitions related to schooling
     and retirement in the same fashion as in the NLS, the rates are sufficiently close to
     suggest that the incidence of self-employment in the NLS is quite close to that in the
     population as a whole.

9.    For each pair of columns, t-tests reject at conventional significance levels the hypothesis
      that the “any self-employment-’ rates are equal.

10.   We use NLS-provided     classifications   of 12 different occupational   categories.

11.   Lentz andLaband(1990)      found that 26.5 percent of second-generation       proprietors had
      inherited or bought a family business.

12.   In Lentz and Laband’s (1990) sample of self-employed men, second-generation
      proprietors on average entered self-employment 1.9 years earlier than first-generation
      proprietors.

13.   In each case, a chi-square test rejects (at the 0.01 level of significance) the null hypothesis
      that the prevalence rates are equal for families where parents were and were not self-
      employed. We exclude families with four or more brothers due to small samples.

14.   In five of the survey years, detailed questions were asked about the value of household
      assets and liabilities including the value of savings accounts, stocks, bonds and mutual
      finds, residence and real estate market value and liability, and farm and business market
      value and liability. In addition to the reported total net value of assets, we construct
      another measure that excludes farm and business assets and liabilities. In each case we
      exclude a handfil of extreme observations at each end of the asset distribution. In order
      to more filly exploit the panel aspect of the data, we interpolate an asset value for every
      survey year between each two consecutive asset reports. All dollar values have been
      converted to 1982-84 dollars using the Consumer Price Index. We do this for parents’
      assets and for sons’ assets. See Dunn and Holtz-Eakin (1995) for additional details
      regarding the measurement of net assets.

15.   This is very close to Fairlie’s (1994) estimate of the transition probability of 3.3 percent
      for men in the PSID.

16.   The p-values are based on standard errors that are corrected using Huber’s formula to
      account for the fact that there are multiple observations per person in the dataset.

17.   Fairlie (1994) uses a net-of-business asset measure similar to ours and finds that a
      $10,000 increase at the mean raises the probability of a transition by 0.005. Using asset
      variation generated by the receipt of an inheritance, Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian, and Rosen
      (1994b) find a substantial effect: a $100,000 inheritance raises the annual transition
      probability by 0.00825. In contrast, Meyer (1990) finds that an additional $100,000 of
      net worth raises the transition probability by only 0.00017.

18.   Fairlie (1994) finds similar strong effects—father’s    self-employment     raises the son’s
      transition probability at the mean by 53 percent.

19.   We ran a parallel analysis for the young women’s cohort of the NLS and found that the
      MOTHER effect is strongest for daughters, 2.122 @-value= 0.0001), but the FATHER
      and BOTH are also strong and significant, 1.238 (0.001) and 1.775 (0.001 ), respectively.
      These results are largely consistent with those of Altonji and Dunn (1 994) who find
      strong similarities in the work hours of parents and children that run along gender lines

                                                -27-
and that they may be traced to intergenerational correlations in work preferences rather
than to labor supply responses to similarities in wages. The evidence here is that
entrepreneurial tastes or abilities are also passed along in families from parents to
children of the same gender.
