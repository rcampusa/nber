Incentivizing Learning-By-Doing: The Role of Compensation Schemes

                                         ABSTRACT

In this paper, we examine the impact of pay-for-performance incentives on learning-by-doing.
We exploit personnel data on fruit pickers paid under two distinct compensation contracts: a
standard piece rate plan and a piece rate plan with an extra one-time bonus tied to output. Under
the bonus contract, we observe bunching of performance just above the bonus threshold,
suggesting workers distort their behavior in response to the discrete bonus. Such bunching
behavior increases as workers gain experience. At the same time, the bonus contract induces
considerable learning-by-doing for workers throughout the productivity distribution, and these
improvements significantly outweigh the losses to the firm from the distortionary bunching. In
contrast, under the standard piece rate contract, we find minimal evidence of bunching and only
small performance improvements at the bottom of the productivity distribution. Our results
suggest that contract design can help foster learning on the job. This underscores the importance
of dynamic considerations in principal-agent models.

1. Introduction
The importance of performance-based pay in employment contracts when worker effort is
imperfectly observable has been well understood for more than three decades (e.g. Harris and
Raviv, 1979; Holmstrom, 1979; Grossman and Hart, 1983). However, with the notable exception
of Gibbons and Murphy (1992), surprisingly little attention has been paid to dynamic concerns
in these principal-agent models. At the same time, the learning-by-doing model first proposed
by Arrow (1962) and central to many modern economic growth theories (Romer, 1994) has
largely neglected the role that firm-level incentives can play in fostering learning by employees.
In this paper, we bring these two distinct strands of literature together to show these gaps are
empirically consequential.


In particular, we exploit a unique panel dataset on individual worker productivity to examine
the role of performance-based pay on job-based learning. Our data comes from a grape and
blueberry farm that utilizes two distinct contracts to compensate workers for their efforts. The
contract for grape pickers pays a fixed wage up to a productivity target and a piece rate
thereafter. The contract for blueberry pickers pays a fixed wage up to a productivity target, a
bonus for reaching the target, and a piece rate thereafter. We primarily focus on whether the
stronger incentives embedded in the second contract translate into more or faster learning on
the job. As such, we follow in the rich empirical tradition of studying fruit pickers to examine
employee incentives and various aspects of agency theory (see Bandiera et al. 2011 for a
review).


We first develop a conceptual model where workers take costly hidden effort to produce
output. Workers vary in their convex effort cost such that some will find it optimal to produce
at a low effort-low reward point, while others produce at a high effort-high reward point. This
model provides two empirical insights. First, when there is a discrete bonus, as in the case for
the blueberry contract in our empirical setting, some workers will find it optimal to bunch just
to the right of the bonus point. Second, while all workers have an incentive to lower their effort



                                                                                                   2
costs, i.e., learn-by-doing, the incentive is greater under the blueberry contract, which offers
the bonus payment if a worker crosses the threshold.


Consistent with our conceptual model and the literatures on salespeople and executive
compensation (Healy, 1985; Oyer, 1998; Larkin 2014, Freeman et al., 2019), we find that the
contract that includes a bonus leads to strategic heaping around the threshold. Importantly,
this behavior changes as workers gain more experience. More seasoned workers are better
able to reach the threshold and engage in heaping. We observe no such heaping or changes in
heaping for workers under the commission only contract (grape pickers). For example, we find
that blueberry pickers increase their likelihood of hitting the piece rate threshold by 15
percentage points (80%) over their first 10 days on the farm, while grape pickers see very little
improvement. This heaping is potentially costly to the firm since small changes in output are
accompanied by substantial changes in payout to workers.


Further, we find that the productivity gains are not limited to only those workers in striking
distance of the bonus payment. In fact, we see improvements with tenure throughout the
output distribution. In contrast, in the standard piece rate contract, we only see learning at the
bottom of the productivity distribution, consistent with the notion that fears of termination
drive learning for these workers. Furthermore, the bonus payment induces productivity gains
that are sufficient to more than offset the costs induced by inefficient heaping. A simple back
of the envelope calculation based on empirical estimates of learning-by-doing under the
blueberry contract suggests that the learning induced from day 3 to day 10 of tenure generates
an additional $60 in net revenue per worker, or approximately $8.50 per day.




                                                                                                    3
Thus, the large bonus payment appears to be instrumental in fostering learning-by-doing,
making this seemingly flawed contract a clear winner from the firm’s perspective. 2 That said, it
is important to note that crop and contract type are collinear in our setting, opening the
possibility of alternative hypotheses centered on difference across crops rather than contracts.
One obvious candidate is that there is simply more scope for learning in the harvest of
blueberries than in grapes. While we have not found any evidence in the agronomic or related
literatures that might support this contention, we cannot completely rule it out. Nonetheless,
we are reassured by the large degree of heterogeneity in base-level performance, and the fact
that workers at the bottom end of the performance distribution of grapes improve with
experience, both of which highlight that the potential scope for learning does not appear, prima
facie, limited by crop type. Another possibility is that better workers are drawn to blueberries.
We are able to dispel this concern more directly -- we find that within-crop learning behavior is
very similar for workers observed picking in both crops.


By showing that performance-based pay has important implications for learning-by-doing, this
paper contributes to two fundamental, but heretofore, disconnected economic literatures. Our
results imply that contracts that appear sub-optimal in the short run may be efficient in the
long run. This suggests that contract design has an important role to play in fostering learning
on the job, a topic that, outside of direct R&D investment, has largely been ignored in the
learning-by-doing literature (See Thompson, 2012 for a review). It also suggests that, in
settings where firm- or industry-specific human capital exist (Becker, 1962), contract design can
overcome not only moral hazard in effort but also moral hazard in learning.


The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a simple conceptual
model of worker output under two distinct performance-based pay contracts that resemble
those that form the basis of our empirical work. Section 3 describes our study setting and data.




2
  In the spirit of the Holmstrom-Milgrom multitasking model (1994), we view heaping and learning as complements
in production.


                                                                                                             4
Section 4 describes our econometric strategy and results. Section 5 examines mechanisms and
robustness. Section 6 offers some concluding remarks.


2. Conceptual Model
In this section, we develop a simple conceptual model that mirrors some of the key features of
our empirical setting. Workers face one of two types of compensation schemes. Under both
contracts, workers are paid a fixed base wage plus additional pay based on performance after
reaching a productivity target. The first contract, the “commission contract,” pays workers a
piece rate for each unit of output that exceeds the threshold. In our empirical setting, this
contract corresponds to a piece-rate subject to a minimum wage; it is also representative of a
wide array of compensation schemes that include a sales commission or profit-sharing
arrangement with some form of minimum salary guarantee. The second contract, the
“commission plus bonus contract,” is similar in structure but also includes a one-time bonus
when workers reach their productivity target. Such bonuses are commonplace in salesperson
and executive compensation schemes where they are justified as a tool to help workers with
goal setting (Joseph and Kalwani, 1998; Healy, 1985).


2.A. Commission Contract
We begin with an examination of equilibrium output levels under the commission contract.
Equation (1) describes total take-home pay as a function of the minimum guaranteed salary, w,
output, q, the pay-for-performance threshold, 𝜙, and the piece rate, p. Here, workers receive a
piece rate on all output above the productivity target, 𝜙. We assume that pay also varies with
output below the threshold 𝜙 at a rate 𝑓(𝑞). This allows for the possibility that additional
output increases the probability that a worker can keep his job (Lazear 2000). 3 Let f’(q)
represent the implicit wage rate per piece below the productivity target. The take home
revenue for a worker is the sum of three terms: (1) the minimum salary guarantee plus (2)
some benefit from a reduction in the likelihood of termination that depends on q plus (3) the
piece rate for any units that exceed the threshold.


3
    We assume for simplicity that the termination threat is zero for those who exceed the productivity target.


                                                                                                                 5
                                       𝜙                 ∞
𝑇𝑎𝑘𝑒 𝐻𝑜𝑚𝑒 𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒 = 𝑤 + ∫0 𝑓′(𝑞)𝑑𝑞 + ∫𝜙 𝑝 𝑑𝑞                                                (1)


Let 𝑐𝑗 (𝑞) denote the costs of producing q units of output for a worker of type j, where costs are
convex in output levels, such that 𝑐𝑗′ (𝑞) > 0 and 𝑐𝑗′ ′(𝑞) > 0 for all j. Figure 1 illustrates
examples of equilibrium outcomes for two different cost functions, a high and low cost of
effort. MR denotes the workers’ marginal wage (revenue) schedule, which is upward sloping
until the productivity target, and equal to p thereafter, reflecting the constant commission.4


High effort costs: We define workers with high effort costs as those whose marginal cost of
effort (MCH) increases steeply, thereby crossing the MR curve only once at a point below 𝜙. An
individual of this type receives the minimum salary guarantee (w), no commission, and faces a
non-zero probability of termination. This equilibrium is illustrated in Figure 1, where x indicates
the productivity level such that 𝑓′(𝑥) = 𝑐𝐻 ′(𝑥) for a worker of high effort cost type.


Low effort costs: We define workers with low effort costs as those whose marginal cost of
effort curve (MCL) increases slowly with output levels such that it intersects the marginal
revenue curve only once and strictly above the productivity target 𝜙. An individual of this type
will be paid the wage guarantee as well as additional compensation for each unit of output that
exceeds 𝜙. This equilibrium is illustrated in Figure 1, where y indicates the output level for a
worker of this type, and 𝑝 = 𝑐𝐿 ′(𝑦).


2.B. Commission Plus Bonus Contract
We extend our analysis to an examination of equilibrium daily output levels under the
commission plus bonus contract. Revenue under this contract is nearly identical to the
commission only case, with one important exception. Workers receive a one-time bonus


4
  The figure draws one example of f’(.) where f’’(.) is a positive constant below the piece rate threshold. In reality,
f(.) could be increasing, decreasing or non-monotonic in output. The general intuition that follows is unaffected by
this assumption, although the relative importance of effort cost type will vary across specifications.


                                                                                                                      6
payment b when they hit the threshold 𝜙. As such, total revenue under the commission plus
bonus scheme is characterized by the following piecewise function (𝟏 is an indicator function
equaling one if output exceeds 𝜙):


                                       𝜙                ∞
𝑇𝑎𝑘𝑒 𝐻𝑜𝑚𝑒 𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒 = 𝑤 + ∫0 𝑓′(𝑞)𝑑𝑞 + ∫𝜙 𝑝 𝑑𝑞 + 𝟏{𝑞 ≥ 𝜙} ∗ 𝑏                                       (2)


Let 𝑐𝑗 (𝑞) denote the costs of producing output level q for a worker of type j, as before. We
describe three types of equilibrium outcomes, each illustrated in Figure 2.


The high and low effort costs equilibria are similar to those under the commission only case.
The former corresponds to output levels in which workers are paid the minimum wage
guarantee and face a non-zero probability of termination. The latter corresponds to output
levels in which workers are paid the guarantee as well as additional compensation for each unit
of output that exceeds 𝜙. These are illustrated as point x and y in Figure 2, respectively.


Moderate effort costs: The more interesting case under this contract occurs when workers have
a marginal cost structure between the high and low effort costs. We define these “moderate
effort costs” workers as those whose marginal cost of effort curve (MCM) crosses the marginal
revenue curve at two distinct points, one below and one at the target productivity threshold 𝜙.
Points z and z’ in Figure 2 illustrate these output levels. In this case, we need to evaluate which
outcome is optimal.


As indicated in Figure 2, let k denote the marginal cost (in dollar terms) of producing output z’
(which equals the target bonus output level 𝜙). A worker will choose to produce at this level if
and only if the following holds:5



5
 For simplicity and without loss of generality, we describe the net marginal cost curve of moving from z to the
bonus payment as an integral from z to . Since we model the bonus payment as one that is paid precisely at
output level , the upper integrand on the left-hand side of (3) should technically be -, where epsilon is an
arbitrarily small unit of output.


                                                                                                                  7
    𝜙
∫𝑧 [𝑐 ′ (𝑞) − 𝑓′(𝑞)] 𝑑𝑞 ≤ [b − 𝑘]                             (3)


That is, a worker needs to produce (𝜙 − 𝑧) additional units of output to hit the threshold. A
worker will only choose this higher output level when the costs incurred from those extra units
of output are sufficiently compensated by the lump-sum bonus payment, b, plus any additional
benefits in job stability (f’(.)).6


We illustrate the heaping phenomenon in Figure 3. Let 𝑞 ∗ correspond to the level of output that
defines equation (3) with equality for the marginal cost curve, 𝑀𝐶 ∗ , which intersects the MR
curve at 𝑞 ∗ . Moderate effort cost workers with a higher marginal cost curve than 𝑀𝐶 ∗ (i.e.
those whose marginal cost curve intersects 𝑀𝑅 below 𝑞 ∗ ), such as MCj, produce less than 𝜙
output and receive the minimum salary guarantee. In contrast, moderate effort costs workers
with a lower marginal cost curve than 𝑀𝐶 ∗ (i.e. those whose marginal cost curve intersects 𝑀𝑅
above 𝑞 ∗ ), such as MCk, will heap at the target productivity level 𝜙. Equilibrium output across
all worker types is highlighted in bold, with a heaping zone defined by the area between 𝑞 ∗ and
𝜙. Any individual within that zone earns a bonus for reaching the threshold that exceeds the
excess costs of reaching that point, thus leading those who would have otherwise produced
output between 𝑞 ∗ and 𝜙 to heap at the target productivity threshold. While conceptually
similar to the heaping found in the tax notch literature (e.g. Saez, 2010; Kleven et al., 2011) and
that found for sales workers in Oyer (1998), heaping in our context reflects a genuine increase
in output for those near the productivity target rather than misreporting or a simple time
shifting of output.


2.C. Learning by Doing




6
 For simplicity, we limit our attention to the case where the marginal cost curve intersects the marginal revenue
curve twice. Given our functional form assumptions, it is possible (if not probable) that the marginal cost curve
could intersect the marginal revenue curve three times. In this case, the logic outlined below on heaping is
altered. Workers will either produce output below the target threshold or above it (but not heaped), depending
on which generates the larger amount of total net revenue (as per above).


                                                                                                                    8
One of the motivations for this paper is to examine learning by doing. In particular, we are
interested in the case where workers learn about how to improve their execution of a task
through experience.7 For simplicity and without loss of generality, we simply treat learning by
doing in our model as shifting 𝑐𝑗 (𝑞) downward for any given worker as a function of time spent
on the job.8 Thus, some high effort cost workers may become moderate and eventually low
effort cost workers over time.


Both contracts in our setting should induce learning: low cost of effort workers are better off
than high cost workers because workers extract at least part of the rent associated with their
output through increased piece rate payments above the threshold or reductions in
termination probabilities below it.9


Importantly, however, these learning incentives are stronger under the bonus contract. This
stems from the fact that, as we have shown, workers in a certain output range find it optimal to
heap (illustrated in Figure 3). These workers are better off heaping under the commission plus
bonus contract than not heaping under the commission only contract, thanks to the large
bonus they receive under the former contract. As such, a worker initially below output level 𝑞 ∗
has an added incentive to improve in the commission plus bonus contract, relative to a worker
in the commission only contract whose improvements only impact their firing probability. The
larger the bonus in the former contract, the stronger the incentive to lower effort costs so that
they can reach the threshold that triggers its payment.



7
  Note that this is distinct from another branch of the learning-by-doing literature that is more focused on workers
or firms learning about their time-invariant ability to carry out a task. This includes the match-quality models first
introduced in Jovanovic (1979) and the employer learning models explored in Farber and Gibbons (1996), Altonji
and Pierret (2001), Lange (2007), and Kahn and Lange (2014).
8
  The underlying mechanisms that drive shifts in c(q) is deliberately unspecified. The workhorse models of
productivity evolution often have a human capital framework in mind (Becker 1964, Mincer 1958, and Ben-Porath
1967), although others employ a Bayesian framework where feedback to workers on the returns to their
effort/technique is noisy and learned through repeated draws from a known distribution (Jovanovic and Nyarko,
1995). Our conceptual model is sufficiently flexible to accommodate a wide range of mechanisms for learning.
9
  Low cost of effort workers exert more effort but are rewarded more for their trouble. The envelope theorem tells
us that this combination is preferable to the low-output/low-rewards point that a high cost of effort worker
chooses.


                                                                                                                    9
We should then expect to see increases in heaping behavior as workers gain experience under
the commission plus bonus contract. Even workers who begin with high effort costs and an
equilibrium output far below the heaping threshold still have an incentive to learn. Within the
context of the model, these workers steadily increase the probability that they eventually earn
the bonus as they accumulate skills through their increased experience on the job. Outside the
context of the model, the salient bonus may serve as a motivator in and of itself. 10 Either way,
the bonus payment should accelerate learning all along the productivity distribution, relative to
the commission contract.


Thus, our basic model predicts two empirical regularities that can be summarized as follows:
      1. The commission plus bonus contract leads to heaping (as illustrated in Figure 3).11
      2. If most workers begin as high effort cost types, we should see faster improvements in
           output as workers gain experience under the commission plus bonus contract. These
           improvements should result in an increase in the rate of heaping with job tenure, as
           well as a steeper tenure-productivity gradient below the heaping point.12


Importantly, the increased learning-by-doing associated with the commission plus bonus
contract may help explain the very existence of this seemingly suboptimal type of contract.
After all, the heaping that occurs due to the threshold bonus is costly to firms since the
payment to workers changes non-trivially around the threshold for marginal changes in
productivity. To a first-order approximation, the costs of this heaping can be expressed as the
marginal costs of wages to those heaped at the threshold. Firms should only be willing to incur
those costs if the features of this contract generate enough productivity gains elsewhere in the



10
   Psychologists have argued that salient bonuses can be important for directing attention, pulling task-relevant
knowledge into awareness, and increasing persistence (Locke et al., 1981; Locke and Latham, 1990). This may also
generate a small amount of heaping in grapes.
11
   Although we do not model this explicitly, if focal points provide psychological incentives to reach the piece rate
threshold, then we may see heaping in grapes. Since this psychological effect should apply to both grapes and
blueberries, our prediction would then be that we expect to see more heaping in blueberries relative to grapes
since the former also has a strong financial incentive for reaching that threshold.
12
   More generally, the amount of heaping that results from additional experience will depend on the initial
distribution of worker types and the specific form of the learning process.


                                                                                                                   10
distribution. This is particularly relevant for those below the productivity target where each unit
increase in output is pure rent for the firm because workers receive a guaranteed fixed wage
not directly tied to output.


3. Data and Setting
The dataset used in this paper is personnel data of harvest workers from a farm in the Central
Valley of California.13 To protect the identity of the farm, we can only reveal limited
information about their operations. The farm, with a total size of roughly 500 acres, produces
blueberries and grapes during the warmer months of the year. Our dataset covers the growing
seasons of 2009 and 2010. In general, blueberries are picked in May and June, while grapes are
picked in August and September. As detailed below, all workers face some type of
performance-based pay arrangement.


Our data consist of a longitudinal file that follows workers over time by assigning unique
identifiers based on the barcode of employee badges. It includes daily information on the total
number of pieces harvested by each worker, the location of the field, the type of crop, the
terms of the piece rate contract, time in and out, and the gender of the worker. 14 Our final
dataset follows an unbalanced panel of roughly 1,300 workers over 101 days of harvest
activities.15 Data quality is extremely high, as its primary purpose is to determine worker
wages.




13
   This dataset was first used by Graff Zivin and Neidell (2012) to study the impact of air pollution on worker
productivity.
14
   We obtain these data from a unique arrangement with an international software provider, Orange Enterprises
(OE). OE customizes paperless payroll collection for clients, called the Payroll Employee Tracking (PET) Tiger
software system. It tracks the progress of employees by collecting real-time data on attendance and harvest levels
of individual farm workers to facilitate employee and payroll management. The PET Tiger software is installed on
handheld computers used by field supervisors. At the beginning of the day, supervisors enter the date, starting
time, and the crop being harvested. Each employee clocks in by scanning the unique barcode on his or her badge.
Each time the employee brings a piece, his or her badge is swiped, recording the unit and time. Data collected in
the field is then synchronized to a host computer, which facilitates the calculation of worker wages.
15
   To eliminate potential concerns about the interaction of contract type and free-riding, we limit our attention to
the crops in our dataset that are paid based on individual (rather than team) output.


                                                                                                                 11
Worker output is measured in “pieces,” where blueberries are collected in buckets and grapes
in boxes. One piece is roughly equivalent to 5-pounds of fruit, which corresponds to
approximately 400 grapes or 1000 blueberries. At the time of our study, the wholesale prices
were, on average, $2.83 per pound for blueberries and $0.33 per pound for grapes.16 In
general, our productivity measures are available at the daily level, although we have hourly
productivity measures for a small subset of our sample.17


The farm offers two distinct performance-based compensation contracts depending on the
crop being harvested for reasons that are largely a historical artefact.18 Grape harvesters face a
commission scheme, as described in our conceptual model. Workers earn $8 per hour (the
minimum wage in California during the time of our study) until their daily output reaches the
piece rate threshold of 32 pieces. At that point, the harvester earns an additional bonus per box
picked. The piece rate was $0.30 per box above the threshold in 2009 and $0.35 in 2010.


For blueberries, the compensation plan resembles the commission plus bonus scheme
described earlier. Workers continue to earn $8 per each hour worked until their daily output
reaches the piece rate threshold of 25 pieces. Upon reaching the threshold a worker is paid a
sizable one-time bonus equal to $12. She then earns a piece rate of $0.50 for each additional
piece harvested beyond the threshold. More details on the dataset and piece rate schedules
can be found in Graff Zivin and Neidell (2012).


Besides the one-time bonus, the contracts differ in the threshold at which the piece rate kicks
in and the size of the piece rate. Though the primary task performed by grape and blueberry

   In personal communications with the farm, they have indicated that they have offered these two distinct
contracts for as long as anyone could remember and that they have maintained them to ensure consistency.

pickers is similar, grape boxes are easier to fill than blueberry buckets given their size. This fact
is reflected in their higher threshold, lower piece rate, and lower price per pound.


We restrict our sample to those workers who eventually complete at least 10 days with the
farm. We focus our attention on this subsample for the analysis so that worker composition
does not influence our learning-by-doing results. The online appendix presents all of our main
results using all workers, regardless of tenure. All of our conclusions hold, both qualitatively and
quantitatively, with or without this restriction.


Table 1 provides some basic summary statistics. The average grape worker harvests 33 boxes
per day, with 55% of worker-days reaching the target productivity level at which performance-
based pay begins. Consistent with the additional fruit required to fill a bucket (and the
corresponding pay schedule), blueberry harvesters produce fewer pieces and are less likely to
reach their production target. Average output is 20 pieces per day, with the blueberry
productivity target reached on 36% of worker-days. Despite these differences in output levels,
realized wages are fairly similar across crops, with blueberry pickers averaging about $3.80
more per day than grape harvesters. The variance in earnings is higher for blueberry pickers
than for grape pickers, commensurate with the stronger incentive component for the former.


Since much of our analysis focuses on learning-by doing, Table 1 also provides some basic
statistics on job tenure within our dataset. The average tenure of a grape (blueberry) worker at
a point in time is 14 (12), and the average completed tenure is 28 (24) days at the farm,
although these range from 10 to 70 days.19 Finally, it is worth noting that approximately 7% of
workers have experience in both grapes and blueberries, a sample that we will exploit to
understand the role of worker selection into each compensation contract. 20



19
   While not all workers start on the first day of the growing season, 57% of grape pickers and 66% of blueberry
pickers are employed within the first 10 days of the given harvest.
20
   For our main analyses, we restrict our attention to the time spent in a worker’s first crop since it is unclear how
much learning ports across crops (a point we explore separately). This restriction leads us to drop 3 percent of our
blueberry worker day observations and 15 percent of our grape worker day observations.


                                                                                                                   13
4. Econometric Strategy and Results
Inspired by our conceptual model, we start by comparing output across the two contract types
to test whether workers respond to the sharp nonlinear payout in the commission plus bonus
contract by heaping just beyond the threshold. Next, we explore learning-by-doing by
examining the evolution of worker productivity as a function of experience. We initially limit
our focus to changes in the likelihood that workers reach their productivity targets, but also
explore learning-by-doing throughout the productivity distribution. As noted above, we
perform our analysis on the sample of workers who survive at least 10 days with the farm to
limit concerns about changing sample composition. All tables and figures are replicated in the
online appendix for the unrestricted sample.


4.A. Heaping
Recall that the commission plus bonus structure creates strong incentives for heaping just
beyond that threshold. Figure 4 plots the histogram of daily worker output separately by crop,
where the vertical line indicates the piece-rate threshold. Focusing first on blueberries (left),
the heaping around the bonus payment threshold (25 pieces) is immediately evident. To the
left of the threshold, the mass is generally normally distributed, discontinuously jumps up at 25
pieces, and steadily declines thereafter. In contrast, the distribution of productivity for grape
harvesters (right) is relatively smooth throughout.


This visual analysis is supplemented by a more formal test based on a recently developed non-
parametric test for heaping for discrete data (Frandsen, 2017). This procedure was initially
designed to test for manipulation in the running variable in a regression discontinuity design,
but can be readily applied to testing for heaping, as in our context.21 The test is based on a
smoothness approximation around the threshold, but only relies on mass at the threshold and
immediately adjacent. Consistent with the theory and the visual evidence in the figures,
heaping just past the target productivity threshold is statistically significant and large in

21
  This test is the discrete analog to that of McCrary (2008), which breaks down because the local linear regression
requires a continuous support near the threshold. Given the discrete nature of worker output, especially around
the thresholds, we opt for the test by Frandsen.


                                                                                                                 14
magnitude in blueberries. Heaping for grapes is also statistically significant (p=0.015) – perhaps
due to workers responding to the salience created by the threshold (Locke et al., 1981, Locke
and Latham 1990) – but the magnitude of the displacement at the threshold is markedly
smaller than the one found in blueberries. The number of blueberry workers just beyond the
threshold increases by roughly 9 percentage points, whereas the corresponding measure for
grape workers is 1 percentage point.


4.B. Learning to Heap
We next explore learning-by-doing by examining how heaping evolves with tenure. We equate
learning-by-doing with days worked rather than pieces produced. Both measures are
potentially valid constructs: while workers learn from previous output, they also learn how to
pace themselves throughout the day, a concept captured by days worked. We opt for days
worked (or tenure) as the work experience variable because the particular day of work
(conditional on the number of completed days) is exogenous with respect to the contract while
the number of pieces is not.22


Under the blueberry contract, we expect workers to become more effective at reaching the
threshold as they gain experience on the job relative to grapes, where there is no salient bonus.
We explore experience profiles using figures similar to above but plotting them separately by
tenure with the farm in 2-day groupings.23 In Figure 5, which plots blueberry pickers, we see
strong evidence of increased heaping with tenure. Few blueberry pickers cross the threshold to
reach the bonus on their first two days of work. By days 3-4, the amount of heaping has clearly
increased, and continues to do so over the next several days. By the end of their second week
of work (roughly day 10), the degree of heaping appears relatively stable.



22
   We opt for estimating simple productivity growth models that are linear or quadratic in days worked, given our
setting and our key questions of interest. Other empirical work on human capital accumulation estimates more
complicated structures, including random productivity shocks and idiosyncratic persistent growth rates (see for
example, Abowd and Card 1989, Baker 1997, Guvenen 2007, Hause 1980, and McCurdy 1982, among many
others).
23
   We opted for 2-day groupings over 1-day for ease of exposition, though results are quite similar when
disaggregated.


                                                                                                                15
Figure 6 shows the same plots for grape pickers. Consistent with Figure 4, we see little evidence
of heaping regardless of tenure with the farm. These two figures are consistent with our theory
that heaping is a learned behavior that is largely limited to the blueberry contract, which offers
the bonus payment upon reaching the productivity target.


To test for the magnitude of these differences, we estimate tenure profiles for the probability
that a worker crosses the threshold on a given day, and allow these profiles to vary by crop. We
include controls as indicated below, experiment with different functional forms for the tenure
profile, and cluster standard errors by worker. Regression results are summarized in Table 2.


The first column includes just three regressors: a linear tenure profile, an indicator for crop, and
their interaction. We find that while both blueberry and grape pickers improve with additional
days of tenure, blueberry pickers improve faster. Grape pickers increase their probability of
meeting the piece rate threshold by 0.4 percentage points with each day of tenure, off their
base probability of 49% on their first day (the constant). The coefficient on the blueberry
indicator reveals that blueberry pickers are, on average, 31 percentage points (63%) less likely
to meet the piece rate threshold, compared to grape pickers. However, with each day of
tenure, blueberry pickers increase their probability of passing the threshold by an additional
percentage point beyond grape pickers, which is a roughly 3.5 times greater rate. This
difference is statistically significant at the 1% level. Our estimates imply that after 10 days,
blueberry pickers increase the likelihood of reaching the target by 15 percentage points (80%
off their base of 18%), while the likelihood for grape pickers only increases by 4 percentage
points (8% off their base of 49%).


The remaining columns of table 2 show that results are largely unchanged when we control for
tenure and its interaction with the crop more flexibly or when we control for worker gender




                                                                                                   16
and characteristics of the day of observation.24 Furthermore, the differential tenure profiles are
always statistically significant at the 1% level. With the quadratic-in-tenure specification and full
controls (column 4), we find that blueberry pickers increase their likelihood of meeting the
piece rate threshold by nearly 14 percentage points (116%) over their first 10 days, while grape
pickers improve by only 6 percentage points (12%).


4.C. Does Total Output Increase with Experience?
The increased heaping with tenure induced by the blueberry contract indicates one of two
phenomena: pickers learn how to produce more efficiently or pickers learn how to better game
the contract. The former is clearly more beneficial to the firm, while the latter could be
particularly costly. To better understand the relative role of each, we expand our focus beyond
the threshold to examine productivity throughout the distribution.


We begin by noting that a simple visual inspection of the histograms in Figure 5 suggest that
the increases in productivity amongst the more seasoned workers is not simply about gaming
since the entire productivity distributions appear to shift rightward as workers gain experience.
These shifts are especially pronounced in the first two rows, as workers make visible
improvements in productivity.


To further probe learning under the blueberry contract, we turn our attention to the starting
performance of workers who eventually hit the threshold. If most of the workers who
eventually hit the threshold had a starting performance just below the threshold, then it would
suggest that workers are largely learning to game the contract and all productivity gains will be
quite marginal. If, on the other hand, many of those that eventually reach the threshold had a
starting performance far from the threshold, then we would infer that workers have made
substantial improvements in their productivity.


24
  Gender controls include indicators for male and female, with missing gender as the omitted category. Date
controls are day of week, week of harvest, and first and last day of harvest fixed effects. Including these controls
does flatten the tenure profile for blueberries somewhat, which reflects the fact that tenure is correlated with the
period in the harvest when crops are more plentiful (Stevens, 2017).


                                                                                                                  17
Figure 7 illustrates the relationship between initial productivity and the likelihood of reaching
the bonus threshold. In this figure, we plot performance distributions for the first three days
for blueberry pickers (left) and grape pickers (right). The histograms in the top panel show
productivity for workers who do not reach the bonus threshold on days 10-12, and the bottom
panel shows productivity for workers who reach or exceed the bonus threshold at least once on
days 10-12.25


For blueberries, we find that workers who eventually reach the threshold come from all along
the distribution, similar to those who do not reach the threshold on days 10-12. The
distribution centers around 15 pieces (approximately 9 pieces below the threshold), indicating
that these workers achieve substantial growth over their early days of experience. Further,
blueberry pickers who eventually meet the threshold do not come from just below the
threshold itself, as evidenced by the missing mass just to the left of the threshold. Turning to
grapes, eventual threshold hitters are quite similar to the right of the threshold but there is less
mass to the left of the threshold, suggesting the workers come from a higher part of the
distribution to begin with. That blueberry workers experience considerable improvements in
the lower tail of the distribution while grape workers do not provides further support for our
contention that the learning for blueberry pickers is contract induced.


We can take a more systematic look at this learning by plotting the number of pieces picked at
each decile of the output distribution by tenure separately for blueberries and grapes; we show
this in figure 8, where darker lines represent workers with less experience. For blueberry
workers (left), the lines monotonically shift upward with tenure, indicating that more
experienced workers perform better than less experienced workers throughout the
distribution. More specifically, a bottom performing experienced worker performs better than a
bottom performing new worker, as does a middle-performing or top-performing experienced


25
  We choose day 1-3 and 10-12 windows to reduce noise in day-to-day performance. However, graphs restricted
to single days or pairs of days look similar.


                                                                                                          18
worker compared to middle or top performing new workers, respectively. In other words, each
distribution stochastically dominates the tenure group just below it.


Note that most of the output distribution is below the piece rate threshold (shown by the
horizontal line), for all experience levels. Thus, workers all along the distribution appear to
improve, even those quite far from the heaping region around the threshold. Across the full
tenure range plotted, growth in daily output for blueberry pickers ranges from 4 to 8 pieces,
depending on the percentile. Since this figure is restricted to workers who survive at least 10
days, sample composition cannot explain the improvement of new workers.


For grapes (right) the pattern is quite different. Improvements over the first 10 days are small,
between 1 and 2 pieces, depending on where they fall in the distribution. The largest
improvements occur for the bottom two deciles. Grape pickers appear to experience less
learning throughout the productivity distribution than their blueberry picker counterparts who
face the commission plus bonus contract.


Table 3 provides further evidence on this pattern, but with a better understanding of statistical
significance. We estimate quantile regressions of output at each quintile of the daily
performance distribution. Output is normalized by crop to have mean zero and standard
deviation one to account for the differences in the output distributions between grapes and
blueberries. (We later explore other normalizations.) For each quintile, we regress output on a
quadratic in tenure, a blueberry dummy, and interactions between the two. This allows us to
assess whether improvements with tenure differ across crops at various points in the
performance distribution. Regressions include full controls from table 2 and again cluster
standard errors by worker.


The results indicate that output improves at the bottom of the performance distribution (20 th
percentile) for both grape and blueberry pickers. Over the first 10 days, we estimate that the
20th percentile improves by 0.25 of a standard deviation (about 2 pieces) for grape pickers. This



                                                                                                  19
improvement is statistically indistinguishable from that of the blueberry tenure profile; the
bottom part of the performance distribution improves at roughly the same rate across crops.


At all other parts of the distribution, however, the performance-tenure profiles are steeper for
blueberry pickers than for grape pickers. Further, these differences are statistically
distinguishable at the 5% level or better. Over the first 10 days of tenure, blueberry pickers
improve by roughly 0.3 to 0.4 standard deviations (or 2-3 pieces) at the 40th, 60th, and 80th
percentiles. In contrast, the tenure profiles for grape pickers in this part of the distribution are
essentially flat.


Figure 9 provides a graphical illustration of the results from Table 3 by plotting the fitted 10-day
productivity changes based on the tenure and crop coefficients. We estimate profiles for each
decile (rather than quintile) of the productivity distribution to better illustrate where the
pattern emerges. We do this for 3 different outcomes: pieces (top left), standardized pieces, as
in Table 3 (top right), and the “latent wage” of each crop (bottom left), which normalizes the
outcome by the crop-specific piece rate.26


Consistent with Table 3 and Figure 7, we find performance for blueberry pickers improves by a
similar amount throughout the distribution. For grapes, improvements only occur at the
bottom of the distribution, with those toward the top of the distribution showing little
improvement over the first 2 weeks of experience. The gap in profiles between blueberries and
grapes becomes statistically significant at the 30th percentiles for standardized pieces and the
latent wage, and at the median for pieces.


The evidence on learning presented thus far has used the worker-day as the unit of analysis. As
such, some of our conclusions may have been driven by changes in the composition of workers
at each point in the productivity distribution. In Appendix Table A1 we reproduce the analysis


26
 Specifically, the latent wage is computed by multiplying the piece rate by the number of pieces regardless of
whether the minimum wage applies.


                                                                                                                 20
based on standardized pieces from Table 3 by analyzing learning-by-doing at the individual
worker level. Reassuringly, we find similar results. Grape pickers who begin at the bottom of
the productivity distribution display improvements with tenure, but the improvements for
blueberry pickers are significantly steeper and exist for all quintiles of starting performance.27


Together, these results paint a picture consistent with the insights from our conceptual model.
The commission plus bonus contract leads to considerable heaping and the bonus creates
stronger incentives to learn as blueberry pickers strive to reach the threshold. Empirically,
those learning incentives lead to improvements throughout the productivity distribution of
blueberry workers.




4.D. Does the Bonus Pay for Itself?
As described earlier, the heaping phenomenon under the bonus contract is costly to the firm
since very small changes in output around the threshold lead to sizable changes in payoff. The
commission only contract does not have this feature. One way to illustrate these differences is
to plot the average price the firm must pay out per piece harvested for each crop as a function
of a worker’s daily output, shown in Figure 10.28


By definition, the price per piece for blueberries jumps up discretely at 25 pieces, while for
grapes the line is smooth around their piece rate threshold (32). When a blueberry picker
produces 25 pieces instead of 24, the firm must pay out a $12.50 bonus. If the contract only
induced this shift at the threshold, labor costs alone would dissolve almost the entire $14
revenue per piece; any other costs would likely render this extra unit of output unprofitable to
the farm.




27
  These results are qualitatively similar when we use the other normalization approaches taken in Table 3.
28
  For clarity, the graph omits the 1% of observations where workers produce less than 8 pieces per day. Price per
piece for these workers ranges from $64 for workers who pick only one piece to $9.14 for those who pick 7.


                                                                                                               21
However, a different story emerges when we step away from the threshold and look at the pay
schedules across the entire distribution. Importantly, price per piece steadily declines in daily
output for both blueberries and grapes. The decline is steeper below the productivity target
because the payout is fixed with respect to output (due to the guaranteed minimum wage).
Price per piece still declines after the threshold since, although the firm pays out a piece rate,
they continue to amortize the fixed wage over a larger number of pieces. The declines in price
per piece at low levels of output are much larger than the discrete increase for blueberries at
the productivity target. For example, at 8 pieces per day, the firm must pay out $8 per piece,
which is more than half the revenue from selling each piece. If a worker improves from 8 pieces
per day to 12 (4 pieces is the typical improvement over 10 days at most points in the
distribution, see figure 8), the firm saves $3 on each piece produced, which is one-quarter of
the revenue the firm receives for it. In contrast, a move from 24 to 25 pieces increases the
average price per piece by only $0.40.


The firm thus makes large revenue gains if their contract induces low-end workers to improve
their performance. The previous section highlighted the fact that blueberry workers under the
bonus contract exhibit considerable learning on the job throughout the productivity
distribution. As such, one reason firms might offer a bonus contract that leads to costly
heaping is that it also leads to beneficial improvements by increasing the productivity of the
costliest and least productive workers. The question is whether the productivity improvements
at the low end dominate the inefficient heaping just above the piece rate threshold.


To assess this trade-off, we perform a simple back of the envelope calculation. As a benchmark,
we begin with grapes. Comparing workers with less than 4 days on the job to those with 10
days, we find that average output increases by 1.4 pieces (from 31.4 to 32.8). At the same time,
the firm must pay out $0.30 to $0.35 for each piece picked above the threshold. We already
know this cost is small – reaching the threshold is minimally related to experience (table 2) and
that productivity does not improve by much for workers above the threshold (table 3 and figure
9). Empirically, this cost change averages only $0.05. On average, the firm gets an additional 1.4



                                                                                                     22
pieces per worker at a cost of $0.05. When factoring in the price per piece that the firm can
expect to receive for its output ($0.33 per pound at 5 pounds per piece), we find that profits
increase by $2.26 per worker for a worker with 10 days of experience relative to one in his first
3 days.


For blueberries the calculation differs on both sides: production increases by substantially
more, as do costs. Comparing workers with less than 4 days on the job to those with 10 days,
average output increases by nearly 5 pieces (from 16.4 to 21.2). At the same time, the extra 10
days of experience appreciably increases a blueberry picker’s chance of surpassing the
threshold (by 24 percentage points), requiring the firm to pay out $12 dollars when this
happens, plus $0.50 on each additional piece picked above the threshold. Empirically, these
improvements increase costs by $3.40 per worker, on average. Thus, the firm gets an average
of nearly 5 additional pieces for an average cost of $3.40 per worker. Factoring in the larger
revenue the firm receives per blueberry bucket, the firm can expect a little over $60 per worker
in profits for blueberries for a worker with 10 days of experience relative to one with less than
4, which is approximately $9 per worker per day. Thus, it appears that the improvement in
output induced by the bonus contract is extremely profitable for the firm, even though the
bonus payment is ‘locally’ distortionary at the productivity threshold.


5. Additional Results
In this section we probe the mechanisms through which workers improve their productivity and
examine alternative explanations for our results.


5A. Improvements in picking speed or avoiding burn-out?
To explore possible mechanisms through which blueberry workers improve their productivity,
we utilize the subset of workers for whom we have hourly productivity data to investigate two
possible stories. One possibility is that more experienced workers become more competent at
the physical act of picking blueberries. In this case, we expect productivity for more
experienced workers to be higher throughout the day. An alternate explanation is that more



                                                                                                 23
experienced workers become better at pacing themselves. In this case, we expect output of the
less experienced workers to decrease towards the end of the day.


In Figure 11, we plot hourly productivity for blueberry harvesters by tenure profiles in roughly
3-day bins (1-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-10, and 10+). The figure shows output in each hour of the day from
6am to 2pm. We find that productivity at all hours of the day increases with tenure. For those
with 10 or more days of tenure, productivity is nearly 50% higher at all hours of the day
compared to those with less than 3 days. The other workers lie in between these groups. We
find little evidence of fatigue for any tenure group, as output does not decline throughout the
day.29 This suggests workers become more competent at picking blueberries with more
experience.


5B. Alternative Explanations
Our empirical work takes advantage of the different contract regimes across crops. We find
substantially more learning-by-doing for blueberry pickers than for grape pickers and attribute
this to the different contract regimes. However, there may be other differences across the two
crops that generate these results.


First, perhaps less scope for learning exists in grapes compared to blueberries. While we cannot
rule this out entirely, we note that Tables 2 and 3 show some improvements with tenure for
grape pickers, with figures 8 and 9 showing these improvements coming from the bottom of
the performance distribution. Also, figure 4 shows substantial heterogeneity in grape picker
performance, with the best producers out-picking the worst by a factor of 3-4, comparable to
the variation in blueberries. Thus, there appears to be scope for productivity improvements in
grape harvesting.




29
   In fact, we see some evidence of an uptick in productivity in the last hour of the day. This is likely driven by a
late surge in effort for workers close to the threshold.


                                                                                                                        24
Second, one may worry about another form of gaming: workers sharing their pickings with each
other to maximize group payoffs. We cannot fully rule out this explanation, but oversight by
field supervisors is meant to limit this sort of behavior. To the extent that it could occur, it is
generally only incentive compatible between workers who have already crossed the
productivity target and those just shy of it. This would amplify heaping but is unlikely to explain
productivity shifts at other parts of the distribution. If a worker above the productivity target
offers a piece to a worker who does not reach the target, she is losing the piece rate the farm
would have given her. Meanwhile, the worker who accepts the piece remains in the fixed wage
regime and is not receiving additional compensation. There may be other possible gaming
opportunities in the field, but they would have to take a very specific form to explain our
finding that output improves at all parts of the performance distribution for blueberry but not
for grape pickers.


Finally, workers may non-randomly sort into crops such that those least able to succeed with
the commission plus bonus contract select into grapes instead of blueberries. To explore this
hypothesis, we take advantage of the fact that we observe 7% of our workers in both grapes
and blueberries. A worker in the spring/early summer blueberry season might stay on for the
late summer/fall grape harvest, or a grape worker may return for blueberries the following
year. Among workers in multiple crops, two-thirds start out in blueberries and one-third start
out in grapes, which is not surprising given the longer time lag from grapes to blueberries.


Appendix figure A1 shows productivity histograms for workers in both crops, separately by
current crop and tenure. These histograms look quite similar to those previously presented. In
the top panel, we see little heaping for blueberry pickers with low tenure (top) but considerable
heaping for those with high tenure (bottom). In the right panels, we see that neither low nor
high tenure grape pickers heap. That those with prior experience in another crop perform
similarly to those native to that crop suggests that worker selection is not driving our results.


6. Conclusion



                                                                                                      25
Pay-for-performance compensation schemes are used across a wide range of industries and
occupations. Even contracts that offer a fixed salary may be implicitly tied to performance by
promotion and termination incentives (Lazear, 2000). Firms offer performance-based pay to
motivate workers to supply costly effort, but they may accomplish more than simply inducing
employees to work harder in applying their existing skill set. A large body of literature has
focused on undesirable outcomes induced by performance-based pay, such as gaming. In this
paper we propose that such contracts may also induce workers to acquire new skills that make
them better at their job, a much more desirable outcome from the firm’s perspective.


We exploit a unique panel dataset on individual worker productivity to provide the first
empirical evidence on the impacts of performance-based compensation schemes, and
particularly the use of bonus payments, for on-the-job learning. We find that contracts with
bonuses tied to productivity targets generate faster learning-by-doing than those induced by a
simple commission scheme. Moreover, these productivity improvements are not simply limited
to those close to the bonus threshold. Instead, learning occurs throughout the productivity
distribution. We find that the costly heaping induced by the highly nonlinear bonus structure is
more than offset by the overall gains in productivity from those well below the bonus
threshold.


This set of results is important for several reasons. Firms collectively spend billions of dollars
each year on research and development in a quest for technologies that can help improve firm
productivity and profitability. At the same time, they also invest considerable sums in human
resource management to both monitor and train workers to better utilize these new, as well as
older, technologies. In our setting, compensation schemes designed to incentivize effort also
play an important role in learning and skill acquisition by workers. This suggests such incentives
may be an important tool to add to the armamentarium of instruments used to improve firm
productivity across many different settings.




                                                                                                     26
The dynamic implications of learning-by-doing also raise new and interesting questions about
the design of contracts aimed at addressing principal-agent problems. While performance-
based pay can induce workers to supply costly effort, it can also affect learning. After all, if a
skill learned is not easily forgotten (Friedman and Kelman, 2007), and skills are quite
transferrable across occupations, then moral hazard in effort is likely to be much stronger than
in learning. On the other hand, if learning-by-doing is itself quite costly and slows down output,
depreciates quickly, or is firm-specific, then the opposite may be true. Understanding the
conditions under which the incentives to induce learning-by-doing are complements or
substitutes to those needed to induce imperfectly observed effort is fundamental for optimal
contract design.


While our results point to the importance of bonus payments and performance targets for
learning on the job, there are many unanswered questions. How important is the salience of
these goals versus the actual monetary payoff for incentivizing workers to become increasingly
skilled in their jobs? What are the criteria shaping optimal bonus target setting? A low target
will only provide low-powered incentives for learning and may lead to too much inefficient
heaping, while a high target may also induce little learning should most workers feel the bonus
is beyond their reach. Given the ubiquity of bonus contracts across sectors that include sales,
corporate executives, and even physicians, how might these results generalize? Together, they
comprise a future research agenda that can create stronger connections between two
fundamental but under-linked literatures in economics.

Notes: Darker colors indicate newer workers. Circle = tenure < 4 days, X = tenure 4-6 days, square = tenure 7-9

distribution of pickers by crop and tenure group. There is no sample restriction based on completed tenure,
though each line is restricted to the indicated tenure group, and we still exclude workers not in their first crop. The
piece rate threshold for blueberry (grape) pickers is 25 (32), indicated with a horizontal line.

Notes: Solid = blueberries, hollow = grapes. Capped vertical lines indicate 90% confidence intervals. Using quantile
regression, we estimate quadratic tenure profiles interacted with crop, for each performance decile, controlling for
gender, day-of-week, week-of-harvest, and first/last harvest day. We plot fitted effects for the 10th day along with
90% confidence intervals. There is no sample restriction based on completed tenure, though we still exclude
workers not in their first crop. Vertical lines indicate the point in the distribution where the piece rate thresholds
are for each crop (blueberry line is solid, grape line is dashed). Standardized pieces (top right) are pieces normed to
be mean 0, standard deviation 1, within crop. Latent Wage (bottom left) are the number of pieces times the piece
rate ($0.50 for blueberries, $0.30 or $0.35 for grapes).

Notes: Table reports means (and standard deviations) for the full sample of workers, regardless of completed
tenure. Pieces is the number of blueberry buckets or grape boxes (as indicated) picked in the day. The piece rate
threshold is 32 for blueberries and 25 for grapes. Daily earnings normalizes to an 8-hour work day.

Notes: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. See table 2. We regress an indicator for whether the worker hit his piece
rate threshold on the given day. The threshold for grapes is 32 pieces and the threshold for blueberries is 25. There
is no sample restriction based on completed tenure, though we still exclude workers not in their first crop. Gender
controls are indicators for male and female (with missing gender as the omitted category). Date controls include
day of week, week of harvest, and first and last day of harvest indicators. Standard errors are clustered by worker.
