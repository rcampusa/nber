                                           ABSTRACT



We study the effects of aggregate and idiosyncratic uncertainty on the entry of firms, total

investment, and prices in a competitive industry with irreversible investment. We first use

standard dynamic programming methods to determine firms' entry decisions, and we describe

the resulting industry equilibrium and its characteristics, emphasizing the effects of different

sources of uncertainty. We then show how the conditional distribution of prices can be used as

an alternative means of determining and understanding the behavior of firms and the resulting

industry equilibrium. Finally, we use four-digit U.S. manufacturing data to examine some

implications of the model.

1 Introduction.
Most investment expenditures are at least in part irreversible, i.e., are sunk costs that cannot
be recovered should market conditions change adversely. As a result, the cost of making an
investment includes not only the expenditure itself, but also an opportunity cost associated
with comrniting resources rather than waiting for new information to arrive. A growing
literature has shown how this opportunity cost can be evaluated, and demonstrated that it is
highly sensitive to uncertainty over future project values, so that changing market conditions
that affect the riskiness of future cash flows can have a large impact on investment spending.
These results emphasize the role of uncertainty as a determinant of investment spending,
and suggest that policies that reduce volatility (over, say, exchange rates, prices, or interest
rates) may lower the required cost of capital.'
    In most of the recent literature, the emphasis is on the investment decisions of an indi-
vidual firm, rather than industry-wide investment and growth, and uncertainty is modelled
by introducing an exogenous state variable (e.g., a demand or cost shift parameter, the price
of the firm's output, or the interest rate) that follows some stochastic process. However,
similar effects of uncertainty on investment can be found at the industry level. The reasons
for these effects, however, may not be the same.
    What always matters for investment are the distributions of future values of the marginal
revenue product of capital —         if these distributions are symmetric (and the firm is risk-
neutral), increasing uncertainty will not affect investment. For a monopolist, irreversibility
causes the distributions to be asymmetric because the firm cannot disinvest in the future
if negative shocks arrive; hence the firm invests less today to reduce the frequency of bad
outcomes in the future (i.e., the frequency of situations in which the firm has more capital
than desired). On the other hand, in a competitive industry with constant returns to scale,

    1McDonald and Siegel (1986) were among the first to demonstrate the implications of irreversibility for
investment decisions. Other examples of this literature include Bertola and Caballero (1990) Dixit (1989b),
Maid and Pindyck (1987), and Pindyck (1988). For an overview, see Dixit (1992) and Pindyck (1991). The
earlier literature on investment under uncertainty, e.g., Hartman (1972) and Abel (1983), demonstrates how
uncertainty will increase the expected value of a marginal unit of capital if the marginal revenue product of
capital is a convex function of the stochastic variable (an implication of Jensen's inequality), and thereby
increase investment.
the distribution of future marginal revenue products is independent of the firm's current
investment. But this distribution is not independent of industry-wide investment if the
elasticity of demand faced by the industry is less than infinite.
   As a result, when studying irreversible investment in an industry context, it is important
to distinguish between aggregate (i.e., industry-wide) and idiosyncratic (firm-level) shocks.
To see this, consider idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks to productivity that are both sym-
metrically distributed. Although either type of shock might affect the expected future market
price and hence the expected tharginal revenue product of capital, the idiosyncratic shocks
will lead to a symmetric probability distribution for the marginal revenue product.2 Ag-
gregate shocks, however, will not; although negative shocks can reduce the market price,
positive shocks will be accompanied by the entry of new firms and/or expansion of existing
firms, which will limit any increases in price. As a result, the distribution of outcomes for
individual firms is truncated; negative shocks to productivity will reduce profits more than
positive shocks will increase them, and irreversible investment will be reduced accordingly.3
An important objective of this paper is therefore to clarify the different mechanisms through
aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks interact with irreversibility in a competitive industry.
   Uncertainty affects irreversible investment in two ways — first, through the effect of the
firm's current investment on the expected path of its marginal revenue product of capital,
and second, through the effects of competitors' investment on the path of the firm's marginal
revenue product. Caballero (1991) has shown that with constant returns to scale, the impor-
tance of the first effect decreases as the demand curve facing the firm becomes more elastic,
as long as the uncertainty is firm-specific. However, this does not mean that industry-level
uncertainty will not affect industry investment and output in a competitive equilibrium. As
shown by Pindyck (1992), irreversibility will have the same type of effect on industry invest-
ment as it would for a monopolist once one allows for entry of new firms or the expansion of
existing ones. The reason for this is that irreversibility combined with the possibility of entry

   2For simplicity, we sce ignoring the effect of uncertsinty through the convexity of the msrginsl revenue
product of cspitsl, as stressed by Hsrtmsn (1972).
   3This is an example of the 'bad news principle" discussed by Bernanke (t983).

affects the distribution of marginal revenue products seen by each individual firm. Hence
another objective of this paper is to fully characterize the distribution of marginal revenue
product and its evolution, and show how that distribution affects entry, investment, and the
price level itself.
    Our work extends and complements recent work by Dixit (1989a), Leahy (1991), and
others. Dixit characterizes industry evolution in the presence of aggregate uncertainty by
using dynamic programming methods to determine the entry and exit decisions of individual
firms of discrete size. Leahy models an industry equilibrium in which price is endogenous,
and shows that under reasonable assumptions, it is optimal for individual firms to make
their investment decisions under the myopic assumption that price follows an exogenous
lognormal random walk.4 In the first part of this paper we follow an approach similar
to that used by these authors, but emphasizing the effects on entry of different sources
of uncertainty. We then go on to show how the conditional distribution of prices can be
used as an alternative way to characterize the behavior of individual firms, and thereby
determine the industry equilibrium. This provides insight into the nature of an equilibrium
with irreversible investment.
    We examine the different effects of idiosyncratic and aggregate uncertainty using a simple
model of a competitive market in which firms have constant returns to scale and there is
a sunk cost of entry. In the next section, we frame the model as a dynamic programming
problem, and we obtain a solution and examine its properties. In Section 3 we re-frame
the problem in terms of the conditional distribution of the marginal revenue product. We
calculate the time path for this distribution, and show how it provides additional insight
into the effects of uncertainty on investment and industry evolution. In Section 4 we use
four-digit U.S. manufacturing data to examine some of the implications of the model, and
to gauge the importance of uncertainty for industry investment. Section 5 concludes, and
discusses some possible extensions of our work.

   41n related studies, Lippman and Rumelt (1985) model a competitive industry equilibrium with free
entry and exit, and Dixit (1991) characterizes the equilibrium for a cnmpetitive industry with irreversible
investment and a price ceiling.

2 A Stylized Model.
We begin by constructing a highly stylized model in which the value of a marginal unit of
capital is stochastic and exogenous. For simplicity, we formulate the model in a way that
eliminates the conventional positive Jensen's inequality effect of uncertainty on the value
of a marginal unit of capital that arises from the endogenous response of variable factors
to exogenous shocks. This lets us focus on the way in which the effects of uncertainty are
mediated through the equilibrium behavior of all firms.
    We consider a market with a large number of "productive units." Each productive unit
might he a single firm, or individual firms might each own several productive units. These
productive units are industry specific, so that their installation involves a sunk cost. Entry
occurs when new productive units are added, either because new firms invest and enter
the market, or existing firms invest in new capacity. What matters is that idiosyncratic
shocks apply to these productive units individually, i.e., the units all have the same expected
productivity, but will have randomly differing realized productivities.5 To clarify the ways
in which uncertainty affects investment, we will assume that the owners and managers of
these units are risk-neutral.6
    We will assume that these productive units are small enough and the number of them is
large enough so that we can represent them as a continuum whose mass at time                        is N(.t).
Total industry output, Q(t), is given by:
                                                     NO)
                                          Q(t) = j   A1(t)di                                              (1)

where A(t) is the output of productive unit i at time 1. The A1's are assumed to follow arbi-
trary and possibly correlated exogenous stochastic processes. We decompose these individual
productivity variables into two parts, their average (the aggregate) and the remainders:
                                                              NO)
                       A(t) = A(t)a1(i),        such that f         cs(i) ds = N(t).

        could think of these productive units as coffee trees, where each firm can plant one or more trees.
While the expected productivity of each tree is the same, the realized productivity of each tree will differ.
   6Then the investment rules we derive maximize firms' values in a competitive financial market, whether
or nut idiosyncratic or aggregate shocks are spanned by the set of traded assets in the economy.
Here A(t) is the average productivity of the industry, so that Q(t) = A(t)N(t), and a,(i) is
the productivity of unit i relative to that of the industry as a whole.
   We allow for one idiosyncratic and two aggregate sources of uncertainty. First, we let a(t)
and A(t) follow separate stochastic processes, so that productivity has both an idiosyncratic
and an aggregate component. Second, we introduce another source of aggregate uncertainty
through the industry demand curve. Industry demand is taken to be isoelastic:

                                         P(t) = M(t)Q(t),                                                 (2)

where M(i) is an exogenous stochastic process that captures aggregate shocks. We will
assume that M(t) follows a diffusion.
   The measure of industry size, N(t), increases with entry and decreases with "failures,"
i.e., the (involuntary) removal of productive units. We assume that the latter occurs at an
exogenous proportional rate y. At the level of an individual unit, a "failure" is a Poisson
arrival, and the intensity of the Poisson process is -y.7 Alternatively, we could have assumed
a deterministic depreciation rate -y that applies to all units; our results (from eqn. (4) below
onwards) would be the same.
   To introduce irreversibility, we assume that entry of a productive unit requires a sunk cost
F. Free entry determines that there are no profits to be made by adding another productive
unit to the industry, so that:

                                 F E {E0 [J°° P(i)A,(i)e6t dt] } ,                                        (3)

which holds with equality at all times in which there is entry. The parameter 5 is the discount
rate. Note that the expectation E is over all unit-specific uncertainty, which includes the
stochastic productivity process a,(t) as well as the Poisson failure process for each unit. The
expectation E0 is over the distribution of the future marginal revenue product of capital,
P(t)A1(), and therefore accounts for the possible (irreversible) entry of new productive
units. As will become evident, the ability to enter the industry reduces the probability of

   71t would be more realistic, of course, to make the Poisson arrival rate depend on the age of the specific
unit. ifowever, that complicates the model but adds little additional insight.


                                                      5
good outcomes by truncating the upper part of the distribution for the aggregate component
of P(t)A(t), namely P(t)A(t).
   By Fubini's theorem and the construction of A(t) we can pass the expectation operator
E, inside the integral in eqn. (3), so that it reduces to:

                                 F E0 [j P(t)A(t)e5t dt] .                                   (4)

Note that the only idiosyncratic effect that remains in (4) is the failure rate y, and this
is now indistinguishable from an industry-wide depreciation rate. Because the value of the
output of each unit is linear in the output-specific stochastic state variable, we can eliminate
all other idiosyncratic elements from the right-hand side of eqn. (3). This is an extreme
result, and it holds because we have assumed that there is no selective entry; i.e. potential
entrants cannot choose the distribution for their idiosyncratic shock.
    Since Q(t) = A(t)N(t), we can use the market demand equation to construct a measure
of the value of output for an average productive unit. Letting B(t) denote the average value
of output:
                            B(t)      P(1)A(t) =   M(t)A(t)N(t)*                             (5)

Because the industry size N(1) is endogenous, B(t) will follow a regulated stochastic pro-
cess. where N(t) regulates B(t). Letting lower case letters represent the logarithm of the
corresponding variable, we can write:

                     diog B(t)     db(t) = dm(t)
                                                       l1I
                                                   + (2---- da(t) — !dn(t).
                                                                       7)

    In order to obtain analytical results that can be used to illustrate the implications of
                                                                                             (6)


different sources of uncertainty, we will make the simplifying assumption that the aggregate
stochastic state variables follow geometric Brownian motions. Thus, we write the dynamics
of m(t) and a(t) as:

                             dns(i)       (csm —        dt + mdzm(t)                         (7)

                              da(t) = (. —             dt +   odz(t)                         (8)

We will also assume that the Wiener processes dzm(t) and dz(t) are uncorrelated. (It is easy
to relax this assumption.) Then B(t) will follow a particularly simple regulated geometric

                                                   6
Brownian motion. Specifically, B(i) will remain at or below a fixed upper boundary. This
fixed boundary, which we denote by U, is yet to be determined as part of an industry
equilibrium. Regulation is due to entry; when this is not occurring, n(t)        log(N(t)) will
follow:

                                      dn(t) =
and b(i) is given by:

                                  db(i) = f3di + odz(i),                                    (9)
where
                         9=

                                   = sJ+ (2__)o.
   This model is simple enough so that we can find a closed form solution for the optimal
investment rule, i.e., for the upper boundary U. (Later we will see how the entire problem
can be recast in terms of the conditional distribution of marginal revenue product.) Let
W(x) denote the value of entering the industry at t =    0   when b(0) = x, so that B(0) = ez:

                         W(x) =   j e''Eo[B(i)IB(O) = e] di.                               (10)

By arbitrage, over an interval dt, the total expected return from being in the industry
must be equal to (6 + 'y)Wdi. This expected return has two components, an expected
capital gain, E0dW, and a flow of revenue B(0)dt =           exdt.   By Ito's Lemma, E0dW =
f3W'(x)dt + W"(x)di, so W(z) must satisfy the following differential equation:

                        oW"(x) + $W'(z) —(5 + 7)W(x) +? = 0.                               (11)

In addition, W(z) must satisfy the following boundary conditions:

                                      lirnW(z)=0,                                          (12)

and
                                        W'(u)=0,                                           (13)

                                                7
where u = logU. Boundary condition(12) follows from the fact that 0 is an absorbing
boundary for B. Condition (13) is the value matching/smooth pasting condition that holds
at the trigger point
    The reader can check that eqn. (11) has the following simple solution that satisfies the
associated boundary conditions:

                                                                                        (15)
                                                o.2
A sufficient condition for the existence of this solution is that the discount rate be large
enough so that the value of a unit remains bounded even if entry into the industry were
prohibited throughout the future. Specifically, we require that 5 +    — — o/2 > 0, i.e.,
8> m + 1(a —           y)   —     This ensures that A> I.
    We can now determine U, the upper boundary of B(t). If we had-solved this as a central
planning problem, we would determine U from the first-order ("super contact") condition
that W"(U) = 0. Instead, we will follow Leahy (1991) and use the free entry condition,
which in this case is F = W(u). Hence:

                                   = --(S +           --.                               (16)

Because of free entry, E0 j° B(t)e_(&4_h)tdt = F, where t = 0 is the time of entry. Since
U    E0[B(t)] for all t and U > E0[B(t)] for all t > 0, we know that E0fg° Ue&)tdt > F.
This is a result of irreversibility; there is an opportunity cost of investing now rather than
waiting for new information. If firms could "uninvest" and recoup the cost F, we would
instead have the standard Marshallian result that E0 f'° U&(o1)tdi = F.
    For simplicity of exposition, in what follows we will assume that aggregate productivity
is constant, so that a, = = 0. (Note that then o = o,,.) Recall that am and o represent
the mean and the standard deviation of the rate of growth of revenue per productive unit
averaged over the industry when there is no entry. With tedious calculation, one can show
that 8(U/F)/dob > 0 and d(U/F)/dcrm < 0. A smaller value of am raises U/F because

                                               S
given any value of U/F, it implies a lower expected price and therefore less entry is needed
to satisfy the zero profit condition. (This is discussed further below.) A higher value of o,
raises U/F by increasing the opportunity cost of investing, and thereby raising the threshold
required for a firm to commit the sunk cost F. But note that it is only aggregate uncertainty
that matters; U/F is unaffected by idiosyncratic shocks. Figure 1 shows this dependence of
U/F on cs,, and cb.
   One can also show that ô(U/F)/ > 0, and ô(U/F)/ô6 > 0. An increase in the
elasticity of demand, q, implies that the potentially positive effect of the failing units on
the price is reduced. This lowers expected revenue flow and hence raises the threshold
required for investment. An increase in 5 likewise raises the threshold by directly lowering
the expected present value of returns and by increasing the opportunity cost of investing in
the unit now, rather than waiting and discounting the expenditure F, As for o(U/F)/o, the
discounting effect described above again holds (capital depreciates faster when 'y is larger).
However, there is an offsetting effect from the increased depreciation of the capital of other
firms, which tends to raise the expected industry price as seen from the time of entry. The
first effect dominates for most reasonable parameter values.
   We can now describe the behavior of industry investment, output, and price in equilib-
rium. Suppose, for example, that aggregate demand increases. Then entry of new productive
units will occur, so that price will rise only to the point that P(t)A(t) = U. Figures 2A, 2B,
and 2C illustrate this by showing a particular sample path for industry'evolution for two
values of a,,,, .15 and .30. (In this simulation, the other parameters are i = 2, am           .02,
a, = 0',, = 0, y = .03, 5 = .06, and F = 100.)   The top graph shows the log of the stochastic
driving force, rn(t). (The realization for z(t) is the same for the two lines, but the values
of a are different.) Figure 2B shows the log of the number of productive units, n(t). Note
that when m(t) is falling (e.g., between t =     12   and 18), there is little or no investment, so
n(i) falls due to failures (or depreciation). For i > 18, in(t) is generally rising, and so entry
occurs and n(t) rises.
   Figure 2C shows the realization for the log of price, p(L). Note that p(t) appears station-
ary; that is because we have set a = o, = 0 for all t, so that A(t) =      1   always. (Hence price

                                                 9
is equal to the average revenue per productive unit, which is the relevant state variable for
the decision-making unit. In the more general case, b(t) would follow the same pattern as in
Figure 20, and p(t) would be the sum of b(t) and a Brownian motion.) As the figure illus-
trates, during "recessions," i.e., when rn(t)   is   falling, price will also fall, and will fall farther
when Cb is larger. But during "good times," p(t) is generally higher when Ub is larger- The
reason is that with a larger c, there is a greater chance of deeper "recessions," so during
"good times" firms wait longer before entering, n is smaller, and p is higher.
   Underlying all of these results is a forecast of future revenues by firms that are considering
entry. In fact, this forecast (which must take into account entry by other firms) completely
determines the decision to enter. Hence, looking directly at the expected value of future
revenues, and their dependence on the underlying parameters, helps to understand industry
evolution. We turn to this in the next section.


3 The Price Distribution and Entry.
In the previous section we found the optimal investment rule in the standard way — by
using dynamic programming to calculate the the firm's value function. In general, this
approach is useful in that studying the local (in time) behavior of the value function allows
one to fully characterize complex dynamic problems. Problems in which the optimal or
competitive outcome consists of regulating a Brownian motion, as in the model developed
in the previous section, are good examples of this. Value matching, smooth pasting and the
Bellman equation are all intuitive properties arising from this local analysis.
   However, dynamic programming sometimes conceals the economic intuition as to how
changes in parameters affect optimal policies. For example, eqn. (10) defined the value
function, W(x), as the expected present value of the flow of marginal revenue product.
Thus, any effects of changes in the variance or drift parameters on the value function, and
therefore on the optimal investment rule, must come through their effects on either the
path of the expected marginal revenue product or the discount rate. Those effect, however,
remained somewhat hidden in our solution to the problem in the previous section. In this


                                                     10
section we look at the expected path of marginal revenue directly and show how it is affected
by the underlying parameters.8
    To do this, we need to derive the conditional probability density for b, which we denote
by f(b, t). Since we know that a firm will enter only when b(t) = u, we can replace x by u in
eqn. (10). Hence f(b, t) is the probability density of Ii at a time t from the moment of entry,
conditional on b(0) = u. As mentioned above, any effects of parameters such as /9 and o
on the entry point u and hence on price will occur through their effects on the path of the
density f(b, t), and in particular on the function:
                                                           logU
                                 E[B()IB(0) = U) =
                                                          L       c6f(b,t)db.

This expected value begins at the moment of entry at U, and then converges over time to
the ergodic mean (see below):

                                     lirnE[B(t)B(0) = U] =                                              (17)
                                                                      22flU•
If the discount and depreciation rates are small, we can accurately describe the impact of
drifts and uncertainty on the equilibrium entry point, U, by determining their impact on the
ergodic mean. It is straightforward to see that               rises with 9 and falls with c; thus, by
the free entry condition, U must fall with /9 and rise with o,.
    If the discount and depreciation rates are large, the problem is more complicated because
we cannot use the ergodic density to construct the right-hand side of (10). Instead we need
to account for the whole path of f(b, t). (Intuitively, we know that f(b, t) must start as a
spike at u when t =     0,   and as i increases it must converge smoothly to the ergodic density.)
Because b(i) follows the diffusion equation (9), f(b,t) must satisfy the Kolmogorov forward
equation:
                                    f(b, t) = ofo&(b, t) — /3fb(b, t)                                   (18)

(See Karlin and Taylor (1981).) Since b(t) is regulated at u, the solution to this equation

   8The effects of the discount rate are straightforward. We are not proposing that dynamic programming
be replaced by the approach used in this section. Rather we are trying to explain more fully why irreversible
Investment is depressed by industry-wide uncertainty.


                                                     11
must satisfy the following boundary conditions for t > 0:

                                          f(u, i) =                                      (19)

                                            lirnf(b,t) =0,                               (20)

as well as the initial condition:

                                                                                         (21)
                                    jf(b,0)db              {
In Appendix A we derive the solution for f(b, t) and show that it implies the following path
for the expected marginal revenue product:

              E[B(i)B(0) = U] = U          [2/3 + et/2 f A(z)et/2 dz],                   (22)

where
                                                           z1/2
                         (z)        (/32/4)(/32/42/3/21)                                 (23)

    We now substitute eqn. (22) back into eqn. (10) evaluated at x = ti, which yields:
                                                           o,
                                                       (5+y)
where
                             —      2/3        2(8-i-y) i _________________
                             = +2fi +                  J                                 (24)

The first term in the expression for (.,.,.) summarizes the impact of the various parameters
on the ergodic mean, while the second term encompasses the the transition from the value of
marginal revenue product at entry and its unconditional (ergodic) mean. Clearly, the latter
will be relatively more important when firms give more weight to the short run, i.e. when
(8 + ) is large.
   Given ( ), the value of U can be found, as before, from the free entry condition:

                                          U=F                     .                      (25)
                                                       c,
One can check (numerically) that eqns. (16) and (25) are equivalent. We have again arrived
at an expression for U (and thus the optimal investment rule), but this time by deriving the
path for the expected marginal revenue product and utilizing the free entry condition.

                                                      12
   Figure 3a shows E[B(t) B(0) = U]/U as a function of time for o1, = .10, .15, and .20. (As
before, the other parameter values are y =          .03,   am =   0.02,    = 0, O = 0, i      = 2, 5 = .06,
and F = 100.) Observe that with a higher value of o, E(B(t)IB(0) = U]/U falls farther.
Because of the irreversibility of investment, the boundary U rises, but larger fluctuations
in demand lead to periods of lower prices, so the ratio falls. Also, while the decline in this
variable is greater when o is large, it must fall farther, so that it takes longer to approach
its steady-state value.
   Figure 3b shows E[B(t)IB(0) = U] for the same three values of . (Note that all of the
curves intersect the vertical axis at U.) If the discount rate S and depreciation rate were
zero, these curves would all converge to the same value, and would not cross each other.
The reason is that with no discounting, only the long-run steady-state matters, and not the
transition to that steady-state. Different values of o would result in different values of U
such that the resulting ergodic means for the marginal revenue product would be the same.
With discounting, however, the transition matters, so that the curves cross.


4 Investment in U.S. Manufacturing.
In this section we use data for two- and four-digit U.S. manufacturing industries to obtain
measures of the key variables in our model. We then use the cross-sectional variation of
these measures to examine the implications of the model, and to gauge the quantitative
importance of uncertainty and irreversibility for investment.
   Two implications of our model are particularly important. First, if an industry is rea-
sonably competitive, it is aggregate uncertainty that should have the greatest effect on the
trigger point U at which firms enter or expand their existing capacity. As shown earlier,
this is because when investment is irreversible, aggregate uncertainty affects the distribution
of prices faced by all firms, so that positive and negative shocks have an asymmetric effect
on each firm's profits; shocks that are specific to a single firm, on the other hand, have
symmetric effects on that firm's profits.9 Second, the effect of uncertainty on investment is

   9Such shocks can still affect investment, whether or not It is irreversible, but only insofar as they alter


                                                     13
mediated through its effect on the trigger point U. Increased uncertainty will increase U, so
that firms require a higher marginal profitability of capital (and hence rate of return) before
they are willing to invest. Hence tests of models of irreversible investment, and attempts to
measure the effects of uncertainty, should be based on the behavior of U.
   Unfortunately we cannot observe U directly. However, conditional on assumptions about
the production technology and market structure, we can estimate our marginal profitability
variable, 2(t), at least up to a scaling factor. As shown below, we can then use our estimates
of 2(2) over certain intervals as a proxy for U.
   Assuming the industry is competitive and the production function is Cobb-Douglas with
constant returns to scale, we can express the output of a (price-taking) productive unit as:

                                 Y(t)     A1K,aL_d)Ml_)(l_a)                                        (26)

where a is the share of capital, and is the share of labor in a labor-materials composite
which we will denote by H. Then, the marginal profitability of capital is given by:

                             = a(1 —    a)' (HPu) p(I-a}/c     1/c
                                                                                                    (27)

where P1 is the price of output, and PH is the price of the labor-materials composite.
   The marginal profitability of capital in this case is the value of output for an average
productive unit, i.e., 2(2). We will work with b(t) = log 2(1), which (again letting lower
case letters represent logs of the corresponding variables) is given by:
                                          1                               1—cs          1
      b(t) = log [a(l — a)1 —al/c] + —[in — (1 — a)hj — a/ct]         —
                                                                          —PH,t      + —Pt.         (28)

   We focus on investment and the marginal profitability of capital for 20 two-digit manu-
facturing industries. For each of these industries, we use data on the real value of output,
real inputs of capital, materials, and labor, and the corresponding price deflators to obtain
a time series for 1(1) over the 29 year period 1958—1986. We cannot measure b(t) for the
individual firms in these industries; instead we calculate a comparable series for b(t) for each
of 443 four-digit subsectors that make up the two-digit industries. We denote these series

the expected marginal revenue product of capital (as in the models of Hsrtman (1972) and Abel (1983)).

                                                   14
by b2(t) and b4(t) respectively. This approach is consistent with our model insofar as the
price elasticities of demand for the outputs of the four-digit industries are large relative to
those for the two-digit ones, and allows us to obtain measures of aggregate and idiosyn-
cratic uncertainty and gauge their overall importance for investment with only moderate
data requirements. The data and the calculation of the b(t)'s are discussed in Appendix B.1°
   Recall that b2(t) is a regulated process, but when it is below the boundary u = logU
it follows the Brownian motion of eqn. (9), which has a stochastic term ilbdz(i) that in-
corporates both demand and productivity shocks. We estimate                    directly from our time
series for b2(t). Specifically, we calculate sample standard deviations of b2(i) for each of the
20 two-digit industries, which we denote by SDB2; this is our measure of aggregate uncer-
tainty. Next, we calculate sample standard deviations of b4(t) for each of the 443 four-digit
industries, and then average them across those industries that make up the corresponding
two-digit industry. These numbers, denoted by SDB4, are the measures of total (aggregate
and idiosyncratic) uncertainty at the relatively disaggregated level of four-digit industries.11
   These numbers are shown in Table 1. Observe that the average four-digit standard
deviation is typically two or three times as large as the corresponding two-digit standard
deviation; as we would expect, there is more idiosyncratic than aggregate uncertainty over
the marginal profitability of capital.'2 The two-digit standard deviations are on the order
of 10 percent per year (consistent, for example, with the annual standard deviation of real
returns on the New York Stock Exchange Index of 20 percent per year and an average
debt/equity ratio of one). Also shown are the cross-sectional sample standard deviations
of the four-digit SDB4's corresponding to each two-digit industry. Note that the standard
deviations vary considerably across both four-digit and two-digit industries. \Ve can exploit
this variation to determine the impacts of SDB2 and SDB4 on investment.

  '°We used a data base assembled by Brian K. Sliker, who graciously made it available for our use. We
included only 443 of the 450 four-digit SIC industries because of missing data in seven of the industries.
  UOur estimator SDB2 is biased downwards from the true standard deviation because b() is a regulated
process. Eqn. (9) applies when it is not regulated, but our sample standard deviations include periods of
regulation.
 t2Let SDB1 denote the standard deviation of idiosyncratic shocks. Then SDB1 =                  SDB22. If
SDB4 = .2 and SDB2 = .1, SDB, = .17.

                                                    15
   Changes in the volatility of b3() should not affect investment directly; instead they should
affect the trigger point u. Although u is not observable, we can use extreme values of b2(t)
as a proxy; since u is the upper barrier for b3(i), b2(t) should be close to u when it is large
relative to its average value. We use three variables, all computed relative to the industry
mean of b(t), as measures of u at the two-digit level: (i) the maximum of b3(t) over the 29
years of data, denoted by DBMAX; (ii) the average of the top decile (three observations) of
the 29 annual values of b3(t), denoted by DBDEC; and (iii) the average of the top quintile
(six observations), denoted by DBQUINT. We average over several extreme values and use
DBDEC and DBQUINT rather than just DBMAX because b2(t) may in practice rise above
u temporarily if there are lags in investment, if there are predictable temporary increases in
      or if firms do not always optimize. We compute these variables relative to the mean
because b(t) is identified only up to a constant, which may differ across sectors.'3
   Table 2 shows cross-section regressions of DBMAX, DBDEC, and DBQUINT against
SDB2, SDB4, and a constant. These regressions are consistent with a basic prediction of the
model — that aggregate uncertainty should have the greatest effect on the trigger point u
(arid hence on investment). The coefficient of SDB2 is much larger than that of SDB4, and
is significant at the 5 percent level when DBDEC or DBQUINT is the dependent variable.
Also note that both the R2 and the t-statistic on SDB2 increase as we average over more
extreme values of b(t) when constructing our proxy for u.
    One problem wtth these regressions is that a higher standard deviation in the distribution
of b's will by itself imply an increase in the extreme values of b even if the model were not
yalid. To deal with this possibility, we generate alternative measures of u based on the
behavior of investment itself. We calculate and order a series for iK(t), the change in the
real capital stock, and (for each industry) find the Ii for which iK(t)              is   a maximum. We
then take b(t,), subtract the mean of b(i), and use the resulting number as a proxy for u.
We denote this by DBKMAX. We then find the times t,, 12, and 13 corresponding to the

  iSNote from eqn. (17) that u minus the mean oft is affected by uncertainty in the same qualitative way
as is u ,tself, because the mean is much less sensitive to uncertainty than is u. When the discount rate is
zero, the mean of I is unaffected by uncertainty.



                                                     16
 three largest values of K(t), and again fiod and average the corresponding values of b(t);
 the resulting variable is denoted DBKDEC. Finally, we generate DBKQUINT using those
 b's corresponding to the top quintile of the AK's.
    Table 2 shows regressions these investment-based measures of u on SDB2 and SDB4.
 Neither volatility variable is significant when DBKMAX or DBKDEC is the dependent vari-
 able, but SDB2 is significant (and the 112 increases dramatically) when DBKQUINT is used.
This again supports the notion that aggregate uncertainty has the greatest effect on the
investment threshold.
    We can use these results to gauge the effect of uncertainty on investment. We will
focus on the regressions in Table 2 in which DBQIJINT antI DBKQUINT are the dependent
variables, because these have the highest R2's, most significant coefficients on SDB2, and
are more robust (although downward biased) estimates of U. The coefficients on SDB2
provides measures of the semi-elasticity A log(U/F)/Au6. These two regressions put this
semi-elasticity in the range of 1.2 to 1.8. Thus an increase in the annual standard deviation
of the marginal profitability of capital at the two-digit level from, say, .1 to .2 should increase
the required return on investment by 12 to 18 percent (so that if the required return was 30
percent, it should rise to about 34 or 36 percent). This is a sizable but not overwhelming
effect of uncertainty. It is consistent with the simulated elasticities of the model illustrated
in Figure 1, but is less than predictions based on analyses of individual projects, e.g., by
McDooald and Siegel (1986), Majd and Piodyck (1987), and others.

5 Conclusions.
In a competitive equilibrium, uncertainty over market demand or average productivity affects
irreversible investment through the feedback of industry-wide capacity expansion and new
entry on the distribution of prices. If demand increases, existing firms will expand or new
firms will enter until the market clears. From the point of view of an individual firm, this
limits the amount that price can rise under good industry outcomes. But if investment is
irreversible, there is no similar mechanism to prevent price from falling under bad outcomes.


                                               17
Each firm takes price as given, but knows that the distribution of future prices is affected
by the irreversibility of investment industry-wide, which leads it to raise the trigger point at
which it is willing to invest. Idiosyncratic shocks, which affect only an individual firm, do
not induce entry and thus should have less impact on the firm's willingness to invest.
   We have tried to clarify these channels through which aggregate and idiosyncratic un-
certainty affect investment and industry evolution. Our model is simple enough so that it
can be solved using standard dynamic programming methods, but we have emphasized the
effects of uncertainty on the conditional distribution of prices, and shown how this distri-
bution can be derived and used as an alternative means of determining and understanding
the behavior of firms and the resulting industry equilibrium. We have also seen that the
basic implications of the model are roughly consistent with the data for U.S. manufacturing
industries, and we have obtained estimates of the semi-elasticity A log(U/F)/Acs that are
moderate in size but plausible.
    It is useful to compare our model with standard NPV models of investment based on the
CAPM. In those models, it is systematic (economy-wide), and not non-systematic uncer-
tainty that affects the discount rate. In our model, aggregate uncertainty, which is related to
but not the same as systematic uncertainty, increases the trigger point, which corresponds
to a higher required rate of return. Thus the mechanisms are very different, but the effects
of different sources of uncertainty are similar as in NPV-CAPM models. We have ignored
 CAPM effects; they will magnify the effects of aggregate uncertainty that we have derived.
    Our model is highly stylized, and makes a number of simplying assumptions. Some of
 them are important and should be kept in mind when interpreting our results. First, if there
 is a flexible factor, or if the firm can costlessly and temporarily shut down when price falls
 below variable cost, the marginal profit function will be convex in price and in exogenous
 productivity. Then for an industry of fixed size, an increase in idiosyncratic uncertainty will
 raise the present value of an additional unit of capital, and so to preserve the zero-profit
 condition, the trigger point at which entry occurs must decline. In this case, idiosyncratic
 uncertainty can lead to an increase in investment.
     Second, we have ignored abandonment. Suppose a productive unit can be scrapped at

any time for some positive scrap value. This sets a floor on the value of the unit; once
the combination of price and the productivity of the unit (which includes an aggregate and
idiosyncratic component) reaches the point at which the unit's value equals this scrap value,
it will be scrapped. This possibility raises the value of the unit for any combination of price
and expected productivity, which lowers the entry point u, and hence reduces the effect of
aggregate uncertainty described by our model. Also, an increase in idiosyncratic uncertainty
will raise the value of the unit. The reason is that potential entrants cannot know what their
relative productivity will be until they enter. However, exit is done selectively, i.e., when
idiosyncratic productivity is low ex post. Selective exit raises the value of a unit, lowering
the critical cutoff point for entry. Hence a scrap value alters the effects of both aggregate
and idiosyncratic uncertainty. It reduces the negative effect of aggregate uncertainty and
creates a positive effect of idiosyncratic uncertainty. Also, the combination of faster entry
and the incentive to exit when conditions are bad tends to reduce the variability of price.'4
    A price floor will have an effect similar to that of a scrap value, but only for aggregate
uncertainty. It also reduces the negative effect of aggregate uncertainty on entry by limiting
one of the two possible reasons for bad aggregate outcomes. (Bad aggregate outcomes that
are due to a decline in average industry productivity are still possible.) However, a price
floor will not alter the effect (or lack thereof) of idiosyncratic uncertainty.




  '4This is strictly correct only when A(t) is stationary (possibly around a deterministic trend) since other.
wise the variance of price becomes infinite. But even if A(t) had a stochastic trend component, the statement
would hold for finite intervals.

A. The Density Function and Conditional Expectation of B(t).
Let   i    b — u,   and g(y, t) be the density of , at time t, so that f(b, t) = g(b — u, t). In this
setup, finding the path of the conditional density of b(t) amounts to solving the problem
defined below by (Al) to (A.6):


                                  g(y, t) = gyy(y, t) — 9gy(y, t),                             (A.1)

                                          g(0,1) =                                             (A.2)
                                                     g5(0,t),
                                             lirng(y,t) = 0,                                   (A.3)

                                   g(y,t)0                                                     (A.4)

                                     jg(y,t)dy = I           Vt 0,                             (A.5)


                                   J9(y,0)dy = 1 i x=o
                                                          fo x<0                               (A.6)

      A solution to a similar problem, although with a different initial condition, can be found
in Bertola and Caballero (1990). Here we only outline the basic steps of the solution, which
is obtained by the method of Separation of Variables.
      Writing the solutions of the homogeneous problem as: g(y,t) = T(t)Y(y), decomposes
the problem into two ordinary differential equations:

                                           T'(t) + AT(t) =   0,                                (A.7)

                                   Y"(y) —   4Y'(y) +             = 0,                         (A.8)

subject to the boundary conditions above, with \ a constant. The solution method has the
following steps: First, find the values of \ for which the homogenous problem has a solution.
Second, characterize each of these solutions. And third, combine these solution to satisfy
the in-homogenous initial condition.




                                                     22
   The characteristic equation of (A.8) has real solutions for .X       98/4, where 9 2$/o. It
is easy to verify that the only real solution that satisfies the homogenous boundary conditions
occurs when ) = 0, which yields the particular solution:

                                     Y(y;.\ = 0) = 0e°.                                  (A.9)

On the other hand, there is a continuum of solutions for values of \ > 0f3/4, which take the
form:
                         Y(y;) = B(')e"                                                 (A.10)
                                              (cosi' + sini)Y)
where
                                          —   faA    02
                                                     4
The coefficients B() are identified by the initial condition, yielding:

                                    B() =                                               (All)
                                              2432
Combining (A.9), (A.1O) and (All) we obtain the solution for g(y,t):

        g(y, t) 0e +               j                    (   cos   y + sin     d.        (A.12)

   The expression for the conditional expectation shown in the text is is now easily obtained
by solving the integral in the expression:

                           E[B(t)IB(0) = Uj =
                                                   uf     e5g(y,t)dy.

B. The Data and Calculation of b(t).
Our raw database was originally developed by Brian K. Sliker at M.I.T., and is used with his
permission. We calculate b(t) based on eqn. (28) using two- and four-digit SIC data for the
real value of output (ROUTPUT), real inputs of capital (RIo, materials (RMAT), and la-
bor hours (TOTHRS), and the corresponding price deflators. TOTHRS is the sum of hours
for production workers (PWHRS) and and non-production workers (NPWHRS), where
the latter is estimated as the product of non-production worker employment (NPWEMP)
and average hours per employee for production workers (the mean of PWHRS/PWEMP).

                                              23
   We calculate the labor and materials shares by setting aj. and M equal to the mean
values of TLC/N OUTPUT and NMAT/NOUTPUT respectively, where TLC is total labor
costs, NMAT is the nominal value of materials inputs, and NOUTPUT is the nominal value
of output. Letting = UL/(aL + OM), we then compute the Solow residual:

                               at   = — (1 — QK)ht — OK/Ct,

where y = log(ROUTPUT), h        = + (1 — )mt, 1, = log(TOTHRS), mt = log(RMAT),
and k = log(RK). Finally, b(s) is given by:

      b(t) =   log [ci —                    + (1/aK)at
                        K
                —           [(log TLC — 1) + (1 —   )log PMAT — log POUTPUT].
