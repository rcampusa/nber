Regulatory Redistribution in the Market for Health Insurance

                                            ABSTRACT

Community rating regulations equalize the insurance premiums faced by the healthy and the unhealthy.
Intended reductions in the unhealthy’s premiums can be undone, however, if the healthy forgo coverage.
The severity of this adverse selection problem hinges largely on how health care costs are distributed
across market participants. Theoretically, I show that Medicaid expansions can combat adverse selection
by removing high cost individuals from the relevant risk pool. Empirically, I find that private coverage
rates improved significantly in community rated markets when states expanded Medicaid’s coverage
of relatively unhealthy adults. The effects of Medicaid expansions and community rating regulations
are fundamentally linked.

    Many health policy instruments serve social insurance objectives. Promi-
nent examples include state Medicaid programs, which provide benefi-
ciaries with public insurance, and community rating regulations, which
equalize the private insurance premiums faced by the healthy and the un-
healthy. This paper shows that the effects of these policy measures, both of
which play important roles in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act (PPACA), are fundamentally linked.
    Community rating regulations prevent insurance companies from ad-
justing premiums on the basis of pre-existing conditions.1 Their intent is
to generate “within-market” transfers from the healthy to the sick. Such
efforts may be undone by adverse selection, however, since the healthy can
escape these transfers by reducing or dropping their coverage (Rothschild
and Stiglitz, 1976; Buchmueller and DiNardo, 2002).
    While the adverse selection problem is well known, the determinants
of its severity are under explored. The severity of adverse selection hinges
largely on the distribution of health care costs across potential insurance
purchasers. This paper’s central insight is that the relevant cost distribu-
tion depends, in turn, on the structure and size of states’ Medicaid pro-
grams. By altering the distribution of health costs across private insurance
purchasers, state Medicaid programs may significantly influence the per-
formance of community rated markets.
    A novel implication of the interplay between state Medicaid programs
and community rating regulations is that Medicaid expansions may crowd
in private coverage. This contrasts with Medicaid’s usual tendency to par-
tially crowd private coverage out (Cutler and Gruber, 1996). Crowd-in can
occur when Medicaid expansions disproportionately cover the unhealthy.2
If the healthy prove more likely to take up Medicaid than the sick, however,

   1 These  regulations are typically accompanied by guaranteed issue requirements,
which prevent insurers from denying coverage on similar bases. For the sake of brevity,
I use the term “community rating” to reference regulatory regimes incorporating both
community rating and guaranteed issues rules.
   2 Medicaid can be targeted at the unhealthy through eligibility via disability or through

income thresholds that explicitly take household medical spending into account. The
latter approach is known as a medically-needy income concept.

                                            2
Medicaid expansions can worsen the relevant risk pool and exacerbate ad-
verse selection pressures. The effect of Medicaid expansions on community
rated markets thus depends on their design and implementation.
    I use the experience of the U.S. states to investigate the empirical rel-
evance of the forces described above. Many states imposed some form of
premium regulations on their insurance markets during the early 1990s. A
set of New England and Mid-Atlantic states implemented relatively strict
community rating regimes. Later years ushered in substantial Medicaid
expansions, driven in part by the 1997 authorization of the State Children’s
Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Beyond SCHIP, several states with
community rating regimes obtained waivers that unlocked federal fund-
ing for coverage of low-income and medically-needy adults. Medicaid’s
coverage of the disabled also increased significantly during this period.
    I find that community rated markets initially experienced fairly severe
adverse selection pressures. Within 3 years of adopting community rating,
I find that coverage rates had fallen by around 8 percentage points in the
community rated markets relative to control markets. The analysis reveals
that coverage declines escalate over these initial years, with medium-run
declines much larger than short-run declines. This should not be surpris-
ing, as even the unraveling of a single insurance plan can take multiple
years to unfold (Cutler and Reber, 1998).
    I next analyze the Medicaid expansions of the late 1990s and early
2000s. In states with community rating regulations, Medicaid expansions
covered more adults, and in particular more unhealthy adults, than in most
other states. I find that Medicaid expansions were associated with private
coverage increases in the community rated markets, but not elsewhere.
Consistent with the proposed mechanism, community rated markets ex-
perienced their strongest recoveries in states where Medicaid expansions
most disproportionately covered unhealthy adults.
    These findings contribute to both the theoretical and empirical litera-
tures on equilibrium in health insurance markets. Recent work demon-
strates the possibility of multiple equilibria in community rated markets
(Scheuer and Smetters, 2014), and studies the severity of adverse selection

                                     3
under fixed health cost distributions (Handel, Hendel and Whinston, 2013;
Hackmann, Kolstad and Kowalski, 2012). This paper shows that equilib-
rium depends crucially on additional features of the policy environment.
The size and structure of public insurance programs are particularly im-
portant, as they shape the risk pool from which the privately insured are
drawn. Adverse selection pressures can thus be alleviated (exacerbated) by
expansions in public coverage of high (low) cost populations.
    Empirically, the paper revisits the conclusions of the literature on com-
munity rating regulations. In contrast with the existing literature (see, e.g.,
Buchmueller and DiNardo (2002), Simon (2005), and LoSasso and Lurie
(2009)), I find that community rating initially resulted in significant de-
clines in private coverage.3 The contrast is driven primarily by the dynam-
ics of community rating’s effects. Past work reports the average of commu-
nity rating’s impact over several years. This paper’s analysis reveals that
coverage declines escalated over this time period.
    More inventively, the analysis links the previously parallel literatures on
Medicaid expansions and community rating regulations. Studies of Medi-
caid expansions (see, e.g., Cutler and Gruber (1996) and Gruber and Simon
(2008)) and the aforementioned literature on community rating make scant
mention of one another. I show that these health policy instruments are
fundamentally linked and that they mediate one another’s performance.
Looking forward, accounting for the relationship between community rat-
ing regulations and state Medicaid programs may be essential for under-
standing the evolution of U.S. insurance markets.
    The paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 develops the theoretical link-
age between community rating regulations and state Medicaid programs.
Section 2 characterizes the evolution of the relevant policies over the pe-
riod under analysis. Section 3 lays out my empirical strategy and section
4 describes the data used in its implementation. Section 5 characterizes
the evolution of insurance coverage in figures, while Section 6 does so us-

1     Why Public Insurance Matters for Community-
      Rated Markets
   This section characterizes the relationship between public insurance
programs, community rating regulations, and equilibrium health insurance
coverage rates. Like the subsequent empirical work, the model focuses on
the effect of community rating on the extensive margin of the insurance
purchasing decision. Because the supply side of insurance markets may
also respond on the intensive margin of coverage generosity, I consider the
empirical relevance of such responses in Appendix A.7.4


1.1    Community Rating Regulations and Coverage Rates
    The outcome of interest is an individual’s decision between purchasing
a standardized insurance product and remaining uninsured. By standard-
ized I mean that I assume there are no margins along which insurers are

    4 Recent  work by Handel, Hendel and Whinston (2013) shows that the relevant regula-
tions will likely induce substantial selection on the intensive margin of coverage generos-
ity; they predict that most individuals will purchase the minimum coverage allowed by
regulation. The current paper can be viewed as focusing on the margin of the decision to
purchase this minimum coverage rather than remain uninsured. Ericson and Starc (2012)
provide further analysis of choice in the context of insurance exchanges. In the context of
annuity markets, Finkelstein, Poterba and Rothschild (2009) find that changes in contract
offerings undid roughly half of the redistribution otherwise implied by restrictions on
gender-based pricing. Earlier work on health insurance rating regulations similarly finds
a role for intensive-margin adjustments in the form of increases in the prevalence of cov-
erage through Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) (Buchmueller and DiNardo,
2002; Buchmueller and Liu, 2005; LoSasso and Lurie, 2009). Absent these intensive mar-
gin adjustments, declines in coverage rates would likely have been even larger than those
estimated in this paper’s empirical work. Appendix A.7 shows, however, that changes in
HMO coverage are not a plausible explanation for variation in the long-run performance
of community rated markets. The data used in this section was found with guidance from
Pinkovskiy (2014).

allowed to differentiate the product. I further assume a perfectly compet-
itive market so that, in equilibrium, premiums are driven to the insurer’s
expected costs.
    Individual i has two relevant characteristics, namely the plan’s expected
payout on i’s health care, ci , and net insurance value, vi . Net insurance
value reflects a variety of underlying characteristics, including risk aversion
and the uncertainty to which type i is exposed. Individuals may also differ
in the value they place on the care made accessible by the plan.5 The char-
acteristics are defined such that i’s total willingness to pay is Di = ci + vi .
Market-wide demand for insurance is determined by the joint distribution
of ci and vi , denoted F (c, v) with probability density function f c,v (c, v).
    Insurers’ costs have two components. These include the aforementioned
expected payout, ci , and a loading cost that is constant across consumers,
l. While insurers are assumed to observe ci , community rating regulations
may restrict their use of this information in determining type i’s premium.
Absent such regulations, premiums may be “experience rated,” meaning
differentiated across cost types. It follows from perfect competition that the
experience rated premium offered to type i is pi = ci + l. With such pre-
miums, any individual for whom vi is greater than or equal to the loading
cost will purchase insurance. The market-wide coverage rate is thus
                                        Z Z
               Cov. Rateexp. rating =             1{vi ≥ l } f c,v (c, v)dvdc,      (1)

where 1{vi ≥ l } is an indicator equal to 1 when net insurance value is
greater than or equal to the loading cost.
   Community rating regulations prevent insurers from differentiating pre-
miums on the basis of expected health care costs. This non-trivially compli-
cates the characterization of market equilibrium, which may not exist and
may be non-unique (Scheuer and Smetters, 2014). When an equilibrium
exists, it must satisfy two conditions. First, the stability of consumer choice

   5 Rich individuals may have relatively high willingness to pay for mid-life cancer
screenings, for example, while consumption of such services may be a manifestation of
moral hazard from the perspective of the poor. Such differences are conceptually related
to “moral hazard types” as analyzed by Einav, Finkelstein and Ryan (2013).

requires that, at the prevailing premium p∗ , Di ≥ p∗ for all purchasers and
Di < p∗ for all non-purchasers. Second, perfect competition requires that
the prevailing premium equal the loading cost, l, plus the average of the ex-
pected payouts across the insurance purchasers, c = E(ci | Di ≥ p∗ ). Given
a c and p∗ = c + l for which these conditions are satisfied, the equilibrium
coverage rate is
                                  Z Z
        Cov. Ratecomm. rating =             1{vi ≥ l + c − ci } f c,v (c, v)dvdc.   (2)
                                   c    v
The difference between type i’s experience- and community-rated premi-
ums is c − ci , which I interpret as a within-market transfer from type i to
other insurance purchasers.
    Community rating’s effect on coverage depends largely on two factors.
The first is the distribution of ci and the second is the relationship between
ci and vi . Regarding the latter, past work notes that if healthy individuals
are highly risk averse, they may value insurance sufficiently to prevent
adverse selection from posing a problem (Cutler, Finkelstein and McGarry,
2008; Einav and Finkelstein, 2010). This paper focuses on the distribution
of ci . Specifically, I emphasize that community rating will significantly
increase the premiums of the relatively healthy when the market contains
a non-trivial number of very high cost individuals.
    Analyses of community rating regulations often take the distribution
of health risks as given (Handel, Hendel and Whinston, 2013; Hackmann,
Kolstad and Kowalski, 2012). This paper emphasizes that the relevant dis-
tribution depends crucially on other features of the policy environment.
Public insurance programs are particularly relevant, as they alter the pool
of potential market participants.


1.2   Medicaid’s Implications for Community-Rated Markets
     This section walks through a numeric example that illustrates how pub-
lic insurance programs can influence community rated insurance markets.
Table 1 contains counts for each type, {ci , vi }, in the example population.
There are three cost types and three insurance value types. Expected health

                                            7
                 Table 1: Population Counts for Stylized Example
                                             Net Insurance Value Type: vi
                     Type               $1,000         $2,000        $3,000

Expected               $3,000                        60               65                 75
Health Cost            $5,000                        30               20                 30
Type: ci              $10,000                        10               5                  5

Note: Cell entries are population counts for the cost/insurance value types associated with the
example discussed in Section 2.2. For example, there are 60 individuals with c i = $3,000 and vi =
$1,000 and 65 individuals with ci = $3,000 and vi = $2,000.




costs are $3,000, $5,000, or $10,000. Insurance value is $1,000, $2,000, or
$3,000. The loading cost, l, for the insurance policy is $1,300.
    Recall that under experience rating types with vi > l purchase insur-
ance. In the present example, types with vi = $1, 000 opt out of coverage.
The resulting coverage rate is 67 percent.
    Suppose now that community rating regulations are introduced. Were
the full population to purchase insurance, c = $4, 000 and p = $5, 300.
At this premium, types {$3000, $1000} and {$3000, $2000} exit the market.
Absent these individuals, c rises just above $4,700 and the premium above
$6,000. An adverse selection spiral continues until only types {$10000, $2000}
and {$10000, $3000} are in the market, implying a 3 percent coverage rate.
Community rating thus generates no redistribution across health types
while reducing the welfare of the newly uninsured.
    Now consider a public insurance program that covers all types with
vi = $1, 000, which could be a proxy for low income. If types with vi =
$1, 000 are removed from the market, the community-rated equilibrium is
for types {$5000, $3000}, {$10000, $2000}, and {$10000, $3000} to purchase
insurance at p = $7, 550. The implied private coverage rate is 13 percent. In
this example, public insurance improves the community-rated equilibrium
despite covering individuals who were not in the initial pool of purchasers.
This occurs because type {$10000, $1000} was near the margin of purchas-
ing insurance in the community-rated market. This type’s presence among


                                                 8
the uninsured breaks the pooling equilibrium in which type {$5000, $3000}
enters the market.
    Finally, consider a public insurance program that covers all types with
ci = $10, 000. This could be associated, for example, with coverage targeted
at the disabled or other individuals with chronic conditions. With these
types removed from the market, equilibrium is for type {$3000, $3000}
and all types with ci = $5, 000 to purchase insurance. The private cov-
erage rate is 52 percent. Note that the effect of public insurance works
through coverage of both the initially insured and uninsured types with
ci = $10, 000. Had public insurance only covered types {$10000, $2000}
and {$10000, $3000}, the equilibrium purchasing pool would include types
{$5000, $3000} and {$10000, $1000}. As in the previous example, the pres-
ence of type {$10000, $1000} among the uninsured significantly influences
the equilibrium. This reflects the fact that, among the uninsured, high cost
types will tend to be relatively close to the margin of purchasing insurance.


2     Developments in Community Rating Regula-
      tions and Adult Medicaid Coverage
   Over the last quarter century, U.S. states have engaged in substantial ex-
perimentation with their health insurance regulations and Medicaid pro-
grams. This section characterizes these developments, with an emphasis
on their implications for the subsequent empirical analysis.


2.1   The Evolution of Insurance Regulations
   As the Clinton Administration’s health plan stalled during the early
1990s, many states adopted some form of community rating and/or guar-
anteed issue regulations. Different sets of regulations apply across three
distinct purchasing settings. Some regulations apply to the non-group
market, where individuals purchase plans directly from insurers. Other
regulations apply to the small-group market, where small firms, typically


                                     9
meaning those with 50 or fewer workers, purchase insurance on behalf of
their employees. As described by Buchmueller and DiNardo (2002), the
coverage provided by firms that directly finance their employees’ insur-
ance plans (i.e., firms that self insure) are regulated through the federal
Employee Retirement Income and Security Act (ERISA), which preempts
state legislation. Firms with more than 50 employees, plus smaller firms
that self insure, are thus unaffected by state regulation. I refer to such
arrangements as existing in the large-group market.
    Community rating regulations restrict insurers from adjusting premi-
ums on the basis of an individual’s health status (and, to degrees that
vary across states, on the basis of age and other demographic characteris-
tics). Guaranteed issue rules prevent insurance companies from rejecting
beneficiaries or limiting their coverage on similar bases. As defined more
explicitly below, I refer to regulatory packages involving both community
rating and guaranteed issue rules as community rating regimes.
    Table 2 highlights states with at least some experience in community
rating regulations. As defined for this paper’s purposes, a state adopted
a community rating regime if it meets two criteria. First, it must have
modified or pure community rating rules, as defined by GAO (2003), in
both its non- and small-group markets. Under pure community rating,
premiums are only allowed to vary on the basis of family composition and
geography; premium variations due to pre-existing conditions and age are
disallowed. Modified community rating allows (limited) premium varia-
tions on the basis of age, but disallows the use of pre-existing conditions.
Many states allow premiums to vary within prescribed bounds (known as
“rating bands”) on the basis of pre-existing conditions. In practice, these
bands significantly reduce the adverse selection pressures associated with
community rating, hence I do not consider such states to have community
rating regimes.6

   6 Most  state rating bands allow premiums to vary by at least 100 percent. For a typical
family policy in the non-group market in 2002, this implies premium variation on the or-
der of $4,400 (see, e.g., Bernard and Banthin (2008)). The within-market transfers implied
by the rating laws in such states are negligible in comparison with states that adopt pure

     Notes:
     *Washington and New Hampshire (post repeal of community rating) have relatively tight rating bands, allowing premiums to vary by only 20% within demographic
     groups on the basis of health. This compares with the remainder of the rating band states that allow premiums to vary anywhere from 50-200% on the basis of
     health.
     **New York and Vermont have pure community rating, which completely prohibits risk-rating on the basis of demographic characteristics as well as health status.
     ***Oregon is the only state that fails to make the core sample of regulated states due to its lack of a strict guaranteed issue requirement in its non-group market (Lo
     Sasso and Lurie, 2009) and its small-group market (Simon, 2005).
     Sources: Information on state insurance market regulations comes from GAO (2003), Simon (2005), Leida and Wachenheim (2008), and CBO (2005).
    The second requirement is that the state must have guaranteed issue
rules that go beyond the federal requirements in the 1996 Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the 1985 Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). This typically involves re-
quiring shorter exclusion periods for pre-existing conditions and longer
periods of continuation coverage for those who lose health insurance due,
among other reasons, to loss of employment. Guaranteed issue rules can
also vary in terms of the range of products to which they apply, with the
strictest regulations requiring guaranteed issue of all insurance products.
For categorizing the stringency of a state’s guaranteed issue requirements
in the small- and non-group markets, I rely on Simon (2005) and LoSasso
and Lurie (2009) respectively.
    I designate 7 states as having adopted community rating regimes. Or-
dered chronologically, they are Maine, New York, Vermont, New Jersey,
New Hampshire, Kentucky, and Massachusetts. Two of the states, namely
Kentucky and New Hampshire, abandoned their community rating regimes
during the sample period.7
    I separately estimate the effects of community rating regimes as adopted
by two groups of states. The first group includes New York, Maine, and
Vermont. I characterize these states as early adopters of “stable” commu-
nity rating regimes. Their regulatory regimes have two empirically notable
characteristics. First, they regulated their non- and small-group markets
simultaneously, which aids in examining the dynamics of community rat-
ing’s effects. Second, their regulatory regimes were maintained in essen-
tially the same form for the duration of the period under analysis, hence
their designation as stable.
    The second group of states includes Kentucky, Massachusetts, New


community rating. Even in the minority of states with relatively tight rating bands (e.g.,
Washington), the implied transfers are on the order of $1,000 less than they would be
under a community rating regime.
   7 Wachenheim   and Leida (2007) report that insurance companies exited Kentucky’s
market in large numbers and repeal of the law began a mere two years after its enactment.
New Hampshire’s law was similarly repealed amidst fears of declining coverage.

                                           12
Hampshire, and New Jersey. I characterize these states as staggered adopters
of relatively “unstable” community rating regimes. Kentucky and New
Hampshire’s regimes were unstable in that they repealed community rat-
ing during the period under study. Massachusetts was unique in terms of
the gap between its regulation of the individual and small group markets
(regulated in 1992 and 1997 as shown in Table 1). Within this group, New
Jersey’s community rating regime most closely resembles those of Maine,
New York, and Vermont. Its regulatory instability lies in its substantial
changes to other insurance market regulations during the sample period.


2.2    The Evolution of Adult Medicaid Coverage
    Table 3 presents characteristics of states’ Medicaid programs as they
pertained to the coverage of adults. Columns 1 and 2 indicate whether and
when states acquired what are known as Section 1115 coverage expansion
waivers. These waivers were necessary to obtain federal financing for cov-
erage of groups not traditionally eligible for Medicaid.8 Column 1 shows
that the community rating states were disproportionately likely to obtain
waivers for this purpose.
    Columns 3 and 4 show the extent to which Medicaid eligibility comes
through the “Medically Needy” income concept. This pathway to eligi-
bility was available in all 7 of the community rating states as compared
with two-thirds of all states. The degree of reliance on this form of eligi-
bility varies substantially within the set of community rating states, with
New York and Vermont substantially above the national average and the
remaining states around or below the national average.
    Columns 5 and 6 show that the community rating states had rela-
tively generous Medicaid eligibility thresholds for adults with children.
Throughout the sample period, most states maintained the relatively low


   8 Since waivers were required to pass an ex ante test of federal budget neutrality, cov-
erage expansions were typically linked to cost-saving efforts elsewhere in the Medicaid
program. Shifts from traditional Medicaid towards Medicaid Managed Care were often
credited as sources of substantial savings.

states was just 37 percent of the federal poverty line. With the exception
of Kentucky and New Hampshire, which repealed their community rating

2.3    Illustrating the Link between Medicaid and Commu-
       nity Rating
    This section uses recent health expenditure data to illustrate the po-
tential link between Medicaid and the performance of community rated
markets. A simple method for gauging adverse selection pressures is to
compare the average health spending of potentially relevant population
groups. Using the 2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), I con-
sider the health care costs of privately insured adults whose premiums
would be affected by standard community rating regimes. Among these
adults, average total health costs were $4,300. For those in the top two
thirds of the distribution of self-reported health, average expenditures were
$3,200.9 Those with lower self-reported health averaged $6,800. The full
pool’s average thus exceeds the average across the healthiest two thirds by
34 percent.
    Adults on Medicaid have higher health costs than those with private
policies. In the 2011 MEPS, costs for the full population of non-elderly,
adult Medicaid beneficiaries averaged $8,300. Medicaid’s coverage of these
individuals thus reduces average costs among the potentially privately in-
sured. Pooling these adult Medicaid beneficiaries with the privately in-
sured, for example, pushes average costs from $4,300 to $5,100. Because
Medicaid pays lower rates than most private plans, average costs would

“Very Good.”

                                         15
be closer to $6,000 if all were privately insured.10 This is nearly twice the
$3,200 associated with the healthiest two thirds of private policy holders.
Healthy individuals would have to place a remarkably high value on in-
surance’s risk-reducing benefits to remain in such a risk pool.


3      Estimating the Effects of Community Rating
    This section presents my framework for estimating the effect of com-
munity rating on insurance coverage. Non- and small-group markets gov-
erned by community rating are the treated markets of interest. Equivalent
markets in less tightly regulated states serve as controls within a difference-
in-differences framework. The existing literature on community rating’s
effects includes estimates of this form as well as triple-difference estimates
in which the large-group markets in all states serve as within-state control
groups (Buchmueller and DiNardo, 2002).
    The difference-in-differences framework is presented below:

    COVi,s,t = β 1 Reg. States × Posts,t + β 2s States + β 3t Yeart + Xi,s,t γ + ε i,s,t .
                                                                                         (3)

COVi,s,t is an indicator for the coverage status (e.g., has private coverage)
of individual i who resides in state s in year t. Equation (3) contains the
standard features of difference-in-differences estimation, namely sets of
year (Yeart ) and state (States ) indicator variables. The primary coefficient of
interest is β 1 , which is an estimate of coverage changes in community rated
markets net of coverage changes in other markets. I estimate the standard
error on β 1 using the block bootstrap method with clusters drawn at the
state level (Bertrand, Duflo and Mullainathan, 2004).
    β 1 will be an unbiased estimate of the effect of community rating on
insurance coverage under a standard “parallel trends” assumption. That
is, conditional on Xi,s,t , it must be the case that the treatment and control

the relationship between public and private payments for health care services.

                                             16
states would have experienced the same changes in coverage had the treat-
ment states not adopted community rating. This assumption faces stan-
dard threats. It could be violated, for example, if treatment and control
states experienced significantly different changes in economic conditions.
It could also be violated if treatment states differentially adopted additional
policies that are likely to affect insurance coverage.
    I take several steps to account for threats to the parallel trends assump-
tion. First, the baseline covariates in Xi,s,t provide a set of controls for
the economic circumstances of the households in the sample. The full set
of controls includes a set of 2-digit occupation dummy variables, region
dummy variables interacted with family income as a percent of the poverty
line, an indicator for having a single mother as the household’s head, and
an indicator for being black, additional indicators for having two or more
full time workers in the household and for the education levels of house-
hold adults, an indicator for home ownership, and age group indicators. In
additional analysis I control directly for state-level economic covariates and
changes in health expenditures. I further explore the relevance of threats to
the parallel trends assumption by applying matching criteria for selecting
the individuals and/or states included in the control group.
    An additional check on the validity of the estimates is to construct a
within-state control group for use in a triple-difference framework. This
framework appears below:

 COVi,s,t = β 1 Posts,t × Reg. States × Small Firmi
          + β 2s States × Small Firmi + β 3s,t States × Yeart
          + β 4t Yeart × Small Firmi + β 5s States + β 6 Small Firmi + β 7t Yeart
          + Xi,s,t φ + ε i,s,t .                                                (4)

Equation (4) augments the fixed effects from equation (3) with an indicator
for being on the non- and small-group insurance markets (Small Firmi ).
It further incorporates two-way interactions between Small Firmi and the
state and year fixed effects. These interactions control for differential trends
across treatment and control states as well as across the large- and small-


                                       17
group markets. They also allow the difference between large- and small-
group markets to differ at baseline across the states. The primary coeffi-
cient of interest is again β 1 .
    In the triple-difference framework, unbiased estimation relies on three
assumptions that are not wholly satisfied in practice. First, it requires cor-
rect assignment of units to the within-state treatment and control groups.
In practice, the small- and large-group markets cannot be cleanly segre-
gated using the firm-size information in the analysis data described in
the subsequent section. This misclassification will tend to attenuate the
triple-difference estimates towards 0. Second, triple difference estimation
requires that the policy not have spillover effects on the within-state con-
trol group. This may be violated, for example, if regulation-induced losses
lead an insurer to raise premiums in all markets. Third, for the within-state
control group to effectively control for state-specific shocks, these shocks
must similarly influence insurance coverage in the within-state treatment
and control groups. This is likely violated due to the stability of cover-
age offerings by large firms relative to coverage offerings by small firms.
For these reasons I estimate equation (4) as a check on the robustness of
estimates of equation (3) rather than as the baseline specification.


4      Description of the Analysis Data Set
   I estimate equations (3) and (4) using samples of individuals from the
March Supplements of the Current Population Survey (CPS) for years 1988-
2007. The data provide information on insurance status and key household
economic and demographic characteristics for years 1987-2006. The sample
excludes households in which the oldest member is either younger than 20
or older than 60 years of age. More substantively, I focus on individuals
in households with at least one child and at least one full-time employed
adult.11 This places attention on the market segments that were most di-

    11 Previous
             studies similarly restrict the sample population to the employed. Appendix
Figure A4 presents coverage tabulations in which the unemployed are included in the

                                          18
rectly affected by changes in Medicaid eligibility over this time period.12
Since these sample selection margins could, in principal, be affected by the
policies under study, Appendix Figures A3 and A4 display the evolution
of coverage for samples in which these restrictions have not been imposed.
    The summary statistics in Table 4 point to an important pre-community
rating difference between baseline insurance coverage in the treatment and
control states. Treatment states had relatively high private coverage rates
(78.7% vs. 70.1%), translating into relatively small fractions of the popula-
tion who lacked coverage altogether. Households in treatment states also
had moderately higher incomes and education levels than households in
control states.
    The summary statistics highlight non-trivial differences between the
community rating states, which are concentrated in New England and
the Mid-Atlantic, and other states. As a result of these differences, con-
trol group selection is non-trivial. The setting is such that no one method
for selecting the control group is obviously preferred to all others. While
the paper’s baseline estimates of equations (3) and (4) include all non-
community rating states in the control group, robustness to a range of
alternative approaches has been checked. One of these, namely a synthetic

sample. The principal rationale for excluding the unemployed involves the assumptions
underlying the triple-difference framework of Equation (4). The triple difference frame-
work assumes that the insurance coverage of workers at large firms are subject to the same
shocks as workers at small firms. As noted previously, this assumption may not hold for
several reasons. Importantly, the insurance coverage of workers at large firms tends to
be more stable than coverage of workers at small firms. The assumption would become
increasingly implausible if the treatment group included the unemployed. A related issue
is that essentially all unemployed adults with children will be eligible for Medicaid for at
least some portion of the calendar year. Their participation in private insurance markets
may thus tend to be limited.
   12 The exclusion of childless households is a difference between the current study and
previous work on community rating regulations. I focus on households with children due
to my emphasis on the interplay between community rating regulations and subsequent
Medicaid expansions. Community rating regulations treat households with and without
children as separate market segments. By design, Medicaid expansions covered very few
childless adults over this time period. The market for coverage of single adults would
thus not have been affected by contemporaneous public insurance expansions. Appendix
Figure A3 presents coverage tabulations in which childless households are included in the
sample.

Note: Samples consist of individuals in households with at least one child and one full-time working
adult, but with no adults working at a firm that has more than 100 employees. For the otherwise
unrestricted samples shown in columns 1 and 2, CPS person weights are applied. For the samples
selected using the matching methods described in the text, shown in columns 3 through 6, equal
weights are applied. The community rating states include New York, Maine, Vermont, Kentucky,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New Jersey. The “Control” states in Column 2 incluce all other
states. A household is defined as having a college educated adult if one of the adults in the household
has at least some college education. The samples in columns 3 and 4 are restricted to matched pairs,
constructed as described in the text. The samples in columns 5 and 6 are further restricted to exclude
individuals in households with incomes less than 133% of the poverty line or headed by single mothers.

5      A Graphical View of Coverage Changes
    Panel A of Figure 1 shows the evolution of the fraction of individ-
uals that has neither private nor public insurance in the treatment and
control groups. In this figure, the treatment group consists of the states
that contemporaneously adopted community rating in both their non- and
small-group markets, namely New York, Maine, and Vermont. New York
accounts for roughly 75 percent of the underlying observations in this sam-
ple. Panel A provides a stark depiction of two of this paper’s central em-
pirical findings. In large-group markets everywhere and in the small- and
non-group markets of the control states, Medicaid expansions and declines
in private coverage have roughly offset one another. The fraction of in-
dividuals without insurance changed little in these markets throughout
the sample (1987-2006). In contrast, the community rated small- and non-
group markets followed quite different paths. After New York, Maine, and
Vermont adopted community rating in 1993, the fraction uninsured in the
unrestricted sample (Panel A) increased by around 80%, from 0.16 to 0.29
in 1997. This erosion reversed in subsequent years, with the fraction unin-
sured declining to 0.17 by 2006. Panel B shows that the coverage changes
observed in Panel A are robust to selecting the sample using synthetic co-

    13 Thesynthetic cohort analysis proceeds as follows. On a sample restricted to years
including or prior to 1993, I estimate the relationship between private insurance coverage
and the covariates used as controls in estimating equations (3) and (4). I then use the
coefficients from this regression to estimate each individual’s propensity to have private
insurance coverage. I estimate these propensities for individuals from all years, including
years subsequent to the adoption community rating regulations. Within each year, I then
use the propensity scores to form nearest neighbor matches (without replacement) be-
tween observations from treatment and control states. I arrive at the final synthetic cohort
sample by dropping all matches for which the propensity score estimates differ by more
than 0.0025. This final step, which drops a very small number of observations involving
relatively poor matches, can be characterized as an application of the “caliper” method.

hort methods.
    Panels C and D of Figure 1 are similar to Panels A and B, but report
the fraction of the population covered by private insurance. Private cov-
erage rates turn sharply for the worse in the community rated markets
between 1993 and 1996. After 1997 these markets show signs of recoveries,
with the recoveries appearing to be complete in the unrestricted sample
and partial in the matched samples. In Panel D, for example, coverage
rates are roughly equal prior to the implementation of community rating
and decline by an excess of 12 percentage points in the regulated mar-
kets between 1993 and 1996. They remained down by an excess of 4 or 5
percentage points over the last four years of the sample.
    A look across the panels of Figure 1 highlights an important point. Fol-
lowing 1997, the community rated markets experienced sharp declines in
the fraction of individuals without insurance. The sharpness of this decline
results from the fact that both the fraction of individuals covered by Med-
icaid and the fraction of individuals with private insurance increased in
these markets relative to other markets. This positive correlation is unique
across time periods and market types, as Medicaid’s tendency to crowd
out private insurance typically dominates the relationship between these
forms of coverage (see, e.g., Cutler and Gruber (1996) and Gruber and Si-
mon (2008)).
    Figure 2 presents tabulations in which the treatment states are Ken-
tucky, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New Jersey. These states dif-
fer from Maine, New York, and Vermont in that their implementation of
insurance market regulations was both staggered and less stable. Because
their regulatory activity included potentially confounding policy changes,
it is less clear that mid-1990s coverage movements can be interpreted as
causal effects of community rating regulations.
    A similar pattern of decline and recovery is apparent in this second
group of community rating states. Notably, there appears to have been a
decline in coverage prior to the adoption of community rating. This de-
cline is driven primarily by New Jersey, where insurance markets were
being strained by the state’s system for financing uncompensated hospital

     Figure 1: Insurance Status Over Time: Households with Children. The figure contains tabulations constructed using the March
     Demographic Supplements of the Current Population Survey (CPS). All samples consist of the adults and children (aged 18 and
     lower) in households with at least one child and at least one full-time working adult. The samples in Panels B and D are restricted to
     matched pairs, constructed as described in the text. The treatment states in all panels include New York, Maine, and Vermont, which
     were the three states to adopt their community rating regimes in 1993 (as indicated by the vertical black lines in each panel). In Panels
     A and C, which display coverage rates in states’ large-group markets as well as in their non- and small-group markets, individuals
     are defined as having access to the large-group market if at least one adult in the household is employed at a firm with more than 100
     employees (and to the non- and small-group markets otherwise). Insurance status is taken directly from the Minnesota Population
     Center’s Summary Health Insurance variables, which are imputed using the CPS. CPS person weights are applied in tabulations
     involving the unrestricted samples (Panels A and C), while observations are equally weighted in panels using observations selected
     through the matching procedure (Panels B and D).

     Figure 2: Insurance Status Over Time: Households with Children. The figure contains tabulations constructed using the March
     Demographic Supplements of the Current Population Survey (CPS). All samples consist of the adults and children (aged 18 and
     lower) in households with at least one child and at least one full-time working adult. The samples in Panels B and D are restricted to
     matched pairs, constructed as described in the text. The treatment states in all panels include New Jersey, New Hampshire, Kentucky,
     and Massachusetts, which were the four states to conduct staggered implementation of their community rating regimes between
     1992 and 1997 (as indicated by the dashed vertical black lines in each panel). The years in which each individual treatment state
     implemented its regulations can be found in Table 2. In Panels A and C, which display coverage rates in states’ large-group markets
     as well as in their non- and small-group markets, individuals are defined as having access to the large-group market if at least one
     adult in the household is employed at a firm with more than 100 employees (and to the non- and small-group markets otherwise).
     Insurance status is taken directly from the Minnesota Population Center’s Summary Health Insurance variables, which are imputed
     using the CPS. CPS person weights are applied in tabulations involving the unrestricted samples (Panels A and C), while observations
     are equally weighted in panels using observations selected through the matching procedure (Panels B and D).
care.14 New Jersey altered its financing of uncompensated care along with
the wave of reforms that ushered in community rating regulations. Ter-
minating its uncompensated care arrangement should, all else equal, have
improved New Jersey’s coverage rates. Establishing an appropriate coun-
terfactual is thus quite difficult. The institutional background suggests that
averaging 1988-1992 as a “pre” community rating period is a more reason-
able approach to the data than one might conclude from the figure. That
said, it seems prudent to place more weight on the evidence associated
with the states that adopted relatively stable regulatory regimes. Appendix
Figure A2 presents the evolution of private coverage in each treatment state
in separate panels.


6     Regression Analysis of Coverage Rates
    This section presents estimates of equations (3) and (4). I first estimate
the medium-run declines in coverage experienced by the community rated
markets relative to other markets. I do this by estimating equations (3) and
(4) on samples in which 1988-1992 constitute the pre-community rating
period and 1996-1997 capture the low point following community rating’s
adoption. I then present estimates of coverage recoveries from the low
point of 1996-1997 through an end period covering 2003-2006.
    Table 5 presents the estimates. The results in Panels A (difference-in-
differences specifications) and B (triple-difference specifications) show that
community rating resulted in substantial coverage declines. In states that
adopted relatively stable community rating regimes (columns 1 and 3) pri-
vate coverage declined by around 9.5 percentage points. In states that

    14 “All-payer” regulations explicitly required that uncompensated care costs be fi-
nanced through surcharges on payments from insurers to hospitals. This surcharge
spiked when, in 1988, the federal government canceled a waiver through which Medi-
care had been generously subsidizing New Jersey hospitals’ provision of uncompensated
care (Siegel, Weiss and Lynch, 1990). The resulting increase in private payers’ costs re-
sulted in significant premium increases and thus declines in coverage. Coverage declines
increased the ranks of the uninsured and thus the cost of uncompensated care, resulting
in additional surcharge increases. New Jersey was thus experiencing an “uncompensated
care spiral.”

***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the .01, .05, and .10 levels respectively. Standard errors, reported beneath each point
estimate, were calculated using a block bootstrap approach with clusters drawn at the state level. The samples in Panels A and B
consist of individuals in households with at least one child and one full-time employed adult from the March Current Population
Survey (CPS) in years 1987-1992 and 1996-1997. The samples in Panels C and D consist of similarly situated households from
1996-1997 and 2003-2006. CPS person weights are applied. Panels A and C report point estimates of β 1 from equation (3). Panels
B and D report point estimates of β1 from equation (4). In all cases the vector X includes a set of 2-digit occupation dummy
variables, region dummy variables interacted with family income as a percent of the poverty line, an indicator for having a single
mother as the household's head, and an indicator for being black, additional indicators for having two full time workers in the
household and for the education levels of household adults, an indicator for home ownership, and age group indicators. The
"Stable Regulations" group includes Maine, New York, and Vermont, while the "Unstable Regulations" group includes Kentucky,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New Jersey.

adopted less stable community rating regimes (columns 2 and 4) cover-
age declines were less severe, with the estimates averaging 5.5 percentage
points. The experience of these states was relatively varied, resulting in
larger standard errors. Note that because Massachusetts only completed
the enactment of its community rating regulations in 1997, it does not enter
into treatment-state status during this time period.
    The results in Panels C and D show the evolution of coverage from the
lows of 1996-1997 through the period covering 2003-2006. In states with
stable community rating regimes, the fraction uninsured recovered essen-
tially all of the losses experienced during the earlier period. For this group,
the increase in standard errors from Panels A and B to Panels C and D re-
flects an increase in variability across these states’ experiences. The states
with less stable community rating regimes appear to have recovered little,
if at all. The remainder of this paper’s analysis attempts to understand this
variation in the long run performance of community rated markets.


7    Evidence on the Interplay between Medicaid
     and Community Rating
    This section empirically assesses the link between the performance of
community rated markets and the structure and size of states’ Medicaid
programs. As emphasized in Section 2, Medicaid expansions can improve
the performance of community-rated markets if they draw high cost types
out of the pool of potential private market participants. Table 3 highlighted
the community rating states’ use of channels through which Medicaid can
be targeted at high cost populations. In this section I begin by using the
CPS to gauge the extent to which states’ Medicaid coverage was, in prac-
tice, taken up disproportionately by relatively unhealthy adults. I then
relate the observed variation in coverage of unhealthy adults to the evolu-
tion of private coverage rates.




                                      27
7.1   The Evolution of Adult Medicaid Coverage in the Cur-
      rent Population Survey
    Using CPS data, Figure 3 displays the fraction of low-income adults
on Medicaid both in total (Panels A and B) and by health status (Pan-
els C and D). Because the CPS did not include the required health status
questions in the sample’s initial years, the latter panels first display data
for 1995. Although the community rating states had more extensive adult
Medicaid coverage throughout the sample period, coverage rates moved
on roughly parallel trends during the first half of the sample. Medicaid
coverage rates diverge just before 2000. Between 1999 and 2006, coverage
rates for adults with incomes less than 300% of the poverty line rose by 17
percentage points in Maine, New York, and Vermont and by 6 percentage
points elsewhere (Panel A).
    Figure 3’s Panels C and D present Medicaid coverage separately for un-
healthy adults and healthy adults. I define unhealthy adults as those with
a work-limiting disability or with self-reported health status worse than
“very good.” This definition of unhealthy accounts for the bottom third
of the self-reported health distribution. I find that Medicaid expansions in
control states covered similar fractions of the healthy and unhealthy adult
populations. In Maine, New York, and Vermont, coverage of unhealthy
adults with low incomes rose by 25 percentage points while coverage of
healthy adults with low incomes rose by roughly 12 percentage points.


7.2   Framework for Relating Public and Private Coverage
    The data allow me to take an additional step towards linking public and

     Figure 3: Evolution of Medicaid Coverage for Adults. The figure contains tabulations constructed using the March Demographic
     Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS). All samples consist solely of adults (aged 21 and higher) in households with
     at least one child and at least one full-time working adult, but with no adults working at a firm with more than 100 employees.
     All samples are further restricted to adults in households with income less than 300% of the federal poverty line. The treatment
     states in panels A and C include New York, Maine, and Vermont, while the treatment states in Panels B and D include Kentucky,
     Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New Jersey. Healthy adults are defined as those with self-reported health status of Excellent or
     Very Good and with no self-reported work disability. Unhealthy adults are the complement to the sample of healthy adults, which
     accounts for roughly one third of the sample population. Insurance status is taken directly from the Minnesota Population Center’s
     Summary Health Insurance variables, which are imputed using the CPS.

The last terms in equation (5) are the components of a standard difference-
in-differences framework, where the coefficients of interest would be the
β 7t . In estimating equation (5), I think of the set of Reg. States × Yeart in-
dicators as controls for changes common to the set of community rated
markets. Their inclusion allows me to estimate the relationship between
Medicaid and private coverage within this set of community rated mar-
kets. The principal coefficient of interest is β 1 , which describes the rela-
tionship between private coverage and Medicaid’s coverage of unhealthy

adults (Unhealthy Frac. Medicaid = # of Adults in the Population ) in a com-
munity rating state relative to other states.
      β 1 should be given a predictive, rather than causal, interpretation be-
cause variation in Unhealthy Frac. Medicaids,t may be correlated with the
error term. Estimates of equation (5) thus provide suggestive evidence
of the proposed mechanism’s plausibility. Absent a partial correlation
between private coverage and Medicaid’s coverage of unhealthy adults,
it would be difficult to argue that Medicaid shapes the performance of
community-rated markets. Notably, a positive correlation must overcome
the most obvious sources of bias, which produce negative correlations be-
tween private coverage and Medicaid coverage of any kind.15
      I also estimate the relationship between private coverage and the extent
to which states’ Medicaid programs target unhealthy adults as follows:


   15 I
     do not pursue a “simulated instruments” approach (Currie and Gruber, 1996; Cutler
and Gruber, 1996) because Medicaid coverage less tightly tracks changes in eligibility rules
during this period than during earlier periods.

The primary variable of interest is Unhealthy Shares,t =             Total Frac. Medicaids,t ,
with Total Frac. Medicaids,t = # of# of Adults on Medicaid
                                     Adults in the Population . Unhealthy Shares,t
quantifies the fraction of a state’s adult Medicaid population that is un-
healthy. Although we must again give β 1 a predictive rather than causal
interpretation, potential sources of bias are less obvious here than in esti-
mating equation (5).16 The test that β 1 > 0 is this paper’s most direct test
for the relevance of the mechanisms described in Section 2. I estimate equa-
tion (6) with and without controlling directly for Total Frac. Medicaids,t
and its interaction with the Reg. States,t indicator.


7.3    The Relationship between Medicaid Expansions and
       the Performance of Community-Rated Markets
    I conclude the analysis with estimates of equations (5) and (6). Since
the primary explanatory variables of interest are new to these specifica-
tions, I present summary statistics characterizing their state-level varia-
tion in Table 6. The means in Table 6 confirm the nature of the Medicaid
expansions shown in Figure 3; community rating states expanded their
Medicaid programs to a greater degree than other states and their expan-
sions disproportionately swept up unhealthy individuals. Magnitudes are
smaller than those seen in Figure 3 because the samples used to construct
the figure were restricted to adults in households with incomes less than


  16 There  are standard reasons to worry that the fraction of the population on Medicaid
is driven by unobservable economic factors. It is also possible that unobservable factors
would be correlated with the fraction of Medicaid beneficiaries who are unhealthy. There
are no obvious reasons, however, to expect such unobservables to differ systematically
across states that did and did not adopt community rating.

300 percent of the poverty line. The standard deviations of the changes in
Unhealthy Shares,t and in Medicaid’s coverage of unhealthy adults reveal
substantial variation in both the size and composition of adult Medicaid
expansions.
    Table 7 presents estimates of equations (5) and (6). Public coverage of
unhealthy adults has a significant, positive partial correlation with private
coverage in community rated markets. Columns 1 and 2 show that a 7
percentage point expansion in public coverage, exclusively reaching un-
healthy adults, was associated with a 6 percentage point improvement in
private coverage. This is roughly the size New York’s public coverage ex-
pansion. Coverage of unhealthy adults has a modestly negative association
with private coverage in the control markets. Coverage of healthy adults
has a negative, statistically significant relationship with private coverage
rates in both market types.
    Columns 4 through 6 report estimates of equation (6), in which the ex-
                                                          Unhealthy Frac. Medicaid
planatory variable of interest is Unhealthy Shares,t = Total Frac. Medicaids,t s,t .
While there is no partial correlation between Unhealthy Shares,t and pri-
vate coverage rates in the control markets, there is a strong, positive par-
tial correlation between Unhealthy Shares,t and private coverage in the
community-rated markets. Controlling for the total fraction of the pop-
ulation receiving coverage through Medicaid has little effect on this result.
The coefficients on these variables show that increases in the total size of
state Medicaid programs were associated reductions in private coverage in
the control states, but not in the community rated markets.
    In columns 3 and 6 I restrict the sample to the years 2000 through 2006
and exclude the states that repealed their community rating regulations
before the end of the sample, namely Kentucky and New Hampshire. The
estimates are thus produced using a sample of community rating states
that maintained community rating for the duration of the sample. The
sample begins in 2000 so that community rating had been in place for at
least 3 years in all states. This restriction helps to ensure that the estimates
characterize the relationship between Medicaid and the long run perfor-
mance of the community-rated markets. The estimate of equation (6) is

     Survey (CPS) for years 1995-1997 and 2003-2006.
     Note: Samples consist of adults in households with at least one child and one full-time working adult, but with no adults working at a firm that has more than
     100 employees. CPS person weights were applied in estimating all numbers reported in the table. The Community Rating states are Kentucky, Maine,
     Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont. The “Control” states include all other states. Table values include means and standard
     deviations, taken across the states within each group. Individuals are defined as being unhealthy if they have a self-reported health status of "Good," "Fair," or
     "Poor," or if they report a work-limiting disability. Individuals not meeting these criteria are defined as healthy. Across the full sample, roughly 35 percent of
     adults are classified as unhealthy.

     ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the .01, .05, and .10 levels respectively. Standard errors, reported beneath each point estimate, were calculated using a block bootstrap
     approach with clusters drawn at the state level. In columns 1 through 3, the reported estimates are of the β1 through β4 from equation (5). In columns 4 through 6, the reported estimates are
     of the β1 through β4 from equation (6). Samples were taken from the March Economic and Demographic Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS) for years 1995-2006. They
     consist of members of households with at least one child and one full-time working adult, but with no adults working at a firm that has more than 100 employees. The samples in Columns 1,
     3 and 4 through 6 include all members of these households while the sample in column 2 excludes children. The results are from OLS regressions that include controls for state and year
     fixed effects, a set of year dummy varibles interacted with an indicator for in-force community rating regimes, a set of 2-digit occupation dummy variables, region dummy variables interacted
     with family income as a percent of the poverty line, an indicator for having a single mother as the household's head, and an indicator for being black, additional indicators for having two full
     time workers in the household and for the education levels of household adults, an indicator for home ownership, and age group indicators. The variables reported in the table are defined
     and described in Table 6.

in the estimate of equation (5) is moderately strengthened.


7.4   A Check on the Plausibility of the Estimates
    To assess the plausibility of the estimated effects, Appendix 6 presents
a calibration, conducted using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel
Survey (MEPS), of the potential effect of public insurance expansions on
premiums in community rated markets. The calibration shows that post-
1993 public insurance expansions had the potential to hold community-
rated premiums down by around $1,700 for a family of 4, with most of this
impact coming from coverage of unhealthy adults.
    This premium impact can be translated into a coverage change by ex-
pressing it as a percent of the relevant premiums and multiplying by the
extensive-margin elasticity of demand for insurance. Bernard and Banthin
(2008) estimate that, in 2002, the average non-group premium for families
was around $4,400 while the average small group premium was $8,500.
$1,700 is roughly 25 percent of the average family premium in the non-
and small-group markets. Chernew, Cutler and Keenan (2005) estimate
that the elasticity of insurance take-up with respect to premiums is approx-
imately -0.1, while Marquis and Long (1995) estimate an elasticity of -0.4.
Elasticities inferred from survey data by Krueger and Kuziemko (2013) are
closer to -1. With an elasticity on the order of -0.4, the Medicaid expansions
of community rating states could explain increases in private coverage of
roughly 7 percentage points on a baseline coverage rate of 70 percent.


8     Conclusion
    This paper studies the relationship between two prominent instruments
of health policy: community rating regulations and public insurance through
state Medicaid programs. The effects of these policies are fundamentally
connected. Community rating regulations risk substantial adverse selec-
tion when large numbers of unhealthy individuals remain on the private

                                     35
market. When targeted at relatively high cost populations, Medicaid ex-
pansions can combat this adverse selection. Medicaid expansions are thus
among a suite of policies that mediate the performance of community rated
insurance markets. Medicaid’s coverage of the unhealthy can reduce the
size of the subsidies and/or tax penalties required to stabilize such mar-
kets. It can similarly be viewed as a complement to risk adjustment pro-
grams.
    The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) contains
regulatory measures including community rating rules, guaranteed issue
requirements, and an individual mandate to purchase insurance. Three of
PPACA’s features are designed to go farther than previous regulations to
induce pooling of the healthy and sick.17 First, it taxes healthy individu-
als who forego insurance. Second, it limits adjustment along the intensive
margin of insurance generosity. Specifically, it expands minimum cover-
age requirements and tightens limits on out-of-pocket spending. Third, its
guaranteed issue requirements are more stringent than those typically in
place across the states.
    PPACA’s regulations may result in significant pressure to shift the cost
of unhealthy individuals out of the insurance exchanges. The law would
generously finance such efforts, as the federal government will reimburse
more than 90 percent of the cost of its associated Medicaid expansions.18
Both the implementation of these expansions and their impact on states’
insurance markets remain uncertain. These issues will be ripe for study as
PPACA’s implementation unfolds.

A.1: Alternative Selection of Control and Treat-
ment States
    Tables A1 and A2 explore the results obtained when estimating equa-
tion (3) using alternative criteria for selecting the sample of either the treat-
ment or control states. Table A1 focuses on the initial effect of implement-
ing community rating (following Panels A from Table 4) while Table A2
focuses on the recoveries of community rated markets during the early
2000s (following Panels C from Table 4).
    Rows 1 through 6 of Tables A1 and A2 display results that involve pool-
ing the full set of community-rating states and using alternative criteria for
restricting the sample of control states. When no states are excluded from
the analysis, the estimated decline in coverage is 8 percentage points, con-
sistent with results reported in Table 4. Restricting the control group to
the non-community rating states that voted for Al Gore in the 2000 Pres-
idential election slightly increases the estimated coverage decline. This
restriction has essentially no effect on the estimated size of the subsequent
coverage recoveries. The same can be said for the results obtained using
4 samples selected on the basis of estimates of each state’s propensity to
adopt community rating regimes. Propensity score 1 was estimated on the
basis of state-level economic and demographic characteristics and an in-
dicator for whether or not the state voted for Al Gore. Propensity score
2 is based solely on state-level economic and demographic characteristics.
Propensity scores 3 and 4 are equivalent to 1 and 2, but are based on the
economic and demographic characteristics of households on the non- and
small-group insurance markets (as opposed to the entire state population).
    Rows 7 through 13 of Tables A1 and A2 investigate the results’ sensitiv-
ity to excluding any one of the community rating states from the sample.
New York emerges as an important contributor to the magnitudes of the
results in both tables. Estimates of both the initial coverage declines and
later coverage recoveries decline by around 2 percentage points when New

York is excluded from the sample. New Jersey pushes the estimated size
of the recovery down by roughly 1 percentage point. The New York and
New Jersey outcomes are important drivers of the results presented in Ta-
ble 7. New York was the most aggressive of the community rating states in
its expansion of Medicaid for unhealthy adults, while New Jersey was the
least.
    The final rows of Tables A1 and A2 explore differences in the effects of
community rating across groups of states that may objectively be expected
to have different experiences. Row 14 excludes states that abandoned their
regulations during the sample (i.e., New Hampshire and Kentucky). As a
check on the plausibility of the public insurance mechanism, it is essential
that these states do not drive the results, and indeed they do not. Row 15
restricts the treatment group to New York and Vermont, which were the
only states to implement pure (as opposed to modified) community rat-
ing laws in both their non- and small-group markets. Finally, I consider
the effect of adding less-tightly regulated states to the treatment group.
Specifically, I define the treatment group to include all states described
in Table 1; this includes 6 additional states which either had weak guar-
anteed issue requirements or which enforced community rating in their
small-group markets, but not in their non-group markets. The addition
of these less-tightly regulated states significantly reduces the estimated ef-
fects of community rating. In both tables the estimates become statistically
insignificant, suggesting that relatively modest regulations cause much less
disruption in insurance markets than community rating regimes as defined
throughout this paper.
    These last results suggest that regulating both of the markets to which
households have access has much greater effects than regulating one of
them. It is also relevant that 4 of the 6 less tightly regulated states utilized
high risk pools during the 1990s. High risk pools provide subsidized cov-
erage for high cost types who would otherwise put upward pressure on
community-rated premiums. As indicated in the last column of Table 1,
none of the community rating states made use of such pools as means to
limit adverse selection pressures during the sample-period.

A.2: Presentation of State-Level Variation
    Appendix Figure A1 presents state-level, regression adjusted changes
in insurance coverage. These state-level observations display variation at
the level at which observations were re-sampled for purposes of block-
bootstrap estimation of the standard errors. The variation displayed is
thus the variation underlying the estimates reported in Table 5, Table A.1,
and Table A.2. Figures A2, A3, and A4 present unadjusted tabulations, of
private coverage, the fraction uninsured, and Medicaid’s coverage of low
income adults, in which the evolution of coverage rates is presented on a
treatment state by treatment state basis.
    Panel A of Figure A.1 shows changes in private coverage across the
set of community-rating states from the base period of 1988-1992 through
1996-1997. Each of the early-adopting states with stable regulatory regimes,
namely Maine, New York, and Vermont, experienced declines well in ex-
cess of the average change experienced by other states. The point estimate
associated with this group is little affected by excluding any one of them.
The similarity of the experience of these states underlies the relatively small
block-bootstrapped standard errors reported in column 1 of Table 4’s Pan-
els A and B.
    Because coverage in Maine and Vermont is estimated using smaller
numbers of underlying observations, year-by-year tabulations of coverage
are, of course, noisier for these states than for New York. New York is
unique in that there is sufficient data for estimates of its annual coverage
rates to move smoothly. Following are the number of observations asso-
ciated with each of the community rating states for 1996 and 1997: New
York, 7,216; Maine, 1,049; Vermont, 1,176; New Hampshire, 1,113; New
Jersey, 3,623; Massachusetts, 2,410; Kentucky, 1,447. When restricted to the
non- and small-group market samples, the numbers of observations are:
New York, 2,040; Maine, 305; Vermont, 358; New Hampshire, 238; New
Jersey, 874; Massachusetts, 554; Kentucky, 320.
    Among the states with relatively staggered adoption of their commu-
nity rating rules, New Jersey and Kentucky experienced substantial cover-

     Figure A.2: Unadjusted Tabulations of Private Coverage. The figure contains tabulations constructed using the March Demo-
     graphic Supplements of the Current Population Survey (CPS). Samples consist of the adults and children (aged 18 and lower) in
     households with at least one child and at least one full-time working adult. In each panel, the “Control” state tabulations replicate
     that shown in Panel C of Figure 1. Tabulations for treatment states are shown on a state-by-state basis, as indicated in each Panel’s
     title. For New York, Maine, and Vermont, the vertical line at 1993 indicates they year in which all non- and small-group community
     rating regimes were implemented. For New Jersey, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, the lines indicate the years over which
     community rating regulations were enacted. For New Hampshire and Kentucky, the dashed vertical line indicates the year in which
     community rating regulations were repealed.

     Figure A.3: Unadjusted Tabulations of the Fraction Uninsured. The figure contains tabulations constructed using the March
     Demographic Supplements of the Current Population Survey (CPS). Samples consist of the adults and children (aged 18 and lower)
     in households with at least one child and at least one full-time working adult. In each panel, the “Control” state tabulations replicate
     that shown in Panel C of Figure 1. Tabulations for treatment states are shown on a state-by-state basis, as indicated in each Panel’s
     title. For New York, Maine, and Vermont, the vertical line at 1993 indicates they year in which all non- and small-group community
     rating regimes were implemented. For New Jersey, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, the lines indicate the years over which
     community rating regulations were enacted. For New Hampshire and Kentucky, the dashed vertical line indicates the year in which
     community rating regulations were repealed.

     Figure A.4: Unadjusted Tabulations of Medicaid Coverage of Low Income Adults. The figure contains tabulations constructed
     using the March Demographic Supplements of the Current Population Survey (CPS). Samples consist of the adults (aged 21 and over)
     in households with at least one child, at least one full-time working adult, and household income below 300 percent of the poverty
     line. In each panel, the “Control” state tabulations replicate that shown in Panel C of Figure 1. Tabulations for treatment states
     are shown on a state-by-state basis, as indicated in each Panel’s title. For New York, Maine, and Vermont, the vertical line at 1993
     indicates they year in which all non- and small-group community rating regimes were implemented. For New Jersey, Massachusetts,
     and New Hampshire, the lines indicate the years over which community rating regulations were enacted. For New Hampshire and
     Kentucky, the dashed vertical line indicates the year in which community rating regulations were repealed.
age declines. It is perhaps not surprising that Massachusetts experienced
a modest decline since it did not enact community rating in its non-group
market until 1997 (its small group market had been regulated since 1992).
New Hampshire was, similarly, not one of the earliest movers.
    The lower panels figure A1 show the state-level, regression adjusted
recoveries experienced from 1996-1997 through 2003-2006. This period’s
coverage changes vary significantly across the set of community rating
states. Over this period, New York performed much better than Maine
and Vermont. New York thus drives what we see in the coverage tabula-
tions presented in Panels C and D of Figure 2. The variation within this
group is reflected in the relatively large standard error associated with col-
umn 1 of Panel D in Table 4. The variation presented in Panels C and D
of Figure A1 is precisely the variation found to be strongly correlated with
changes in Medicaid’s coverage of relatively unhealthy adults in Section 7.


A.3: Robustness to Supplementing Controls with
State Economic Aggregates
    Appendix Tables A.3 and A.4 explore the robustness of the baseline
difference-in-differences estimates to controlling for economic aggregates
and growth in state-level health expenditures. Table A.3 reports the ro-
bustness of the estimates of initial coverage declines. Table A.4 reports the
robustness of the estimates of subsequent coverage recoveries.
    Controlling directly for economic aggregates (specifically the employ-
ment to population ratio and income per capita) has essentially no impact
on the results. The estimated coefficients on these variables are statistically
indistinguishable from 0. I take this as evidence that the individual- and
household-level economic and demographic controls proved sufficient as
controls for the state of the economy. This was not guaranteed; aggregate
economic activity could very well influence insurance offerings for reasons
beyond its implications for household-level economic conditions. In prac-
tice, however, this does not appear to be the case.

     ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the .01, .05, and .10 levels respectively. Standard errors, reported beneath each point estimate, were clustered at
     the state level. Column 1 replicates the point estimate from column 1 of Panel C in Table 5. Column 5 replicates the point estimate from column 2 of Panel C
     in Table 5. As indicated, additional specifications contain controls for state level health spending per capita (in 1000s of dollars), income per capita (in 1000s
     of dollars), and the employment to population ratio. State health spending was taken from the National Health Expenditure Accounts, while state personal
     income, employment, and population were taken from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
    State health spending emerges as a strong predictor of private coverage
changes during the latter sample (i.e., the “subsequent coverage recoveries”
sample). Growth in health spending per capita is negatively related to
coverage in all specifications, and the relationship is strongly statistically
distinguishable from 0 for the latter period. Including this control results in
moderate increases in the estimated size of the recoveries in the community
rating states. This reflects the fact that the community rating states were
states in which health expenditures grew relatively rapidly.


A.4: Age Composition of Coverage Movements
    If community-rating regulations induce adverse selection, one would
expect to observe a shift in the composition of the covered towards pop-
ulations with relatively high expected health spending. Unfortunately the
CPS contains no information on health status until 1995, which comes two
years after the implementation of community rating in Maine, New York,
and Vermont. Nonetheless, expected health spending is positively corre-
lated with age. Appendix Figure A5 thus presents a breakdown of the
evolution of private coverage rates by age group.
    The year community rating went into place, namely 1993, saw a diver-
gence in coverage rates for adults aged 21 to 45 relative to adults aged 46
to 60. In that year the coverage rate rose by around 8 percentage points for
those aged 46 to 60 and declined by around 5 percentage points for those
aged 21 to 45. Coverage declines between 1994 and 1997, as estimated in
the main text, were of similar size for both groups. For those aged 45 to
60, the net coverage change was from just over 70 percentage points to just
under 70 percentage points. For younger adults, the coverage rate declined
from 73 percentage points in 1991 to a 1997 low of 56 percentage points.
While sub-group tabulations are somewhat noisy, in particular for the 46
to 60 group during the pre-regulation period, the data appear consistent
with adverse selection along the age margin.

     Figure A.5: Insurance Status by Age Group: Stable Regulatory Regimes. The figure contains tabulations constructed using the
     March Demographic Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS). The sample in panel A contains adults aged 21 through
     45, while the sample in panel B contains adults aged 45 through 60. The Treatment States include Maine, New York, and Vermont.
A.5: Coverage Movements with Alternative Sam-
ple Inclusion Criteria
    The analysis in the main text focuses on households with at least one
child and one full time employed adult. Appendix Figures A6 and A7
present tabulations of the samples that include childless households (A6)
or households in which all adults are unemployed (A7). As can be seen in
Figure A6, inclusion of childless households has very little impact on the
core features of the evolution of coverage. The data suggest that coverage
rates in markets for “singles” coverage were relatively stable over the full
sample period. This may be because the market for singles coverage was
relatively adversely selected to begin with. This market segment is home
to the “young invincibles” whose coverage decisions are much discussed
in the context of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
    Figure A7 presents tabulations of coverage for samples augmented to
include households in which no adult is employed. A household with chil-
dren and no employed adults will almost invariably be eligible for Medi-
caid at some point during the calendar year. Unsurprisingly, inclusion of
this group significantly shifts up the Medicaid coverage rates associated
with in-sample households. Medicaid’s counter-cyclicality (with respect to
the business cycle) is also readily apparent. The insurance status of the
unemployed tells us little about the effects of community rating regula-
tions because these households are unlikely participants in private mar-
kets. Their inclusion in the sample serves primarily to compress realized
fluctuations in the fraction uninsured (see Panel A).

A.6: Calibration of the Potential Effect of Public
Insurance Expansions on Premiums in Regulated
Markets
    The potential effect of public insurance expansions on community-rated
premiums can be approximated using the observed expenditures and health
status of those who are newly eligible for, and participating in, public in-
surance.19 Table A5 calibrates the effect of all post-1993 public insurance
expansions on the community-rated premium of a family with 2 adults and
2 children. From 1993 to 2004, the number of Medicaid (or SCHIP) ben-
eficiaries expanded by around 10 million children, 5 million non-disabled
adults, and 3 million disabled persons. States with community rating ac-
counted for roughly 1 million of these children, 1.1 million non-disabled
adults, and 500,000 disabled persons while accounting for roughly 11 per-
cent of the nation’s population. The vast majority of the expanded coverage
of unhealthy adults and the disabled (roughly four fifths) drew from the
pool of non- and small-group market participants.20
    I examine the expenditures of newly eligible individuals using health
spending data from the 2004 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).

   19 Two important caveats arise in this context. Health spending will reflect the reim-
bursement rates offered to providers by public programs, which are typically lower than
those offered by private insurers. The calibration accounts for this using an estimate from
Zuckerman et al. (2004) that Medicaid reimbursement rates are roughly 30 percent lower
than reimbursement rates that prevail under Medicare (for comparable services). Large
employer plan typically pay 40 percent more than Medicare’s rates Clemens and Gottlieb
(2013). Non- and small-group plans likely pay rates between those of Medicare and large-
employer plans. Spending on Medicaid beneficiaries will also reflect difficulties in ob-
taining care due to physician (un)willingness to see Medicaid patients. Pregnant women
and the disabled were explicitly covered by Medicaid on account of their high health ex-
penditures. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) confirms that (non-disabled)
adults on public insurance have higher health expenditures than the typical adult on pri-
vate coverage. (It may still be the case, of course, that observed differences understate real
differences in what the publicly insured would spend if they were on private insurance.)
Children, however, were not made eligible on account of their health.
   20 Thisresult does not stem directly from evidence presented earlier in the paper, but
can be seen quite readily in the data when comparing Medicaid coverage of unhealthy
adults with and without access to insurance through the large group market.

     costs of publicly insured individuals in excess of privately insured individuals were estimated using data from the 2004 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
     (MEPS). The MEPS sample was restricted to individuals in households with an employed adult in order to focus on newly eligible recipients of public
     insurance. Excess spending for publicly insured adults is roughly similar whether the comparison sample includes all other adults or only adults with private
     insurance. The excess spending for the disabled is the reported $8000 when the sample includes all other adults, and rises to $14,000 when the sample is
     restricted to only include those with private insurance. Excess costs were converted into costs per privately insured individual by multiplying average excess
     costs by the ratio of new beneficiaries from the non- and small-group markets to the baseline number of private insurance holders. Although not all new
     public insurance recipients would have been on private insurance, individuals with the highest costs would have been likely to obtain private coverage in the
     comprehensively regulated markets since they stood to benefit the most from community rated premiums. For example, even if only 0.5 of the 1.1 million
     adults had previously held private coverage, these would likely have been relatively high cost adults, making the above conversion into excess costs per
     privately insured individual appropriate. Total excess costs were converted into excess costs covered by private insurance by multiplying by two-thirds. Two-
     thirds is the typical share of health expenditures covered by private insurance among non- and small-group policy holders in the MEPS. The final adjustment
     accounts for the fact that Medicaid reimbursement rates are lower than private reimbursement rates. Estimates for non-disabled adults and disabled adults,
     which are based on the actual expenditures of publicly insured inviduals, will understate the expenditures that would be incurred under private insurance unless
     an appropriate adjustment is made. Work by Zuckerman et al. (2004) suggests that Medicaid reimbursement rates are, on average, 30% lower than
     reimbursement rates that prevail elsewhere.
To proxy for newly-eligible status, I use household employment informa-
tion. Specifically, I focus attention on those who are in households with at
least one full-time employed adult. The vast majority of those eligible for
Medicaid prior to the 1990s expansions were in households in which there
were no full-time employed adults. These expansions were designed to
target the working poor, i.e., low income households in which at least one
family member works regularly. In this sample, the typical non-disabled,
publicly insured adult spends roughly $1,325 (standard error of $611) more
per year than the typical privately insured adult. The typical publicly in-
sured disabled individual spends roughly $8,000 (standard error of $671)
more than the typical adult. Finally, I estimate that, if privately insured,
newly eligible children would have spent roughly $100 more than the typ-
ical privately insured child.
    The potential premium impacts of expanded coverage for adults and
the disabled are much larger than that associated with children. There
were approximately 5 million adults with private insurance in the non-
and small-group markets of the community rating states in 2004. I assume
that four-fifths, or 880 thousand, of the newly covered, non-disabled adults
came from the non- and small-group markets.21 Their excess spending of
$1,325 per person thus amounts to roughly $233 per adult still on these
markets. The excess spending of the newly-covered disabled population
amounts to $640 per adult on these markets. If two-thirds of these ex-
penditures would have been covered by private insurance (a typical share
for the privately insured on the non- and small-group markets), the pre-
mium impact would amount to nearly $585 per adult. A final adjustment,
to account for Medicaid’s relatively low reimbursement rates (which will
depress observed spending by those on public insurance relative to what
they would spend were they on private insurance), raises this estimate to
$836 (see Zuckerman et al. (2004)). Similar calculations for expanded chil-
dren’s coverage yields an estimate of roughly $17 per child. The post-1993

  21 This  assumption is driven by CPS data suggesting that roughly one-fifth of new
beneficiaries came from families whose alternative source of insurance would have come
through the large group insurance market.

public insurance expansions may thus have held down community-rated
premiums by around $1,700 for a family of 4.


A.7: The Evolution of Health Maintenance Orga-
nizations in Community Rating States
    The analysis in this paper’s main text focuses on the extensive mar-
gin of the insurance purchasing decision. Adverse selection can also occur
along the intensive margin of insurance generosity. As discussed in the
main text, past work estimated relatively small impacts of community rat-
ing regulations on the extensive margin. Buchmueller and DiNardo (2002)
hypothesize that these markets may have arrived at separating equilib-
ria in the spirit of Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976). In support of this view,
Buchmueller and DiNardo (2002) and Buchmueller and Liu (2005) find evi-
dence that the market share of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)
increased significantly in community-rated markets relative to other mar-
kets.
    In contrast with past work, this paper finds that community rating reg-
ulations caused extensive margin declines in private coverage rates. In
some states coverage subsequently rebounded. By way of explanation, this
paper advances a hypothesis involving the interplay between community
rating regulations and public insurance programs. A natural alternative
hypothesis, considered below, involves the separating equilibria proposed
by past work. Specifically, coverage may have recovered because of sepa-
rating equilibria made possible by adjustments on the supply side of the
insurance market.
    To assess this alternative hypothesis, I assembled data on the evolution
of HMO penetration rates over the course of my sample period. These
data are reported annually in the Statistical Abstract of the United States
for 1995 through 2006, and in five year increments from 1980 through 1995.
Table A.6 displays the evolution of HMO penetration rates for the indi-
vidual community rating states and for the United States as a whole. As


                                     61
with the main text’s analysis of coverage rates, I separately present initial
changes from the pre-regulation period through 1997 as well as the subse-
quent evolution from 1997 through 2005.
    Consistent with Buchmueller and DiNardo (2002) and Buchmueller and
Liu (2005), I find that HMO penetration rates increased disproportionately
in the community rating states relative to other states during the mid-
1990s. From 1990 to 1997, the average change in HMO penetration was
roughly 9 percentage points for the United States as a whole and roughly
18 percentage points among the community rating states. Combined with
the results from the main text, this suggests that community rated markets
experienced significant coverage declines on both the extensive margin and
the intensive margin of coverage generosity.
    I next consider how intensive margin adjustments relate to the pattern
of coverage recoveries shown in Panel C of Figure A1. The evidence sug-
gests that intensive-margin adjustments cannot explain the observed re-
coveries. Note first that both the community rating states and the U.S. as
a whole experienced little change in HMO penetration rates from 1997 to
2005. As proxied by HMO penetration, there is no evidence of differential
changes in coverage generosity over this time period.
    Second, I examine the variation in HMO coverage changes within the
set of community rating states. This variation appears unable to explain
variation in the size of the coverage recoveries. The last column of Ta-
ble A6 reveals significant variation in the changes in HMO coverage rates
within the set of community rating states. Notably, HMO coverage de-
clined in New York, while increasing in Maine and Vermont. As shown in
Panel C of Figure A1, New York experienced a substantial extensive mar-
gin recovery over this time period, while Maine and Vermont lagged the
performance of other community rating states. This is inconsistent with the
view that HMO penetration enabled coverage to recover. If anything, the
evidence suggests a positive correlation between intensive and extensive
margin recoveries.
