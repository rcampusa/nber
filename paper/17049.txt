                                            ABSTRACT

Over the last thirty years pathways to retirement have changed substantially in the UK. They have
been dominated by spells of unemployment in the late 1970s, with then an increased importance of
disability spells from the mid-1980s onwards. At the end of the period the direct route from work to
retirement was increasingly more common. General economic conditions seem to have been important
driving forces during the entire period. In contrast changes in health do not seem to provide convincing
explanations for these trends: mortality has been falling over the period without any apparent link
to the share of the population reporting ill health or disability or to the number claiming benefits. We
also find evidence that recent reforms have had some impact. The halting of the previous growth in
the rate of in-flow onto disability benefits in the mid-1990s coincided with the implementation of a
major reform. Evidence from the pilots of the Pathways-to-Work programme in 2003-2005 suggests
that those moving onto disability benefits moved off these benefits faster than they would otherwise
have done as a direct result of the programme.

1. Introduction

Two potentially contradictory trends have been identified as populations around
the world have been ageing in recent years. On the one hand, improvement in
health has led to non-abated increases in life expectancies. On the other, health
conditions and disability have become seen, more than ever, as the main obstacle
to longer working lives. This apparent paradox is at the core of policies aiming to
encourage longer working life as various institutional settings (state pensions,
disability benefits and unemployment insurance) interact with changes in health
status and labour market conditions. Previous research has highlighted the
impact of financial incentives of pension systems across a number of developed
economies (Gruber and Wise 1999, 2004) but much less is known on the role
that other pathways to retirement and changes in health conditions have played.
        The UK is a fine example of these interactions. With stricter
unemployment benefits and relatively few early retirement schemes (Banks et. al
2010), disability benefits have come over time to represent an important
pathway to retirement. At the same time, life expectancy has been rising
continuously while measures of self-reported health or disability do not seem to
exhibit similar falls. As a result, disability benefits have become on top of the
policy agenda with reforms following each other at a very rapid pace since the
mid 1990s: a major reform in 1995 was followed by important changes in 2000,
2001, 2003, 2006, 2008 and lately 2010.
When one considers the degree of policy interest for this issue, one could be
surprised at the limited literature on the subject in the UK. The main reason
behind this is not the lack of interest from economists but more the lack of
suitable data that combine information on labour market situation and
comprehensive measures of health and disability. Most early work had to rely on
self-reported measures of incapacity for work and benefit receipts. The obvious
problem is that self-reported measure of disability could be affected by benefit
receipt and offers therefore limited explanatory power (Myers 1982, Bound
1991). The main result from this early literature (Doherty 1979, Fenn 1981,
Piachaud 1986, Disney and Webb, 1991) was that both disability benefits and
self-reported disability were linked to the labour market conditions: increased
unemployment seemed to lead to increased number of claimants of disability
benefits and increased self-reported disability. More recent research (Benítez-
Silva et al. 2010) has confirmed this relationship between the business cycle and
the incidence of self-reported disability and provided more insights to the
mechanisms involved, showing that unemployment had a large impact on the
outflow rate out of disability benefits. Increasingly, researchers have tried to go
beyond measures of self-reported health to capture the impact of more objective
measures of health shocks. Disney et al. (2006) have for instance used panel data
to construct instruments of self-reported health, showing that these health
shocks were important predictors of movements in and out of paid work among


1
those approaching the state pension age in the UK. In an alternative approach,
anchoring vignettes have been used to try and control for group or country-
specific reporting effects on subjective health and work disability, with particular
application to international comparisons (see Kapteyn et al. (2007) or Banks et
al. (2008) for example.
This paper examines changes in health and disability related transfers in the UK
over the last thirty years, and describes how they are related to changes in
labour force participation. The objective is to present a comprehensive
description of the reforms to the institutional setting, along with available time
series coming from administrative data on benefit receipt, cross-section or panel
data on self-reported health and their interactions with labour force status. By
providing systematic evidence on institutions and data, we hope to help future
research providing a fuller picture of the trends over this period. We also present
evidence on the impact of two large reforms to disability benefits in the UK that
help shed light on the long-term changes in disability prevalence in the UK.
Section 2 presents the evolution of transfers targeted towards people with
disabilities in the UK, focusing on recent reforms and the distinctive features of
these benefits compared to their equivalent in other countries. Section 3 shows
the evidence available on the different pathways to retirement in the UK while
section 4 presents evidence on various health measures, including mortality and
self-reported health, and contrasts these evidences with labour market
outcomes. Section 5 presents evidence on two major reforms of the UK disability
benefit system, the 1995 reform and the more recent Pathways–to-Work
programme. Section 6 concludes.

2. History of transfers targeted towards people with disability in the
   United Kingdom

Disability is a difficult characteristic to define. The traditional approach in the
literature has rested on the pioneering work from Nagi (1965, 1991) who
identified three components of disability: a pathology, an impairment and an
inability to perform expected activities.3 This approach leads to view disability as
a permanent condition, completely separated from sickness, defined as a
temporary incapacity. This distinction between permanent and temporary
conditions has not been instrumental in the design of the UK benefit system.
Historically, as this section will describe in more detail, sick and disabled
individuals were all covered by sickness benefits, the only distinction coming
from duration of claims. As a result the focus has been more on long term
sickness than on ‘disability’. In order to facilitate the comparison with other
countries, we present the benefits available both to short-term sick and to long
term sick or disabled.

  See Bound and Burkhauser (1999) for a review on these definitions and the implications for the
measurement of the population with disabilities.


                                                                                                   2
Transfers targeted towards long term sick or disabled in the UK are a complex
set of benefits that have evolved over time and been relabelled multiple times. To
clarify this institutional setting, with a jungle of acronyms, it is helpful to
distinguish four types of ‘disability’ benefits: work-related injury benefits,
disability insurance, non-contributory benefits and means-tested benefits
(Creedy and Disney 1985, Burchardt 1999).

    2.1. Work­related injury benefits
Compensatory benefits, for injuries at work or during wars, were historically the
first ones to be implemented in the UK with the enactment in 1897 of the
Workmen’s Compensation Act, which established the legal liability of employers
to compensate employees for loss of earnings capacity as a result of an accident
or disease linked to employment (Walker 1981, Walker and Walker 1991).
During World War I a state scheme, the War Disablement Pension, was
introduced to offer compensation to veterans of H.M. Armed Forces. It was
followed in 1948 by the Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (IIDB), set up by
the National Insurance Industrial Injury Act 1946.4 Both schemes still exist today
and have only been marginally changed over time.5 They offer more generous
benefits than other disability benefits, are not means-tested, and can be
cumulated with other benefits.

    2.2. Disability and sickness insurance
The second type of disability benefits is earnings replacement benefits. The UK
schemes share some characteristics of other countries’ sickness and disability
insurance but also have two defining features inherited from their origin.
First, they are not really insurance schemes, as generally understood. The
welfare system put in place in the UK in 1948 largely followed the design of the
Beveridge report (Beveridge 1942). It relied on an insurance principle, whereby
eligibility to benefits was determined by contribution requirements, but benefits
were not earnings related, unlike the US SSDI or examples in Continental Europe.
As a result the system has largely been targeted at low income individuals for
whom flat-rate benefits represented a large replacement rate.6
Second, the UK system has not formally recognised permanent disability
conditions. The benefit set up in 1948 was called Sickness Benefit and offered a
benefit with unlimited duration.7 Hence the coverage for disability was not


4
  The rate of the IIDB in 2009–10 was £143.60 per week (or $12,000 annually) for an extent of
disablement of 100% and those over 18. The benefit is reduced proportionally with the disablement.
5
  The IIDB was originally split into Industrial Injury Benefit (IIB) for the first 26 weeks of sickness and
Industrial Disablement Benefit for longer durations. In April 1983 IIB was abolished and replaced for the
first 8 weeks by employers Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) and Sickness Benefit for durations between 9 and 25
weeks (see section 2.2 for more details on SSP).
6
  There is a short period between 1966 and 1980 when earnings-related Sickness benefits have been
introduced but this social insurance experiment has been both limited and short-lived.
7
  The system introduced after World War II is also largely the heir of the general sickness insurance
introduced by the National Insurance Act 1911. It provided sickness benefits payable for 26 weeks along
with a disability benefit and some health care benefit. All these benefits were distributed through


3
distinguished from short-term sickness, and only duration of claim could
distinguish the long-term sick from the short-term sick.
Table 2.1 presents the evolution of these schemes from 1948 to 2010 according
to duration of incapacity while Box 2.1 summarizes the changes to the generosity
of these sickness and disability schemes. In 1971 Invalidity Benefit (IVB) was
split from Sickness Benefit but still followed the structure inherited from the
previous scheme, whereby entry to IVB would be offered to those who had been
on sickness benefits for longer than 28 weeks. IVB offered a higher level of
benefit than Sickness Benefit but without imposing another health test when
entering IVB. The screening process at the time relied on a medical assessment,
by a personal doctor, of the ability to conduct “suitable work”.
In 1983 a major reform was introduced to transfer administration of sick pay
claims from Sickness Pay to employers, for the first eight weeks of sickness,
increased to 28 weeks in 1986. Employers were mandated to pay Statutory Sick
Pay (SSP), payments which would be reimbursed by the government through
lower National Insurance contributions.8 For those who would not qualify to SSP,
Sickness Benefit was still available.

The number of claimants increased slowly until the mid-1980s for the older
working age individuals, when a sharp increase of IVB recipients was registered
for all age groups. One can see in Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2 the number of IVB

approved Friendly Societies but the scheme largely paved the way for further state interventions (see
chapter 2 of Creedy and Disney 1985 and Gilbert 1965).
8
  Control of SSP was made by self-certification of sickness from the part of employees, which has raised
concerns when expenditures on SSP turned out to increase more rapidly than Sickness Benefit (Creedy and
Disney, 1985 page 127).


                                                                                                       4
recipients as a share of the 55-59, 60-64 and 65-69 age groups for men and
women. Between 1985 and 1996, the share of the 55-59 year old men on IVB
almost doubled, from 10.9% to 20.0%.
In 1995 a reform was introduced which replaced the IVB and Sickness Benefit
schemes with Incapacity Benefit (IB). This maintained the “own occupation test”
to qualify for the first 28 weeks of incapacity but replaced the “suitable work
test” of IVB with an “all work test” to qualify for the higher rate IB. This new
medical screening was also removed from personal doctors and was instead
administered by medical staff at the regional level and commissioned by the
scheme’s administration. The growth of the IB roll was stopped, even slightly
reversed but the stock remained high, especially for younger individuals. In
addition to these changes, IB was no longer paid to new claimants above the
state pension age (65 for men and 60 for women, at the time). Individuals
previously typically preferred to stay on IVB than to receive the basic state
pension as the latter is taxable whereas the former was not. The new IB benefit
excludes those above state pension age (at the time 60 for women and 65 for
men) and is treated as taxable income. This is why the number of claimants of IB
aged above the state pension age drops markedly after the 1995 reform in
Figures 2.1 and 2.2.

Note: IV/IB claimants’ data from Anyadike-Danes and McVicar (2007), working age population
from Family Expenditure Survey.

The 1999 Welfare Reform and Pensions Act introduced further changes, with a
tightening of the health test from April 2000 onwards and a reduction in the
generosity of IB from April 2001. The new health test is called Personal
Capability Assessment, which is designed to assess capacity for work instead of
checking incapacity for work and is therefore supposed to foster return to work.

The reform also increased the eligibility requirement for IB from having paid
contribution in any year before the start of incapacity to having paid sufficient
contributions in one of the last three years. Finally it introduced means-testing of
IB with regard to individual private pension income at a rate of 50% above £85 a
week.

Box 2.1. Reforms to the UK Disability Insurance system, 1948 to present
day
1948                            Introduction of Sickness Benefit. Flat rate benefit, no distinction
                                by duration of claims.
1966                            Introduction of earnings-related Sickness benefit.
1971                            Introduction of Invalidity Benefit (IVB). Higher rate for duration
                                above 6 months.
1972 reform                     Introduction of Invalidity Allowances. Supplements for becoming
                                disabled at younger age.
1980                            Abolition of earnings-related Sickness benefit.

1995 reform                     Incapacity Benefit (IB) replaces IVB. New claimants receive less
                                generous Incapacity Benefit, which is taxable (unlike IVB). “Own
                                occupation” test replaced by “Any occupation” test. Regional
                                medical test instead of personal doctor. No longer paid to people
                                over state pension age.

expansion 2003-       conditionality, increased support and increased financial
2008                  incentives to return to work.
2008 reform           Employment support allowance (ESA) replaces IB for new
                      claimants.
2010 reform           ESA is applied to all existing IB claimants.


In 2003 the New Labour government decided to pilot an ambitious, and
expensive, programme to incentivize IB claimants to return to work called
Pathways­to­Work. The programme included increased conditionality with
mandatory work focused interviews, increased financial incentives to return to
work and increased support with the provision of voluntary schemes designed to
help disabled individuals to return to work. The scheme was evaluated in pilot
areas and then expanded to the rest of the country (Adam, Bozio and Emmerson
2011).
In 2008 the Government announced a new scheme to replace IB, the Employment
Support Allowance (ESA) for new claimants. This new scheme incorporates a
stricter eligibility health test along with a redesign of the benefit rates. In the first
13 weeks of claim, the claimant is subjected to a Work Capacity Assessment
which determines whether the individual is entitled to ESA. Among those found
eligible for ESA, the Work Capacity Assessment distinguishes between those who
have “limited capacity to work and are unable to follow work related activities”
and the remainder who have “limited capacity to work but are able to follow
work related activities”. For the last group claimants are mandated to attend the
Pathways-to-Work programme. ESA will be progressively applied to all existing
IB claimants, i.e. existing claimants are going to be re-tested for the stricter
eligibility between October 2010 and 2014.

    2.3. Non­contributory benefits
Whereas the previous disability benefits are only available to those who have a
sufficient National Insurance contribution record, a set of benefits were created
in the 1970s for individuals of working age, with congenital disabilities, and who
did not qualify for the contributory scheme. In 1975 the Non­Contributory
Invalidity Pension (NCIP) was introduced, offering a benefit of 60% of IVB to men
or single women. In 1977 the scheme was extended to married women who were
“incapable of performing normal household duties” under the name of Housewife
Non­Contributory Invalidity Pension (HNCIP) but at lower rate than the NCIP.
Both NCIP and HNCIP were replaced in 1984 by the Severe Disablement
Allowance (SDA) which stopped the distinction that was deemed discriminatory
against women. It was subsequently abolished in 2001 for new claimants.
In the 1970s a number of schemes were also designed to offer benefits to
compensate the extra cost endured by disabled individuals, either in the form of
carers or the extra cost of mobility. In 1971 the Attendance Allowance (AA) was
created for those who required personal assistance and in 1976 a Mobility


7
Allowance (MA) was introduced for those who had difficulty moving around. Also
in 1976 an Invalid Care Allowance (ICA) was introduced for those who could not
work because they had to stay at home to care for a disabled relative.9 In April
1992 the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) replaced MA and AA for those who
had become disabled before the age of 65, while AA was kept for those aged over
65. In terms of total expenditure, DLA represents the biggest transfer targeted
towards people with disability in the UK. In 2006-07 it represented £9 billion of
expenditure, approximately 0.7% of national income. If one adds the £4 billion of
AA and £1.2 billion of CA, the non-contributory disability benefits represent
more than 1% of national income. With the June 2010 Budget, the government
plans to cut DLA spending by re-examining the health of existing claimants. The
details or this reform are not known at the time of writing.

    2.4. Means­tested benefits
A number of means-tested benefits targeting poor household have provisions
that include premiums for disability. Income Support (IS) on ground of disability
for instance offers a premium for low-income households containing at least one
disabled individual.
Another example is Working Tax Credit (WTC), the UK equivalent of the US
Earned Income Tax credit (EITC), has also a supplement for disabled workers,
and has a less onerous hours rule than that applied to non-disabled childless
adults, with a further premium for severely disabled. Housing Benefit (HB) is
another means-tested benefit with additional income for those with disability
and increased premium for those with severe disability.

3. Pathways into retirement and program reforms

Given the complexity of pathways into retirement, it is important to put the
changes to disability schemes in the wider context of other reforms to state
pension schemes and unemployment schemes. Presenting data on pathways into
retirement requires long panel datasets where each individual can be followed
from work into retirement status. The UK does not have comprehensive
administrative data such as the ones available for Germany (see Borsch-Supan et
al., this volume) but we can shed light on these transitions using three
approaches: cross-sections from Family Expenditure Survey (FES) and Labour
Force Survey (LFS), one-year economic transitions from LFS and the longer
panel from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS).

   3.1. Cross­section evidence on economic activity
Two representative surveys provide good information on participation in the
labour market in the UK. The FES goes back to 1968 and from 1975 onwards, the
LFS offers large samples of British households with a full description of their

    In 2003 ICA was renamed Carer’s Allowance (CA).

                                                                                     1

was associated with a large increase in the unemployed and the retired. The
share of those reporting being sick did not increase immediately. However,
starting in the mid-1980s, the share of 55-64 year old reporting being inactive
because of sickness increased markedly, in line with the increase in disability
benefits recipients observed in Figure 2.1. Over the last ten years the increase in
employment rate of this group has largely been at the expense of the
unemployed, and only marginally at the expense of those reporting health
problems. As a general remark, the share of those inactive because of sickness is
always much larger than those looking for work, even when the official
unemployment rate reached its highest level in the 1980s.

    3.2. One­year transitions from LFS
One advantage of the LFS since 1992 is that survey respondents are asked about
their economic position quarterly in five successive waves. This provides us with
a one-year panel dataset from 1993 onwards allowing us to present evidence on
transitions from employment into inactivity. Figure 3.3 presents the evolution of
these short-term transition rates for 60 to 64 year old men. The most striking
fact over the period, especially since the late 1990s, is the reduction in the
transition rate from employment into retirement. This coincides with the
significant increase in the employment rate of this group over the period.
Transitions to unemployment and disability have declined over the early 1990s
and stabilised at a low level since. There is hardly any evidence from these
statistics that the 1995 reform has had much impact on the transitions through
disability and the dominant factor over the period remains the change in



                                                                                                                                                             10

Figure 3.4 presents similar evidence by looking reversely to the previous activity
of newly retired individuals, i.e. individuals who declare that they are retired in
one year but were not in the previous year. From the mid-1990s to the days
before the financial crisis, direct transition from employment to retirement has


11
increased markedly: whereas in 1994 only 54% of newly retired men were
coming directly from employment, this share reached 67% in 2008. This has
been matched by a similar decrease of newly retired men coming from
unemployment, whose proportions were halved from 20% to 10%. On the other
hand there is only limited evidence of reductions in those coming from long-term
sickness or disability. From 1994 to 2001 the proportion is increasing, from 25%
to 35% while a decline is evident in the more recent years down to 23% in 2008.

    3.3. Evidence from BHPS
The short-term transition rates from the LFS provide a good but limited
description of the pathways to retirement that individuals might experience. It is
possible to imagine that transitions to unemployment cascade into disability
before retirement and that short-term transitions do not capture these effects. In
order to shed light on these long-term transitions, we use a long panel dataset,
the British Household Panel Survey, which surveys 10,000 individuals every year
since 1991 and up to 2007. Although we have access to seventeen waves of
BHPS, there are only few cohorts that we can follow from age 50 through
retirement. We have selected the cohort born between 1938 and 1942 who were
aged 49 and 53 in 1991 and aged 65 to 69 in 2007. In Figure 3.5 we present the
evolution of self-reported economic activity for a sample of men from this cohort
who were in paid work in 1991. Between age 50 and 55, inactivity is largely
dominated by unemployment, whereas disability becomes a more substantial
aspect from age 55 onwards up to much older ages. Nonetheless the decrease in
employment over the 50-69 age group is still largely dominated by the increase
in other status, i.e. retirement.

In Figure 3.6 we present similar statistics to Figure 3.4 but using the long panel
of the BHPS as opposed to the short panel of LFS data. Those who were retired in
2007 transited largely directly from employment: 64.5% of retired men aged 65-
69 in 2007 were in employment before retiring compared with 63.3% for
women. This leaves still a significant share that transit through unemployment
and disability: 25.0% of men aged 65-69 came from disability against 13.8% for
women. Disability is an ever more important transition for women as the
increase in labour force participation of women has reduced the other form of
inactivity while increasing eligibility to disability benefits.

Note: Those who are inactive throughout the panel are included in “other”.

Figure 3.7 takes full advantage of the long panel from the BHPS by presenting
evidence on transitions from employment into retirement and distinguishing the
different pathways. The large majority of men and women aged 65-69 are either
still in work or have transited directly from employment to retirement (75.6% of
men and 78.4% of women). This is not to say that spells of unemployment or
disability are rare, as a significant proportion of men transit through
unemployment (11.3%) and disability (8.9%). It is however much less common
to experience multiple transitions from unemployment to disability before
retiring as these two options seem to be alternative pathways.

4. Evidence on long term trends in health and labour participation

This section aims to provide evidence on long term trends in health using
measures of mortality rates at different ages and self-reported measures of
disability. We then attempt to relate these changes to changes in the labour force
participation.

    4.1. Mortality data
There are two advantages in using mortality data. First, mortality is a well
defined concept and it is therefore easy to present comparable information
across countries. Second, mortality rates are available over long periods and can
be matched with historical data on labour force participation. However mortality
data have also very obvious limitations for our purpose: they are not individual
data, and do not allow assessing individual specific health shocks to labour force
participation. And perhaps even more importantly, morbidity is a very different
issue from disability or incapacity to work, which is more likely to matter to
explain trends in labour force participation. England and Wales life tables are
available from 1841 onwards by age and sex and by period and cohort.10 We use
in this section period data for ease of comparison with other countries.


10
   Mortality rates calculated on a “period basis” do not account for future changes (typically
improvements) in mortality rates, whereas those calculated on a “cohort basis” do allow for such changes.

Figure 4.1 and 4.2 show the evolution of period mortality rate of English and
Welch men and women at age 55, 60 and 65. Until the 1970s, there was only a
minor reduction in mortality rates for men at age 55 and 60 and almost no
improvement at age 65. During that decade men mortality rates started falling
rapidly, especially at older ages. The fall in mortality rates is less impressive for
women, but as Figure 4.2 makes clear, women have experienced much lower
mortality rate than men and much earlier decline in mortality at older ages.

Figure 4.3 presents two-year mortality rates by age for both men and women
comparing the period data from 1960 and 2005. Mortality rates increase steeply
by age and are higher for women but the gap between men and women has got
smaller since 1960, men having enjoyed a somewhat larger reduction in
mortality than women. Whereas the 5% two-year mortality rate was reached at
61 for men in 1960, it was only attained at age 70 in 2005. For women, the age of
the 5% two-year mortality rate increased from 68 to 75 over the same period.

Figures 4.4 and 4.5 show the age of equal mortality rate over time computed
using one-year mortality rates (“isomorts”). This graphically illustrates the
ageing process as an increase in the age where individuals face the same
probability of death: being a British 65 year old man in 1960 – when state
pension age was already 65 – is equivalent in terms of mortality risk to being
aged 74 today. Or reversely being 65 today is like being 55 in 1960. The increase
is less pronounced for women, reflecting as before the larger reduction in
mortality for men, but is nonetheless impressive. For instance, being a 60 year
old woman in 1960 – the then state pension age – is today equivalent in terms of
mortality risk to being 70 years old.

   4.2. Measures of self­reported disability
Although the previous section highlights the large improvement in average life
expectancy, the ability to continue economic activity at older age is more likely to
be affected by health conditions that are not obviously related to morbidity.
Objective measures of disability are particularly rare over long historical time


17
series as they have only been recently added systematically to survey on ageing.
As a result, analysis of such measures, over the time period we are looking at
here, is not possible. Going forward, however, the fact that ageing studies such as
the Health and Retirement Study, the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and
the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe now routinely collect
objective measures of physical functioning such as walking speed, grip strength,
chair stands, balance tests and lung function, along with cognitive performance
tests and huge batteries of questions on doctor diagnosed diseases and
limitations in activities of everyday living, means that an analysis based on
objective measures of health and functioning should be a priority for future
research.

For our purpose here, however, there is useful information on self-reported
health from the General Household Survey (GHS), which surveys annually 10,000
household in the UK from 1971 to 2006. In Figure 4.6 we show the proportion of
men reporting limiting long-standing illness, the notion closest to the accepted
definition of disability, by different age groups. Two facts are striking. First, over
this thirty year period the share of men reporting some disability is relatively
flat, despite the large improvement in health (at least as measured by the
improvements in mortality rates). Second, this proportion of individual saying
that they have some limiting long-standing illness is increasing by age at every
period.

The presentation of time-series averages by age group, however, tends to mask
the systematic age variation in the data across later working-ages. In Figure 4.7


                                                                                   18
we present the proportion of men reporting limiting long standing illness by age
at ten year intervals. The share of self-reported disability is steeply increasing by
age at every period but although it was increasing at every age between 1977
and 1997, the latest year in our data exhibits a marked reduction for ages above
51. In Figure 4.8 we plot the same data with respect to specific age mortality
rates for each year and the same time-patterns emerge. Similar evidence for
women is presented in Figures 4.9 and 4.10. The changing rate of disability for
given levels of mortality probability is something that we will return to in later
sections of this paper.

4.3 Health measures and labour force participation

In order to summarize the evidence on labour force participation, benefit receipt
and the health measures we have discussed previously, we present in Figures
4.11 and 4.12 indices of these measures alongside each other for men and
women respectively. Both figures look at the evolution from 1972 to 2006 for the
age group 55-59. Mortality is declining constantly over the period and does not
seem to be related with any other trends. One interesting fact comes from the
correlation between the number of claimants of disability benefits, the self-
reported limiting long-standing illness and the overall change in non-
employment that is observed among men. Non-employment increased sharply in
the early 1980s, peaking after the 1992 recession. The IB claimant count
increased slowly over the period before a rapid growth in the early 1990s and a
strong reversal after the 1995 reform. Although it is difficult to make precise
inference from these correlations, the trend in self-reported disability is also
hump shed around the 1995 reform, laying grounds for claims that self-reported
disabilities reflect as much the impact of being in receipt of a “disability benefit”
as some measure of perceived incapacity.

Figure 4.12 presents similar evidence for women. The graph is dominated by the
large increase in receipt of disability benefits, reflecting the increased eligibility
of women to contributory disability benefits. Labour force participation is clearly
on an increasing trend in that age group, except during the early 1980s when the
employment rate of this group declined sharply.

Figures 4.13 and 4.14 contrast two ways of presenting ageing and labour force
participation. The first panel shows the employment rate by age for three years
at a ten year interval, while the second panel present the same data by the
mortality rate at that specific age. In Figure 4.13 the employment of British men
exhibit the characteristics that we have highlighted previously: a large drop in
employment at the time of reaching the state pension age (age 65) and a
significant drop at all ages between 1978 and 1988. The recent period appears
favourably with an increase in the employment rate at all ages, but especially
between 64 and 69. The second panel on the other hand highlights that these
changes have taken place during a period of rapid decrease in mortality. For a
given mortality rate, employment rates are now lower than at any other date,
including the lowest point of the late 1980s.

This is also the case for women, as shown by Figure 4.14. Only at the youngest
ages, below age 55, is it possible to see the increasing participation of women
counteracting the decline in employment for a given mortality rate.
These figures provide a vivid illustration of the meaning of ageing in our
developed societies where age takes in effect different meaning and are related
to a recent analysis of Shoven (2010), who discusses using mortality risk or
remaining life expectancy as better measures of age than years-since-birth for
the purpose of social security analysis and design. The limit of this approach in
our context, however, that mortality risk measures do not capture fully
functioning ability and therefore err on the side of putting too much emphasis on
morbidity as opposed to measures of disability

Another more powerful way of looking at the same underlying data from Figures
4.6 to 4.13 is to combine it into one graph showing evolution of employment and
self-reported health over time for a given mortality rate. Figure 4.15 presents the
non-employment rate and measures of self-reported health over time for males
at the age corresponding to a one percent mortality rate in the relevant year. As
one would expect from the analysis in earlier sections of this paper, the reference
age for the comparison constantly shifts upwards - in 1975 a 1 percent mortality
rate was observed for men aged 53, whilst in 2008 this age had shifted to 61.
        Both health measures, i.e. the share of men reporting long-standing illness
and the share reporting a limiting long-standing illness, have increased over time
but at a much slower rate than non-employment. Taking the period 1975-2007


25
as a whole, long-standing illness increased by two-thirds, limiting long-standing
illness increased by half, but non-employment almost quadrupled, holding
mortality probabilities constant. It is also worth noting that at the beginning of
the period the rate of non-employment was only half the rate of disability as
measured by limiting long-standing illness. Yet, by the end of the period non-
employment rates were higher than disability rates by ten percentage points.
These diverging trends are particularly apparent towards the beginning of the
period (late 1970s and early 1980s) when non-employment was rising very fast
while self-reported health measures were not, and also in the more recent years,
when self-reported health measures have stopped their increase.

Another possibility using these associations between age specific mortality rates
and employment rates is to compare countries at various points in time. In
Figures 4.16 and 4.17 we compare the case of France, the UK and the US between
1968 and 2006. In 1968, the UK and the US have very similar employment rates
for given mortality rates whereas by 2006, the UK experience much lower
employment rates than the US for mortality rates above 1%. Albeit the fact that
the UK had in 1968 lower employment rate than the US after age 65, the British
males had at that time higher mortality rates, conditioning on age, than American
ones. On the other hand in 2006, British males have seen their mortality rates
drop to the level of the Americans and therefore experience much lower
employment rates than the US at any given mortality rate.

France had in 1968 relatively high employment rates at older ages, still lower
than the US and the UK, but with a similar pattern. However, already in 1968,
French males experienced lower mortality at a given age than American and
British males. This leads to much lower employment rate in France than in the
US and the UK for a given mortality rate in 1968. By 2006, the lower mortality
rates of French males is still visible but employment rates at older age has
dropped further leading to much bigger difference with the other two countries,
especially at low mortality rates. For instance for a 1% mortality rate, the French
males have in 2006 an employment rate of 12% against 61% for the UK and 72%
for the US, and against 80% for French males in 1968.

5. Evidence from disability benefits reforms

The evidence presented so far relies heavily on times series but does not show
any causal impact that policy targeted on disability benefits could have on
employment and retirement patterns of individuals, in particular those who
report some form of incapacity to work. This section presents evidence from two
reforms of the UK disability benefits: the 1995 reform which intended to make
the health test stricter, while the Pathways-to-Work programme which was
designed to help IB claimants move off benefits and return to work.


                                                                                           28
    5.1. The 1995 reform
        Incapacity benefit replaced IVB and sickness benefit in April 1995. The
effect of the reform was to reduce the benefit’s generosity in a number of ways
and to tighten the eligibility requirements.11
The reduction in generosity was realised by a number of different changes. First,
the reform reduced the rate of benefit. IB is paid at three different rates
according to the length of the period of incapacity. Short-term lower rate IB has
replaced sickness benefit for people not eligible for SSP. A short-term higher rate
of ICB is payable from week 29 to week 52. In spite of its name, this is less
generous than IVB. Long-term IB, which is as generous as IVB, is only payable
from week 52. Second, the generosity of the age additions has been reduced.
Previously, someone would have been eligible for an age addition to their
invalidity pension if the period of incapacity began before age 59. Since 1995
they are only eligible for an age addition if the period of incapacity begins before
age 45. In addition, the age additions are payable after week 52, when long-term
ICB begins, rather than after week 28. Third, IB became taxable from 1995
onwards. This brings it into line with the other main benefits (retirement
pensions and unemployment benefits) and income support, which are subject to
income tax. However, compensatory disability benefits (war disability pension
and industrial injuries disablement pension) and extra costs disability benefits
(disability living allowance, attendance allowance) remain not subject to tax.
Fourth, unlike IVB, long-term IB is not payable to anyone over state pension age,
although people who start receiving short-term IB before state pension age can
continue to do so for the full 52 weeks.
The tightening of eligibility requirement mostly came about with the
replacement of the ‘suitable work test’ that applied to IVB recipients after 28
weeks by the ‘all work test’. Instead of an assessment of a person’s ability to
perform jobs that it was reasonable to expect them to do given their age, health
and qualifications, the ‘all work test’ required an assessment of the person’s
ability to do any kind of work. The all work test involved an ‘objective’
assessment of the level of difficulty the person had in performing different
physical and mental activities (for example, walking up and down stairs, bending
and kneeling, coping with pressure). Points were awarded for the degree of
difficulty they had performing each activity, with a minimum total number of
points necessary to be deemed incapable of work. A second change is that the all
work test is carried out by the government medical service rather than the
individual’s own doctor. As with IVB, the claimant has the right to appeal for
their case to be heard by a social security appeals tribunal.
The first evidence one can gather on the 1995 reform is to look at the change in
inflows into the IVB/IB rolls. Given that the reform has made qualifying for the

benefit harder and that the generosity of the benefits has been reduced, one
could expect to see changes in inflow rates into the scheme. Figure 5.1
represents the number of claimants to IVB and IB whose claim duration is less
than one year. This is a relatively good proxy for the inflow rate although it is
affected during the 1980s by the introduction of SSP. The latter has led to a
decrease in inflows to IVB by shifting short-term sick into the employers’
sickness scheme. In 1992 the recession hits the UK very acutely and this seems to
have led to a peak in inflows onto IVB. The 1995 reform is associated with a
dramatic drop in inflows which subsequently stabilized at the pre-1992 level.

Disney, Emmerson and Wakefield (2003, 2006) examined the relationship
between health and employment in the UK using panel data from the British
Household Panel Survey from 1991 to 1998. They used a fixed-effects
conditional logit model, instrumenting self-reported general health using
responses to questions about specific health problems (following Bound et al.,
1999). Older age, reaching state pension age, and deteriorations in health were
all found to lead to increased probability of leaving work. They also tested
whether the 1995 reform strengthen the relationship between health and
employment by estimating co-efficient on health stock interacted with treated
group. The estimated coefficients were positive but not statistically different
from zero at conventional levels of statistical significance.
As an alternative and using the same dataset, we have run a probit retirement
model among those in work, controlling for health stock. We plot in Figure 5.2
the year dummies before and after the reform. The coefficients for men do drop
markedly post reform with the combined 1995-96 coefficients statistically

    5.2. Pathways–to­Work reform
Although the 1995 and 2001 reforms were associated with the ending of the
increasing trend in numbers receiving disability benefits, the stock of recipients
remained at a high level. As a result a new programme, called Pathways-to-Work,
designed to help claimants return to work, was implemented. It comprised three
components: an increase in financial incentives to return to work with the ability
to keep (approximately) 50% of the disability benefit for up to 12 months after
returning to work; increased conditionality of benefits with mandatory work-
focused interviews; and voluntary schemes to help beneficiaries manage their
health problem more successfully. Initially the programme was applied to those
moving on to disability benefits (rather than existing claimants) and this impact
of this programme on new claimants was piloted and has been thoroughly
evaluated (see Adam et al. 2011).
The programme was first piloted in three large areas in October 2003 and four
further large areas in April 2004. Later on the scheme was expanded to other
areas of the country, in various phases. We present in Figures 5.3 and 5.4 the
outflow rate at 6 months out of IB in the pilot areas and subsequent expansion
areas. After the introduction of the programme the exit rate out of benefit
increased substantially in each in the treated areas. This provides convincing
evidence that the programme had a decisive impact on movements off benefits,


31
although there is some evidence that the effect become smaller as it was rolled
into subsequent areas. Adam et al. 2011 have shown that the impact on exit out
of benefit has been concentrated on durations less than one year, suggesting that
the programme has mostly been successful in bringing forward exit out from
benefit among those who would have left within one-year of receipt, rather than
removing from the disability rolls those who would otherwise have received
benefits for longer than a year. Using a difference-in-difference strategy, the
authors show that the programme has had a significant effect on the probability
to return to work in the two groups of pilot areas, but that this positive effect has
been limited to those who do not report a mental health problem and was
concentrated on women.

The evaluation of this programme highlights that outflows from benefit, and
more specifically back to employment, do matter considerably. Furthermore they
are not necessarily the same: the study shows that while the impact on benefit
receipt did not persist beyond 12 months the employment impact was still
significant at 18 months. Even if policymakers have tended to concentrate on
stricter eligibility with the hope of reducing inflows to benefit, the case for an
outflow policy remains strong, at least within the UK institutional setting.

6. Conclusion

Over the last thirty years pathways to retirement have changed substantially in
the UK. They have been dominated by spells of unemployment in the late 1970s,
with then an increased importance of disability spells from the mid-1980s
onwards. Pathways to retirement through unemployment have been reduced in
the early 1990s, while disability spells have started to be less common from the
mid-1990s onwards. At the end of the period – before the financial crisis – the
direct route from work to retirement was increasingly more common.
The empirical evidence on the underlying causes of these changes is still mixed.
There is weak evidence of unemployment and disability reforms’ effects on the
routes to retirement, but the general economic conditions seem to have been
important driving forces during the entire period. Changes in health measures do
not provide convincing explanations for these trends: mortality has been falling
over the period without any link to the share of the population reporting ill
health or disability or to the number claiming benefits. There is some evidence



33
though that self-reported disability is associated with changes in the number of
disability claimants.
There is also evidence that recent reforms have also had an impact. The 1995
reform was associated with, at the very least, the halting of the previous growth
in the rate of in-flow onto IB (and possibly also a fall in the percentage describing
themselves as having a limiting long-standing illness). Evidence from the pilots
of the Pathways-to-Work programme suggests that those moving onto disability
benefits moved off these benefits faster than they would otherwise have done as
a direct result of the programme. This programme was also found to have an
enduring impact on subsequent employment rates. While the recent financial
crisis and associated recession is likely to lead to much attention being focused
on getting the newly unemployed back in to paid work, those who receive
disability benefits and who could potentially return to the labour market may
still need assistance.
