                        Taxes and Ownership Structure:
                 Corporations, Partnerships and Royalty Trusts

                                   ABSTRACT



     This paper investigates the effect of taxes on the equilibrium ownership

structure of productive assets. Ownership structure includes the traditional

choice between debt and equity financing, but also the larger choice between

corporate and partnership forms.

     A key feature of these alternative forms is that corporations are subject

to taxation at both the corporate and investor levels, whereas partnerships are

not. At the same time, depreciation and interest tax shields are taken at the

corporate tax rate for corporate assets and at investors' tax rates for partner-

ship assets. We find that assets endowed with excess non-interest tax deductions

are best held in partnership form by high tax bracket investors. Assets whose

allowed deductions are low enough to generate a net tax liability in corporate form

are best held as partnerships by low tax bracket investors. All other assets are

held in the corporate sector and are financed in a manner consistent with Miller's

(1977) capital structure equilibrium.

     We argue that our analysis illuminates the tax aspects of such transactions

as mergers and sales or spin-offs of corporate assets to partnerships and royalty

trusts. We also show that our results afford a simple characterization of the

lease or buy decision.

1. Introduction

          The corporate form has many well—known benefits. By separating

ownership from management, it allows productive assets to be managed by

those who are best qualified, regardless of their personal wealth or

attitudes toward risk. The corporate form also facilitates the exchange of

ownership claims among investors, and in so doing it allows the management

of the assets to proceed continuously, independent of the lives or fortunes

of individual owners.

          Despite these benefits, however, many productive assets are owned

by noncorporate business entities, such as partnerships. This fact has

received special emphasis in recent years as corporations themselves have

often been instrumental in shifting assets outside the corporate sector

(see Cooper, 1984). Transactions in which corporate assets are sold to an

investor group and then leased back have been common for some time. A more

recent variation on this theme is Metromedia's outright sale in 1982 of

41,000 advertising billboards to wealthy investors through a limited

partnership (Abrams, 1984).    Another example, which has attracted

considerable public attention, is the spin—off of natural resource

properties to be held directly by investors through a royalty trust. This

transaction has been carried out by Mesa Petroleum, Masonite and other

corporations (Cooper, 1984).

          The prevalence of such activity suggests the need for a theory of

ownership structure. Finance theorists have focused their attention on the

mix of debt and equity claims that corporations should issue to finance

their ownership of productive assets, but this is only a part of the

problem. Coming prior to the financing question is the issue of whether or

not a given asset should be held in corporate form at all.
                                   —2—

          The need for a broader theory, encompassing the choice of organi-

zational form as well as the financing mix, has been recognized in recent

papers by Fama and Jensen (1983 a, b). They devote particular attention to

the relative severity of incentive, or agency, problems among corporations,

partnerships, mutuals and other forms.

          The purpose of our paper is to explore another aspect of the same

question, namely taxation. It is widely recognized that the corporate form

entails double taxation, while alternatives such as partnerships and

royalty trusts do not. However, the asset market equilibrium implications

of this difference in tax treatment have nor been fully analyzed.    In

particular, we are interested in finding out which tangible assets should

be held in corporate form and which in partnership form. We also analyze

which investors will hold partnership shares in equilibrium and which will

hold corporate securities.

          We abstract from uncertainty in order to eliminate all agency

problems and focus attention squarely on tax considerations. In Section 2,

we consider a simple one—period model, which allows us to completely

characterize the allocation of tangible assets among partnerships and

corporations, as well as the financing of those assets held in the

corporate sector. We show that assets endowed with excess tax deductions

are better held in partnership form by high tax bracket investors.

Similarly, assets that would generate a net tax liability if owned by a

corporation are better held in partnership form by low tax bracket

investors. All other assets are held in the corporate sector and are

financed in a manner consistent with Miller's (1977) capital structure

equilibrium.
                                     —3—

            In Section 3, we consider asset market equilibrium in a multi—

period setting. Under the assumption that assets can be costlessly traded

or converted to another ownership form, we obtain results that are analo-

gous to those of the one—period case. The force driving the allocation of

assets to corporate and partnership form in the multiperiod case is the

desire to minimize total taxes in every period.

           The next three sections are devoted to applications and elabora-

tions of our basic analysis. In Section 4 we show that a particularly

simple characterization of the lease—or—buy decision emerges as a by-

product of our results on optimal asset ownership. In Section 5 we show

how a given asset may naturally progress through different ownership forms

as its cash flows and depreciation allowances evolve over the course of its

useful life. In Section 6, we show that in an environment of capital gains

and recapture taxes, changes in corporate ownership, through mergers and

acquisitions or sales of assets, are an alternative to changes in ownership

form for minimizing taxes.

           In Section 7 we briefly summarize our results and suggest some

further extensions.



2. The One—Period Case

    2a. The structure of the model and the definition of equilibrium

           The   optimal packaging of tangible assets can be illustrated most
readily for   the one—period case. This case entails finite asset life,

which   we later show to be an important element of the partnership form's
attractiveness,    but at the same time it avoids the complication of

multiperiod term structure issues. We will also argue in Section 3 that,
                                         —4—

when assets can be costlessly repackaged, the multiperiod case collapses,

with minor modifications, to the one—period case.

                We assume an exogenous supply of tangible assets at the beginning

of the period. Each asset generates an identical pre—tax cash flow,

C (>0). at the end of the period. Any production technology using these

assets exhibits constant returns to scale, so we can discuss the optimal

packaging of any one of these assets in isolation from the others. For

each asset, a, the owner is allowed to make an exogenously determined

non—cash charge, Da, against a's pre—tax cash flow. This charge could be

thought of as depreciation or depletion. Asset a's taxable income is then

(C — IDa), and in the absence of other deductions its after—tax cash flow is

C —   t(C   —       where r is the applicable tax rate.1

                Each member, i, of a set of individual investors is endowed with

initial wealth, consisting of some amount of tangible assets. The inves-

tors either trade these assets directly or package them in the form of

securities before trading. Securities, which represent indirect claims on

tangible assets, come in the form of corporate or personal debt and cor-

porate stock. That is, an investor can issue his own debt securities

against his personal tangible holdings, or he can organize a corporation to

hold the tangibles and have the corporation issue securities. Each

investor's objective is to end up with a portfolio of tangibles and/or

securities that maximizes his future consumption. Equivalently, such a

portfolio will maximize the investor's after—tax cash flow.

                The after—tax cash flow that is ultimately produced by a given

tangible asset depends both on the form in which it is packaged and on its

final owner. If asset a is owned directly by investor i, its income is

taxed at i's exogenously specified personal tax rate, r, and the asset's
                                              —5—

after—tax cash flow is C —         r(C   —          We   refer to any such directly held

tangible   as being packaged in partnership form. 2
            AU tangibles held in corporate form are subject to corporate tax
at the rate t.            they are subject to further personal tax depends
                    Whether

on how the corporations finance them. We assume, following Miller (1977),
that investors' returns on corporate stock are tax exempt. An asset

packaged as corporate stock thus escapes double taxation, and its after—tax

cash flow is simply C —              — Da).

            By contrast, all interest on bonds is assumed to be taxable to

the bondholder and tax deductible to the issuer.                  If an-asset is packaged

as corporate debt, therefore, we must divide its cash flows into interest

and   principal   payments.      If an asset Is to be fully debt financed, a

corporation can promise after—corporate—tax debt service payments that

exactly match the asset's after—corporate—tax cash inflows. Thus if the

asset's value in this form is V, the interest payment at rate r, is rV

and the principal payment is C —          r(C   — Da) —    r(1   —
                                                                     r)V.     Since principal

payments are tax exempt to bondholders, this leaves total after—tax

receipts for investor i of r(1 —                 + C —
                                                          i(C    — Da) —    r(1   —


            Investors'    packaging and trading activities produce market values

for all tangible asset packages. In conjunction with the after—tn cash

flows described above, these market values in turn define after—tax rates

of return. For example, if investor i holds asset a in partnership form,

his after—tax return,              is given by


                    C —   ti(C
                           p
                                 — 0a)
                                                                                  (1)
            P                 ai

          Analogously, i's after—tax return from holding a in corporate

stock form is given by

and in corporate bond form by


                   C —

                                    _Da) + r(1 —                 ri)V
                                                                  p
                                                                         —   r(1   —
                                                                                        cB
           B                                                ai                                 ()
                                                  1    +


          Several features of these definitions are worth noting. First,

from (2) corporate stock yields the same after—tax return to any investor.

This is of course true of all tax—exempt securities.

          Second, the after—tax cash flow from any tangible asset package

can be represented as the asset's pre—tax cash flow, C, minus the net tax

payments attributable to the asset in that form. This is obvious for

partnerships and corporate stock from (1) and (2).                                     It can be seen for

corporate bonds if we rewrite (3) as


                                             a                  a
                   C —     [t c(C    —   D    )   — (tc — t i)rVB]
               =                                                                               (4)
                                         1 +


where the second term in the numerator is the net tax payment term. In the

absence of debt financing, tax payments would be Tc(C — 0a)                                    as in (2).

However, if r>t , debt financing generates a net tax shield and the tax

payments attributable to the asset are reduced.

          Third, if a bond pays interest at the market rate, r, its market

value is equal to its principal and we can further interpret (3). If


               =   C   —   t(C      — Da) —           r(1   —
                                                                 t)v:.                         (5)
                                          —7—

then substituting (5) into (3) results in


          0ai     r(1 -       Ti).                               (6)



That is, any bondholder's after—tn return is equal to the after—tax

interest rate. Moreover, from (5)


                 C —
                      c
                          r   (C —   a)
                                     t)
           a
                  1 + r(1 —



That is, the value of an asset in corporate bond form, paying the market

interest rate, is equal to the asset's after—corporate—tax cash flow

discounted at the after—corporate—tax interest rate.4

          Faced with this set of conditions, investors package and trade

assets, as permitted by the tax authorities, until the following equi—
                      5
librium is reached:



         Definition:          Asset market equilibrium consists of (a) an

ownership form or package (e.g., partnership, corporate debt, corporate

stock) for each tangible asset, (b) a market value for each asset package

and (c) an allocation of asset packages among investors such that (1) asset

and securities markets clear and (2) at current market prices, no investor

can alter his portfolio (e.g., trading or repackaging assets) in such a way

as to increase his after—tn return.



          Equivalently, each tangible asset must be packaged and allocated

to a final investor in such a way that its value is maximized. This

follows the basic logic of the Fisher Separation principle: regardless of

his personal preferences or tax status, any investor will want to package
                                         —8—

the tangibles he is endowed with in the way that maximizes his future

consumption opportunities.

           In deriving subsequent results, we will also find it useful to

invoke the following equivalent concept of equilibrium:



           Proposition I: A configuration of tangible asset packages, final

owners and market values is an equilibrium if and only if it minimizes

total future tax payments relative to the set of feasible, mutually

voluntary transactions.



           Proof: The configuration in question defines a market value,

for each investor's net worth and an after—tax return, pi.on that net

worth. Total after—tax cash flow in the economy, then, is simply the sum,

z Vi(l +   p5,   of cash returns across investors. Equivalently, the
i
economy's total wealth consists of the sum of tangible asset packages.

Each such package, as we have seen, generates a pre—tax cash flow, C, minus

the net tax payments, a, attributable to that package.        Since summing

across all asset packages would also give us the economy's total after—tax

cash flows, we must have


           z Vi(l +   pi)    =   z(C — Ta).                     (8)
           i                     a


           Suppose now that the ownership configuration is not an equi—

librium. Then some investor j can trade at current market prices in such a

way as to increase          to p. Since all trades are voluntary, this could

not result in a lower return on net worth for any other investor. After

the trade, we must have
                                                    —9—


              i#j
                  E Vi(l + p1) +     V3(l     +    p3)   > E V1(I +
                                                          i           t)    (9)


Equivalently,        total after—tax cash flows after the trade are equal to the

sum across asset packages, where Ta' represents the post—trade taxes

attributable to asset a. Thus from (9)


                      -   Ta')   > E(C   -
                                             Ta)                           (10)




Since total pre—tax cash flows are unchanged, (10) holds only if

ETa    c   ETa.     This proves that any non—equilibrium ownership configuration

fails to minimize total taxes.

              Now consider an ownership configuration that does not minimize

taxes. Then there is some feasible transaction that investors will

voluntarily undertake that reduces total taxes. Since the transaction is

voluntary, no investor's after—tax return is reduced by it. From (8), at

least one investor's after—tax return is increased by this transaction.

Therefore the initial configuration could not hve been an equilibrium.

This completes the proof.



      Zb. Asset packaging in the corporate sector

              Given the basic structure of the model, we can now describe the

equilibrium allocation of tangibles between partnership and corporate f on

and the financing of those tangibles held in the corporate sector. We

begin with the latter question, which has been analyzed by Miller (1977).

              If we assume temporarily that all tangibles are held in corporate

form, our model is equivalent to Miller's, and we can make use of his

findings. Three of his results are noteworthy in our context.
                                           — 10 —




               First,     if r is the pre—tax return on debt, the equilibrium

after—tax return on equity must be r(1.— t). Thus, the market value of

any tangible packaged as corporate equity is given by


                         C —   T(C   —
                          1 + r(1 —                                      (11)


If   this were not the case, then from (7) some entrepreneur could increase

his portfolio return by repackaging equity as debt or vice versa.6

               Second, while the total equilibrium supply of equity must be that

which drives the after—tax return to r(1 —          t),   it doesn't matter which

specific assets are packaged as equity or debt. Comparison of (11) and (7)

indicates that an asset must have the same market value in either form.

               Third, in the absence of uncertainty, investors have specialized

portfolios.           From (6), any bondholder earns an after—tax return of

r(1 —   ti),      while any equityholder earns r(1 —   t).   Therefore no investor

with        > t
                  c
                      can hold bonds, while no investor with t1 <   r   can hold stock
        p                                                     p     c
in equilibrium, since they would not be maximizing their after—tax return

if they did.




     2c. Partnerships

               We can now relax the assumption that all tangibles are held in

the corporate sector.            In that event, there are two cases in which

investors can increase their after—tax returns by shifting an asset from

corporate to partnership form. The first of these is described in the

following proposition:

              Proposition    II: If an asset's allowed depreciation, a, is such

              Proof: If any such asset is held in corporate form, whether debt

or equity, Its value must be

              An investor with              >   r who owns equity is earning an after—tax
return of r(1. —     r).     If this investor were to purchase asset a for                        and

repackage it as a partnership, his after—tax return would be


                —   1i( — ?)   —
                                            C — t (C — Da)

                                                                                  C ).


Thus he could increase his after—tax return by undertaking this

transaction.

              Conversely, if i holds a in partnership form initially, its value

must be at least a and i must be earning an after—tax return of at least

r(1 —   r).     If i switches to corporate equity, his after—tax return will at

best remain unchanged. In addition, if asset a is repackaged in corporate

form its after—tax return will be at most r(1 —                     t) (equity)      or r(1 —

(debt).   Since these returns were already available on other corporate

securities, no investor's position is improved if a is repackaged.

Therefore, partnership form is the equilibrium package for a. This com-

pletes the proof.
                                                 — 12   —




             Assets with C <             have been termed "negatively taxed" by Bailey

(1974). Their allowed deductions are such that, as long as the owner has

other income to offset, their after—tax cash flow exceeds their pre—tax

cash flow. This is the principle that lies behind oil and gas drilling

partnerships as well as various real estate, motion picture, research and

development and other tax shelter investments sold in partnership form.

             Intuitively, one would expect such negatively taxed assets to be

most attractive to investors in the highest tax brackets. This intuition

is confirmed and generalized to any assets held in partnership form,

whether negatively taxed or not, in the following proposition:



             Proposition III: If two assets are held in partnership form by

two investors with unequal tax rates, the asset with the larger allowed

deductions must be held in equilibrium by the investor with the higher

personal tax rate.



         Proof: Suppose assets a and b, with                        > Db   are held in

partnership form. Suppose initially that investor i holds asset b while

investor j    holds asset a and                  t.     The after—tax rates of return for
                                             p   p
investors i and j    are thus defined implicitly by


                     C(1_Ti) +
                          p              p
                                                                                    (14a)
             P


                                     +
                             p           p                                          (14b)
                         1       +
                                              — 13 —



Hence investor i could pay the following amount for asset a and still earn

the same after—tax rate of return:



                  ——        p
                                +    ia
                                     p
                                          .                                  (15a)
                          l+p

Similarly investor j could pay the following amount for asset b:




             v
                       C(1—.ç3) +
              b   =         p        p
                                                                             (15b)
                          1 + p3


For the current ownership pattern to be an equilibrium, it must be that



                                                                             (16)




Otherwise exchange is mutually preferable. But (16) can be shown to be

equivalent to (Db —      Da)(Ti     — 1J) >   0, which is false. The condition is
satisfied only if investor           holds asset a and investor b holds asset j.

Thus equilibrium can occur only if the high—tax bracket investor holds the

high—deduction asset to the extent of his ability to do so. This completes

the proof.

             In the last line of the above proof, the phrase "to the extent of

his ability to do so" deserves some clarification. If tax arbitrage were

permitted, investors in the very highest tax bracket would hold all of the

negatively taxed assets in equilibrium. If such an asset were held by an

investor with any lower tax bracket, the high tax bracket investor would

issue personal debt to buy it. Not only would this reduce taxes (or

increase tax credits) attributable to the asset itself, but the interest

deduction to the debt issue would always outweigh any additional taxes paid
                                   — 1k —



by the debt holder. With tax arbitrage restrictions, however, the highest

tax bracket investors have United ability to keep acquiring assets.

          In the latter event, Proposition III implies that a sorting

equilibrium will develop. If we rank investors in descending order of

and assets in descending order of Da, the investor with the highest          will

keep acquiring assets in descending order of Da until he runs up against

the tax arbitrage constraint. The process is then repeated for the

investor with the next highest tax rate and so on, until either the supply

of negatively taxed assets is exhausted or we reach an investor with             =

t. From   (12) and (13), such an investor would be just indifferent between

holding a negatively taxed asset in partnership or corporate equity form.

          Besides negatively taxed assets held by high tax bracket

investors, there is a second case in which greater value can be achieved by

packaging an asset in partnership rather than corporate form. This arises

at the opposite end of the allowed deduction spectrum.



          Proposition IV: Any asset with     < C/U +     r)   must be held in

partnership form in equilibrium as long as there are investors with ¶        C


holding bonds.



          Proof: Suppose such an asset were packaged in corporate debt

form.7 Any investo* with r' c r who held bonds would be willing to buy

the asset in this form at its market price V. From (4), (6) and (7) the

investor would earn an after—tax return of r(1 —    t')
                                                     p
                                                        on     this asset,

expressible as follows:

                                                                              B


                  If this investor switched the asset to partnership form, his

after—tax return would be:

                           =            p                    —       1    .

                                            B


                  Subtracting (17) from (18):



                   ai          ai           (t
                                                 C
                                                     - r1)[C             - (1 +

                                                                                      "tB



Since (19) is positive for a C Cf(1 +                                             r),   the asset cannot be held in

corporate form in equilibrium.

                  Conversely, if the asset were held in partnership form, its value

must be at least V and its owner must be earning an after—tax return of at

least r(1 —           ri).      Consequently, there is nothing to be gained by switching

the       asset   to corporate form. This completes the proof.
                  Further      insight into Proposition IV may be gained if we note that

      C   C/(1 +      r)   implies8


                                      [C -i (C -
                  C>Da+r                1+r(1—t) .                                                                         (20)



                  The right—hand side of (20) is simply the total tax deductions

available against asset a when it is packaged in corporate debt form.

These consist of depreciation and the interest on the corporation's debt.
                                        — 16 —



When   (20) holds, these deductions are insufficient to shield the asset's

entire pre—tax cash flow, C.         If held in corporate debt form, then, the

asset generates a positive tax liability at the corporate level and again

at the investor level. Under these circumstances the partnership form,

which eliminates double taxation, is advantageous.9 This is precisely the

argument that has been used in support of the royalty trust concept,

whereby a corporation spins off an income—producing property to its

shareholders. The property's income is then taxable to the shareholders

directly, as in a partnership, but corporate tax is avoided. It should be

noted, though, that it is not sufficient to have             < T
                                                                   c
                                                                       in   order for the
                                                         p
royalty trust form to yield tax advantages. It is also necessary that the

assets held in trust be low depreciation assets (i.e., ?               C    C/(1 + r)).

           Since assets with         < C/Cl + r) are more heavily taxed than

those with higher allowed deductions, it seems that they would be most

efficiently held by investors in the lowest tax brackets. In fact, if the

investors in the lowest tax bracket can borrow, they will hold all such

assets in equilibrium:



           Proposition V: Let           be the minimum personal tax rate.                 In

equilibrium, all assets with          C C/CL + r) must be held in partnership

form by investors whose tax rate is              as long as these investors can

borrow without limit.



           Proof: We know from Proposition IV that all such assets must be

held in partnership form by investors with          C T. Let asset a be held by

investor i with ¶mln <       < I .    The asset's value, a, must be such that

                                                                — 17 —

          Otherwise, investor i could have earned a higher after—tax return
by holding bonds. If                 an investor with tax rate                                      borrows a       at interest

                                                                               1+r(1—r)

          Thus, total taxes are always reduced by this transaction. This

completes the proof.'°

          Finally, if the lowest tax investors are limited in their ability

to borrow, the logic of Proposition III dictates a sorting equilibrium.

Investors in the lowest tax bracket will purchase assets beginning with

those having the lowest Da and working up in ascending order of Da. Once

these investors' ability to purchase assets is exhausted, the process

continues with the investor having the next highest tax rate and so on

until either the supply of assets with Da <                                     C/(l        +   r)      or the wealth of

investors with
                     p
                         <   t is exhausted.
                                 c

         Together, Propositions I—V plus Miller's (1977) analysis

completely characterize the asset market equilibrium. Assets with the very
                                        — 18 —




highest       and lowest allowed deductions will be organized as partnerships and

sold to investors with the highest and lowest tax rates, respectively. In

the face of borrowing restrictions, these partnerships will be sorted, with

those having the highest deductions going to investors with the highest tax

rates and vice versa. All remaining assets with 01(1 +       r)   c   <   C will be

held in corporate form. All such assets have the same value, so there is

no sorting of assets within the corporate sector. However, the total of

debt and equity financed assets must be such that the marginal bondholder
        i a
has r
        p      c



3. The Multiperiod Case

               As long as investors can costlessly trade or repackage assets

each period, equilibrium in a multiperiod setting can be viewed as a

sequence of single—period equilibria. In that event, many of the results

of Section 2 carry over to the multiperiod case with only minor modifica-

tion.

               We assume in this section, therefore, that any investor or

corporation can hold an asset for one period, collect that period's

after—tax cash flow, and then sell or repackage the asset with no taxable

recognition of gains or losses and no recapture of depreciation. Although

a complete equilibrium analysis of capital gains and recapture taxes is

beyond the scope of this paper, we do consider some of their consequences

in Section 6.

               Under the frictionless repackaging assumption of this section, an

asset's ownership form can be optimized period—by—period. Moreover, each

asset's end—of—period market value is independent of its current owner and

ownership form. In the aggregate, therefore, the configuration of asset
                                    — 19 —




ownership will be rearranged each period so as to minimize total taxes for
that period.

          In this environment, three analogues to the results of Section 2

are worth noting. Because they follow the same logic developed in that

section, we state them here without proof.

          First, if C1 and    are   asset a's pre—tax cash flow and allowed

deduction, respectively, in the most immediate future period, the asset

will be held in partnership form during this period as long as C1 <        and

there are investors with     > t holding corporate equity. Thus if an

asset is negatively taxed even for only one period, it will be sold as a

partnership to high tax bracket investors during that period.

          Second, if the maximum corporate tax deductions (depreciation

plus interest) for an asset in a given period are less than that period's

pre—tax cash flow, the asset must be held in partnership f on during that

period as long as there are investors with      < r holding bonds. Stated

in algebraic form, analogous to equation (20), the partnership condition is



                a     ________________
          C1>D1+r            1+(1) ,                                  (24)



where r is the one—period market interest rate and        is the asset's

end—of—period market value. The asset's future value enters this condition

because if an owner can borrow against that value, it affects the size of

available interest deductions in the most immediate future period.

Rearranging and simplifying expression (24) results in the following

analogue to the condition stated in Proposition IV:


               C1 —rVa1
                                                                      (25)
           1        1+r
                                                      — 20 —



 This suggests that the larger is an asset's future value relative to its

 current cash flow, the less likely it is to be held in partnership form by

 low tax bracket investors. As we discuss further in Section 5, the best

 candidates for low tax              bracket     partnerships, or royalty trusts, are assets
whose future value is declining relative to current pre—tax cash flow.

               Finally, if (C1 —
                                            rV)/(1    +    r)   C
                                                                    < C,   the asset will be held

in corporate form                during   that next period. As in Miller (1977), the

aggregate debt and equity financing of these corporate assets will be such

that the marginal holder of either type of security earns a one—period

return of r(1 —             r).    Hence the current value, V, of any corporate asset,

whether debt or equity financed, is given by


                            C — - (C        — Da) +
                   a    —    I   ci            1       1

4.       Leasing

              The analysis thus far provides a new perspective on leasing.

which has previously been recognized as a device for separating asset

ownership from asset management.1' It may be, for example, that an asset

can generate its maximum pre—tax cash flows only if it is managed by a

specific person or entity. However, the same cash flows and associated tax

deductions may be worth more if they are owned by someone else. In such

cases, where the optimal owner of an asset differs from its optimal

manager, a potentially profitable lease transaction is available.

              In this context, the analysis of Sections 2 and 3 can be thought

of as identifying the optimal owner of any tangible asset.                           In the

one—period case, for example, we have seen that assets with C C                            or
     <   CI(1+r)       are optimally held directly by investors in partnership form.
                                     — 21 —



If   the same asset is most efficiently managed by a corporation, the

investor—owners could simply lease it to the corporation.12 If
C/(1+r) < Da   <   C, on the other hand the asset is optimally owned in

corporate form. Leasing can arise for such assets when they are best

managed by an entity whose tax rate is other than Tc (say, another

corporation that finds itself in a nontax—paying position).'3

          The fact that optimal asset owners can span the whole range of

tax brackets highlights a point made by Myers, Dill and Bautista (1976):

Sometimes it pays f or a low tax bracket entity to lease from a high tax

bracket owner, but other times the reverse is true. The direction in which

the transaction goes is determined by the tax bracket of the optimal

manager and the magnitude of the asset's available deductions

(depreciation, interest, etc.) relative to its pre—tax cash flow.



5. A Life Cycle Model of Ownership

          While the multiperiod case, discussed in Chapter 3. implicitly

incorporates changes in cash flows and allowed deductions over time, we

have not thus far taken the typical pattern of these changes into account.

For many assets, both pre—tax cash flows and depreciation tax shields tend

to decline over the asset's life. However, with accelerated depreciation,

allowed deductions often decline at a faster rate than the pre—tax cash

flows. Such assets may follow a natural ownership life cycle.

          For example, when it is young a tangible asset may be negatively

taxed, in which case it should be owned by investors whose tax rates exceed

the corporate rate. When it is middle—aged, depreciation tax shields have

declined and the asset may be positively but lightly taxed. In this phase,

corporate ownership will be optimal. When it is old, depreciation tax
                                               — 22 —



shields       have declined further and borrowing against the asset's future

value no longer provides as much of an interest tax shield. The asset has

thus become heavily taxed and should be owned in partnership f on by

investors with low tax rates——e.g., as a royalty trust.

               These principles can be demonstrated with a simple model of the

optimal ownership decision. Since this is a dynamic optimization problem,

it is natural to formulate it in a continuous—time framework. As before,

we abstract from uncertainty, although the model could be generalized in

that direction.

               Assume that the pre—tax cash flow C(t) grows at a constant rate

g, namely


               dc/C     gdt .                                             (27)

               We assume that the pre—tax cash flow declines through time——i.e.,

g < 0.       Let B(t) be the tax basis of the asset, and let depreciation (and

depletion) be at a constant proportional rate 5. Thus depreciation is

D(t)        SB(t) and it evolves according to


               dD/D =   dB/B    =   —Sdt   .
                                                                          (28)

               The extent to which the pre—tax cash flow is sheltered from

taxation is summarized by the ratio of depreciation to pre—tax cash flow

y(t)        D(t)/c(t), which evolves according to


               dy/y =   —(6+g)dt    .
                                                                          (29)

A typical tangible asset becomes more heavily taxed through time——i.e.,

a >    —g   and thus y declines through time.
                                       — 23 —



            The life cycle for the ownership of the asset can be summarized

by the value of the ratio -y.       We know that as long as y > 1——i.e.,

D(t) >   C(t)—the    asset is negatively taxed and thus should be owned in

partnership form by investors above the corporate tax rate. We expect that

where y      1 the asset should be repackaged into corporate form. We also

expect that the asset should eventually be converted into a low—tax royalty

trust. Evidently there is a critical value y* c      1    where it is optimal to

convert the asset from corporate to royalty trust form. This life cycle is

summarized in Exhibit 1.

                                     Exhibit 1

            It remains to identify the critical ratio y*. Assume for now

that all royalty trusts are owned by nontaxable investors. (Remember that

royalty trusts should be held by investors in tax brackets at least as low

as those of corporate bondholders, and that most corporate bonds are held

by nontaxable institutions). Hence the value of a royalty trust R(t) is

given by capitalizing its pre—tax cash flows at the pre—tax interest rate:


            R(t)       f C(s)e_5_t)ds =      C(t)/(r—g)    .                    (30)

            Now consider the value of the asset while it is still in

corporate form.        The after—corporate—tax operating cash flows are

x(t)      (1_Tc)C(t) +   tD(t).   At the optimal time t*       the   corporation will
                                            — 24 —



convert the asset into a royalty trust with value R(t*). The value of the

asset while still in corporate form V(t) is given by capitalizing these

cash flows at the after—corporate—tax interest rate:


             V(t) 1 X(s)e_tc)(5_t)ds +

                      (1_t)C(t)[1_e_t*_t)]/A                 +


                                —x (t*_t)
                      +    C(t)e            /(r—g)                                    (31)


where            A E r(1—t)—g and p E r(1—'r) + iS.


             The optimal time t* to repackage the asset from corporate to

royalty trust form maximizes the value of the asset. Hence we have the

first order condition


                  av(t)/ot* =                                    —
             0
                                   (l_r)C(t*)        +
                                                         Tct*)       AC(t*)/(r_g),    (32)


which can be rewritten as


                           =
             C(t*)/(r_g)       X(t*)I[r(1_t)_gJ          ,                            (32')

where the LHS is the value of the royalty trUst and the RHS                is   the value of

a notional asset in corporate form whose after—tax cash flows grow at the

rate g.

             An alternative, but instructive way to derive this condition is

to consider net taxes paid as a result of keeping the asset in corporate

form.     Taxes before financing are tc(C_D)• At the optimal conversion time,
the value of the asset is given by the royalty trust valuation formula

CI(r—g).     If the asset is financed with debt, the tax saving due to
                                        — 25 —



interest   expense is TrC/(r—g). At the optimal conversion time, the net

tax effect is exactly zero:


           T[C(t*) —   D(t*)]   =
                                     trC(t*)/(r_g)                          (33)


It can be verified that (33) is equivalent to (32).

           Note that the corporate tax rate can be eliminated from (33).

Hence the optimal time to convert from corporate to royalty trust form is

independent of the corporate tax rate. This result is reminiscent of our

finding in the one—period case that the critical ratio of depreciation to

pre—tax cash flow for determining ownership form is independent of tax

rates.

           We can solve (32) or (3) for the critical ratio y that separates

the corporate from the royalty trust stage:


              5 D(t*)/C(t*)         —g/(r—g) .                              (34)

Note that this ratio only makes sense if g C         0,   when pre—tax cash flow

declines through time. To understand why, consider the watershed perpe-

tuity case where g     0. Assume first that depreciation is zero. Then (34)

is identically zero and the asset is equally valuable in corporate or

royalty trust form. For example, if the asset is financed in corporate

form by an issue of debt. pre—tax cash flow is exactly sheltered by inter-

est expense. In this case, corporate borrowing also eliminates double

taxation and hence low—tax investors are indifferent between receiving the

pre—tax cash flow directly through a royalty trust or indirectly through

interest payments. Now introduce depreciation. The associated tax shields

are more valuable to a corporation (or high—tax investors) than to low—tax

investors. Hence the asset should never be owned in a low—tn royalty

trust.
                                           — 26 —




             Similarly,       when g > 0 interest expense is greater than or equal

to pre—tax cash flow.             Both the excess interest expense and the

depreciation tax shields are more valuable in corporate (or high—tax

partnership) form than in royalty trust form owned by low—tax investors.

Thus royalty trusts only make sense for wasting assets, where g 'C 0.

             When g C 0, the possibility of conversion increases the value of

assets and thus the net present value associated with investment decisions.

For example, consider the value of an asset in its corporate stage. Since

it can be shown that the critical ratio y* occurs at time

                  =       +



we have from (31) that


             V(t) =                    +
                      (l_tc)C(t:)/fx

                      + C(t) [y(t)/y*] d)/(_g) -        (l_t)C(t)[1(t)/1*]6/X
                      -
                                                                             (35)


The first two terms correspond to the value of the asset if it is kept in

corporate form forever. Hence the last three terms represent the extra

value due to the opportunity to convert the asset into a royalty trust.

             It would be nice to have a simple valuation expression for any

asset which is initially negatively taxed, while it is still in its high

tax partnership stage. Unfortunately, this requires a knowledge of the

sequence of investors who own these partnerships, and their required rates
             14
of return.

             One final point about royalty trusts is worth making, namely that

creation of royalty trusts only makes sense for assets whose depreciated
                                                — 27 —



book value is less than current market value.                   To demonstrate this,

consider the value of an asset held forever in corporate form, namely


                        (1—i )C(t)          t   6B(t)
            V(t)                       +                                                      (36)
                       r(l—-r)—g           r(l_tc)+6

Now suppose that depreciated book value equals current market value——

B(t) — V(t)——and that the rate of depreciation equals the rate of decline

in pre—tax cash flow:       6 = —g.        Then this valuation expression simplifies

to B(t)     V(t) a    C(t)/(r—g)   =   R(t).      Since all variables grow at the same

rate, this relation always holds. Hence book value always equals market

value, and the value of an asset in corporate form is the same as in a

royalty trust. This result corresponds to the special case where account-

ing depreciation exactly equals economic depreciation. Myers, Dill and

Bautista (1976) found that corporations were indifferent between leasing

and   buying in this case. In Section 4 we argued that their leasing
analysis could be reinterpreted as a statement about optimal owners of

assets——i.e., when accounting depreciation equals economic depreciation

there is no optimal owner.

           It intuitively follows for the faster depreciation schedules

assumed   here——i.e., 6 >    —g——that conversion to a royalty trust should be

delayed   until    a subsequent time when depreciated book value is less than

prevailing market value. To verify this, suppose the contrary, namely that

it is optimal to convert now, so that, D(t)                   oB(t) =         6V(t)   =   oR(t)
6C(t)/(r—g). But then y(t)             D(t)/C(t) = 61(r—g)          >   y*.    Hence it is too

early to convert to a royalty trust. In summary, conversion to a royalty

trust only makes sense when depreciated book value is less than current

value. This result is reminiscent of our finding in the one—period case

that royalty trusts only make sense if D <               C/(l+r).
                                     —28—


          The analysis thus f at explains how high tax partnerships and

royalty trusts can dominate uninterrupted corporate ownership of tangible

assets. However there may be other mechanisms which serve a similar

purpose, particularly in the face of capital gains and recapture taxes.     It

is to this topic that we now turn.



6. Mergers and Acquisitions

          We have seen that royalty trusts can be an effective mechanism

for reducing taxes on a wasting asset like an oil field. However it has

been claimed that mergers and acquisitions also accomplish the same thing,

through the associated step—up in the tax basis of assets.    Indeed U.S.

Steel justified its $7 billion acquisition of Marathon Oil in part on

precisely this tax reduction. The relationship between royalty trusts and

acquisitions as alternative mechanisms for reducing taxes on wasting assets

was highlighted by Mesa Petroleum's tender offer for Gulf Oil, and Gulf's

subsequent acquisition by Socal for $14 billion. Mesa's offer proposed to

reorganize Gulf's oil—producing properties as royalty trusts specifically

to reduce taxes.

          Whether a royalty trust or an acquisition is the better way to

reduce taxes on a wasting asset, and whether acquisitions of nonwasting

assets yield tax benefits, are questions that depend critically on the

specifics of the tax code. (From the last section, we know that royalty

trusts are not appropriate for nonwasting assets.) The mechanism and

current tax law regarding creation of a royalty trust are as follows.

First the corporation places certain of its assets in a trust. The tax

basis of the trust is identical to that of the assets. There is no taxable

event upon creation of the trust. However there is a taxable event upon
                                    — 29 —



distribution   of the beneficial interest in the trust to stockholders. The

distribution is treated like any other dividend; it is taxed at ordinary

income rates, calculated on the basis of the observed secondary market

value of trust units.

          In equilibrium, the effective tax associated with distribution of

a royalty trust is likely to be minimal. Since low—tax investors are the

logical owners of royalty trusts, it makes sense for them to purchase the

stock just before distribution, so that the distribution is taxed at their

rate!6 As mentioned in the last section, these investors are likely to be

nontaxable. Hence the only taxes associated with such- a distribution have

to do with the recognition of capital gains by the original (high tax)

stockholders. In keeping with the rest of the paper1 we assume that the

effective tax on capital gains is minimal. (For example, stockholders may

be able to recognize offsetting losses.)

          The mechanism and applicable tax law regarding an acquisition to
                                                  17
step up the tax basis of assets are as follows.        The acquiring corpora-

tion purchases the stock of the acquired corporation, thus generating a

capital gains liability for stockholders. (As before, we assume an effec-

tive capital gains tax rate of zero.) The acquiring corporation then

"liquidates" the acquired corporation.'8 Under Section 334 of the Internal

Revenue Code, the acquiring company is allowed to step up the tax basis of

the assets of the acquired company to a level equal to the value of the

consideration paid for the acquired company. However, under Section 1245,

the acquiring company is liable at ordinary income tax rates for recapture

of any post—1962 depreciation.
                                       — 30 —



             In   the absence of capital gains taxation, an equivalent mechanism

is for another corporation to purchase the asset directly from the corpora-

tion that currently owns it.       In either case there is a corporate tax on

recapture.

             The comparison between an acquisition and creation of a royalty

trust as a mechanism for reducing taxes under current tax law thus depends

on the relation of the current market value of an asset to its initial book

value. Suppose first that the current market value of the asset, which

incorporates its optimal tax treatment, is less than its initial book

value. Then the acquisition mechanism actually increases taxes in present

value terms. In other words, any reduction in taxes due to a step—up in

basis is exactly offset by taxes paid due to recapture. Furthermore, the

taxes paid because of recapture are due immediately, while the taxes saved

because of the step—up in basis are spread into the future. Hence, if

current market value is less than initial book value, creation of a royalty

trust is the appropriate way to reduce taxes on a wasting asset.

             The polar alternative case is where initial book value is trivial

compared to current market value. For example, oil fields that were

established before the dramatic increases in oil prices are likely to be in

this situation. In this case, the tax due to recapture is trivial compared

to the step—up in basis. Bence it is virtually costless to step up the

basis to current market value. Furthermore, we know from the last section

that royalty trusts do not make sense if book value is as large as current

market value. Hence an acquisition creates more value than conversion to a

royalty trust in this case.

         To recapitulate, the tax advantages under current law of acquisi-

tions versus conversions to royalty trusts depend on the relation between
                                    — 31 —



current   market value and initial book value.   If market value is below

initial book value, conversion to a royalty trust is advantageous, but an

acquisition is not. If market value is substantially above initial book

value, the tax on recapture is small compared to the tax benefits

associated with a step—up in basis; hence an acquisition dominates

conversion to a royalty trust.

           Our analysis also addresses the tax consequences of a sale and

leaseback arrangement between corporations designed to step up an asset's

basis. Such an arrangement can be decomposed into the sale part and the

leaseback part. We argued in Section 4 that any perceived benefits in a

lease were attributable to the asset being held by its optimal owner.

Hence any net tax benefits have to do with the sale part. But we noted

above that the tax consequences here were the same as with an acquisition

of stock. Hence our use of the term acquisition can be considered to

include assets sales as well, whether or not there is a leaseback arrange-

ment.

           Finally, we have seen that any advantage of a royalty trust

relative to acquisition by another company under current law has to do with

the avoidance of recapture——for example, when market value is below

historic book value. Proposed tax law even eliminates this advantage for

royalty trusts. According to this proposed law, the corporate tax

consequences of creation of a royalty trust are the same as if the

corporation had sold the asset, entailing recapture and capital gains. In

this case, since the tax consequences to the corporation that initially

owns the asset are the same, it makes sense for another corporation to buy

the asset and step up its basis to market value. Hence, under proposed

law, conversion to royalty trust is always dominated by acquisition.

     7.   Conclusion

                In this paper we have investigated the effect of taxes on the

    equilibrium ownership structure of tangible assets. This issue encompasses

    the corporate capital structure decision, but it also includes the broader

    choice   between corporate and partnership form.
                For some interesting special cases we are able to completely
    characterize   the asset market equilibrium. Subject to the qualifications

    discussed above, our basic results can be summarized as follows:     nega-

    tively taxed assets are best held by high tax bracket investors, while

    positively taxed assets are best held by low tax bracket investors. All

    negatively taxed assets will thus be organized as high tax bracket

    partnerships. All assets that are positively taxed, even -after allowance

    is made for maximum corporate interest deductions, will be organized as low

    tax bracket partnerships. All other assets will be held in corporate form,

    and their aggregate financing proportions will be consistent with Miller's
-



    (1977) equilibrium.

               Other aspects of the problem remain to be studied in more detail.

    For example, in Section 6 we have only touched on the issues posed by a

    realistic treatment of capital gains and recapture taxes.

               A second major task would be to integrate the incentive problem

    aspects of ownership structure with the tax considerations analyzed in this

    paper. As mentioned, Fama and Jensen (1983 a and b) and Wolfson (1983)

    have discussed the relative severity of incentive problems entailed by the

    corporate and partnership forms. The theory would be further advanced by a

more detailed analysis of the trade—offs between economizing on taxes and

    mitigating incentive problems.

1. Alternatively, Da determines the fraction, (1 —                    f) of   the asset's

    pre—tax cash flow that is taxable. Black (1971) refers to this

    taxable fraction as the asset's tax bracket.

2. We make no distinction between partnerships and sole
                                                                         proprietorships.

    For our purposes, the key feature of either form is that the asset is

    not subject to double taxation.

3. In similar fashion, if investor I holds asset a in partnership form

    and finances it by issuing personal debt to investor j, the value of

    the debt can be represented as


                                  i       a
                         C
                                 [r (C — D ) —     (t pi— rjp )rVaP
          P
                                              1+pJ
   Any   chain    of securities issues against a tangible asset can ultimately

   be expressed in the same general form.

4. The same rule also holds in the multiperiod case as Ruback (1983) has

   shown. Analogously, if investor i issues personal debt against a

   directly held tangible asset, the value of this debt is given by


                   C —   T(C — Da)
              =              p
          P
                    1+r(1—t1)

5. The authorities will limit tax—arbitrage transactions, which consist

   of investors taking simultaneous long and short positions in assets

   that are subject to different tax treatment. A prime example is

   borrowing by high tax bracket investors to purchase tax—exempt
                                               — 34 —




     securities,     such as equity. Some amount of these transactions can be

     admitted in our model, as they are in actual fact. What is necessary

     is that tax arbitrage not be allowed to eliminate all differences in

     after—ta yields across securities of different types and across

     investors in different tax brackets.

6. If corporations issue debt to repurchase equity, or vice versa, they

     are engaging in a kind of tax arbitrage. The ability of the corporate

     sector to undertake such transactions without limit, while individual

     investors cannot, is a fundamental determinant of equilibrium. If the

     investor with the highest personal tax rate, ¶ma, could borrow

     without limit to purchase stock, all tangible assets would be packaged

     as stock, and all corporate stock would be held by this investor, who

     would finance his holdings by issuing personal debt to other inves-

     tors. In that event, the equilibrium after—tax return on equity would

     ber(1—t max).
7.   Since the asset would have the same market value if it were packaged

     in corporate stock form, it is sufficient to examine the corporate

     debt case.

S. If C >     Da(l   +   r),   C —       > rDa.          Adding and subtracting rC and

     rt(C —          from the right—hand side of this inequality gives
     C —       — r(1 —               — Da) +   r(C   —          —   Da)) which in turn implies
                          tc)(C                           t(C
     (20).

9. If an asset is held in corporate stock form, it of course generates

     positive tax     liabilities       at the corporate level but none at the

     investor level. A further implication of Proposition IV, then, is

     that it can be worthwhile to submit to the corporate tax only if the
                                       — 35 —




      corporation's   taxable income is not "too large"; that is, only if

           C/(1 +   r).
10. If there are tax—exempt investors, they will bid up the prices of

      these assets until their return is exactly r. This implies that all

      such assets will have a value of          Cf(1 +   r),   in which case the

      partnership condition is equivalent to Da <

11.   See Millet and Upton (1976), Lewellen, Long and McConnell (1976) and

      Myers, Dill and Bautista (1976) for more extensive discussions of

      leasing. Our conclusions are consistent with these authors.           Our

      purpose here is simply to show that the leasing question can be

      imbedded in the larger question of who should optimally own a given

      tangible asset in equilibrium.

12. Alternatively, as is usually done in oil drilling or other tax shelter

      deals, the limited partners can sign a management contract with the

      general partner (frequently a corporation). Or under the royalty

      trust concept, a set of assets originally owned by a corporation could

      be spun off in trust to investors, but still managed under a contract

      by the corporate parent. Our analysis of course ignores all incentive

      problems resulting from separation of ownership and management. See

      Wolfson (1983) for a discussion of these problems in the context of

      drilling partnerships.

13. Myers, Dill and Bautista (1976) conclude that there is no net

      advantage to leasing in the one—period case. This conclusion is

      driven by two assumptions that differ from ours: first, that any

      owner can borrow without restriction and second, that the asset's

      allowed depreciation, a, is equal to its purchase price va. Under

      their assumptions, for any owner (individual or corporate) with tax

      rate t,   it must be true that
                                            — 36   —




                    C   —
                    1   +   r(1   —   r*)
                 a
     Solving for V yields

                        C
                —
                    1+r'
     and thus asset value is independent of the owner's tax rate.

     Intuitively, the disadvantage of debt for a wasting asset due to the

     fact that principal repayment is not deductible is exactly offset in

     this case by the advantage of depreciation, which exactly shelters

     principal repayments. While the assumption that        =   a   is quite

     reasonable for depreciation, we construe          to include other

    nondepreciation tax shields, so that their total need not sum to the

     asset's initial value.

14. If the maximum investor tax rate is equal to the effective corporate

    rate, then the valuation formula in (9) continues to be valid.

15. More specifically the royalty trust distribution is considered a

    dividend if the parent corporation has accumulated surplus on its tax

    books.   Otherwise, it is deemed a tax—free return of capital. See

    Cooper (1984).

16. In practice, large distributions like these (or payments of arrearages

    on preferred stock) are candidates for "dividend stripping" by

    corporations that take advantage of the intercorporate dividend

    exclusion and simultaneously recognize capital losses associated with

    the price decline. If this is allowed, equilibrium may not exist on

    the ex—dividend date.

17. There are two basic kinds of acquisitions: acquisitions that are

    "taxable"   for stockholders, and acquisitions that are "tax—free" for
                                      — 37 —



      stockholders.      "Tax—free" acquisitions generate no capital gains
      liability   for stockholders, but they also do not allow for a step—up

      in the tax basis of assets.         The mechanism described here is a

      "taxable" acquisition, which generates both a capital gains liability

      and   a step—up in the tax basis.
18.   It is no longer possible to engage in a "partial liquidation" of the
      acquired    company, as U.S. Steel did in acquiring Marathon Oil. This

      device allowed U.S. Steel to step up the tax     basis of the Yates oil
      field,   without recognizing gains associated with Marathon's use of

      LIlt accounting.
