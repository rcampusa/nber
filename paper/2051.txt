     The Competitiveness and Comparative Advantage of U.S. Multinationals,
                                   1957—1983



                                    ABSTRACT




    The share in world exports of manufactured goods of U.S. multinational
firms, including their majority—owned overseas affiliates, has been nearly
stable since 1966. This stability, over a period in which the export share
of the U.S. as a geographical entity was declining for the most part,
suggests that it was not declines in the competitiveness of American
firms' management and technology that were responsible for the deteriora-
tion of the U.S. trade position. That view is reinforced by the fact that
a good deal of the change in U.S. export shares can be explained by changes
in U.S. prices relative to those of other countries.

    The comparative advantage of both the U.S. and U.S. multinational
firms, especially the latter, has been in chemicals, machinery, and
transport equipment, industries with relatively fast growth in worldwide
exports. The growth of U.S. exports in 1966—77 fell far short of what
it would have been if the U.S. had retained its share in each industry.
The growth of U.S. multinationals' exports fell a little short of that
implied by constant—shares but surpassed that of the U.S. as a country in
almost every industry. After 1977, both the U.S. and its multinationals
kept up with their constant share growth rates and the U.S. even ran a bit
ahead. The multinationals' position as exporters, now supplying almost
half their exports from their majority—owned overseas affiliates, seems to
have been quite insulated from changes in U.S. policies and circumstances.

Introduction

     In an earlier study it was shown that the share in world manufactured

exports of firms located in the U.S. moved differently from the share of U.S.

multinational firms, including both their domestic and their overseas opera-

tions. The U.S. share fell steadily from the 1950's through the mid-1970's,

but the share of U.S. multinational firms did not decline at all or even

increased (Lipsey and Kravis, 1985). That contrast suggests that it is impor-

tant to distinguish between the factors that determine the competitiveness of

the U.S. as a production location and those that determine the competitiveness

of U.S. firms. The latter might include characteristics such as the firms'

management and technology, since the firm characteristics would affect the

firms' performance in both home and foreign operations.

     Much of the standard analysis of trade developments explains increases or

decreases in a country's exports and imports or shares in world trade by

     This research, part of the National Bureau's program in International
Studies, was done mainly as a part of a study of the competitiveness of
U.S. firms supported by a grant to the National Bureau from the National
Science Foundation (PRA-8513944) and a grant to the University of
Pennsylvania by the Ford Foundation (No. 855-0678). Some support was also

changes in the country's prices relative to those of its competitors and

suppliers and by changes in incomes in its markets. That emphasis on price

developments is the reason for the belief that the very high exchange value of

the U.S. dollar was a major factor accounting for the large U.S. trade and

current account deficits of recent years.

     A rival explanation for U.S. trade difficulties that has been offered in

recent years is that the problems are internal to U.S. firms; they have lost

their technological lead or their management skills and, therefore, altera-

tions in monetary and fiscal policies will not restore the competitiveness of

the U.S. (See, for example, Abernathy et al., 1983). The decline of U.S. firms

is seen as stemming from defects in the training of managers, from the empha-

sis in U.S. firms on short—term results, from the deterioration of technical

education in this country, or from the declining U.S. lead in research and

development investment.

     Factors internal to firms are just the ones that have, in the last few

years, become the main explanations for the phenomenon of direct investment.

They are the elements of the competitiveness and comparative advantage of

individual firms that enable them to produce in countries outside the ones

where they originated in competition with local firms that have the advantage

of familiarity with local product and factor markets and the favor of local

governments. In the literature on multinationals (e.g., Dunning, 1981), these

are treated as belonging to firms rather than to countries, and as being

readily transferable from country to country within, but not between, firms.

The more transferable these attributes are geographically, the less they can

be the basis for national competitiveness and comparative advantage.

     The implication for national trade policy is that factors that contribute
                                     —3—

to firm competitiveness and comparative advantage will not necessarily contri-

bute to national competitiveness and comparative advantage. Subsidies to

R & D, to innovation, or to management or technical training may enhance the

competitiveness of national firms in world markets, but that competitiveness

may be exploited by producing outside the home country.

     A corresponding implication is that the factors producing firm com-

parative advantages should be studied by examining measures of the com-

petitiveness and comparative advantage of firms rather than that of their home

countries. And any large difference between the fortunes of a country and

those of the firms based in it helps us to determine whether the respon-

sibility for changes lies with macroeconomic policy or with the determinants

of firm advantages, such as management or technology.


The Export Share of the U.S.

     Although our main interest in this paper is in the competitiveness of

U.S. multinationals, we begin by examining, for comparison, developments in

the competitiveness of the U.S. as a country. U.S. export shares of manufac-

tured goods declined from the early or mid-1950's to the early or late 1970's,

the date depending on the series used for measurement. The years 1976—78 were

the lowest points so far in most series, and there was some recovery after

that. Ratios for the years covered by surveys of U.S. investment abroad were

as follows:

The period from 1977 to 1982 saw a slight reversal of that trend, although it

may turn out to be only a temporary one.


The Role of Prices

     Of the two broad explanations for changing export shares suggested above,

we explore only very briefly here the role of prices. A measure of the change

in U.S. prices relative to those of its main competitors, or what we might

call the price competitiveness of the U.S. is shown in Appendix Table U-16.

It is an index of U.S. export prices relative to an index of world prices of

manufactured exports, based on prices of the U.S. and of six main competitors,

weighted by the importance of commodities in U.S. exports as described in
                                          —5—

Bushe, Kravis, and Lipsey (1986).

        We ask first whether movements in the relative U.S. price level explain

annual U.S. shares in exports of manufactures in the period from 1955 through

1983.

 USExS      =   U.S. exports of products in SITC 5-8 as per cent of exports
                  by developed market economies. For period before 1965,
                  shares in exports of SITC 5-8 are extrapolated back by
                  shares in total exports (Appendix Table U-lb).

        I   =   time
  Figures in parentheses are t statistics

The export share of the U.S. as a country is explained by a downward trend and

by the current and lagged price levels. The equation implies that a higher

relative U.S. price level is associated with a higher U.S. export share the

year it occurs but a lower share the year after. By the end of the year after

the U.S. price increase, the U.S. export share would be below the one pre-

ceding the price rise.

        A large part of the very high      in this equation is accounted for by the

trend term. An alternative approach is to explain changes in the U.S. export

share by changes in relative prices.

            A = variables    in the form Xt/Xt_l

The equation, explaining a little more than a third of the variation in

shares, again indicates that a rise in the relative U.S. export price first
                                     -6-

increases the U.S. export share in the year of the price increase and then

reduces it the next year. The total decrease in share resulting from the price

increase is about 11 per cent of the price change, implying a cumulative

elasticity of substitution a little over one.

     We can also test whether a high price level has any independent influence

on changes in the U.S. export share aside from that of the price change

        aAfter correction for serial correlation

The price level coefficient is negative even when the current and lagged price

changes are included in the equation, suggesting some additional unfavorable

effects of high prices. However, the price level adds little to the explana-

tion of trade shares once lagged price changes are included.

     These results indicate that a good deal of the competitiveness of the

U.S. as a country can be attributed to U.S. price levels and changes in them,

relative to the rest of the world. Earlier work on machinery and transport

equipment (Kravis and Lipsey, 1981, and Bushe, Kravis, and Lipsey, 1986) has

suggested that a more thorough analysis would reveal still longer lags and

price elasticities or substitution elasticities further above unity.

     These export responses to price levels and price changes include the

behavior of U.S. parent companies and must reflect their actions to a con-

siderable extent, since they account for about two thirds of U.S. exports of

manufactured goods. We now turn to the analysis of their exporting patterns.

The Competitiveness of U.S. Multinationals

      We saw earlier that the U.S. share in world manufactured exports declined

between 1957 and 1966 from 21 or 22 per cent to 16-18 per cent. It then

dropped to the 13 to 14 per cent range in 1977, where it remained in the early

1980's. The figures are repeated in line 1 to make comparisons with the export

record of multinationals easy.

      It can be seen (line 4) that the overall share of U.S.-based multina-

tionals, including exports by parents and majority-owned affiliates (MOFA5),1

was essentially stable. Exports from the U.S. by multinational parents

shared, though to an attenuated degree, the decline between 1966 and 1977 in

total U.S. exports. However, the growth of affiliate exports more than offset

this decline.

     As is implied by the fact that parent export shares declined less than

those of the U.S. as a whole, the share of parent firms in U.S. exports of

manufactures rose substantially between 1966 and 1977. Some of that rise was

lost between 1977 and 1982.

That increased importance of multinational firms as exporters from the U.S. in

1966-77 was apparently not the result of a shift of firms from non-

multinational to multinational status. In fact, the number of firms reporting

as multinationals actually decreased slightly from 1966 to 1977, as can be

seen in Appendix Table U-b. However, in the period when the multinationals'

share decreased, between 1977 and 1982, there was a substantial decline in the

population of U.S. multinational firms.2

     The shares of majority-owned affiliates in exports of both developed and

LOC host countries shows a pattern of sharp increases and, f or developed

countries, rough stability since 1977. The MOFA share in exports of developed

countries increased by more than 50 per cent in the 20 years before 1977 and

then remained fairly stable through 1983. And the share of U.S. affiliates in

LDC exports grew by almost 75 per cent from 1957 through 1977 at a time when

the share of these countries in world exports was also increasing

substantially,3 and continued to rise at least through 1982. Thus, in both

developed and less developed host countries, there was a period of active

development in which the majority-owned affiliates outpaced other host-country



   2Part of this reduction in population may be illusory and the growth of
parent exports therefore understated. The cutoff point below which full data
for affiliates did not have to be reported was increased from $500,000 in 1977
to $3 million in 1982. Any parent firm with no affiliates above the cutoff
size was exempt from reporting on its own activities. We were able to make an
adjustment, quite small, for the effect of this change on affiliate exports,
but we are not able to guess the effect on parent exports or other parent
variables. The impact on aggregate affiliate measures is limited by the unim-
portance of affiliates of that size in the totals, but it is conceivable that
quite large parents with only marginal overseas production were eliminated
from the list even without making any changes in their overseas activities.
Thus, we do not know what the decline in parents' share of U.S. exports repre-
sents. It could be mostly a statistical artifact, it could represent a
turning away from multinationality by U.S. firms, or it could represent a
decline in the competitiveness of U.S. multinationals relative to other U.S.
firms, or a shift in U.S. comparative advantage away from industries in which
U.S. multinationals have their advantages. A conclusion on this issue requires
disaggregation by industry and the study of fixed groups of firms.

   3This result seems to contradict the findings of a paper by Nayyar (1978)
to the effect that the share of U.S. majority-owned affiliates in developing-
country exports fell from about 10.6 per cent to below 9 per cent in the early
1970's. The growth of affiliate exports to 1974 in Nayyar's data seems very

firms, followed by a period of less dynamic growth (for both the countries and

the affiliates), in which the affiliates' exports increased in step with those

of other host—country firms.

    As is implied by what has been said about parents and affiliates,

majority-owned overseas affiliates' shares in exports by U.S. multinationals

jumped substantially from 1966 to 1977, and their share of exports by all U.S.

firms more than doubled from 1957 to 1977. Then the affiliates' share

decreased slightly between 1977 and 1982 before increasing again, to its

highest recorded level, in 1983.

That switch in the 1977-82 period suggests a move by U.S. multinational firms

toward producing in the U.S., perhaps as a response to the low values of the

U.S. dollar in the late 1970's and early 1980's, before shifting back toward

foreign production as the dollar recovered.

     To what may the superior foreign export performance of U.S.-controlled

firms be attributed? Several possibilities suggest themselves. One is that




slow in view of our 1977 census total. Furthermore, he defined aggregate deve-
loping country manufactured exports much more narrowly than in our calcula-
tions.
                                     —11—

American affiliates were sharing in the superior (to the U.S.) export growth

of their host countries. This would involve behavior like that of other

domestic firms in the host countries. Another is that U.S. parents systemati—

cally shifted export operations to foreign bases through diminution or slower

growth in U.S. exports. Perhaps in the end the basic factors underlying export

sourcing decisions are riot very different for these two possible explanations.

However, if U.S. affiliate exports merely kept pace with the rate of growth in

host country exports, there may be a stronger presumption that the ME was

simply responding to the host country's competitive opportunities. Affiliate

export performance in host countries superior to that of both local firms and

U.S. parents, on the other hand, suggests an active policy of shifting exports

and a role in promoting host-country export growth.


The Comparative Advantage of U.S. Multinationals

    Before examining how different industries contributed to these changes in

exports and export shares we use the distribution of exports among industries

to identify the comparative advantage of the United States and of its multina-

tional firms. We identify the comparative advantage in terms of the relative

distributions of exports. U.S. multinationals, for example, are regarded as

having a comparative advantage in the chemical industry relative to the U.S.

as a country (or to the world as a whole), if the share of chemicals in their

exports is larger than the share of chemicals in U.S. (or world) exports. It

would be desirable to use net exports as the criterion for countries, but we

have not so far made such calculations for the multinationals, and it is also

not as clear for them what the figures would mean. One reason for the uncer-

tainty is that their exports are classified by industry rather than by pro-
                                       —12—

duct, and while we consider it reasonable to assume that their exports are

within that industry, the assumption that their imports were also in the same

industry would be more questionable. Another drawback to this method of

assessing comparative advantage is that it ignores distortions in the com-

position of trade due to government interventions.

    The differences between the distributions of U.S. and U.S. multinationals'

exports and those of the world and of developed countries in 1966, the first

year for which all are available, are given below. They show that the U.S. had

comparative advantages relative to the world in chemicals, machinery, par-

ticularly non-electrical, and transport equipment. U.S. multinational firms'

comparative advantage ran along the same lines, but to an exaggerated degree.

Their concentration in chemicals and machinery was slightly greater than that

of the U.S. and in transport equipment, much greater, while they exported a

smaller proportion of foods, metals, and other manufactured products.

    The corresponding comparisons for 1982 show a similar pattern for the U.S.

However, there were some shifts. The U.S. had less of a comparative advantage

in chemicals and transport equipment and more in non-electrical machinery, and

larger disadvantages in metals. The breakdown of transport equipment into

motor vehicles and equipment and other transport equipment reveals that the

U.S. comparative advantage was in the latter subgroup, mainly aircraft and

parts. In motor vehicles the U.S. showed comparative disadvantages relative

to the world and to developed countries as a group.

For U.S. multinational firms, a finer breakdown by industry for 1982 than was

available for 1966 reveals that they possessed comparative advantages relative

to the world as a whole and to developed countries in both electrical and non-

electrical machinery. Largely, the industry pattern of their comparative
                                     -14-

advantage was similar in 1982 to the earlier one, with some shift towards che-

micals and a large decline in their comparative advantage in transport equip-

ment. The breakdown of the transport equipment industry into the two

subgroups indicates that U.S. multinationals held comparative advantages in

both, and that the margins were larger for motor vehicles than for other

transport equipment.

    The 1982 comparison between U.S. multinationals and the U.S. as a country

(Col. 5) shows that the multinationals' comparative advantage in machinery

relative to that of other U.S. firms had disappeared; the U.S. as a production

location showed a large comparative advantage relative to U.S multinationals,

although the latter enjoyed a smaller, but noticeable, comparative advantage

in electrical machinery relative to the U.S. The multinationals, by 1982, had

increased their advantage in chemicals but reduced that in transport equipment

relative to the U.S. Within transport equipment, U.S. multinationals had a

large comparative advantage in motor vehicles relative to the U.S. but the

US. as a country had a noticeable comparative advantage in other transport

equipment relative to U.S. multinationals. The contrast reflects the fact

that the motor vehicle industry is one of the most multinational of U.S.

industries in its operations, -in the sense that a high proportion of its

employment is overseas (Kuichycky and Lipsey, 1984, p. 2) and it does much of

its exporting from abroad, while the other transport equipment industry is

among the least multinational and does most of its exporting from the U.S.

Even among parent firms, other transport equipment companies have small pro-

portions of their employment abroad relative to parents in other industries,

and tend to fill export demand from the U.S.

                                     -15-

multinationals would show up more strongly if we compared the multinationals, or

the parent companies themselves, with non-multinational U.S. companies. However,

that comparison is difficult because of incompatabilities in the classification

of exports between the product classification for the U.S. and the industry

classification we used for the multinationals. That problem is obvious in

industries such as chemicals and- electrical machinery that are almost completely

dominated by multinationals, as can be seen in Appendix Table U-3. where esti-

mated electrical machinery industry exports from the U.S. by U.S. multina-

tional parents and foreign-owned firms in the U.S. are larger than total U.S.

exports of electrical machinery.4 It is clear, in any case, that U.S. parents

possess large comparative advantages relative to non-multinational U.S. firms

in chemicals and electrical machinery, but that the non-multinational firms

have a strong comparative advantage in non-electrical machinery.

    A different set of observations on the comparative advantage of the U.S.

and of U.S. multinationals can be made by comparing U.S. firms in general and

U.S. parents with foreign—owned firms in the U.S. In this case we are com-

paring U.S. firms not with foreign countries in general but with foreign

multinationals, holding constant the production conditions of the U.S.




   4me problem is not only one of product and industry classification but
also reflects the fact that there is some duplication between the firms listed
as U.S. multinationals and those listed as foreign-controlled U.S. firms.

    Data on exports by foreign—owned firms in the U.S. are not available for

1966 but we can make the comparisons for 1977 and 1982. The earlier year may

be affected by the fact that many of the foreign-owned operations were new or

had been foreign-owned for only a short time.

    The most striking characteristic of the exports by foreign-owned U.S.

firms in 1977 was the high concentration in chemicals, mainly by German multi-

nationals, and the absence of exports of transport equipment, both areas of

U.S. and U.S. firms' comparative advantage. The concentration of exports by

the foreign multinationals -in chemicals increased substantially between 1977

and 1982. Thus, although chemicals was an industry of U.S. and U.S.

multinationals' comparative advantage relative to the rest of the world, there

are indications that at least German multinational firms possessed greater

firm-specific advantages -in this area. The comparative disadvantage of

foreign multinationals in transport equipment was still large in 1982 but had

diminished greatly, especially relative to the U.S. in general.

Competitiveness Within Industry Groups

    The decline in the competitiveness of the U.S. relative to other developed

countries and to the world between 1966 and 1982, as manifested in its falling

shares of exports, was spread across all the major industry groups.

However, it was smaller in non-electrical machinery than in the other groups.

Relative to developed countries, the decline was smaller in the whole machi-

nery industry than in any of the others except miscellaneous manufactures.

    As we know from the aggregate data presented earlier, the story was quite

different for the worldwide operations of U.S. multinationals, including those

of parents and their majority-owned affiliates.

U.S. multinationals gained in world export shares in food and chemicals and

lost shares in the other industries. Even where their world shares declined,

they held up better than those of the U.S. as a country. That relationship

can be seen clearly in the ratio of the export share changes for U.S. multina-

tionals to those for the U.S. as a country.

On the average, U.S. multinationals' export shares increased more or decreased

less than those of the U.S. by a margin of about 20 per cent. In no industry

group did they lose relative to the U.S. as a whole, but in machinery the

growth of their exports from developed countries just kept pace with that of

the U.S.

     In the case of machinery, both U.S. multinationals and the U.S. as a

country lost ground, but neither by much. In the case of transport equipment,

both the U.S. as a country and U.S. multinationals lost export shares by

around a quarter of the 1966 level.


Comparative Advantage, Growth in Demand, and Overall Competitiveness

    Changes in the overall competitiveness of a country or of its multina-

tional firms can be factored into several elements. One is the set of changes in

competitiveness within industries. A second is their comparative advantage,

which determines the extent to which they produce and export in each industry.

And a third is the rate at which world trade grows in each industry. The last is

partly a reflection of the rate of growth of demand and partly a result of
                                     —20-

shifts in the degree to which demand is met by each country's local output in

each industry. The first two of these elements have already been touched upon.

    The third element has varied a good deal among industries. In the whole

period covered, and in each of the sub-periods, world exports of chemicals,

electrical machinery, and transport equipment grew more rapidly than manufac-

tured exports in general, while exports of foods and metals grew less and those

of non-electrical machinery and other manufacturing clustered close to the

average.

    Both the U.S. and U.S.—owned multinational firms were oriented toward the

faster-growing industries in this breakdown, with their below-average

weighting of foods and metals and high weights for chemicals, machinery, and

transport equipment. This was even more the case for the U.S. multinationals

than for the U.S. Thus, if the U.S. and its multinational firms had retained
                                     —21—

their shares of exports within these industry groups, their shares of aggregate

manufacturing exports would have increased.

    We can compare the actual changes in U.S. and U.S. multinational firms

exports with those that would have occurred if they had retained their 1966

shares within industries. We refer below to this calculated export growth as

"constant share" export growth.

    The bias of the U.S. and U.S. multinationals toward fast-growing industry

groups is indicated by their high "constant share" growth rates, a little

higher for the multinationals than for the U.S. but both above the world

growth rate. Actual U.S. exports fell far short of that hypothetical growth

and the export growth of multinationals fell short as well, although not by as

much. That means that the stability in the U.S. multinationals' share of world

exports was the result of a combination of declining shares within at least

some industry groups with an orientation toward the faster-growing industries.

In the decade from 1966 to 1977, the comparative advantage of both the U.S.

and U.S. firms favored above-average export growth, given the rates of growth

of the seven industry groups. The prospective margin in the constant-share

growth ratio for the U.S. was .16 over the world growth ratio and for U.S.

multinationals the margin was .38. In actuality the U.S. fell far below the

hypothetical constant share growth rate and far below the world growth rate

despite its favorable composition of exports. U.S. multinationals' exports

grew at close to the world rate because their export composition was

favorable, and the favorable export mix made up for the loss of shares within

groups.

    Given the industry growth rates over the next five years, the U.S. and

U.S. multinational firm export mixes in 1977 would have produced roughly

constant shares in total manufactured exports. In fact, U.S. exports grew at

a little more than both the world rate and their constant share rate. For U.S.

multinationals, actual export growth was close to the world rate, as in the

earlier period. However, their growth was below the U.S. rate, as had not

been the case for the earlier decade.

    If the composition of exports in 1966 had been that of 1982 for the U.S.,

U.S. multinationals, and the world, and if the industry export growth rates of

the 1966-1982 period had been as they were, the comparisons would have come out

as follows:

    In 1982, the U.S. multinationals continued to show the greatest bias

toward what had been the fast-growing export sectors of 1966-1982. That bias was

stronger than that of the U.S., which was, in turn, more oriented to such sec-

tors than was the world as a whole. However, the rest of the world moved

toward the rapidly growing export industries a little faster than either the

U.S. as a country or U.S. multinationals.


Conclusion

    The worldwide share of U.S. multinational firms (U.S. parent companies

plus their majority-owned affiliates) in manufactures exports has been nearly

stable since 1966. We do not know what happened to parent exports from the

U.S. before 1966, but the very large growth in affiliate exports makes it

probable that the total share of U.S. multinationals increased between 1957

and 1966. The early growth (1957—66) and later stability (1966-77) of overall

U.S. multinational export shares occurred while the share of the U.S. as a

geographical location declined substantially, from over 20 per cent to 13 or

14 per cent. Since 1977, there have been no clear trends in the shares of all

U.S. firms, of parents, and of majority-owned affiliates in the aggregate,

although the affiliate share continued to increase in developing countries.

Thus, U.S. multinationals conformed to the market performance of local firms,
                                     -24—

both in the U.S. and in developed countries abroad during these years. This

is in contrast to their rapid expansion of exports prior to 1977. In those

years, they increased their exports from virtually all foreign locations at a

faster rate than other host-country firms, and their exports from the U.S.

faster than non—multinational U.S. firms.

     This record is consistent with the view that American management and tech-

nology remained competitive, and is at variance with the argument sometimes made

that the fall in the share of the U.S. in world manufactures exports was due to

management failures and declines in technology. Perhaps the greater integration

of the world economy with respect to transport and communications, and hence to

the ease of managerial control over activities in distant locations, facilitated

the expansion of affiliate exports in the 1957-77 period, but even so, American

management should be credited with taking advantage of these opportunities. And

since 1977, American-controlled firms abroad have maintained their shares in a

rapidly growing world market, with powerful competition from Japan and some

other industrial countries and the advent of new competitors.

    While we do not attempt to explain fully the decline in the U.S. country

share in export markets, we find that a substantial part of the changes in share

during a thirty-year period could be accounted for by movements in U.S. export

prices relative to those of its main competitors. That finding is further evi-

dence, in our view, that much of the explanation for the export performance of

the U.S. as a geographical entity must be looked for in the factors that deter-

mine price levels. Over the short run, at least, these are presumably monetary,

fiscal, and related policies that affect exchange rates and rates of inflation.

    The loss of U.S. shares between 1966 and 1982 extends to each of the

major branches of manufacturing. The shares of U.S. multinationals, however,
                                     —25—

increased in foods, chemicals, and, relative to developed countries, in other

manufactures. They also showed smaller declines than those of the U.S. in

most other categories.

    The comparative advantage of the U.S. has been in chemicals, machinery, and

transport equipment, and this is even more true for U.S. multinationals. These

have been fast-growing exports in world markets. They contributed substantially

to an export composition weighted in favor of products with relatively strong

demand growth. However, the growth of manufactures exports between 1966 and

1977 by all firms located in the U.S. fell short, by almost a third, of what

it would have been if the U.S. had maintained a constant share in each

industry and thus participated proportionately in the expansion of world trade

in each industry. The exports of U.S. multinationals also fell short of

constant-share growth, but by less than 10 per cent. Between 1977 and 1982, in

contrast to the earlier period, the export growth implied by constant shares

f or the U.S. and for U.S. multinationals was close to the world and

developed-country averages. That is, the composition of exports for both was

a little less favorable relative to other countries than it had been before.

The growth in U.S. exports in those years was close to or even slightly

greater than would have been produced by constant 1977 shares in each

industry, while that of U.S. multinationals was slightly less. Thus, in the

latest period for which we have data, when U.S. exports kept pace with those

of other countries, as they had failed to do in the preceding quarter-century,

the differentiation between U.S. multinationals and the U.S. as a country was

greatly reduced.

    The major conclusion about U.S. multinationals is that they have continued

to hold a very steady share in world exports. That has been true while the
                                     -26-
U.S. country share was declining and it remained true when U.S. country share

rose. The multinationals position in exports thus seems to have been quite

insulated from changes in home-country policies or circumstances.

Notes to Appendix Table U—la

    aFor 1975 and 1966 comparable to 1957, SITC 0, 1, 4—8, less 041—045.
These totals include substantial amounts of non—manufactured products but
were the best approximations that could be made for these two years. For
other years the definition of manufactured products follows that used in
the BEA direct investment surveys. That definition is itself adapted from
the U.S. Census Bureau's ESIC. One important difference is that petroleum
refining is not included in manufacturing but is placed in a separate
petroleum industry that we do not include here.

1957: U.S. Department of Commerce (1960),
       By industry, to countries other than U.S., p. 36.
       To U.S., by product, Table 26, Manufactures and semimanufactures
          plus meat products.
          Foods = meat products
          Metals = aluminum
          Transport equipment = motor vehicles, aircraft, and equipment
          Other = Newsprint and pulp; Scientific instruments, Rubber
            products, and Other.

       To U.S., by industry, total from Table 57 allocated between Canada
          and Europe using total for all countries from Table 58 and allocated
          by industry using product distribution and assuming that difference
          between product and industry total consisted of fabricated metals
          other than aluminum.

       To All Countries, by Industry, breakdown between Canada and Europe
          for all manufacturing from Table 58 and industry breakdown sum of
          exports to U.S. and exports to other countries.

      The share of metals is probably overstated in comparison to data for
         later years because of the Inclusion of publicly—owned companies,
         50% or more owned by U.S. citizens, but with no controlling U.S.
         interest.
