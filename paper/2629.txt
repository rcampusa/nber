Precise conditions under which a temporary import tariff will worsen the

permanent external terms of trade shocks will affect the current account are

I.       Introduction

         The recent behavior of the external sector in a number of countries,

including       the United States, has generated concern among policymakers        and

academics.        In fact, in the last few years policy analyses have increasingly

focused on issues related to the evolution of the trade and current

accounts,       and some proposals aimed at altering some countries external posi-

tions have been intensively discussed.            Perhaps one of the most hotly

debated policy measures consists of the imposition of (temporary) import

tariffs as a way of improving the internal terms of trade and, thus, a

                                   I
country's       current account,

         Historically,    a number of countries have many times resorted to

protectionism as a means         to face external   payments difficulties;   the imposi-

ti   .   of   temporary   impediments to trade --   in   the form of import tariffs or

quotas,       for example -- has in fact been a common prsctice aimed at improving

the current account and/or at changing the behavior of the real exchange

rate.      In particular,     this has been a very common feature of the Latin

American countries, which have recurrently tried to use temporary

protectionist measures as a way to influence the behavior of the external

sector.       Many times, however, these protectionist policies hsve failed to

achieve       their objectives, and in spite of increased levels of import tariffs

the current account balance has not experienced             any improvements.2   Tradi-

tional trade theory has explained this phenomenon claiming that in some

cases the elasticities        of demand for imports and exports can be very low.

These explanations,        however,    fail to recognize   the fact that the current

account basically responds to intettempotal           considerations,   and that for any

policy measures to have an effect on its balance, it necessarily has to have

an impact on the country's savings and/or investment decisions,
        The purpose of this paper is to develop s fully real optimizing

intertemporsl        general equilibrium model to analyze how disturbances                     to terms

of trade     -   - both   internal (due to tariff changes) and external       -   -   affect           the

current sccount.          The analysis focuses on the cases of temporary              import

tariffs and temporary external terms of trade shocks.                 In the Section             IV,


however,     the cases of permanent      disturbances       is also briefly discusaed.                 The

model considers a two-periods economy that produces and consumes three goods

--    exporrables, importablea      and nonrradsbles.        Consumers maximize intertemp-

oral utility, while producers maximize present value of profits.                       In this

three goods setting changes in the equilibrium real exchange rate                      -   -    or

equilibrium relative price of nontradables          -   -   becomes a key intertemporal

channel through which the terms of trade disturbances impacr on the current

account.         Although in recent years   it has become customary to emphasize                     the

intertemporal        nature of the current account, a large number of policy

discussions        have in practice ignored this proposition and have proceeded

along the lines of traditional static textbook models.                 Also, a number of

applied papers have recently discussed the effects of tariffs on current

account behavior without acknowledging          any interremporal       factors.           On the

other hand, many of the papers that have explicitly used an inttrtemporsl

setting have either used ad-hoc assumptions regarding consumers or

producers,       or have only considered a two-goods world, being unable to deal

with the effects of import tariffs on the real exchange rare.3


II.     The Model

        In this section a real general equilibrium intertemporal model of a

small open economy is derived to analyze the way in which different

disturbances affect the current account.           The model is based on Edwards
                                                             3




(1988c) and extends in several directions the intertemporal                                    models of

Svenason and Razin (1983) and Edwards and van Wijnbergen (1986).

        Conaider rhe case of a amall country that produces and conaumes three

goods
         -   - importablea           (N)   ,    exporrables        (X)      and nontradablea         (N)   .    There

are two periods        -   -   the    pcesent           (period I) and the future (period 2)

Foreign borrowing and lending is allowed at the exogenoualy given world

interest rate r*.                  The country faces an intertemporal budget constraint

that atatea that the diacounted aum of the current account balances ia zero.

(Thiaa assumes        that the initial debt commitment                       is zero.)        There are a large

number of producers                and (identical) consumers, and perfect competition

prevails.       Consumers           maximize utility subject to their                     intertemporal budget

constraint, whereas                firma maxithize         profits subject to existing technology

and availability of factora of production.                               In orc    :    to simplify the

exposition in the firat part of the paper it ia assumed that there                                     ia      no

investment.         In Section V.2, however, investment                       is       incorporated into the

analysis.

     Assuming that the utility function ia time separahle, with each

subutility function homothetic and identical, the representative consumer

problem can be stated as follows:

                     max Q(u(cNcMcX); U(CNCMCXH.

subject to:


                                                                           S Wealth,

                                                                                                                    (1)

domestic prices of importable relative to exportablea in periods 1 and                                      2.     q

and    Q     are prices of nontradables relative to exportahles in periods 1 and

2,    and    5*    is the world discount factor equal to                       (l+r*)1.           It is assumed

that imports are subject to a tariff.                              Denoting periods 1 and 2 tariffs as

t     and T,       domestic prices of importables are related to world prices in

the following way (where an asterisk refers to a foreign variable):


                        p —     p*   +   t;         —   '*   + T                                                 (2)


       Wealth is the discounted sum of consumer's income in both periods.

Income, in turn, is given in each period by three components:                                      (1)    income

from labor services rendered to firms;                              (2)   income from the renting of

capital stock that consumers own to domestic firms; and                                    (3)    income obtain-

ed from government transfers.                           These, in turn, correspond to the proceeds

from import tariffs which the government hands back to the public.                                        In this

model, then, as in most of the international                              trade literature, the govern-

ment plays no active role besides imposing import tariffa, and handing their

proceeds back to households                     in a nondiarortionary way.4

        Given the nature of preferences, the consumer optimization process can

be thought of as taking place in two stages.                               First, the consumer decides

how to allocate his(her) wealth across periods.                               Second, he(she) decides how

to distribute           each period (optimal) expenditure across the three goods.                                The

solution to the consumers optimizing problem is conveniently summarized by

the following           intertemporal           expenditure function:5


                         E    — E(a(l,p,q),             It(l,P,Q),Q}.                                            (3)


where       it    and    fl    are exact price indexes for periods                 I   and 2.       Under the
                                                             5




assumptions       of homotheticity and separability these price indexes correspond

to unit expenditure functions (Svensson and Razin, 1983)                                 .   A convenient

property of the expenditure function is that its derivative with respect                                           to


each price is equal to the compensated demand curve for that good.                                          For

instance,       the compensat,d          demand function for nontradables                    in period 1

(where a subindex refers to a partial derivative with respect to that vari-

able) is given by:


                     S    —Em.
                      q     irq

Another important property of expenditure functions is that they are con-

cave.        Moreover,    given our assumption of a time separable utility function,

expenditure       in periods       I   and 2 are substitutes.                    As a result, all intertemp-

oral cross demand effects are positive (i.e.,                            E , E , E    , S   >
                                                                          pQ  qP   qQ    pP
        It is assumed that firms use conventional technology to produce                                       N, X

and     M.     There are three factors of production                     -   -    capital,     labor and natural

resources.        Consequently,          factor price equalization does not hold in either

period.       At this point it is assumed that there                         is    no investment, and that

all factor prices are fully flexible.                            Later, in Section V, however, both

assumptions will be relaxed.                        The producers'     maximization problem can be

stated,       in each period,          in the following way (where                   v   and    V       are vectors

of factors of production;                   w       and       are vectors of their rewards, and                    s.

and     S.    are outputs of good               j    in   periods 1 and 2.)

                                        max profits —                                -
                     period    1
                                                                  (ps÷qs+s)
                                                                                                                   (4)
                     period    2        max Profits —                                -
                                                                  (PSN.4QSNsSx)

The outcome of this optimization process can be conveniently summarized by

two revenue functions          -   -    r       for period 1 and        R        for period 2       -   - which   are

functions      of prices and factor endowments.
                  r —      r(l,p,q;v)                                                            (5)
                  R   —   R(l,P,Q;V)

Revenue functions have a number of useful properties that will be used

                            First, they sre convex.       Second, their partial deriva-

tive with respect to each price is the supply function of
                                                                           of

a psrticulsr factor is equal to the marginal product of that factor (Dixit

and Norman, 1980).

        Equilibrium    in this economy is obtained by the simultaneous solutions

of the consumers       and producers optimization problems,               snd by the require-


ments that the nontrsdable market clears every period end that full

emoloyment prevails.            The' solution to this    problem will determine the
                                                                 rates in

a set of three equations.            The first is the intertemporsl             budget constraint

thst states that the present vslue of income has to equate the present value

of expenditure:

       Since we have assumed that this country can borrow from abroad,

expenditure      in any period can exceed income; that             is,   the current account

can be different from zero.           Moreover,       since in this model it is assumed

that the initial foreign debt is zero, the amount of foreign borrowing is

equal to the stock of foreign debt at the end of period 1.                    However,

equation   (6)    imposes the restriction           that if in period 1 there is a current

account deficit, in period 2 there should be a current.account                   surplus large

enough to pay the debt.

       The current account in period I is defined as income minus expenditure

in that period.

Given that we have assumed that there is no investment, this equation

corresponds      to savings in period          I.   In Section V.2 below, however, the more

general case with investment is briefly discussed.

11.1   Terms of Trade, the Eouilibrium Real Exchange Rate and the Current

       Intertemporal     models of the current account have emphaized that in

order for policy measures          (or other disturbances)         to affect the current

account they shou].d have an effect on savings and/or investment                  decisions.

In models such as the ones developed by Svensson and Razin (1933), Razin and

Svensson (1983) and Edwards and van Wijnbergen (1986), terms of trade

changes have a direct effect on intertemporal consumption decisions.                     The

analyzing          the current accounts reaction to the change in internal terms of

trade,        In order to simplify the discussion and to use a diagramatical

analysis       it is first assumed that initial import tariffs are equal to zero:

t   —   T —   0.        In this way first order income effects can be ruled out.

where (relative to the no-tariff                       case)               increases by more than              .      This

significantly      in period 2.              Although this path is clearly characterized                        by

equilibrium movements             in each period, observers may think that the RER has

moved in the "wrong direction"                   in period 1.

        To sum up, then, formally                it is not      possible to know whether the

equilibrium changes in                q     and Q       as a result of the temporary import

tariff will be positive or negative:11

111.2     The Current Account

        From equation       (9)   it is now possible to find out how the current

account in period 1 will respond to the temporary tariff:

                                  -

                                                             (irEinc   ir
                                                                            q   dt
                                                                                      -   5*irE     ii
                                                                                                  irflQ   dt    (15)



        Where           captures           the reaction of real expenditure                   in period 1       (E)
                 E11

the reaction of period 1 expenditure                         to a change in that period's exact

price index.      The presence of either a                     Einc    or a      E        term in every one of
                                                                                     rr
the RHS terms of equation (15) clearly highlights                               the fact that the tempo-

rary tariff will only affect the current account via intertemporal                                         channels.

The first term in the RHS of equation (15) is the traditional                                       direct effect

and it is positive.           The intuition for this positive effect is straightfor-

ward.     The temporary tariff makes period I consumption relatively more

expensive,      and as a result of this the public substitutes                              consumption        away

from period 1 into period 2, generating an improvement of the current
                                           14




account balance in period I.     The magnitude      of this effect will depend both

on the term Emm      and on the initial share of imports on period               1



expenditure     m.
     The second and third terms on the RHS         of   equation (15) are indirect

effects,   that operate via changes in periods I and 2 equilibrium                   real


exchange rates.      Since, as was established above, the signs of               (dq/dc)      and

(dQ/dt)    cannot be determined a   priori.,    the signs of these two terms in (15)

are generally undetermined,     as will be the sign of the current account

equation (15) as a whole.     However,     the interpretation        of these two indirect

terms is quite straightforward.      If the temporary tariff results in an

equilibrium real appreciation in period 1,          (dq/dt) > 0,        there will be an

additional force towards a current account improvement.                The reasoning        is


again simple.     If the temporary tariff results in a higher equilibrium price

of nontradables in period 1 (i.e., in a real appreciation in               1),       there will

be substitution away from period      1   expenditure,    generating     an improvement in

the current account in that period.         The third term on the RHS relates the

change in period 2's RER to period l's current account.                If as a consequence

of the temporary tariff Q       increases,      there will be a tendency to substi-

tute expenditure     away from period 2 into period       1,    generating forces that

will tend to worsen the current account in period              1.   Notice that the

presence of these two terms involving the real exchange rate introduce

important differences    to the more traditional intertemporal analysis,                    as the

one pioneered by Svensson and Razin (1983).

     The total effect of the temporary import tariff on period l's current

account will depend on the strength of the intertemporal price effects,                       on

the initial expenditure     on imports and nontradables,            and on the effects of

the tariff on the RER vector.       It is possible, however, that as a
                                             15




consequence    of the temporary import tariff the current account will worsen

in the period when the tariffs are imposed, generating a quasi-perverse

effect.    This result suggests that policy makers should be very careful when

imposing temporary      trade restrictions    as a way to improve the current

account.


IV.    External Terms of Trade, Real Exchange Rates and the Current Account

       The discussion in Section III has concentrated       exclusively on

substitution channels, ignoring income effects.         This was possible thanks to

the simplifying assumption      of a zero initial tariff.     However,   in real world

situations    income effects are important and can have an important         influence

on the current account.                                      when income effects
                              There,are two circumstances

will be particularly important:         when there are tariff changes in the pre-

sence of large initial tariffs, and when there are discurbancesto external

terms of trade --      the world   price of importables relative to exportables.

In this section we analyze the way in which the temporary disturbances to

the external      terms of trade affect the current account.     The analyais

focuaes on the role of income effecta and the results obtained are compared

to those of Section III.       As in the previous section,    the discussion

proceeds by steps:       we first inquire how a temporary shock to the external

terms of trade affects the vector of equilibrium         real exchange rates.     1e

then discuss how period 1 current account is affected by this shock.

IV.l    Equilibrium    Real Exchange Rstes

       When there are income effects the diagrammstic apparatus of Section III

cannot be usedto analyze the behavior of equilibrium RERs.           Still sssurning

that    t — T —   0,   a temporsry shock in the external terms of trade will

affect the vector of equilibrium RERs in the following way:12

where   A   is negative and is defined in footnote 11, and where                                       the terms      E

and
      E0    capture the income effects in periods 1 and 2, and are positive.

      A number of important results emerge from these equations.                                        First, due

to the existence of foreign borrowing, a temporary terms of trade shock that

only increases the current international price of imports, will affect both

the current and future equilibrium value of the real exchange rate.                                              Second,

contrary to the case of a temporary tariff, even under the assumption of

substitutability     in demand everywhere, the change in the relative price of

nontradables   cannot be signed.                  The reason for this is, of course, that in

addition to the substitution effects, we now have a (negative) first order

income effect associated to the worsening of the terms of trade.                                          These

income effects are given by the second                         RI1S   term in equations            (16) and (17)

As is usually the case these income effects are proportional                                       to the level of


imports in period 1           (E-r),           Notice that if the income effect dominates

the substitution effect,                (dq/dp*)        and        (dQ/dp*)          can be negative even if

we assume substitutability               in consumption everywhere.                         This is because        the


worsening   of the terms of trade will result in a decline in demand for all

                                  a downward pressure on the relative price
goods in every period, generating

of nontradables in all periods.

       In order to highlight the relation between tariffs and terms of trade

effects,    we can rewrite equation (16) in the following way (a corresponding

expression can be written for equation (1?)):

IV.2   The Current Account

       More than thirty-five years ago Lsursen and Metzler (1950) snd

Harberger (1950), using essentially static models, established conditions

under which terms of trade shocks would worsen the current account.                                                             More

recently,    Obstfeld    (1982), Svensson and Razin (1983), snd Persson and

Svensson (1985) have relooked at the relation between terms of trade shocks

and the current account using models where                                          incercemporsl         considerations           are

explicitly taken into account.                        The specific question asked in these papers

was:    since the current account is equsl to the diffetence between savings

and investment, what are the mechanisms                                       through which a terms of trade shock

will affect these intercemporsl decisions?                                           None of these studies, however,

considered the presence of home goods and the additional effects that terms

of trade shocks can exert via changes in the RER.

       Equation (19) provides an expression for changes in the current account

of period    1   as a result of temporary external terms of trade shocks under

our maintained assumption that                          t — T —               0:

                   42!       -         E                -
                                                                    E               (42-)    -       5*   E     r       (42_)
                   dp*                     its    p                 irs        q     dp*                  itO       Q    dp*

                                                                                   dO
                             -
                                     (E      -   rp )       -   E        it
                                       p                        itO                dpw
                                                      18




        It is clear from equation (19)            ,   that   in the present model                  it is not

possible to know with certainty whether a temporary worsening in the terms

of trade will improve or worsen the current account.                          The first three              R}{S


terms of equation (19) are equivalent                  to those in equation                (15) for the

temporary    tariff case, and their economic interpretation is virtually the

same.     The fourth RHS term in (19)             is equal     to period      1     imports and          s.ce       it

is preceded by a minus sign, it is negative.                       The last       R1-{S    term in (19) cap-

tures the (negative) income effect generated by a deterioration                                    of the terms

of trade, and    is   positive since          (di2/dp*)      < 0    (i.e., the negative terms of

trade shock reduces aggregate           utility and real income)              .      These last two terms

capture    the effects of the reduction               in expenditure in both periods on the

current account in period 1:            the decline in wealth prompted by the terms of

trade shock will generate      forces towards improving the current account in

that period.

     It is interesting to compare the effects of a temporary external terms

of trade shock to those obtained from a permanent disturbance to the world

relative price of imports.          In the case in which               dp* —       dP*           the change in

the current account of period           1   will be:


                 dca                        dca                     - (5*m
                                    —       (_.-)                             E0          fIr)
                        permanent                     temporary


     Notice that, as before, the response of the current account in period I

to a mermanent    terms of trade shock cannot be signed unequivocally.                                    In this

model, even if there is a permanent terms of trade shock we cannot know

priori whether    the first period current account will improve or worsen.

What we do know from (20), however, is that, whatever the sign                                     is,   the

magnitude of the change will be different than in the case of a temporary

shock.    Naturally,    this is due to the fact that the term                                                  is
                                                                                          (6*irEfl)
                                             19




negative.    As a consequence, a permanent negative terms of trade shock will

either worsen the current account in period 1 by more, or improve it by

less, than s temporary shock.         The reason for this is that when the terms of

trade shock is permanent      the negative    income effect affects both periods,

and there is no intertemporsl substitution of expenditure for consumption

smoothing reasons.


V.    Extensions:     Factor Price Rigidities and Investment

      In order to make the exposition clearer, the model presented above has

been derived under a number of simplifying assumptions.                            In this section we

briefly sketch how the model can accommodate two important extensions.

V.1   Factor Price Rigidities

      All of the exercises performed above have assumed that all prices,

including those of factors, are fully flexible.                     This is not always the

case, especially in the developing        countries.           Rigidities in some factor

prices can be easily introduced        into the analysis.                Assume, for example,

that the (real) wage rate       (w)    is fixed at a level                 —
                                                                                ,      lower than
and         where r      is the unconstrained     revenue function in period 1,                     R
      RL
is the unconstrained revenue function in period 2, and                         9     and   L   represent

the labor force in each of those periods.             n       this case, then, we have to

define constrained revenue functions          (8,R)       (see Neary 1985):


                               — max {5Xq5Np5M)                   w2)
                                 si
                                                          -




and


                    a(w,P,Q;K) — max ((5XQ5N÷85M)             -    WL)
                                 S,L


where   5    and    Si   i — X,M,N    refer to output of exportables,                      importables
                                                       20




and nontradables           in periods 1 and 2.           Now the nontradable market equilibrium

conditions need to be replaced by:


                   r       —E.                                                                   (22)
                       q            q

Neary (1905) has shown that under fixed factor prices the following relation

exists between restricted and unrestricted revenue functions:

                           —   r[p,q,.2(w,p,q,k)]       -
                                                            w2(w,p,q,k)                          (23)


where     .2   is the      amount of labor employed in the constrained case.                 Once the

revenue functions have been redefined in this way it is easy to find how the

relative price of nontradables                   reacts to a tariff change in an economy with

fixed real wages.                  After this effect has been found        the way the current

account will react can be derived in the same way as in Sect-ion                         IV above.

        For a number of years trade theorists have been preoccupied with the

relation between tariffs and employment (van Wijnbergen 1987).                           In the model

developed in this paper, if wages are flexible, tariffs have no effects on

aggregate      employment.              However, if there is real wage rigidity tariffs will

indeed have an effect on the level of total employment in the economy.                           For

                                                            in period I to a
example, equation (24) gives the response of labor employed

temporary      tariff in that period:

                               —    -
                                        (2/r) (jq/)-
                                                                 (dq/dt)                            (24)



where the term          (dq/dt)           captures the change in the relative price of          N     in


period 1 to that period's tariff increase.                       Both        and          are
                                                                                   rjq

Rybczinski type terms whose signs will depend on factor intensities.

Depending on the sign of                     (dq/dc)   and on factor intensities in the

different sectors                  (d2/dr)    can be   positive or negative.

V.2     Investment

        Since the discussion presented above has ignored investment, the

current account       in each period is equal to savings in that particular

period.        Investment, however, can be introduced       in a straightforward

fashion.       Once investment is added to the analysis, the intertemporal budget

constraint has to be altered and an equation describing the process govern-

ing investment       decisions has to be added to our system.           Denoting investment

by     I     and aaauming that there is time to build, the intertemporal budget

constraint becomes (where          v    is now the vector of factors of production

other than capital):

                     r(l,p,q;k,v) +     5*R(l,P,Q;k+I,v)   +   t(E-r)    +

                                       - 1(5*) —   E(x(l,p,q),S*fl(l,P,Q),O]              (25)


           Possibly the simplest way to deal with investment is by assuming that
investment decisions are governed by the condition that in equilibrium

Tobin's       "q" equals 1.   Further assuming that investment       goods correspond to

the numeraire       good, the investment equation can be written in the following

way:


                              1                                                           (26)


The manipulation of       (25)    and (26) and the two conditions       for equilibrium    in

the nontraded goods market in period 1 and 2 will now yield the correspond-

ing expressions       for changes in the RERs and the current account.           In this

case the current account equation should be modified by subtracting                 I     to


the RHS of equation (9).

VI.   Concluding Remarks

      In this paper I have developed an intertemporal, fully optimizing model

of a small open economy with nontradable goods to analyze how temporary

terms of trade shocks affect the current account.            The analysis distinguish-


ed between disturbances to the internal terms of trade, generated by tariff

             and disturbances    to the external terms of trade.         In this general

the terms of trade will influence the current account,

analysis of the current account behavior was preceded by

determinants of real exchange rates.             It was shown that in this intertempor-

al setting a temporary tariff will affect the equilibrium real exchange rate

both in the current and future periods. However, it is not possible to know

a priori the direction of this effect.             In fact, it is possible that,

                                               will result in a real
contrary to popular belief, a temporary tariff

The case of more than two periods is analytically straightforward;          the

algebra, however,     is messier.     In that case the scope for unconventional

results is expanded,     since with mote than two periods it is possible to have

intertemporal    complementarity     in demand.   The case of two (large) countries

is slightly more difficult,        since world market clearing conditions   have to
be incorporated.      An interesting feature of the large country case is that

even if tariffs are initially zero, tariff changes will still result in

first order     income effects.     The reason, of course, is that in the large

country case tariff changes will affect the international         terms of trade.
