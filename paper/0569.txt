                                       During the 1970's


                                             ABSTRACT

              A striking fact concerning the relationship between prices and ex-

     change rates during the 1970's has been the dismal performance of the

     simple versions of the purchasing power parity doctrine.            During the 1970's

     short-run changes in exchange rates bore little relationship to short-run

     differentials in national inflation rates and divergences from purchas1ng

     power parities were cumulative.         This paper reviews and analyzes the em-

     pirical record and attempts to explain the causes for the divergences.             It

     examines the hypothesis that the divergences are due to specific develop-

     ments in the    u.S.   dollar and the   u.S.   inflation as well as the hypothesis

     that the divergences are due to large changes in inter-sectoral relative

     prices.     It is shown that even though the simple predictions of the pur-

     chasing power parity doctrine do not hold,         na~ional   price levels have been

     linked to each other.       It is then argued that exchange rates, like other

     asset prices, have been highly volatile since they are more sensitive to

     expectations about the future than are national price           1eve~s.   Therefore,

     during    pe~iods   that are dominated by events which alter expectations, departures

     from purchasing power parities are likely to be the rule rather than the

     exception.    The paper concludes with the policy implications.           It is argued

     that a policy of intervention in the foreign exchange market which ensures.

     that exchange rates conform with purchasing power parities would be a mis-

     taken course of policy, and that reducing costly and unnecessary variations

    , in exchange rates requires the adoption of more stable and predicta!::le patterns

    of policies.

1.   Introduction

      One of the striking facts concerning the relationship between       pr~ces

and exchange rates during the 1970 8 s has been the dismal performance of

the predictions of the simple versions of the purchasing power parity doc-

trine (PPP).   That doctrine in its "absolute version" states that the

equilibrium exchange rate between domestic and foreign currencies equals

the ratio of domestic to foreign price levels.        The "relative version" of

the doctrine relates equilibrium changes in exchange rates to changes in

the ratio of domestic to foreign prices.        During the 1970's short-run changes

in exchange rates bore little relationship to short-run differentials in

national inflation rates and, frequently, divergences from purchasing power

parities have been cumulative.

      This paper reviews and analyzes the empirical record of       exch~nge   rates

and prices during the 1970's and the analysis is based on the experience of

the Dollar/Pound, the Dollar/French Franc and the Dollar/OM exchange rates.

Section 2 presents the evidence on PPP during the 1970's and contrasts it

with the evidence from the 1920's--a period during which the doctrine held

up reasonably well.        This analysis is relevant for assessing whether the

flexible exchange rate system was successful in providing national economies

with an added degree of insulation from foreign shocks, and whether it pro-

vided policyrnakers with an added instrument for the conduct of macroeconomic

policy.   The evidence regarding deviations from purchasing power parities is

also relevant for determining whether there is a case for managed float.

Section 3 attempts    to    explain what went wrong with the performance of the

doctrine during the 1970' s.       It examines the hypothesis that the departures

from PPP are a U.S. phenomenon, as well as the hypothesis that the departures


                                           1
                                          2


are due to large changes in inter-sectoral relative price changes within

the various economies.    Given that the predictions of the simple versions

of PPP do not hold up, Section 4 proceeds in examining the question of

whether national price levels have been independent of each other.         Section

5 addresses the question of whether exchange rates and national price levels

are comparable and whether in principle one should have expected them to be

closely linked to each other.     The   ma~n   point that is being emphasized is

that there is an important intrinsic difference between exchange rates and

national price levels which stems from the "asset market theory" of exchange

rate determination.   This theory    imp1~es    that the exchange rate, like the

prices of other assets,   is much more sensitive to expectations concerning

future events than national price levels and as a result, in periods which

are dominated by "news" which alter expectations, exchange rates are likely

to be much more volatile than· national price levels, and depa!tures from PPP

are likely to be the rule rather than the excepticn.         Finally, Section 6 con-

cludes the paper with some policy implications.



2.   Purchasing Power Parities:     The Evidence

       The relationship between exchange rates and prices that is summarized

by the PPP doctrine is one of the oldest and the most controversial relation-

ships in the theory of exchange rates.         The intellectual origins of the

doctrine [which are analyzed in Frenkel (1978)] can be traced back to the

writings of Wheatley and Ricardo in the early part of the 19th century and

its more recent revival owes much to Cassel's writings mainly during the

.1920's.   Much of the controversy concerning the usefulness of the PPP doctrine

is due to the fact that it does not specify the precise mechanism by which

exchange rates are linked to prices nor does it specify the precise conditions
                                            3


that must be satisfied for the doctrine to be correct.         Rather, the PPP

doctrine may be viewed as a short-cut; it specifies a relationship between

two variables without providing the details of the process which brings

about such a relationship and, therefore, it should not be viewed as a theory

of exchange rate determination.

        2.1    Empirical Framework

        The PPP relationship can be written as

(1)           tn St = a + btn(p/p*)t + u
                                        t

where St and (P/P*)t denote, respectively, the exchange rate (defined as the

price of foreign exchange in terms of domestic currency), and the ratio of

domestic to foreign price indices (with an asterisk denoting quantiti.es per-

taining to the foreign country) and where u         denotes an error term.      The
                                                t
formulation in equation (1) corresponds to the absolute version of·PPP.               The

corresponding relative version of PPP can be written as



where. 8 denotes the first difference operator and where v          denotes an error
                                                                t

term.

        From the empirical viewpoint several issues may be raised:         (i) what

price index should be used in equations (1)-(2)?         (ii) are the data consistent

with the hypothesis that b=l?        (iii) is the constant term in the relative

version of PPP zero as implied by equation (2)?         Further refinements would

also examine whether the coefficients on domestic and foreign prices are

equal to each other (in absolute value) as implied by the specification of

equations (1)-(2).       These questions are examined below using     month~y   data

for the U.S., the U.K., France and Germany.         To allow for a simultaneous

determination of prices and exchange rates, equations (1)-(2) are estimated
                                          4


using a two-stage least squares estimation procedure.

        2.2   The Evidence From the 1920's

        In order to fix ideas and to proviae perspective for the evaluation of

the empirical record of the 1970's, it is useful to start with a brief review

of the performance of PPP during the flexible exchange rates period of the

1920's.       The experience with flexible exchange rates during the 1920's (which

was terminated with the return of Britain to gold in mid-1925), has proven

to be extremely important in shaping current thinking about a variety of

issues concerning the economics of flexible exchange rates and has been

critical for the growth of popularity of the PPP doctrine.        That period in-

eluded experiences under hyperinflationary conditions (the German hyperinflation)

as well as under "normal" conditions (based on the experience of Britain, ti'e

u.s.   and France).

       Estimates of equation (1) for the 1920's using alternative price indices
                           1
are reported in Table 1.       These estimates indicate that in most cases the

data are consistent with the hypothesis that the elasticity of the exchange

rate with respect to the price ratio is about unity.2         In assessing these

results it is important to recall that the estimates are based on monthly

data and that short-run deviations from PPP may reflect the fact that not

all markets adjust at the same speed.         On the whole the results illustrate

the main usefulness of the PPP doctrine.         It provides a guide to the general

trend of exchange rates and prices and it emphasizes that, as a first approxi-

mation, policies which affect the trend of domestic (relative to        fore~gn)


prices, are likely to affect the exchange rate in the same manner.



        lThis paragraph draws on Frenkel (1980a).

      2In applying equation (2) to the hyperinflation period it was assumed
that the variations in P/P* were completely dominated by variations in German
prices so that the foreign price could be viewed as being fixed. For further
evidence and tests and for the data sources see Frenkel (1980a).

      2.3   The Evidence from the 1970's

      In a recent paper dealing with inflation and unemployment, Robert J.

Gordon (1976), analyzed the reactions of a hypothetical modern-day Rip van

Winkle who had become well acquainted with the earlier literature but who

only recently awoke from a decade-long nap.     It is interesting to examine

the results of an analogous experiment in the context of PPP.       Suppose that

Rip van Winkle, who was well acquainted with the data reported in the previous

section, went to sleep in 1925 to be awoken in the 1970's.      Would his human

capital of the 1920's vintage be obsolete?    This question is of special

interest since world capital markets have become much more integrated, the

role of "real" shocks and "surprises" in the 1970's have become much It¥:)re

important, views about the role of government in the conduct of macroeconomic

policies have changed, the roles of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade

as well as the degree of exchange rate management have been altered and

finally, the International Monetary Fund has been created.

      Tables 2 and 3 report the estimates of equations (1) and (2) for the

IOOnthly Dollar/Pound, the Dollar/French Franc and the Dollar/German Mark

exchange rates using wholesale and cost of living price indices.       As may be

seen the results are extremely poor and the estimates are extremely imprecise.

For the absolute version of PPP (Table 2) the coefficients on the price ratios

are significant only in the equations pertaining to the Dollar/OM exchange

rate, and for the relative version of PPP (Table 3) the slope coefficient is

again insignificant.   It is noteworthy,   howcver~   that (as expected) the

constant terms in that table do not differ significantly from zero.       The

'poor performance of these versions of PPP during the 1970's is augmented by

the fact that in some cases the estimates do not remain stable over the

sample period.   This instability is especially exhibited in the Dollar/Pound

3.     What Went Wrong?

         From the comparison of the evidence from the 1920's with those from

the 1970's it is obvious that if Rip van Winkle were to predict the results

of Table 2 from those of Table 1 his predictions would have failed dramatically.

What is responsible for this failure?

         3.1   Are the Departures from PPP a   u.s.   Phenomenon?

         In starting to account for the collapse of PPP in the 1970's it is first

relevant to note that all the regressions in Tables 2, 3 and 4 involve the

u.s.   dollar exchange rate and the U.S. price index.        In order to examine

whether this fact plays an important role in yielding the poor results, the

PPP equations were re-estimated for the various exchange rates which do not

involve the     u.s.   dollar or the U.S. price level, i.e., for the Pound/OM and

the Franc/OM exchange rates.       These results are reported in Table 5.     As

may be seen the results here are much superior.          Except for the wholesale

price indices in the Franc/OM regression, all the coefficients are highiy

significant and the elasticities of the exchange rate with respect to the

various price indices do not differ significantly from unity.

        What accounts for the vast difference in the performance of PPP among

the various currencies?       One explanation can be made in terms of the general



      3Further evidence on the empirical record of the PPP doctrine can be
found in the various papers in the May issue of the Journal of International
Economics, 8, no. 2, 1978, and for surveys see Officer (1976) and Katseli-
Papaefstratiou (1979).

presumption that due to transport cost, PPP is expected to hold better

among the neighboring European countries than among each of these countries

and the U. 5.      A second explanation can be made in terms of changes in com-

mercial policies and non-tariff barriers to trade which have been more

stable within Europe than between Europe and the U.5.            A third argument

which was put forward in another context by Robert J. Gordon (1977), em-

phasizes the unique effects of the various phases of the U.S. price controls

and their gradual removal during the first half of the 1970's.            A fourth

argument could be made in terms of the effects of institutional agreements

like the snake and later on like the European Monetary System on the degree

of the intra-European flexibility of exchange rates.

       3.2      Changes in Relative Prices

       .The formulation of the PPP doctrine in equations (1) and (2) did not

specify which price index shouJ.d be used in the computation.            Of course, when
                               -
the structure of relative prices in the economy remains stable, as is likely

to be the case when most of the shocks are of a monetary origin, the choice

of the price index is immaterial.       On       the other hand, when there are real

shocks which alter relative prices, the choice of the price index becomes

crucial.

       To illustrate, suppose that the domestic and the foreign aggregate

price levels are a linear homogeneous (Cobb-Douglas) function of the prices

of non-traded goods, P ' and of traded goods, P ' like in equations (3)-(4):
                      N                        T

where 6 and 6* denote domestic and foreign expenditure shares on non-traded
                                           8


goods.     From (3) and (4) the ratio of the prices of traded goods can be

written as



(5)



Equation (5) links the relative price of traded goods to the ratio of the

price levels through terms which summarize the internal price structures in

the two economies.       Suppose now that the formulation of purchasing power

parities in equations (1) and (2) applies only to traded goods (so that S

equals (PT/P
               T) plus   an error term).   Using equation (5) and adding a constant

term yields




or, assuming for expository purposes, that 6=6*, this becomes


(7)


A comparison of equation (7) with (1) reveals that when the internal relative

price structure remains stable, its neglect would not affect the relationship

between the exchange rate and the ratio of aggregate price indices and its

only influence would be confined to the estimate of the constant term.          If,

however, relative price structures do vary, then it is crucial to incorporate

them explicitly into the ppp equations, and their omission introduces a

specification bias.

         Since the estimates in the previous tables were obtained from regressions

employing aggregate price indices, it is important to examine whether relative

price structures remained stable during the sample period.        To examine this

question it is first noted that the cost: of living index contains relatively
                                       9


more non-traded commodities than the wholesale price index.       It is likely

therefore that when there are large changes in internal relative prices,

these changes would be reflected in changes in the ratio of the cost of

living to the wholesale price index.

      Table 6 reports the estimates of regressions of cost of living indices

on the wholesale price indices (as well as regressions of their rates of

change) for the U.S., the U.K., France and Germany.      As may be seen in all

cases the elasticity of the cost of living inflation with respect to the

wholesale price inflation is statistically significant but smaller than unity,

while the elasticity of the level of the cost of living with respect to the

wholesale price level is about unity in the U.S. and the U.K., is somewhat

higher than unity in Germany and is about zero in France.       These results

indicate that the internal relative prices--as measured by the relationship

between the cost of living and the wholesale price indices--have not changed

much in the U.S. and the U.K., they have changed somewhat in Germany and

have changed dramatically in France.       This last observation may account for

the poor performance of the PPP equation which related the Franc/DM exchange

rate to the ratio of the wholesale price indices in Table 5.

      The general pattern of the internal price ratios is described in

Figures (1)-(4) which show a scatter of monthly observations of the two

price indices for the U.S., the U.K., Germany and France.       As is evident

from the first two scatter diagrams the changes in relative prices have not

been pronounced; the scatter for Germany reveals some degree of relative

price variations while the scatter for France shows an extraordinary degree

'of fluctuations in the internal relative prices.      Since these fluctuations

have been so large, the information of Figure 4 is supplemented by Figure 5

which presents a time series of the two price indices.       In view of these large

changes in the internal relative prices the collapse of PPP which was reported

in Section 2 is much less surprising.



4.    Are National Price Trends Independent of Each Other?

       The two versions of the PPP doctrine relate the exchange rate to the

ratio of national price levels and changes in the exchange rate to inflationary

differentials.        As was argued above these relationships are likely to hold

when the internal relative price structures remain relatively stable, as

would be the case when the predominant source of shocks is of a monetary

origin.    If, however, relative prices do change--as they should when the pre-

dominant source of shocks is of a real origin--then the simple PPP versions

which use aggregate price levels are not likely to hold.        It is possible,

however, that even though the exchange rate does not move in full conformity

with the ratio of national price levels and changes in the exchange rate do

not conform fUlly with inflationary differentials, the two national price

levels expressed in terms of the same currency do move in conformity with

each other.

        Equation (8) formulates this idea which has been suggested by John F. O.

Bilson (1980):

(8)        tn P       = a + atn{SP*)t + €t
                  t

where the variable Sp* converts the foreign price index p* to domestic

currency units.        While the traditional formulation may fail due to changes

in relative prices, these changes in relative prices may be less important

in determining the trends of national price levels (expressed in common cur-

rency units) which are dominated by monetary conditions.        This distinction may

be potentially important for the applications of monetary models of exchange

rates [e.g., the models described in Frenkel and Johnson (1978)] since in many

of these models Sp* is frequently being substituted for P.

       Table 7 reports estimates of equation (8) for the various national

price levels (converted to common currency units) using the cost of living

and the wholesale price indices.     The contrast between these results and the

corresponding traditional PPP estimates of Table 2 is immediate.       In Table 7

all the coefficients (except for the U.S./France wholesale price index) are

highly significant, and analogous to the results in Table 5 the link between

the price levels within Europe is stronger than the link between the price

levels of the u. S. and the European countries.



"5.   Exchange Rates and National Price Levels are Not Comparable

       The analysis in the previous sections presumed that when inter-sectoral

relative price structures remain stable and when there are no significant

changes in tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade and in the degree of

capital market integration, the purchasing power parity doctrine should hold

even for the short run.      The major point that is being made in this section

is that the modern approach to the analysis of exchange rates implies that

there is a fundamental difference between the characteristics of exchange

rates and those of national price levels.      This difference yields a presumption

that, at least in the short run, exchange rate fluctuations would not be

matched by   corresF~nding   fluctuations of aggregate price levels.

       The central insight of the modern approach to the analysis of exchange

rates is the notion that the exchange rate, being the relative price of two

durable assets (monies), can be best analyzed within a framework that is

appropriate for the analysis of asset prices.      A key characteristic of the

price of an asset is its strong dependence on expectations concerning the
future.    In an efficient market for assets, new information concerning the
                                       12


 future is reflected immediately in current prices and thus precluding un-

 exploited profit opportunities from arbitrage.   The strong dependence of

 current prices on expectations about the future is unique to the determination

 of durable asset prices which are traded in organized exchange; it does not

 characterize to the same extent the determination of prices of non-durable

 commodities (like fresh fish).   The strong dependence of asset prices on

 expectations also implies that during periods that are dominated by "news"

 which induce frequent changes in expectations, asset prices exhibit large

 fluctuations.   Since exchange rates are viewed as asset prices, they will

 also exhibit a relatively large degree of volatility during periods that are

 dominated by "news" which alter expectations.    Since by definition the "news"

 cannot be predicted on the basis of past information, it is clear

. that by and large the fluctuations of exchange rates are unpredictable.

        In contrast to these characteristics of exchange rates, aggregate price

 indices are not expected to reveal such a degree of volatility since they re-

 flect the prices of goods and services which are less durable and therefore

 are likely to be less sensitive to the "news" which alter expectations about

 the future.

        This distinction between commodity prices and asset prices is fundamental

 for interpreting the deyiations from PPP.    As is well-known, changes in

 commodity prices are serially correlated while changes in exchange rates are

 not.   The "stickiness" exhibited by commodity prices need not reflect any

 market imperfection but rather it may reflect the cost of price adjustment

 which results in finite nominal contracts.    Likewise it may reflect the

-results of a confusion between nominal and real shocks or between permanent

 and transitory shocks.   This, in addition to the fact that commodity price

 indices are less sensitive to changes in expectations imply that when there

 are frequent and significant changes in expectations as was certainly the case

during the 1970's, exchange rates adjust immediately while commodity prices

do not.   Exchange rates reflect expectations about future circumstances

while prices reflect more present and past circumstances as-they are embedded

in existing contracts.    This difference implies that large fluctuations of

exchange rates are likely to be associated with large deviations from pur-

chasing power parities and these large deviations reflect the intrinsic
                                                 4
difference between commodity and asset prices.       with this perspective the

recent volatility of exchange rates and the associated departures from the

predictions of the PPP doctrine are much less of a     mystery~   they reflect the

volatile character of the 1970's which witnessed great turbulence in the world

economy and large volumes of real shocks like the oil embargo, supply shocks,

commodity booms and shortages, shifts in the demands for money and differential

productivity growth.     In addition, the 1970's witnessed great uncertainty

about the future course of political and economic events which induced sharp and

frequent changes in expectations.

6.   Conclusions and Policy Implications

      This paper analyzed the collapse of PPP during the 1970's.        One of the

points made in this paper was that there are circumstances during which

large deviations from PPP are to be expected and that the 1970's presented

an example of such circumstances.    Given the expected large deviations what

is left of the purchasing power parity theory and what role should it play

in guiding policy?     It is clear that it should not be viewed as a theory of

exchange rate determination since it specifies a relationship between two

endogenous variables without providing the details about the processes which

bring it about.   It is also clear that it does not provide a guide for day-to-

day or month-to-month fluctuations of exchange rates.       Further, when the

economy experiences real structural changes which require adjustments of

relative prices, purchasing power parities may not be satisfied even in the

long run.   Its usefulness is in providing a guide as to the general trend

of exchange rates in particular in circumstances where the main shocks under-

lying the trend are of a monetary origin.     As   for the conduct of macroeconomic

policy, it serves as an important reminder that the exchange rate and the

price level cannot be divorced from each other and that policies which affect

the trend of domestic (relative to foreign) prices are likely to affect the

exchange rate in a   si~ilar   manner.

      Emphasis on the fact that exchange rates and prices are both endogenous

variables is important in view of the recent allegations that flexible ex-

change rates have been inflationary.     Both exchange rates and prices respond

to the same set of shocks and both can be influenced by a similar set of

policies.   The fact that exchange rates adjust faster than commodity prices

reflect the known phenomenon that asset markets clear relatively quickly.

This fact does not imply that as an economic matter the chain of causality

runs from exchange rates to prices.

      The recognition that exchange rate fluctuations reflect the underlying

circumstances rather than creating them is fundamental.       It implies that,

for a given conduct of macroeconomic policy the basic choice is not between

costly turbulence and free tranquility but rather between alternative outlets

to the underlying turbulence.      If the source of evil was the variability of

exchange rates, then pegging the rate would have been the simple and the
                                       15


feasible solution.    The experience with the Bretton Woods system indicates

that this is not the case.    One could argue, however, that the obligation

to peg the rate would alter the conduct of policy by introducing discipline.

Experience suggests, however, that national governments are unlikely to be

disciplined by the exchange rate regime; rather, the exchange rate regime is

more likely to adjust to whatever discipline national governments choose to

have.

        One of the relevant questions that remains is whether exchange rate

fluctuations during the 1970's have been excessive.      It should be obvious

that in order to answer this question we need a standard for comparison.        If

a relevant yardstick is the extent of variation of national price levels,

then indeed exchange rates have fluctuated excessively.     For example, from

June 1973 through JUly 1979, the average absolute monthly percentage

change of the Dollar/Pound, the Dollar/French Franc and the Dollar/OM ex-

change rates exceeded two percent per month.    In comparison the average

absolute monthly percentage change for wholesale and consumer price indices

and for the ratios of national price levels were only about half that of

the corresponding exchange rates.    As a result, adherence to a narrow inter-

pretation of the purchasing power parity theory results in the conclusion

that exchange rate variations were excessive.      The asset market approach

suggests, however, that a relevant yardstick should be the variations of

other asset prices rather than commodity prices.      During the same period the

average absolute percentage change in. the various stock market indices has

been about twice the corresponding changes in exchange rates.      By this standard

'exchange rates have not fluctuated excessively.

        With this interpretation it seeIDS that intervention in the foreign

exchange market which ensures that exchange rates conform with purchasing
                                        16


power parities would be a mistaken course of policy.    If commodity prices do

not adjust fully in response to exogenous shocks, it seems that a large

adjustment of exchange rates serves a useful role since it provides the out-

let for the pressure which otherwise would have been reflected in commodity

prices.

      Government policy can, however, make a positive contribution to reducing

costly and unnecessary variations of exchange rates by adopting more stable

and predictable patterns of policies.    This is particularly relevant in the

case of exchange rates since as was argued before, current exchange rates

reflect expectations concerning future events and future policies.    Current

policy instability may induce expectations for future policy instability and,

thereby, have a magnified effect on current exchange rates.   When policies

are erratic and unpredictable, monetary policy exerts real side effects.      Put

differently! money is felt when it is out of order; when it is in order it

only serves as a veil over the real equilibrium of the economy.    This unique

property of money is best summarized by the following quotation from John

Stuart Mill:

      There cannot, in short, be instrinsically a more insignificant
      thing, in the economy of society, than money; except in the
      character of a contrivance for sparing time and labour. It is a
      machine for doing quickly and commodiously, what would be done,
      though less quickly and commodiously, without it: and like many
      other kinds of machinery, it only exerts a distinct and indepen-
      dent influence of its own when it gets out of order. (J. S. Mill,
      Principles of Political Economy, 5th edition, 1862, Book III,
      Chap. VII, § 3• )

The role of policy is to ensure that money is in order and this can be achieved

by following a predictable stable course of policy.    Following such a course

will not eliminate variations of exchange rates nor will it ensure that ex-

change rates conform with the predictions of the purchasing power parity theory.

It will, however, reduce some of the unnecessary and costly fluctuations which

are induced by unstable and erratic policies.
