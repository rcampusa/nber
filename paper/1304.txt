                   PECUNIARY AND MARKET MEDIATED EXTERNALITIES:

                     TOWARDS A GENERAL THEORY OF THE WELFARE

                       INFORMATION AND INCOMPLETE MARKETS




       This paper presents a simple but quite general framework for analyzing

the impact of informational externalities.          By identifying the traditional

pecuniary effect of these externalities which nets out,         the paper greatly

simplifies the problem of determining when tax interventions can be Pareto

improving.    Ii some cases it also leads to simple tests, based on readily

observable indicators of the efficacy of a particular tax policy.              The

framework of the paper is used to analyze adverse selection, sigri111ng,

moral hazard,    incomplete contingent claim markets and queue rationing

equilibria.

   What is surpxising about this result is its simplicity. The fact that an increase in 0 involves the

sale ci higher quality inputs by same households suggests the neth for a careful balancing ci the
increased cost ci these sales by avner households against the benefits to purchasers. Yet no such

alculation is iIIIpIiS by equation (14). The nessary balancing ci the costs ci selling higher
quality itcns is being done by ac households in the prrss ci madmizing utility. Changes in I
vbich result fran dianges in x 1! by owner households (in response to changes in the- market price)

are part ci the pecuniary imrct ci the original tax change. As such, they net ost. Ths accounts

for the simple farm ci the final pdicy prescription.

   Finally, it should be neted that there is, at least in pripl; an thservahle basis far judging the
