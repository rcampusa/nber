                       A Note on Optimal Public Enforcement with
                            Settlements and Litigation Costs




                                       ABSTRACT




                This note reexamines the theory of optimal public
           enforcement when litigation costs are incurred if the
           defendant is prosecuted at trial, and when an out-of-court
           settlement is possible. Using a numerical example, it is
           shown that settlements and litigation costs can
           substantially alter the optimal system of public
           enforcement. It is also shown that failing to take these
           considerations into account can significantly lower the
           achievable level of social welfare.

 1.   Introduction

        Economic analyses of optimal public enforcement examine the enforcement

 authority's choice of the probability of detection and the level of the

 penalty.[l] The authority's problem is to choose the probability and the

 penalty so as to maximize social welfare. Two implicit assumptions are made

 in these analyses: first, that all violators who are detected are prosecuted

 at trial; and second, that the prosecutor's and the defendant's litigation

costs are zero.[2] Each of these assumptions is substantially contrary to

fact.

        The overwhelming majority of all violators who are caught are not

prosecuted at trial, but rather settle out of court. For example, over ninety

percent of all criminal cases are disposed of in this way through the process

of "plea bargaining;" similarly, most civil cases brought by administrative

agencies are disposed of without resorting to trial. [3]

        To some extent, the propensity to settle out of court is due to the high

cost of litigating cases that go to trial. In private civil litigation, there

is evidence that the parties' litigation costs can exceed the amount received

by a successful plaintiff. [4] Litigation costs associated with public

enforcement also are likely to be high, in part because of the high standard

of proof that often must be met (as, for example, in criminal prosecutions).

      The contribution of this note is to incorporate these two "real world"

facts- -settlements and litigation costs- - into the model of optimal public

enforcement, and to examine their implications for the choice of the

probability of detection and the level of the penalty. A simple model of

public enforcement with these features is presented in section 2. Some

numerical calculations are then performed in section 3.[5)


                                          1
2. The Model[6J

     Individuals are assumed to be risk neutral and identical, except for the

private gain they obtain from engaging in an activity which imposes harm on

others. If an individual undertakes the activity, he faces some probability

of being caught. If he is caught and the case goes to trial, he will incur

litigation costs and, with some probability, will be found liable and have to

pay a fine.    (The model easily could incorporate nonmonetary sanctions.)

Alternatively, the individual may settle out of court. An individual will

engage in the activity if his private gain exceeds his expected payment- -the

sum of the expected defense cost (i.e., the defense cost times the probability

that he is caught and the case goes to trial), the expected fine (the fine

times the probability that he is caught and loses at trial), and the expected

out-of-court settlement (the settlement amount times the probability that he

is caught and the case settles out of court).

     Both the probability of an out-of-court settlement and the amount of the

settlement are assumed to be exogenous.[7] This assumption is made in order

to focus on the effects of these considerations on the optimal probability of

detection and on the optimal level of the penalty.

     The following notation will be used to describe the individual's problem

more precisely:

     g    — gain to an individual from engaging in the activity,

     h(.) —   probability   density of gain among individuals,

     g'
          — maximum possible gain,

     p    —   probability that an individual who engages in the
              activity will be caught,

     r    —   probability   that an individual who is caught goes
              to trial,


                                            2
                —
        q           probability that an individual who goes to trial is
                    found liable,

        f       —   fine   collected from an individual who is found liable,

        b       —   cost   of defense if an individual goes to trial,

        s       — settlement paid by an individual who settles out of
                    court.

        Given this notation, an individual will undertake the activity if

 (1)                                         g >   E(p,f),
where

 (2)                                 E(p,f) —   p[r(qf+b)+(l-r)s].
 In other words, an individual will engage in the harmful activity if his gain

exceeds his expected payment, E(.). His expected payment can be decomposed

 into three parts: the expected fine, prqf; the expected defense cost, prb; and

the expected settlement, p(l-r)s.

        Also, let:

        N(p,f) — number of individuals who engage in the activity,

        e           —   external   cost or harm from engaging in the activity,

        n(p,f) — number of individuals who are caught (—
                                                                     pN(p,f)).
        There are two types of costs borne by the public enforcement authority- -

detection      costs and prosecution costs. Let:

        c(p,N) —        cost to the enforcement authority of catching
                        fraction p of those individuals who engage in
                        the activity.

Detection costs are assumed to be increasing in both p and N (c1(.) >             0,   c2(.)
> 0).       Thus, for example, if the number of violations is one thousand, it is

more costly to catch one hundred violators (with p — . 1) than it is to catch

ten violators (with p —            .01).   And it is more expensive to catch 10 percent of

a million violators than it is to catch 10 percent of a thousand violators.


                                                     3
Finally, let:

        a     = cost to the enforcement authority of prosecution. [81

It is assumed that there is no cost to the enforcement authority of imposing

fines.

        Social welfare equals the sum of the gains to individuals who engage in

the activity less the harm they cause, less the cost of catching them, and

less the private and public costs associated with trials:


(3)      W — J _g'gh(g)dgeN(p,f)  -           -
                                                  c(p,N(p,f))   -
                                                                    n(p,f)r(a+b).
               E(p,f)

        The problem of the enforcement authority is to maximize social welfare,

W, through the choice of the fine, f, and the probability of detection, p.

The optimal values of the variables will be indicated by asterisks.

        Since an individual cannot pay more than his wealth, the maximum

effective fine equals the individual's wealth less his cost of defense. If

individuals are risk neutral and fines are socially costless to impose (as is

assumed here), it is well known that the optimal fine equals the maximum fine;

thus,

(4)                                       f*=y-b,
where,

        y      —   initial wealth     of individuals.

The reason for this result is simple. If the fine were less than y-b, the

fine could be raised and the probability of detection lowered so as to keep

the expected payment of violators, E(.), the same. Social welfare would rise

because the cost of catching individuals would fall.

        Given that f* —   y-b,   the optimal probability of detection is determined

by maximizing social welfare (3) with respect to p. Assuming an interior


                                                   4
solution, the resulting first-order condition can be written as:[9J

         [e-E(.)}[-dN(.)/dp} —
(5)
                 {cl(.)-c2( .)   [-dN(.)/dp])   +   [dn(.)/dp]r(a+b).
The left-hand side of (5) is the marginal benefit of raising the probability

of detection, which equals the reduction in the number of individuals engaging

in the activity, -dN(.)/dp, times the harm caused by each net of their gains,

e-E(.).[lO] The right-hand side is the marginal cost of raising the

probability, which has two elements--detection costs and litigation costs.

The terms in braces represent the effects on detection costs. The first term,

c1(.), is the direct cost of raising the probability of detection, holding

constant the number of individuals engaging in the activity. The second term

in braces represents the savings in detection costs due to a reduction in the

number of individuals who undertake the activity. The final term is the

effect on litigation costs associated with the change in the number of

violators who are caught.[ll]

      It is easy to see that settlements and litigation costs affect the

optimal system of public enforcement. Since f* — y-b, the optimal fine falls

as the defendant's litigation costs rise.

      The effects of settlements and litigation costs on the optimal

probability are less obvious because a number of terms in the first-order

condition, (5), are affected. Everything else equal, the possibility of a

settlement lowers the expected payment, E(.), of an individual who engages in

the harmful activity, assuming that the settlement amount will be less than

his expected payout at trial (including his litigation costs). Thus,

settlements will tend to increase the number of individuals engaging in the

harmful activity, N(.), and the number who are caught, n(.). The possibility


                                            5
of settlement also will have the effect of decreasing average litigation

costs, r(a+b). Similarly, an increase in the litigation costs of the

defendant will increase the expected payment of someone who engages in the

harmful activity, which will reduce the number of individuals who choose to do

so. Also, an increase in the prosecutor's litigation costs will have a direct

effect on average litigation costs.

     When all of these factors are taken into account, it is not clear whether

settlements and litigation costs will tend to increase or decrease the optimal

probability of detection, or by how much.



3. An Example

     Although the preceding discussion shows that the optimal system of public

enforcement depends on the likelihood that a case will be settled and on the

costs of litigation if the case is tried, it does not suggest the magnitudes

involved. In this section, calculations of the optimal probability of

detection and optimal fine are performed using a special case of the more

general model. It will be shown that the fact that most cases settle and that

there are substantial litigation costs can significantly change the optimal

system of public enforcement. The importance of taking these considerations

into account will be measured by comparing the level of social welfare

achieved under optimal public enforcement to the level of social welfare that

would result if the probability and fine were set under the incorrect

assumption that all cases are litigated and that litigation costs are zero.

     It will be assumed in this section that the probability density of gains,

h(.), is uniform between 0 and g', and that the cost of detection function,

c(p,N), is given by c1p + c2N, where c1 and c2 are positive constants.[12]


                                        6
 Given these assumptions, it is not difficult to show that the optimal

 probability of detection is:


 (6)         p      (l/g')[(dE(.)/dp)(e+c2)] -

                      (l/g')(dE(.)/dp)[(dE/dp) -
                                                       [c1+r(a-i-b)]
                                                           2r(a+b)]
 where

 (7)              dE(.)/dp —   rqy   +   (l-r)s   ÷ rb(l-q).

        Calculations were made using plausible values for the parameters given in

 equations (6) and (7). Specifically, let:

       y (wealth)                                      — $20,000,

        g' (maximum gain)                                  $12,000,

       e (harm)                                        — $ 5,000,

       q (probability of liability at trial) — 0.5,

       c1 (marginal cost of p)[l3]                     —   $1,500,
       c2 (marginal cost of N)                         — $1,200,

       r (probability of trial)                        — 0.3.

While it is likely that fewer than 30 percent of all cases go to trial, this

choice of r reflects the fact that a large number of cases are settled just

prior to trial, after substantial expenditures by both prosecutor and

defendant.

       In addition, let:

       a (prosecutor's costs)                          — $2,500,

       b (defendant's costs)                           — $2,500.

As noted in the introduction, there is evidence that the combined litigation

costs of the parties may exceed the victim's damages. The implicit assumption

here is that these values are equal.

       For the reasons given in section 2, the optimal fine is set such that the

fine plus the defendant's cost of litigation equals his income.        Thus,

                                                  7
     f* (optimal fine)                       — y   -    b — $17,500.

The settlement amount is assumed to be midway between the prosecutor's

expected winnings at trial net of his litigation costs, and the defendant's

expected loss at trial including his litigation costs. Thus,

     s (settlement amount)                   —   qf    +   .5(b-a) — $8,750.
Finally, from (6),

     p* (optimal probability)                —   .17.
Using the assumed values of the parameters and the optimal values of p and f,

the resulting level of social welfare is $571.

     Now suppose that the probability and fine are set under the mistaken

assumptions that all cases go to trial and that litigation costs are zero. In

other words, suppose one were to choose p and f to maximize social welfare

assuming r — 1 and a — b — 0.   This would lead to a fine of $20,000 (although

in fact the injurer would not be able to pay this much) and a probability of

.31, nearly double the optimal probability of .17. In addition, actual social

welfare (using the true values of r, a, and b) would fall from $571 to $517,

more than a 9 percent loss. Thus, failing to take into account the

possibility of settlement and the presence of litigation costs can have a

substantial effect on the determination of the optimal system of public

enforcement and on the achievable level of social welfare.

supported by a separate grant from the Law and Social Sciences Program of the

National Science Foundation (grants SES-8510638 and SES-8409858,

Institution while he was a National Fellow there in 1985-86. Helpful comments

were provided by Michael Block and Steven Shavell.

        [1]   See, for example, Becker (1968).

        [2] Although some analyses of the court system do consider settlements

and litigation costs, these studies are not concerned with optimal public

enforcement. See, for example, Landes (1971).

        [3] See, for example, Grossman and Katz (1983) and Posner (1970).

        [4] For example (although perhaps an extreme one), a study of asbestos

litigation found that $1.71 is spent by the parties in litigation costs for

every $1.00 received by the plaintiff. See Kakalik           (1983).

        [5] The paper by Fenn and Veljanovski (1985) complements the analysis

presented here. Their focus is on explaining why, given prosecution costs, a

regulatory authority would accept a violator's promise to voluntarily comply

with the authority's regulations in the future.

     [6] The model in this section is a generalization of the model used in

Polinsky and Shavell (1984).

     [7] In models which focus on other issues, both of these assumptions

have been relaxed. See, for example, Bebchuk (1984) and the references cited

therein.

     [8] This cost includes both the cost to the prosecutor's office and the


                                           9
court costs associated with a trial. The model does not distinguish between

these two institutions.

       [9] This derivation uses the fact that h(E(.))[dE(.)/dp] — dH(E(.))/dp =

-dN(.)/dp,    where H(.) is the cumulative distribution of h(.).

       [10] The individuals who are deterred by the increased probability of

detection are those who were previously indifferent between engaging in the

activity or not; their gains equal the expected payment, E(.).

       [11] Note that, depending on the sign of the right-hand side of (5),

the expected payment, E(.), may be greater than, equal to, or less than the

harm caused, e. Thus, an optimal system of public enforcement may be

characterized by "overdeterrence," in the sense that some individuals who are

deterred from engaging in the activity would have received gains greater than

the harm they would have caused (if e <     E(.));   or there may be

"underdeterrence," in the sense that some individuals who engage in the

activity obtain gains less than the harm they cause. These points were

recognized by Friedman (1981), although his model of public enforcement did

not include settlements and litigation costs.

       [12] A linear cost function allows for a simple closed-form solution for

the optimal p. Such a cost function can be justified on the grounds that it

represents a first-order approximation to a more realistic multiplicative cost

function. Reasonable parameter values were chosen on this basis; see note 13

below.

       [13] The values for the constants c1 and c2 were determined by starting

with the multiplicative version of the cost function c — kpN.          To select a

reasonable value for k it was assumed that if all individuals were violators

(N —   1),   it would take one-half of the wealth of society (1/2 of $20,000) to


                                           10
catch all of them (p —   1).   This implies that k $10,000. Thus, for p   .12

and N — .15, c1 — kN — $1,500 and c2 — kp — $1,200.
