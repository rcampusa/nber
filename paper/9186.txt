Why World Redistribution Fails

                                            ABSTRACT

       An optimal linear world income tax that maximizes a border-neutral social welfare function
provides a drastic reduction in world consumption inequality, dropping the Gini coefficient from 0.69
to 0.25. In contrast, an optimal decentralized (i.e., within countries) redistribution has a miniscule
effect on world income inequality. Thus, the traditional public finance concern about the excess
burden of redistribution cannot explain why there is so little world redistribution.
        Actual foreign aid is vastly lower than the transfers under the simulated world income tax,
suggesting that countries such as the United States either place a much lower value on the welfare of
foreigners or else expect that a very significant fraction of cross-border transfers is wasted. The
product of the welfare weight and one minus the share of transfers that are wasted constitutes an
implied weight that the United States assigns to foreigners. We calculate that value to be as low as
1/2000 of the value put on the welfare of an American, suggesting that U.S. policy implicitly assumes
either that essentially all transfers are wasted or places essentially no value on the welfare of the
citizens of the poorest countries.

1 Introduction
       In May, 2002 rock star Bono and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Paul O’Neill

toured Africa together. At each stop they publicly aired their different views on the need

and effectiveness of foreign aid. Bono insisted that more aid is needed to lift Africa out

of desperate poverty, implying that that it is largely the mendacity of developed countries

that prevents more aid. Secretary O’Neill argued that much aid has done little to reduce

poverty, owing in large part to waste and corruption.

       This high-profile tour generated wide media coverage of global poverty and

global income inequality. But the same debate has been ongoing for many years. Gross

disparities of income across countries1 have drawn attention to the small amount of

resources transferred from the rich countries of the world to the poor countries, and have

given rise to calls that the rich countries devote much more of their resources to foreign

aid. For example, Sachs (2001) has called for the United States to double its aid budget

and devote the funds to disease control, primary education, clean water, and other vital

needs of impoverished places.

       The unwillingness of the United States and other developed countries to

substantially raise their foreign aid may reflect one or both of two factors: the citizens of

rich countries place a very low value on the welfare of the citizens of poor countries, or

they may shy away from transfers because of the large efficiency cost that would plague

such efforts. This cost may have two sources. One is the concern expressed by Secretary

O’Neill and others that the funds would be not reach the targeted groups due to waste and




                                                 1
corruption. Another type of cost relates to the traditional concern of public finance

economists that the process of taxing the well off and transferring the proceeds to the less

well off causes disincentives. The economic cost of these disincentives limits the optimal

amount of cross-country transfers that would be undertaken even by a policymaker with

egalitarian impulses to redistribute from the globally rich to the globally poor.

        From this public finance perspective, it is clear that the problem of global

redistribution has the same structure as the problem each country faces—trading off the

efficiency costs of a progressive tax system against the more equal distribution of welfare

it achieves. In fact, most countries achieve some degree of redistribution through their

own tax-and-transfer system. Clearly, the extent of overall, world, redistribution is small

relative to world inequality because cross-country transfers are minimal. The question of

whether these minimal transfers are at least approximately optimal and what the optimal

transfers would be requires further investigation, however.

        In this paper we explore this question quantitatively as follows. We first calculate

each country’s optimal redistributive policy, assuming that each country sets its tax

system to maximize a concave social welfare function of individual utility levels,

knowing that the tax system will influence individuals’ choices. Then each country will

set its own tax schedule that is more or less progressive based on the distribution of

incomes (more precisely, the ability to earn income) within that country. Even though

the social welfare function is concave, the desire to redistribute is constrained by the

economic cost of the marginal tax rates the redistribution requires. Using data on income


        1
          Milanovic (2002) has shown that the major source of world income inequality is cross-country
differences.



                                                      2
inequality and assumptions about utility functions that imply how responsive behavior is

to taxation, we calculate the optimal income tax system in each of 118 countries and

characterize the amount of redistribution that these decentralized systems produce.

       Now we consider the hypothetical case of a world income tax, where the same tax

schedule applies to everyone regardless of where they live, and which therefore allows

for transfers across countries. We first consider the case where there is no waste (other

than excess burden) from cross-country transfers and that the tax setter is border-neutral,

meaning that each person’s welfare enters the social welfare function the same regardless

of where he or she lives. Assuming further that the world decision maker has the same

preferences as each country about the tradeoff between the mean and distribution of

incomes (i.e., an equally concave social welfare function), and faces the same costs from

imposing redistribution, we can solve for the optimal progressivity of the world income

tax. The solution depends on the inequality of world incomes, and not on the degree of

inequality within countries.

       The results of simulating these stylized models reveal that the decentralized tax-

and-transfer scheme makes hardly any dent in the world income inequality. This is so

even though countries pick progressive tax systems on their own. In contrast, an optimal

world income tax would significantly reduce the world inequality of consumption, albeit

with a larger efficiency cost and at the cost of a reduction in welfare of citizens of the

richest 25 countries. Thus, we conclude that a concern about the excess burden of cross-

country transfers cannot explain why foreign aid is so low--what limits these transfers is

not the efficiency cost of the redistribution.




                                                 3
       What might? One possibility is that weights put on the welfare of foreigners are

lower than those put on the welfare of citizens, as implied by Bono. Another is that

transfers are not used efficiently, as implied by Secretary O’Neill. In the final section we

address these possibilities by allowing the policy makers in the rich countries to place a

lower value on the welfare of the citizens of other countries at any given level of income

compared to their own citizens, and/or expect that a fraction of cross-country transfers

would be wasted. With our parameter assumptions we cannot distinguish between the

Bono and O’Neill scenarios, but we can calculate precisely how low the product of that

relative value and the share of transfers that are wasted must be in order to generate the

current level of cross-country transfers, in the form of foreign aid, given by rich to poor

countries.

        It is shockingly low. In our baseline case, foreigners are on average valued by the

U.S. at just 16% of an average American, with the citizens of the poorest countries

weighted by as little as 1/20th of one percent. The latter value implies either that U.S. puts

essentially no weight on the welfare of those individuals or that 1/2000th of the transfer is

wasted or a combination of both.


2 Methodology

2.1   Calculating the Optimal Linear Income Tax
       Our central analytical tool is a model of the optimal income tax structure, as

pioneered by Mirrlees (1971). The idea is that the government chooses an income tax

function that maximizes a given social welfare function, subject to an exogenously

specified revenue requirement and the constraint that individuals will choose the levels of



                                                  4
consumption and leisure that maximize their utility subject to their own budget

constraints, which depend on the tax system chosen.

        There are three key elements of the problem. The first is the degree of concavity

of the social welfare function, which captures how society makes the tradeoff between

the sum of utilities and the distribution of utilities. Second is the elasticity of substitution

between leisure and consumption in individuals' utility functions (which are assumed to

be identical); this determines the amount of distortion, or welfare cost, for any given tax

structure. The final element is the distribution of abilities, where an individual's ability is

presumed to be equal to the pre-tax wage rate. Loosely speaking, the optimal income tax

structure trades off the social welfare gains of a more equal distribution of utilities against

the efficiency cost caused by the structure of marginal tax rates needed to achieve any

given amount of redistribution.

        Although the optimal income tax literature has explored the sensitivity of the

results to various assumptions about the social welfare function, the distribution of

abilities, and the magnitude of behavioral response, it has not been used to quantitatively

explore the implications of a decentralized system of redistribution in a world of gross

inequalities across countries. This is the task we begin below.


2.2   Choosing the Model Parameters
        There are two scenarios that we wish to compare. One is a decentralized solution,

in which each country selects its own optimal linear income tax system. The other one is

a world income tax system, in which the decision maker designs a single linear income

tax that applies to all individuals in the world. This exercise requires making a host of

assumptions about the distribution of earning potential, the utility function, welfare



                                                   5
function, behavioral elasticities and stylized economies we study. In what follows we

review the main issues.


2.2.1 The Distribution of Abilities
       The dispersion of abilities is critical because, in general and ceteris paribus, the

optimal linear income tax will be more progressive (i.e., feature a higher demogrant and

higher tax rate) the more unequal is the initial distribution of earning potential within the

jurisdiction. Mirrlees (1971) presents an example in which widening the distribution of

skills, assumed equal to wage rates, increased the optimal marginal tax rates; he

concludes that the dispersion of skills necessary to imply marginal tax rates much higher

than the 20 to 40 percent range is unrealistically high. In his baseline numerical

simulation, he sets the value of the standard deviation of the associated normal

distribution (denoted σ) in the assumed logarithmic distribution of skills to be equal to

0.39, derived from Lydall's (1968) figures for the distribution of income from

employment in various countries. When Mirrlees repeated the simulation with σ=1.0, a

much wider dispersion of ability, he reported that the optimal tax schedule

       “is in almost all respects very different. Tax rates are very high: a large

       proportion of the population is allowed to abstain from productive labour.

       The results seem to say that, in an economy with more intrinsic inequality

       in economic skill, the income tax is a more important weapon of public

       control than it is in an economy where the dispersion of innate skills is

       less. The reason is, presumably, that the labour-discouraging effects of the

       tax are more important, relative to the redistributive benefits, in the latter

       case.”


                                                 6
        Stern (1976), examining only flat-rate tax systems, corroborates Mirrlees finding.

For his base case featuring an elasticity of substitution between goods and leisure of 0.4,

when σ=0.39, the optimal marginal tax rate is 0.225, but it rises to 0.623 when σ=1.

Cooter and Helpman (1974) perform a variety of numerical simulations, and find that for

all of them the optimal marginal tax rate increased as the constant-mean ability

distribution spreads out.2

        Of course, innate ability is unobservable, so its dispersion is not knowable, either.

What is available, and are collected in Deininger and Squire (1996), are estimates of Gini

coefficients for 138 countries. These estimates were produced from a variety of micro

data sources, and come from studies of varying quality. They identify Gini coefficients

based on actual observation of individual units drawn from household surveys, based on

comprehensive coverage of the population, and based on comprehensive coverage of

different income sources as well as of population groups. World Bank (2000, Table 2.8)

is a more recent source of Gini coefficients. These estimates are based on survey data

obtained from government statistical agencies and World Bank country departments, and

in many cases overlap with the Deininger and Squire (1996) observations. In our

simulations, we use the World Bank (2000) estimates as the primary source, and resort to

the "high-quality" observations in Deininger and Squire (1996) for countries that are not

present in that dataset.



        2
          Helpman and Sadka (1978) claim that this result is not general, but offer only a trivial counter-
example that features a Rawlsian (maximin) social welfare function and a fixed lowest ability level of zero.
They argue that there should exist counter-examples with more general social welfare functions, but admit
they were unable to identify any such example.



                                                         7
          A more vexing problem is that the studies sometimes calculate the inequality of

pre-tax income, sometimes calculate the inequality of after-tax income, and sometimes

calculate the inequality of consumption. Of course, none calculates the inequality of

ability. By making strong assumptions about the process that generates income, one could

claim to have recovered the distribution of abilities that is consistent with the data. For

example, for a given and common utility function and tax system, one could convert the

distribution of labor earnings into the distribution of abilities. This is the procedure we

follow.

          Because of the greater variability of annual income compared to annual

consumption, measures of inequality based on the former will tend to be higher.

Deininger and Squire report that in their sample the mean difference between the

expenditure-based Gini coefficients and those based on gross income is 6.6. They also

report that for the nineteen pairs of Gini coefficients computed using the Luxembourg

Income study data, those based on after-tax income were on average 3 points lower than

those based on gross income; this sample includes, however, only one developing country

(Mexico). Clearly, the quantitative importance of this effect will depend on the effective

progressivity of the tax system in place.

          In what follows we assume that the distribution of abilities in each country is

lognormal. Then, we parameterize the distribution so that the resulting Gini coefficient of

income or consumption for a given country under a certain baseline income tax system3 is

equal to the empirical value. In this exercise, gross income is assumed to equal labor



          3
              The baseline income tax system features a marginal tax rate of 0.30.

income of the individual, and both consumption and net income are assumed to

correspond to after-tax income.


2.2.2 The Individual Utility Function
       The individual utility function is a critical element of the problem because it

determines the substitutability between leisure and consumption, which in turn reveals

the marginal efficiency cost of any degree of tax progressivity. In his simulation analyses

of the optimal linear income tax, Stern (1976) focuses on a constant-elasticity-of-

substitution (henceforth CES) utility function with an elasticity of substitution of 0.4,

based on his reading of the labor supply elasticity literature available at that time.

Depending on how it is read, the literature since then suggests considering both a lower

and a higher number: lower because the aggregate elasticity of substitution between

leisure and consumption may be less than 0.4,4 higher because labor supply is only one

dimension of behavioral response to taxation that involves an efficiency cost, and

research on the elasticity of taxable income suggests that an elasticity of 0.6 may be

appropriate (Auten and Carroll 1999; Gruber and Saez 2000; Slemrod, 1998). Although

in this case the relevant behavioral response is summarized by an elasticity of taxable

income rather than an elasticity of substitution between consumption and leisure, in order

to be comparable with most of the optimal income tax literature we retain the standard

modeling. However, we assign higher behavioral responses than have been found for

labor supply, in order to represent the whole range of possible responses.

       Somewhat surprisingly, the "income elasticity" of optimal progressivity – do

richer countries choose more progressive tax systems? – in this class of models has been




                                                9
almost completely ignored. Indeed, the answer is not obvious. A proportional increase in

all individuals’ abilities changes the set of tax systems that raise the required amount of

revenue. Under certain conditions, the admissible tax systems are simply scaled up in the

sense that an equi-proportionate change in all abilities, revenue, and the demogrant,

holding the marginal tax rate constant, is still admissible (but perhaps no longer is

optimal). However, holding taxes and the degree of inequality constant, the commonly

used CES utility functions with an elasticity of substitution below unity imply that in

countries with high average ability levels there is much less labor supply, relative to

countries with low average abilities, than is apparently observed. As a result, the tax base

and revenue collected increase less than proportionally, so that it is not possible to sustain

a scaled up tax system.

       One approach to these issues is to consider the class of utility functions that yield

the “scale” elasticity of zero.5 As discussed by King, Plosser, and Rebelo (1982), this

class has the form U(ln(C)+g(L)), where C is consumption and L is leisure. The

motivation for examining this utility function is to ensure that simulations yield results

that are not grossly inconsistent with the empirical observation that labor supply is

broadly similar across countries with widely varying average income levels. Note,

though, that the optimal tax system may not simply scale up, because the optimum also

depends on the social welfare function. What the assumption about utility functions

guarantees is that, ceteris paribus, the income elasticity of the optimal tax structure

depends only on the social welfare function.

       4
           For a survey of the labor supply literature see Blundell and MaCurdy (1999).




                                                        10
         In what follows, we present results for the Cobb-Douglas utility function. This is

the only CES utility function that is also in the King-Plosser-Rebelo class. This choice

implies a compensated elasticity of labor supply of one, which is high in the context of

the literature on the elasticity of taxable income, but within the range of available

estimates.


2.2.3 The Social Welfare Function
         Although there have been attempts to recover a society's social welfare function

(henceforth SWF) from examining actual government policies, or by examining

individual risk aversion, for the most part economists have not tried to defend a particular

SWF. Instead, they have investigated the implications of alternative specifications of the

SWF for the solution to the problem at hand. We adopt that strategy as well.

         To be consistent with the earlier literature, we investigate SWFs of the type

introduced by Atkinson (1970), that are of the form W = Σ(1-v)-1U1-v. The higher the

value of v, the larger is the concavity of the SWF, and the larger is the implied

willingness of the society to trade off the sum of utilities for a more equal distribution of

the utilities. We investigate the implications of three values of v: 0.5, 2.0, and 5.0, but

concentrate on the case of v=2.0, which is Stern's (1976) central case, as well. Whatever

value we choose, we assume it is the same for all countries and for the designer of the

world income tax. In so doing, we skirt the fascinating but difficult question of whether

the degree of egalitarianism differs across countries, including whether it differs

systematically depending on the mean level of income or on the distribution of abilities.

         5
          Write leisure as L(sw,sG) i.e., a function of wage rate and income, where s is a scalar. The
necessary property for a zero scale elasticity is dL/ds = 0. Note that this property depends on a combination




                                                         11
2.3    Introducing Tradables and PPP Differences
         In practice, there are significant differences in countries’ real price levels.

Ignoring these differences would have some peculiar implications when we allow for

transfers across countries. The centralized budget constraint would simply add up

nominal taxes and subsidies of different economies, so that it would amount to assuming

that U.S. and Indian consumption can be exchanged one for one. While this may be

correct for tradable commodities, it is not correct for the non-tradable ones. There are

also implications for the location of production. Ignoring the presence of non-tradable

commodities and holding price levels fixed while allowing for large international

transfers will invariably lead to poor countries shutting down their production and relying

solely on transfers. The prediction of 100% voluntary unemployment across the Third

World would be a highly undesirable model feature.

         In this section we enrich the model so as to address these issues in a more

satisfactory way. The model features two sectors in each country that produce tradable

and non-tradable commodities, denoted T and N, respectively. We normalize the (world)

price of tradable goods to one. Non-tradable commodities are produced and consumed

domestically. Because people want to consume both types of goods, some non-tradable

goods have to be produced in each country. Equilibrium is reached by the adjustment of

relative wages in the two sectors.6 The details of the model follow.




of income and price responses.
         6
           An alternative equilibrating mechanism would allow the substitution of labor for capital. We do
not, however, consider this to be a realistic possibility. For example, we are not aware of a conceivable way
of substituting capital for the time of a barber. This example captures an important feature of at least some
non-tradable commodities: they require the time of an individual. In other words, highly-skilled individuals
are not more productive (or at least they are not much more productive) than the low-skilled ones.



                                                         12
2.3.1 Individuals
          Assume that there is a continuum of individuals characterized by (heterogeneous)

skill       levels         a.        We          consider               the         following           utility       function

                                                        −1

consumption commodities. The Cobb-Douglas consumption segment implies that the

fraction δ of total income is spent on tradables, while the rest is spent on non-tradables.

Denoting the price of non-tradables in country i as pi, consumption of the two types of

goods is therefore given by

                                                                             1−δ

where w ( a ) is the wage rate of an individual with the skill level of a.


2.3.2 Production
          We assume that production in both sectors takes place using only labor. However,

the relative productivity of workers with different skill levels varies by sector. Each

individual works in just one sector. More specifically, we assume that production in the

tradable sector takes place using efficiency units of labor, such that

                                              Ts =      ∫ a (1 − L ( a ) )dF ( a ) ,

where the integration takes place over the set of workers who choose to work in the

tradable sector, ST. The productivity of a worker in the non-tradable sector is assumed to

be more closely related to the amount of time that is invested in the activity, although it is

positively correlated with skill. In particular, we assume that the productivity in the non-

tradable sector is ad, where 0 ≤ d < 1 , so that



                                                                        13
                                 Ns =   ∫ a (1 − L ( a ) )dF ( a ) ,
                                             d

                                        SN



where SN is the set of workers that choose to work in the non-tradable sector. In the

extreme case when d = 0 , each individual is equally productive in the non-tradable

sector. In general, more skilled individuals are more productive in the non-tradable

sector, but by a smaller (and decreasing) factor than in the tradable sector. There are no

country-specific productivity differentials other than differences in the skill levels of

individuals.


2.3.3 Equilibrium
       We assume that both sectors are competitive. Because the tradable good is the

numeraire, the individual who chooses to work in the tradable sector will receive a wage

rate equal to a per unit of his time. The individual who chooses to work in the non-

tradable sector is paid piad. Thus,
                                         a,      a > pi a d ,
                                  w(a) =  d
                                          pi a , otherwise.

Because it is assumed that d<1, low-skilled workers will choose to work in the non-

tradable sector and high-skilled workers will choose to work in the tradable sector,

although the cutoff level of skill will differ from country to country and depend on the tax

system in place.


2.3.4 Features of the equilibrium
       The price of the non-tradable commodity determines the potential wages of every

individual in each of the two sectors, which determines the sector in which individual is

working and allows us to solve for individual consumption and labor decisions.

Therefore, the price of non-tradables in a given country is sufficient to determine the

                                                     14
aggregate demand and supply of non-tradables. In the equilibrium, the price adjusts to

make them equal.7 Total imports of tradables must be equal to the transfer to the country:

                                           T D − T S = transfer ,

because transfers can only take the form of tradables.

         One feature of equilibrium is that richer economies have a higher price of non-

tradable commodities, so that the overall price level in richer economies is higher. This is

also a well-known property of actual relative price levels, remarked upon by Balassa

(1964) and Samuelson (1964),8 who suggest explanations that are in the same spirit as

this model.


2.4    Calibration Methodology and Baseline Results
         Table A-1 lists the key data all of the 118 countries we examine. The first column

lists the population in 1999. Note that, although not all countries are considered in the

simulations, the countries that are considered comprise about 93% of world population.

Next, the table shows the mean per capita income, in PPP dollars, followed by the PPP

deflator. The level of gross national product (GNP) per capita varies from a low of $414

(for Sierra Leone) to $38,247 (for Luxembourg). The next two columns present the Gini

coefficients taken from World Bank (2000) or Deininger and Squire (1996), and the year

for which the coefficient was calculated. There is significant variation in these

coefficients, ranging as low as 0.19 for the Slovak Republic and exceeding 0.60 for

Brazil, the Central African Republic, Gabon, Malawi and Sierra Leone. Although recall


         7
           The level of inequality may affect the price level because it affects the relative supply of low and
high skilled labor. Note also that 100% unemployment will not occur, because in this case no non-tradable
goods would be produced.
         8
           See Rogoff (1996) for a recent survey.

that the Gini coefficients are not directly comparable, the wide range strongly suggests

that inequality varies greatly across countries.

        We assume that the utility function is Cobb-Douglas (r=0). This leaves three

world-wide parameters to be selected: δ, the share of tradables in consumption; d, the

productivity parameter in the non-tradable sector; and α , the share of leisure. There are

also two country-specific parameters: the extent of inequality and the average skill (a)

level (the distribution of a is assumed to be log-normal). Finally, the calibration

procedure requires that each country’s revenue constraint is satisfied under the baseline

tax system, adding the third country-specific requirement and pinning down the

demogrant under the baseline tax system.

        In calibrating the model, we seek to match actual data regarding economy-specific

mean incomes, Gini coefficients, and PPP indices, plus an overall world-wide average

labor supply of 0.25. We first assume a standardized tax system with t=0.3 in all

countries. Then, given d, δ and α , we adjust the distribution of skills in each country to

exactly match the empirical mean income and relevant Gini coefficient. This requires

solving for an equilibrium at each step, and yields the price of non-tradables and

consumption of the two types of commodities. Having this information for all countries

makes it possible to compute the PPP indices.9

        The next step is to select the values of d, δ, and α that generate average labor

supply at the desired level and that minimize the sum of squared deviations of the




        9
          We use the Eltetö-Köves-Szulc (EKS) method that was used to compute PPP in our data. See
Hill (1997) for a discussion of purchasing power parity methods and the EKS formula (equation 50).

simulated PPP levels of 118 countries from their actual 1999 PPP price levels.10 This

procedure generates calibrated parameter values of δ=.79, d=.12, α=.63. These parameter

values imply that almost 80% of income is spent on tradable commodities. Furthermore,

the small value of d implies that the non-tradable sector has significant decreasing returns

to scale in individual skills, so that it is quite close to relying on just the amount of time

provided.11

         Table 1 presents the results of the calibration exercise for a few selected countries,

and in the top row the world average.12 (Table A-2 in the appendix shows the results for

all 118 countries in the simulation). The first column of Table 1 shows the average labor

         10
             There are a few complications in implementing this method. Most importantly, it may not be
possible to match the empirical Gini values even by choosing extreme values of the inequality of skills. To
see this concern, consider the case when δ=0. In this situation, all individuals employed in the non-tradable
sector have exactly the same wage rate and exactly the same income. Because a given fraction of income
must be spent on the production of this sector, this requires a big enough fraction of population working in
this sector. As the result, the combination of a relatively low value of δ and a relatively low value of d (i.e.,
a high share of non-tradables) makes the lower end of the distribution equal and large, therefore limiting
the overall level of inequality. It turns out that there is a region of values of these parameters where the
actual Gini coefficients for the most unequal countries may not be matched. It also turned out that the best
choice of these parameters (i.e., the one that minimizes the deviations from the actual PPP levels) is on the
boundary of this region (i.e., the country with the highest inequality level has an extreme inequality of
skills). The parameters we use are almost on this boundary, but the results are not sensitive to shifting away
from the boundary.
          11
             With d=0, ad=1, implying that skill would not matter at all in the non-tradable sector. As a
result, only hours worked in that sector would determine its output.

income if everybody worked full-time (i.e., consumed no leisure at all). The following

columns show the average labor supply, consumption, and unemployment rate.

Unemployment in this model is voluntary, and is a result of the demogrant that implies

that a certain degree of consumption is possible even with zero labor supply. Although

the simulated unemployment rate is as high as 21% for a few of the most unequal

economies (those with Gini coefficients exceeding 0.55; see Table A-2 in the appendix),

in aggregate only a tiny fraction (less than 0.5%) of the world’s population chooses not to

work. Those that choose to be unemployed are at the bottom of the ability distribution in

a given country. Because with a Cobb-Douglas utility function, richer economies are just

scaled-up versions of poorer ones, the unemployment rate is simply a function of the

degree of inequality in underlying abilities.

        The next two columns show the Gini coefficients of pre-tax labor income and

consumption in the baseline simulation. Note that, because of the redistributive nature of

the baseline tax system, the former is always higher than the latter, with the difference

between the two measures ranging between 5 and 25 points. In each case, the parameters

have been selected so that the relevant one of these is equal to the empirical value from

Table A-1. The Gini coefficient of consumption for the world as a whole is 0.68, while

the Gini coefficient based on labor income is 0.72.

        The final three columns show consumption levels at the 5th, 50th, and 95th

percentiles of the distribution. Huge inequality of consumption is evident in the statistics

for the world: median consumption is $1,814, while consumption at the 95th percentile is


        12
           The world average is computed over all individuals, and is not equal to the unweighted average
of the country averages.

$27,860. As Figures A-2 and A-3 show, the calibrated PPP indices quite closely match

the actual ones, although this mostly reflects the fact that the dependence of the price

level on income is well accounted for. In reality there is also significant variation in the

price level conditional on income level, and this is not well explained by our model.

There is a small variation of the price level conditional on income that is produced by our

model (due to differences in inequality levels), but it is nowhere near what is observed in

the data.


3 Results
       We are now ready to calculate the optimal income tax systems, first for each

country and then for the world income tax. Table 2 shows the results for a subset of

countries; Table A-3 in the appendix gives the full set of results.

       In the focal simulation we assume that the parameter of the Atkinson's welfare

function is v=2.0.13 The first and third columns of Table 2 show the parameters –

marginal tax rate and demogrant – of the decentralized optimal linear income tax. The

optimal marginal tax rates are monotonically related to the Gini coefficients shown in

Table 1. Under the decentralized solution, the optimal marginal tax rate varies between

0.13 for the Slovak Republic and 0.82 for Gabon. The population-weighted-average

marginal tax rate is 0.41.




       13
            As we discuss later, the qualitative conclusions are robust to changes in this parameter.

          Gini coefficients for the world are calculated using labor/consumption adjusted for purchasing
power parity differences.

        The second and fourth columns of Table 2 show the parameters of the optimal

world income tax. The marginal tax rate is 0.62, substantially higher than the average

under the decentralized solution, although smaller than the decentralized tax rates for a

handful of the most unequal economies. The world income tax system also features a

very significant demogrant of $3,112. This demogrant exceeds the actual per capita GNP

for 73 countries. Note, however, that the aid from abroad backfires as well, because it

takes the form of tradable commodities. As a result, the larger the aid, the lower the value

of tradables in terms of non-tradables and the less effective is a dollar of transfers.

        Because of the monotonic relationship between the Gini and optimal

progressivity, the world income tax rate is higher than the rate for almost all countries in

the world. For this reason, the deadweight loss is significantly higher than would occur

under the decentralized systems. The ratio of deadweight loss to the amount of

redistribution achieved is also higher than it need be under a decentralized redistribution

scheme. To see why, consider the hypothetical situation where each country has the same

Gini but differing levels of mean income, so that each country would on its own choose

the same optimal marginal tax. Assume further that the marginal tax rate that the world


                                                                20
planner would choose is the same, because (we assume) world inequality is

approximately the same as in each country. Because each person faces the same marginal

tax rate under the decentralized and world income tax systems, the deadweight loss in the

two cases would also be identical. However, the world income tax system would

accomplish much more redistribution, because it is not providing demogrants to people

who are poor from a country's perspective but who are not poor from a world perspective.

        The middle four columns of Table 2 show the Gini coefficients of consumption

and labor income under the decentralized and world income tax regimes. Not

surprisingly, the Gini coefficients of consumption are lower than those of labor income.14

Redistributive tax systems render consumption considerably more equal.

        A striking result of this simulation is that the decentralized tax system does not

substantially affect the degree of inequality for the whole world. The Gini coefficient of

consumption decreases only slightly when compared to the original calibrated world

featured in Table 1.15 In fact, if tax rates in all countries were set to zero, the Gini

coefficient of consumption would be 0.695, compared to just 0.689 under the

decentralized tax systems. Each country redistributing on its own makes only a small dent

in world inequality. This result simply reflects that inequality in the distribution of all

individuals’ income, regardless of where in the world they live, is higher than the

inequality of individuals’ income within nearly every country of the world. According to

Milanovic (1999), the differences in countries’ mean income explain at least three-

        14
           In most cases the Gini coefficient of consumption falls below the baseline values of Table 1, for
both the decentralized and the world tax systems, with exceptions to this rule being the economies that
optimally set taxes below the baseline value of t=0.3.




                                                        21
quarters of overall world inequality. No country on its own can transfer income from the

world’s rich to the world’s poor, because no country has the world’s poorest and the

world’s richest among its citizens. Consequently, decentralized redistribution cannot

significantly address world’s inequality.

         The world income tax fares significantly better in reducing the inequality of

consumption. The Gini coefficient goes from 0.69 under the decentralized tax regimes to

0.25 under the WIT, when calculated using consumption adjusted for the (endogenous)

price level. However, because of its disincentive effects, the world income tax also

decreases the average level of consumption and reduces average labor supply. Average

labor supply (the number of hours worked) falls by more than half, from 0.21 to 0.09,

under the world income tax. This decline is mostly due to the sharp decline in labor

supply in the poor economies. The world unemployment rate increases from 2% to 15%.

         Although by construction there are no cross-border transfers under the

decentralized solution, under the world income tax the implicit transfers are substantial.

For example, per capita the United States transfers $16,432 abroad. Countries at about the

mean income of Uruguay and below receive net transfers, and the poorest countries

receive more than $2,600 per capita. The mean level of welfare for the whole world16

increases under the world income tax system when compared to the decentralized

solution, implying that the world income tax is more successful in redistributing income

than the decentralized system. Under the decentralized solution, the average welfare level


         15
             This is possible because for many richer economies our baseline tax rate of 0.3 exceeds the
optimal marginal tax rate, and therefore for these countries there is more redistribution in the baseline case
than under the optimal income tax structure.
          16
             The welfare levels are normalized for expositional purposes. Only relative differences are of
interest.

in the world is about equal to that of the average Filipino. A conversion to the world

income tax brings it to about the level of a typical Czech. Not surprisingly, there are huge

welfare gains for residents of the poor countries and substantial welfare losses for

residents of the developed economies.

          Figure 1 illustrates the implications of switching from decentralized income tax

systems to a world income tax by plotting tax as a function of gross income for

individuals at the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles (under the decentralized system) for

three countries: India, Poland, and the United States. For the citizens of the United States,

tax due under the world income tax exceeds tax liability under the decentralized tax

system for any level of gross income. This is also true for the richest Poles, but most

Poles would observe a decrease in tax liability, absent behavioral response. Even the

richest Indians gain, although not as much as the poorest ones. The figure also shows that

the marginal tax rate increases under the WIT for all three economies. As a result, within

each country the richest citizens gain least (or lose most).

          The value of the substantial cross-country transfers (for example, citizens of India

receive on average a nominal transfer of $2,666) may seem to be magnified by


                                                                     23
differences in the cost of living in different economies. For example, under the

decentralized solution the purchasing power of a dollar in India is magnified by a factor

of more than three. However, transfers may take the form of tradables only, so that they

are not as beneficial as a pure income transfer would be. This is reflected in significant

changes in the cost of living of the poorest economies, which reflect the increased prices

of non-tradables. This occurs because, as an economy becomes richer (due to transfers),

the demand for non-tradables increases, but their supply is still bounded by the

economy's own labor resources. In the case of India, the price of non-tradables under the

WIT increases by a factor of twenty, and the overall cost of living increases from 0.33 to

0.78 (Table 3). In fact, one result of this transfer scheme is that most of the poorest

economies end up consuming less non-tradable goods. This is because there is an overall

decrease in labor supply as the result of the large transfer.

       The differences in the cost of living also make it possible for average

consumption in the world to stay almost constant in PPP terms. Looking at the percentiles

of consumption, it is clear that under the world income tax most of the population gains.

The consumption level of the world-median individual increases by $4,600 in PPP terms.

At the same time, the structure of consumption changes. Consumption of non-tradables

falls in every country.




4 Foreign Aid and the Bono/O’Neill Factor
       A striking feature of the optimal world income tax solution is the large transfers

from the rich countries, amounting in the United States to $16,432 per capita. In fact,

many relatively well-off countries do provide foreign aid to less well-off countries, and


                                                  24
most rich countries contribute to multilateral institutions such as the World Bank that

offer assistance to relatively poor countries. How does it compare to our simulated level

of optimal transfers, and what does the comparison imply?


4.1    Foreign Aid
         The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD publishes annual

data on both bilateral and multilateral aid flows.17 Its 1999 report indicates that in 1998

the U.S. gave $5.988 billion of bilateral assistance, and $2.798 billion of multilateral

assistance, for a total of $8.786 billion of official development assistance. This last figure

represents 0.10% of U.S. GNP, and is $33 per capita. To put the U.S. figures in

perspective, for all 21 DAC countries (including the U.S.), official development

assistance represented 0.24% of GNP; the U.S. ranks 21st among the 21 countries

represented. The actual amount of net aid contributed or received by various countries,

from World Bank (2000, Tables 6.8 and 6.10), is presented in the last column of Table A-

1.18


         17
             There is a considerable literature on the determinants of foreign aid, in particular the extent to
which it is motivated by strategic and political considerations as opposed to altruistic and humane ones.
Lumsdaine (1997) investigates the effect of colonial links between donor and recipient, the democratic
status of the recipients, and the income level of the recipient, but presents only simple correlations rather
than a full-blown multivariate analysis. Alesina and Dollar (1998) do perform such an analysis (of bilateral
aid flows only), and find considerable evidence that the direction of foreign aid is indeed dictated by
political and strategic considerations much more than by either the economic needs or the policy
performance of the recipient.
          A separate but relevant literature concerns the effects of foreign aid on the receiving countries, and
has been studied by Jepma (1997) and Boone (1994, 1996). Most recently, Burnside and Dollar (2000) find
that aid is beneficial to countries that adopt appropriate and stable policies, and is wasted otherwise.
However, they find no evidence that foreign aid encourages the adoption of "good" macroeconomic
policies.
          18
              Table 6.8 of World Bank (2000) reveals the official development assistance and aid
contributions of the high-income economies in 1998. It includes both bilateral transfers and contributions to
the financial institutions. Table 6.10 shows the amount of assistance and aid received by various countries.
These numbers do not balance out. This is because some aid is allocated by region, but not by country, and
because of administrative costs, research into development issues, and aid to non-governmental

4.2   Bono and O’Neill: Estimating the Implicit Discounting of Foreigners'
      Well-being and/or the Implicit Extent of Waste
        The actual flows of aid are miniscule compared to what our simulated world

income tax generates. The discrepancy cannot be explained by the efficiency costs that

would result from the higher marginal tax rates needed to generate the tax revenue to be

transferred from the poor countries—that is an integral part of the WIT simulations. One

natural explanation for the discrepancy is that, contrary to the model’s assumption,

Americans are not border-neutral at all, but rather value the welfare of a foreigner

significantly less than the welfare of an American. Another is that transfers are not used

efficiently, so that the richer countries perceive them as a waste of resources.

        The notion that Americans’ altruism stops, or nearly stops, at the border will not

shock most readers. Neither will the possibility that transfers are wasted. With the model

we have developed, though, we can go beyond suggesting these notions to quantify what

the actual flows of aid imply about how much the United States weighs the well-being of

a resident of, say, India. Our weights reflect a combination of a lower weight put on

foreigners’ well-being and the extent of waste. Our preferred interpretation of them is as

a measure of the extent to which transfers are wasted that must be implicitly subscribed

to if the United States weights citizens of a given country as Americans and yet chooses

not to provide substantial aid.

        To fix ideas, consider a simple version of this setup in which the U.S. and India

are the only countries in the world, and each country has only a poor person (denoted P)

and a rich person (denoted R). Each country makes its own decisions about its tax-and-


organizations. As the result, contributions exceed aid received by approximately $22 billion. The total

transfer system. The social welfare function of the U.S. includes the utility level of

Indians, although the Indians' utilities may have a relative weight of less than one. The

social welfare function of the U.S. has the form W = (1- v ) U RS
                                                                    −1

where Uij refers to the utility of the ith person in the jth country (S=US and I=India), and b

(0<b) is the relative weight placed on an Indian's utility.

         The United States now has three policy instruments: the demogrant and income

tax rate as before, plus a transfer to the Indian government. The U.S. knows the Indian

social welfare function, so it knows exactly how India will adjust its own demogrant and

tax rate upon receipt of a transfer, and can therefore calculate the increase in the utility of

each Indian citizen. Given these assumptions, we can in the framework of our simulated

model calculate the amount of transfer to India the U.S. will make for any value of b.

Conversely, we can work backwards and calculate what value of b is consistent with the

amount of transfers we observe. In what follows we do the latter. Before we do so, we

introduce the possibility that transfers are wasted. Specifically, we assume that a transfer

from the U.S. to any other country need not go toward reducing that country’s revenue

requirement but instead it can be wasted by corrupt politicians, whose welfare we assign

a zero weight. We denote the extent of this waste in country i by ai, so that a transfer of T

results in a decrease of the revenue requirement by (1-ai)T.




amount of aid received is about $35 billion.

        Calculating the implied weights on the well-being of other countries’ residents is

straightforward, as long as each country selects its tax system optimally. Denote by λi the

marginal social welfare benefit from a marginal increase in public spending in country i.

Formally, this is the Lagrange multiplier on the revenue constraint in the ith country’s

optimal tax problem.19 Because of the possibility of waste, the marginal welfare from

transfer of a dollar to country i is then (1-ai)λi. On the margin, the optimizing government

considering international aid compares its own λ to that of other countries. At the

optimum, the government of donor country i must then set λi=(1-aj)bjλj, for any recipient

country j, where bj is the welfare weight attached to country j. This formula allows us to

calculate the product (1-aj)bj directly, because optimization yields the values of the λ’s.

In the case of the model of Section 2, we additionally adjust this formula for differences

in the cost of living, so that bj=pijλi/λj, where pij is the index of cost of living in country j

relative to country i.




        19
           At the optimum, it is equal to the average of marginal utilities of income (from the social
welfare point of view) in a given country.



                                                       28
        Table 4 presents the implied marginal weights from the point of view of the U.S.

for a selected group of countries. By construction, ceteris paribus, weights for the poorer

economies must be smaller than those for the richer ones. For the poorest economy of

Ethiopia, this weight is just 0.0005. One blunt interpretation is that the latter number

implies that the amount of actual foreign aid given by the U.S. to Ethiopia is consistent

with the well-being of an Ethiopia resident being valued at 1/2000 of that of an

American. Alternatively, it can be believed that only 1/20th of one percent of aid reaches

its desired recipients. A combination of the two is also possible. For example, if as much

as 5% of aid reaches its recipients, the corresponding welfare weight consistent with the

observed amount of aid would still be equal to just 0.01.

        The column labeled WIT in Table 4 reveals that even under an optimal world

income tax there is still room for a potential welfare improvement: the average weight for

the rest of the world is 0.4, so that a marginal dollar in U.S. transfers would still finance a

$2.50 increase in welfare, if used to finance a universal increase in the demogrant. This

is, however, not feasible in our model because of the assumed linearity of the tax system

that precludes a unilateral change of the U.S. transfers.20


5 Sensitivity Analyses
        In Table 5, we present the results of simulations analogous to those of Section 3,

but for different degrees of concavity of the common social welfare function. We

consider v=0.5, 2.0 and 5.0. Because v=2.0 is our baseline case, the numbers in this part



        20
           In a more general nonlinear tax system the feasibility of such transfers would be limited by the
incentive constraints.

repeat information shown earlier. A value of v=5.0 corresponds to a much more

egalitarian social welfare function, while v=0.5 is a much less egalitarian social welfare

function. To save space, we show only the results for the world as a whole and three

different countries: the United States, Poland and India. As expected, increasing

egalitarianism leads to more redistribution: marginal tax rates increase under both the

decentralized and world income tax solutions. Notably, though, the changes are much

larger in the decentralized case. This is because world inequality is very extreme to begin

with, and therefore even a low redistributive incentive induces high marginal tax rates

(and the optimal marginal tax rate is bounded from above by the one corresponding to the

“peak” of the Laffer curve). Indeed, the optimal world income tax is almost unaffected by

changes in the concavity of the welfare function.

          Changes in the social welfare function also have significant consequences for the

implied weights. This is intuitive. Without any redistributive incentive, these weights

would all be equal to one even if the distribution of incomes were very unequal.

Therefore, the lower is the concavity of the social welfare function, the higher should be



                                                                  30
these weights. For example, when v=0.5, the implied welfare weight attached by the U.S.

to an Indian is 0.32, and it falls to 0.19 for v=5.0.


6 Summary and Ruminations
        The decentralization of redistribution decisions results in vastly less redistribution

than would a centralized world income tax, even if the world policy maker considers the

disincentive effects caused by the higher taxes needed for cross-country transfers. In our

stylized simulation of redistribution policy, the decentralized system hardly budges the

world Gini coefficient of consumption, even though it reduces it for particular countries.

Put bluntly, within-country redistributive schemes are of almost no value from the world

perspective. In contrast, a world income tax would provide a drastic reduction in

consumption inequality, cutting the Gini coefficient by nearly two-thirds. The

decentralized scheme is also relatively inefficient, as it causes an efficiency loss that is

larger than it need be to achieve the same amount of redistribution as would a centralized

system. To be sure, the world income tax features a much higher absolute efficiency cost,

because it has a higher marginal tax rate than most countries would choose on their own.

        The actual flow of foreign aid is minuscule compared to what the optimal world

income tax implies, suggesting that the social policies of the rich countries are not

border-neutral, or anything close to that. In our baseline case, we calculate that this level

of transfer is consistent with the U.S. on average valuing the well-being of foreigners

only 1/6ths as much as an American citizen, and less than 1/2000th for poorest of the

developing economies. Alternatively, it corresponds to an extreme extent of waste so that

only 1/20th of one percent of transfers reaches its desired recipients.




                                                   31
       This conclusion is sensitive to the assumed concavity of the social welfare

function. Furthermore, our interpretation of weights is subject to a number of caveats.

The first is due to the restrictiveness of the instruments that we consider: a linear tax does

not allow the targeting of aid directly to the poorest members of the poor economies. If

more targeted ways of transferring aid were available, the implied weights consistent

with actual transfers would be even lower. We consider only a static framework and do

not account for the effect that transfers can have on human or physical capital

accumulation and, therefore, on future growth. Finally, it would certainly be interesting to

credibly distinguish ethnocentrism from perceived inefficiencies.
