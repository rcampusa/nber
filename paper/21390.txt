                                              ABSTRACT
We use experimental data of a training program in 2005 in Colombia. We find that even up to ten
years ahead, the JeA program had a positive and significant effect on the probability to work in the
formal sector. Applicants in the treatment group also contributed more months to social security during
the analyzed period, and to work for a large firm. Earnings of treated applicants were 11.8% higher
in the whole sample, and they made larger contributions to social security. In addition, we also present
non parametric bounds that for some percentiles of the sample of women, there are positive and nearly
significant effects of the program. Thus, the effects of the program would have been capitalized both
in increases in the likelihood of being formal, and increases in productivity. We also present evidence
that the estimated program effects on the likelihood of working for the formal sector, the likelihood
of working for a large firm, and the earnings in the formal sector, are not an artifact of analyzing multiple
outcomes.

We also find that for the whole sample of applicants, those in the treatment group have 0.315 more
years of education, and have a probability of graduating from high school 10 percent higher than the
control group. We find no significant effect on the probability of attending college or any school program,
nor on fertility decisions, marital status or some dimensions of assortative mating. Among applicants
matching to the census of the poorest population, we find that beneficiaries are more likely to participate
in the labor market, to be employed, and to be enrolled in a private health insurance at the time of
the survey.

Finally, we find that the benefits of the JeA program are higher than it costs, leading to an internal
rate of return of at least 22.1 percent. On the whole, the program was a cost-effective alternative, worth
to consider to bridging the transit of youths from the informal to the formal sector in the future.

I.      Introduction



Developing skills and participating in the formal labor market is a central policy concern in

developing countries. The issue acquires particular importance once we recognize that a well-

functioning economy, which can attract investment and promote growth, requires individuals

with sufficient levels of skills and work readiness (see, for instance, OECD 2012). Moreover,

unskilled youth have particularly low labor market attachment and are vulnerable to poverty.

According to Székely (2011), 20% of Colombian youths 15-18 years old were not in education,

employment, or training by 2005, while Guarín and Medina (2015) show that in Colombian

cities like Medellín, the same figure is as high as 44% for youth 16-20 years old. With these

central issues in mind, on the wake of the worst recession after WWII Colombia experienced in

1999-2000, the Colombian Government implemented an important youth training program called

Jovenes en Acción (JeA).1 The program, which was operated between 2001 and 2005, combined

classroom training with an internship and was offered to individuals who were pre-screened by

private-sector training institutions, of which some were for-profit and some were not. These

institutions designed the content of the courses and were responsible to find firms operating in

the formal labor market that would accept the youths for the required internships; this

mechanism provided clear incentives, as payments were linked to the completion of both the

class room and the internship component.



To evaluate the program, a randomized trial was carried out and analyzed by Attanasio, Kugler

and Meghir (2011) (AKM henceforth). They found that the program benefited mainly women,

1
  See Gaviria and Núñez (2002), Barrera and Corchuelo (2003), Medina and Núñez (2005), Sarmiento and others
(2007), and Fedesarrollo (2009, 2010), among others for issues relating to training in Colombia.


                                                    2
                          Attanasio, Guarín, Medina and Meghir, 2015

increasing their employment, their participation in the formal sector and their earnings. Under

the most conservative scenario the internal rate of return of the program for women was

calculated to be 21.6%. For men however, there was no discernible effect other than a shift to the

formal sector. This in itself is important however, because the formal sector offers numerous

benefits and because firms that operate in the formal sector tend to be higher productivity (see

Meghir, Narita and Robin, 2015), which might lead possibly to further training and professional

opportunities.



Informality is a major issue around the world and in Latin America in particular. Perry et al.

(2007) present figures showing that the share of the labor force not covered by a pension scheme

in Latin American countries is about four times as large as it is in advanced countries, while the

share of labor force self-employed is about twice as large. According to Medina et al. (2013),

Cárdenas and Mejía (2007), and López (2010), since the mid 1980s informality (based on the

ILO definition) has fluctuated in Colombia from 53% to 60% and is particularly high among the

young (see Saavedra and Medina, 2013), at a time which is important for laying the foundations

of a productive career.



Ten years have passed since the JeA experiment and the program itself ended. An important

question, given the promising short run impacts found by AKM, is whether the program had any

long-term effects. This question is particularly salient given the effects the program had on

participation in the formal labor market: given the importance of informality in Latin America

and in Colombia specifically, programs that can reduce informality in the long run are likely to

be very valuable from both a growth and a welfare point of view.



                                                3
                            Attanasio, Guarín, Medina and Meghir, 2015

Although there are other experimental studies evaluating job training programs implemented in

Latin American countries, there is no one to our knowledge that had assessed their effect beyond

a three years horizon.2 We are in the extremely fortunate position to be able to link into the

experimental sample administrative information on whether workers are employed in the formal

sector and if so what their earnings are. This allows us to evaluate whether the program achieved

one of its longer-term aims, namely to increase attachment to the formal sector. Moreover, the

earnings data, albeit censored, allows us to estimate bounds on the treatment effects on

underlying productivity. Finally, additional administrative data allow us to look at a variety of

additional outcomes.

Thus, in this paper, we merge the experimental data of the Colombia’s JeA evaluation collected

in 2005 with social and labor market administrative records collected between July 2008 and

June 2014, which we describe in detail below. We then use the resulting data to assess its impact

on a variety of outcomes.

We find that the JeA program had a positive and significant effect on the probability to work in

the formal sector, and those applicants in the treatment group contributed more months to social

security during the analyzed period. Beneficiaries of the JeA program were also more likely to

work for a large firm. Formal earnings of treated applicants were 11.8 percent higher in the

whole sample, and they made larger contributions to social security. We also find that for the

whole sample of applicants, those in the treatment group have 0.24 more years of education. The

long run effects of the program are stronger for women than for men, consistently with the

evidence in AKM about the short run impacts. For women we also find some suggestive

evidence three years after graduation.

evidence that the program improved their productivity (in addition to improve their chances of

working in the formal sector).



The rest of the paper is organized as follow: we first provide, in Section 2, information on the

background of the JeA program. In Section 3, we describe the data used in the paper and provide

some descriptive statistics of it. In Section 4, we present the estimated effects of the program

and, in Section 5, its cost-benefit analysis. Section 6 concludes.



II.     The Intervention



The Jóvenes en Acción program was a training program for urban young unemployed that was

implemented in the early 2000s in Colombia as part of a wider strategy called Red de Apoyo

Social, aimed at providing a safety net for the poorest sectors of the population after the crisis

that hit the country in the late 1990s.3 It was initially funded with a USD$70 million loan from

the Inter-American Development Bank, and was targeted to unemployed youths 18 to 25, who

belonged to the poorest population classified in the two lowest levels of a score, called SISBEN,

which is used in Colombia to target all welfare programs.4 As DNP (2000b) highlights,

unemployment rates of youths between 18 and 25 years of age of the ten largest metropolitan


3
  The Colombian crisis of the late 1990s is described by Medina, Núñez and Tamayo (2013). The first program of
the Red de Apoyo Social was created by means of the CONPES policy document Number 3075 of March 15, 2000
(DNP, 2000a), and was aimed at generating employment for the poorest, while program Jóvenes en Acción was
simultaneously created with program Familias en Acción, by the CONPES policy document 3081 of June 28, 2000
(DNP, 2000b), with a budget for both programs of USD$426 million, USD$320 million of which were to be
provided by The World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
4
  SISBEN is the acronym in Spanish for Information System for Beneficiaries Selection, and it is composed of six
levels built with the quality of life SISBEN score, used in Colombia to target public subsidies. To apply to the
program, individuals were additionally required to have a valid id, and if the applicant a mother of children under
seven years of age, she must present an official document to prove her maternity. Applicants that had previously
taken training courses at SENA or any training institution were also eligible to Jóvenes en Acción.


                                                        5

areas, living in the first and second lowest deciles of the income distribution, at the turn of the

Millennium were 62.8 percent and 52.8 percent respectively. The program was implemented in

the seven main cities of the country: Bogotá, Medellín, Cali, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga,

Manizales and Cartagena. According to FIP and DNP (2001), by 2001, the program planned to

enroll about 100,000 students in these cities between 2001 and 2003. According to AKM,

however, it actually began to enroll them in 2002, and, by 2005, it had enrolled 80,000 students.



The program’s goal, which we describe in more detail in Appendix A, was to increase the

employability of the young beneficiaries and provide them support for building was what called

by the program, their project of life. More specifically, its objectives were: (i) to develop the

youths’ occupational skills, so to increase their likelihood to become employed and improve

their performance at work, (ii) to promote the private supply of relevant job training programs

for poor youths, and (iii) to put productive poor youths and training institutions closer to firms.



Jóvenes en Acción essentially consisted of training courses designed and provided by private

institutions, known as ECAP, after the Spanish acronym for training institutions. Each course

was expected to train about 30 unemployed youths selected amongst eligible applicants. The

course had to have three main components: (i) classroom training; (ii) on-the-job training; and

(iii) the youth’s project of life (FIP and DNP, 2001). The aim was to develop occupational skills,

social skills and broader career objectives. The program also included a small stipend of about




                                                  6
                              Attanasio, Guarín, Medina and Meghir, 2015

USD$2.20 per day for trainees without children under seven years of age, and to about

USD$3.00 per day for women with children under seven.5

The training institutions designing and offering the courses could be for profit or not for profit

and they had to satisfy certain criteria, listed in Appendix A. AKM report that 43 percent of

them were for profit. In 2005 there were 114 ECAPs offering 441 courses to 26,615 trainees,

with their instructors teaching about 7.6 hours per day.6

A unique feature of the program was that the ECAPs were paid a relatively small amount if a

youth completed only the classroom component. A substantial fraction of the overall payment,

instead, was conditioned on the student completing the apprenticeship with the participating

firms in a timely fashion (see FIP and DNP, 2001). Moreover, the ECAPs would receive

additional payments if the beneficiaries were hired by the firms that trained them. To the

government, the total cost of the program is the sum of the cost of the course, plus the

maintenance transfers disbursed during the six months (See FIP and DNP, 2001). This incentive

scheme, which stressed the need to identify skills for which a demand was present in the labor

market, was one of the most innovative characteristics of the program, especially compared to

the training programs operated since 1957 at SENA, Colombia’s government institution

providing training, which often did not relate to the demand for specific skills in the labor market

(See Saavedra and Medina, 2013).




5
  Transfers to women with children under seven year of age were not contingent on the number of their children
under seven, and were paid weekly per day in which beneficiaries had attended their courses during their classes,
and biweekly, after they completed their training, during their training period. See FIP and DNP (2001), DNP (2008,
2002), and AKM. Beneficiaries were also covered by personal accidents insurance, and by civil liability insurance,
but not health insurance, as most of the beneficiaries were likely to be covered by the non-contributory health
system that insures the poorest Colombians.
6
  40 percent of the beneficiaries were from Bogotá, 18 percent from Medellín, 16 percent from Cali, 11 percent from
Barranquilla, 7 percent from Bucaramanga, 5 percent from Cartagena, and 2 percent from Manizales. The total
amount invested was US$22 Millions (See Ministerio de la Protección Social, 2005)

III.       Data

In our empirical analysis, we use two types of data. First, we use the evaluation survey of

program applicants that was collected at the start of the program and used in AKM to estimate

the short run impact of the program. Second, we use two administrative data sources to follow

the respondents in the evaluation survey several years after the completion of the intervention. In

this section, we describe the two data sources and discuss the selection criteria used in the

analysis, starting with the evaluation data.



1. Experimental Data of the Jóvenes en Acción Program

For the purpose of evaluating the intervention, the ECAPs selected up to 50% more applicants

than the places available for the courses. 30 of the selected applicant were then randomly

assigned to the course while the others were used as a control group. The evaluation survey is

described in AKM and is a random sample of the universe of applicants and consists of about

50% treated and 50% control subjects although this was not achieved for each training center.7

Here we stress that this design maintains a selection role for the ECAPS, which can be important

for the impact of the intervention. It should be remembered that the ECAPS had strong

incentives to select individuals that would complete the entire program.

Appendix Table A1 shows descriptive information and results on the balance of the evaluation

sample. Both for women and men, the sample is well balanced. Nonetheless, when we pool

students of both genders, we find that beneficiaries are slightly more educated.




7
    The sample was stratified to insure it would be balanced by city and gender.

2. Administrative Records

The data sources that we use in this paper to estimate the program’s long run effects, consist of

two different administrative datasets, known as SISPRO dataset and the SISBEN survey, (from

their Spanish acronyms).

(i)     The SISPRO Data

The SISPRO contains information from the Unified Register of Contributions, known as PILA

from its Spanish acronym, which is the national information system used by firms to file the

mandatory contributions to health, pensions and disability insurance they pay for their

employees. Firms must report each month the amount contributed for each one of their

employees. The Ministry of Social Protection has universal coverage of all the monthly

contributions in the country since July 2008. Thus, this data provides us with the possibility of

following up the individuals in the evaluation survey and constructing a longitudinal database

with monthly frequency from July 2008 to December 2014. Since the PILA contains the monthly

census of all contributions in the country, individuals in the evaluation database that were not

found in the PILA register are assumed to be out of work, unemployed, or working in the

informal labor market. The structure of the data also allows us to observe individuals entering

and exiting the formal labor market.

(ii)    The SISBEN survey

Virtually all social programs in Colombia are targeted through the so called SISBEN index. This

index is constructed as a weighted average of a number of household level variables.8

Information on the variables used to construct the score is collected with a survey, which is




8
 The formula to compute the index and the variables that enter the index are not publicly known. Moreover, the
components of the SISBEN and their weight are periodically updated.


                                                      9
                              Attanasio, Guarín, Medina and Meghir, 2015

routinely administered to about the 60% poorest segment of the population in Colombia.9 In our

analysis, we use the surveys collected between mid 2009 and early 2015. We then match, using a

variety of methods and information sources, the data from the evaluation survey with the

SISBEN data. We therefore construct a long-run follow up with the matched applicants’, and

their households’ characteristics, at the date their surveys were collected. Since this survey is a

census of the poorest population, applicants that were not matched to it are assumed to belong to

the upper income levels of the population.

An individual can, in principle, be in both administrative data and many indeed are. However, it

is clear that the two data sources are somewhat complementary: somebody with a formal

employment and high earnings will be found in the PILA data sets but will be, ceteris paribus

less likely to be in the SISBEN data base. Conversely, people in the SISBEN data, as they are

being targeted by welfare programs are less likely to be in PILA.



IV.     Descriptive Statistics

In Table 1, we present some descriptive statistics based on the baseline information of applicants,

and also based on their follow-up information from SISPRO and SISBEN. Our baseline

information includes 3,956 applicants, 54% of whom are women. In Panel A, we notice that at

the moment they applied to the program, they were on average 21 years old, 18 percent were

married with an average of 10 years of education. 52% of applicants were employed and 38% of

the total were wage earners. Their average earnings were COP$103 thousands (at December


9
  The SISBEN survey began to be collected in 1992 by all Colombian municipalities, and after its collection,
whenever any household wanted its information to be updated, it had to require it to its municipal Department of
Planning, in charge of the local SISBEN administration. The SISBEN was updated for first time for the whole
country between 2003 and 2005, and the second time it was updated was between 2009 and 2010. Since the first
time it was updated, its records became much more reliable and its score much less manipulable (See Bottia et al.,
2012).


                                                       10
                          Attanasio, Guarín, Medina and Meghir, 2015

2013 pesos). Only 8.9% worked in the formal sector, 7.8% had a written contract, and they

worked an average of 12.3 days per month and 25.9 hours per week. Men were less likely to be

married, and more likely to be working, and in particular, to be wage earners, with higher

earnings, more formal and more likely with a written contract. Finally, they worked more days

per month and hours per week (Table 1, Panel A).



In panel B of table 1, we notice that 77% of applicants matched at least one month with the PILA

between July of 2008 and December of 2014, and on average, they matched 31.2 months in that

period and contributed for an average of 870 days. In the whole period, they earned an average

of COP$23 millions of December 2013 in the formal sector (COP$297 thousand per month), and

contributed an average of COP$3.5, COP$2.6, COP$0.8 and COP$0.3 millions to pensions,

health, Cajas and SENA respectively. Men were more likely to be formal and to earn and

contribute more.



Finally, in panel C, we report outcomes that were extracted from the SISBEN database. About

71% of the applicants were matched in to SISBEN, with the matching rate being higher for

males than females. Those observed in SISBEN, had, when they were surveyed, an average

education slightly lower than the average of all applicants at baseline, which is natural since the

SISBEN survey only includes the poorest. Of those observed in the SISBEN survey, 70% had

graduated from high school, 63.1% participated in the labor market, 52.4% were employed and

10.8% unemployed. Their monthly income was COP$254 thousand, and the income of 24% of

them was above the minimum wage (Table 1, Panel C).

We now present more information on outcomes related to formal employment, in particular, the

average earnings of the applicants, the average earnings of applicants matched to PILA, and the

                                                                                12

likelihood of matching to the PILA survey. Individuals are assumed to be matched to the PILA if

they hold a formal job. Figure 1 shows the average (formal) earnings of applicants, including

both treated and control samples. Earnings of individual not matched in the PILA (and hence, out

of work, unemployed, or informal) are set to zero. The sample is weighted, by PSCi (1-PSCi),

where PSCi is the population probability, taken from administrative records, that an applicant i,

that applied to course C, at site S, be offered a place. These weights will be used throughout,

including in the estimation of the effects.

There is a clear gap in favor of beneficiaries of the JeA program, which is slightly increasing

over time. The figure gives a first view of the estimates we present later of the effect the program

on formal earnings, arising partly from a higher likelihood of being a formal employee, that is, of

matching to PILA, and, possibly, from increases in productivity.

Figure 2 shows the mean earnings only of applicants who were matched to PILA. Until 2011, we

do not observe significant differences between individuals who were treated and those who were

not. However, starting in 2011, we find an increasing gap in favor of the beneficiaries. The gap is

larger for men than for women. It should be remembered, however, that this is a self-selected

sample, an issue we will address later by the estimating non-parametric bounds of the effect on

productivity.

Finally, Figure 3 shows the effect of the program on the probability of matching to PILA, which

shows a similar pattern to the one observed in Figure 1. Altogether, the figures suggest that most

of the effects on earnings of the JeA program are capitalized by beneficiaries in the form of a

higher probability of becoming a formal employee, rather than by means of an increase in their

productivity.

V.     Program Effects

To estimate the long term impacts of the program we use the following model:

                                 𝑌!" = 𝛼𝐷! + 𝑋! 𝛽 + 𝑆𝐶! + 𝜀!"                                       (1)
Where Yij is the outcome of person i in site and course j, Di is the treatment indicator, and it is

equal to 0 if the applicant was randomly denied a place in course j, or 1 if he was randomly

offered a place in it, Xi is a vector of characteristics of the applicants at baseline, such as gender,

initial employment and experience, education and so on. Considering that randomization in the

experimental design took place at the course level, we include SCj, a site-by-course fixed effect,

which allows us to interpret our parameter of interest (α) as the weighted average of the program

effects across all courses. Finally, εij is a random error term. In all of our estimates below we

compute robust standard errors, clustered at the site-by-course level, and whenever we use panel

data, we cluster them at the applicant level.

We present estimates of the “intent to treat” effect, that is, the mean effect of the offer of

treatment. However, since compliance among applicants is 97%, our estimates should not differ

substantially from the average treatment effect in this population. We weigh each applicant by

PSCi (1-PSCi), where PSCi is the population probability, taken from administrative records, that an

applicant i, that applied to course C, at site S, be offered a place. While we report the results

obtained using this weighting scheme, we also compute unweighted estimates, which are

available on request. Weighing does not make any substantial difference to our results or

conclusions because the probabilities do not vary much.



1. Effects of the Jóvenes en Acción on participation in the Formal Labor Market

We use the PILA data for each month between July 2008 and December 2014 to track

individuals in the formal market. When an individual is not recorded in the dataset they are either

                                                  16

unemployed or working in the informal market. We focus on three outcome variables: whether

an individual is working in a formal job in any one month, whether they are working in a large

formal firm, and their earnings. These are set to zero for those who do not appear in the

administrative data set (PILA).

 the formal sector, whether working with a contract, days worked per month, and hours worked per week. We
 additionally include a gender dummy and its interactions with all covariates. Standard errors are corrected by
 clustering at the applicant level. R-W p-values were estimated taking into account that there were multiple

The results for the whole sample are reported in Table 2, while results by gender are shown in

Table 3. We include training center fixed effects and we report stepdown p-values computed

using the procedure derived by Romano-Wolf (2005) adjusting for multiple testing in groups. So

in Table 2 the p-values are adjusted for testing the three outcomes in that Table. In Table 3 the R-

W p-values account for testing of all 6 outcomes reported there. All levels of significance (and

the asterisks in the table) are reported based on the R-W p-values and not on the standard t-

statistics.

Formal Earnings. We find that formal earnings is about COL$35,000 higher among the

individuals who were randomly assigned to the training courses than the formal earnings of the


                                                                     18

control group. This corresponds to a 13.6% increase in formal earnings. The RW p-value

associated to this effect is 0.025. This shows a remarkable persistence of the effects of the

program, beyond the cost-benefit analysis in AKM, where a 10% depreciation rate was assumed.

In terms of pesos, the effect is similar for males and females, at about 35k (Table 3), although for

women it represents a higher percentage increase: female earnings in the control group are

COL$200,000, while those for males are COL$327,000. Thus the respective percentage

increases are 17.5% for females and 10.7% for males. Once we control for multiple testing the

female effect is significant at the 6.5% level, while the male effect is insignificant.



Probability of working in the formal sector. The probability of working in the formal sector is

increased by 4 percentage points as a result of the program (Table 2). This effect is significant at

the 1% level (RW p-value=0.009). When we look at the same impacts separately for women and

men, in Table 3, we find that for females the probability of being a formal employee increases by

5 percentage points (RW p-value of 0.052). For males, the point estimate is similar and the t-

statistic is 1.89, but the adjusted RW p-value is 0.25 and is therefore not statistically different

from zero. Participants in JeA worked on average 3.33 months longer in the formal sector, quite

precisely estimated with a standard error of 1.19.

Probability of working in a large firm. Finally, we consider the probability of working for a

large firm as an additional outcome variable. Large firms often offer better career prospects

through promotion opportunities and may be a proxy for higher quality jobs. We find that the

proportion of those working in large formal firms increases by 3.2pp (p-value 0.025). Breaking

down the impact by gender we find a 3.8pp effect for women (p-value 0.065). For men the effect

is 2.5pp and totally insignificant.

Bounding the effects on productivity.

The estimated effects point to a strong and persistent effect of the program on working in the

formal sector, which is reflected both in the participation and in the earnings measures. However

this does not necessarily imply that the trainees have become more productive. This is not an

issue that can be assessed experimentally simply because we only observe earnings conditional

on working in the formal sector; in other words comparing the formal earnings of those who

went through the program to the formal earnings of those who did not, as pointed out in AKM is

subject to selection bias, because of the effect of the program on formality. Trainees who select

into the formal sector are likely to be very different from controls who select into the same

sector.

           One possibility is to bound the effects on earnings, following an approach similar to that

used by AKM. To sharpen the bounds they relied only on a monotonicity assumption, i.e. that

participating in training could not discourage work. However they had to deal with a selection

problem less severe than what we are facing, as missing earnings were confined to non-

workers. In contrast to this study, they also observed the earnings of those with jobs in the

informal sector. Therefore, to get tighter bounds in our context, we impose stronger restrictions

as in Angrist et al. (2006).

           In particular, we assume that the training program could not lead to a decline in earnings,

Y1it ≥ Y0it, where the first subscript is 1 for those allocated to treatment and 0 for those not.10 This

is not an innocuous assumption because it states that lost experience from participating in

training has either negligible effects or is dominated by the effects of training. Now, define 𝑇!!"

to be a dummy for whether an individual i works in the formal sector when allocated to training.


10
     This is the monotone treatment response assumption used by Manski (1997).


                                                        20
                                 Attanasio, Guarín, Medina and Meghir, 2015

Similarly 𝑇!!"   is a dummy for whether an individual i works in the formal sector when not

allocated to training. We assume that T1it ≥ T0it, which is the monotonicity assumption of Imbens

and Angrist (1995).11 Define 𝑞! 𝜃 to be the θ-quantile of the distribution of Y0, and 𝑞! 𝜃 the θ-

quantile of the distribution of Y1. Finally, T is an indicator of formality and D is the

randomization defining allocation to treatment. Angrist et al. (2006) show that

                           𝐸 𝑌𝑇|𝐷 = 1, 𝑌𝑇 > 𝑞! 𝜃        − 𝐸 𝑌𝑇|𝐷 = 0, 𝑌𝑇 > 𝑞! 𝜃

                                         ≥ 𝐸 𝑌! − 𝑌! |𝑌! > 𝑞! 𝜃 , 𝑇! = 1

                    ≥ 𝐸 𝑌𝑇|𝐷 = 1, 𝑌𝑇 > 𝑞! 𝜃         − 𝐸 𝑌𝑇|𝐷 = 0, 𝑌𝑇 > 𝑞! 𝜃   = ∆!"     (2)

We can further tighten the bounds by exploiting the fact that in our experimental setting the

vector (Y1it, Y0it, T1it, T0it, Xit-1) is independent of Di, where Xit-1 is the vector of baseline

characteristics as in Lee (2009). In this case, we can derive bounds conditional on X and then

average over X’s distribution among formal workers who were not treated. Thus the lower bound

takes the form

                        ∆!!" = 𝐸 𝑌𝑇|𝐷 = 1, 𝑌𝑇 > 𝑞! 𝜃 , 𝑋 − 𝐸 𝑌𝑇|𝐷 = 0, 𝑌𝑇 > 𝑞! 𝜃 , 𝑋

                         ∆!"
                          ! =      ∆!!" 𝑑𝐹 𝑋                                          (3)

where F(X) is the distribution function of X conditional on D = 0 and T = 1. The upper bound is

computed in a similar fashion.



In Panel A of Table 4, we show the estimated bounds by demographic group obtained using

equation (2), based on the applicants’ formal earnings, as reported when they contributed to

health, disability, pensions, from which we take the maximum. We estimate lower and upper

bounds at different percentile levels. First, including all control individuals matched to PILA


11
     See Angrist et al. (2006) and Lee (2009).


                                                       21
                               Attanasio, Guarín, Medina and Meghir, 2015

(65th percentile), and then, including only those on top of the 75th, and 85th income percentiles.

The table shows that, for women, the upper bound of the impact of the JeA program on earnings

is positive, significantly different from zero and large. It is particularly high at the 65th and the

85th percentiles: the shape of the impacts is U-shaped, with a minimum at the 75th percentile,

both in absolute and percentage terms. For men, the story is very different: the upper bounds on

the impacts are much smaller and never significantly different from zero. For the overall sample,

the impact reflects the pattern of the impact of women, except that the minimum is at the 75th

percentile. As for the lower bounds, they are never significantly different from zero. In the case

of men, all point estimates of the lower bound are actually negative.



In panel B, we also condition on the specific ECAP individuals attended, and compute bounds

based on equation (3). In this case, we still find positive and significant upper bounds, although

their point estimates are smaller than those in Panel A. The lower bounds are higher than those in

Panel A, and at the 65th percentile the lower bound is significantly positive for women at the

10%. For men, again, we find much smaller impacts and, again, all lower bounds are negative

and, in the case of the 85th percentile, significantly different from zero. The point estimate of the

upper bounds in the 85th percentile is negative (although not significantly so).12

We summarize the evidence from the bounds by saying that there is some suggestive evidence

that the program might have improved the productivity in the formal sector of the female youths

who received it. The increase in formal earnings for men, instead, seems to be completely driven

by the increasing formality, rather than by an increase in productivity.



12
  We do observe that the JeA effect increases with time: the estimates in table 4 imply a relative increase in earnings
for women of 9.2%, but when we get the lower bound estimate using only 2014 data, its relative effect becomes
14.1%.

following pretreatment characteristics: age, education, marital status, employment, paid employment, salary, self-employment earnings, whether working in the formal
sector, whether working with a contract, days worked per month, and hours worked per week. Standard errors are corrected by clustering at the applicant level.




2. Effects on Contributions to Social Security

Finally, we present evidence on the contribution records of these formal workers as an additional

way of corroborating the increase in participation in formal sector. Thus, Table 5 presents the

estimated effects of the JeA program on the amounts of taxes and contributions paid by

applicants. As with the results reported in Table 4, we find significant and positive effects on

contributions, overall and for women, but not for men. Finally, in Table B.1 in the appendix we

find no significant effect on these.

earnings, whether working in the formal sector, whether working with a contract, days worked per month, and hours worked per
week. Column 2 additionally includes gender and its interactions with all covariates. R-W p-values were estimated taking into
account that there were multiple hypotheses, using the Romano and Wolf (2005), and Romano, Shaikh and Wolf (2008), on each of
the three outcomes included in this table, based on the bootstrap standard errors stratified by city, gender and treatment status. The

VI.    Cost-Benefit

Table 6 presents a simple cost-benefit analysis focusing on women where we find significant

effects of the program. We find that the average formal earnings of control applicant women is

COP$200,100, or US$100.1 Our estimated premium for women, attributable to the JeA program

is 17.7 percent in our case. Allowing for a program cost of COP$1.6 millions that includes the

direct costs of operating the program, a maintenance allowance, and the loss of tenure, the

internal rate of return is 29.5 percent, similar to the one calculated by AKM.

As seen in Figure 4, the gains are stable over time: the effects of this program seem to be

permanent. However, even if we allow for a 6% depreciation annually we still obtain an internal

rate of return of 20%

VII.   Conclusions

The Jóvenes en Acción was focused on training and work experience for young people. Its

original evaluation by AKM, based on randomized experiment, showed positive effects on

women, who showed an increase in earnings and an increase in formal employment.

Nevertheless the key question is whether the effects are sustained. In this paper, we use

administrative data to follow up the subjects in the experiment and show that the effects on

women are sustained. Specifically there is a long run increase in participation in the formal labor

market of about 4%. Moreover, female formal earnings of about 18%. No significant effect is


                                                26

found for men, although the impacts are positive. In the case of women, the cost benefit analysis

with no skill depreciation attributes a 29% internal rate of return. We also bounded the effect on

productivity and at least for women these do not include zero indicating an improvement there as

well (although the lower bound is not significantly different from zero).

By all accounts this has been a successful program with sustained effects. Given the importance

for growth of reducing the size of the informal sector and moving people into the formal one the

lessons learnt from this program should be replicated. Evidence on the relative importance of the

classroom component vis a vis the work experience one would be very useful. Our belief is that

the combination of the two contributed to the success of the program.

Appendix A. Jovenes en Acción

Institutions interested in offering the program could be national or international, formally

established, having as one of its social goals the provision of job training programs, with the

required infrastructure, technique expertise, experience, and economic solvency that could allow

it to provide a high quality program, and appropriately manage the public economic resources of

the program. Institutions could be private, public or mixed, and among the public they could be

different to the SENA, provided that their public resources were not used to provide the Jóvenes

en Acción program, so that they had no advantage with respect to their private competitors.

The ECAPs did not receive any payment if a student dropped out before completing at least 20

of the coursework (although the students could be replaced by other), they received 30% of the

fee if the student completed less than 80 percent of the coursework, 40% if the student finished

the coursework but did not complete the ‘on-the-job’ training component, 45% if the student

started the on the job training with a delay but did not fully finish it, 50% if the student started on

time (within 5 working days) as a trainee but did not fully finish the course, between 80 and 90%

if the student is started with a delay fully finish it, and 100% if the student started as a trainee on

time and completed the course fully.

Moreover, the ECAPs would receive additional payments if the beneficiaries were hired by the

firms that trained them: in this case, and provided their employment was in a field related to the

classes they received, on a contract of at least six months, the ECAP would receive the stipend

not cashed by the beneficiaries.

                                           Program details



The first component was expected to last between 280 and 350 hours and was focused both on

the development of basic abilities for becoming employed (independent of the specific field), and

the development of occupation specific skills. The former objective was pursued by providing

the youths with basic social abilities and developing their soft skills: teaching them to be

proactive, resourceful and open to feedback; improving their verbal and written communication

skills; their analytic, deductive and daily work problems solving skills; by encouraging them to

assimilate and understand their job’s organizational environment; by developing teamwork

skills, etc. The latter goal was pursued by providing training in the specific field of their interest,

including the expertise in the use of equipment and tools, didactic material, and the procurement

of services; products or services production, etc.



The second component consisted of three months of on-the-job training, and was about 480

hours long, conditional on the labor schedule of the specific firms in which the youths were

trained. The training institutions, ECAPs, when designing the training courses, they had to

identify participating employers that would take the young trainees on an apprenticeship basis.

The ECAPS also wrote a training plan to facilitate the completion in the firm of the training

process that began in their classrooms. It also includes an assessment of the youths’ performance

in terms of their achievements, agreed upon by the firm, the ECAP, and the youth.



The third component, the project of life, pursued the youths’ comprehensive human

development, orienting them towards a positive visualization of their abilities, personal and work

perspectives; providing them with tools for decision-making. It encouraged the youths to reflect

on their work, their imminent insertion in the labor force, and its meaning with respect to their

future labor market perspectives, helping them build their labor identity. This component took

* $COP of 2013. All regressions control for siteby-course fixed effects and the following pretreatment characteristics: age, education, marital status, employment, paid
employment, salary, self-employment earnings, whether working in the formal sector, whether working with a contract, days worked per month, and hours worked per week.
Column 2 additionally includes gender and its interactions with all covariates. Standard errors are corrected by clustering at the applicant level. R-W p-values were
estimated taking into account that there were multiple hypotheses, using the Romano and Wolf (2005), and Romano, Shaikh and Wolf (2008) procedure, on each of the
three outcomes included in this table, based on the bootstrap (1000 replications) standard errors stratified by city, gender and treatment status.
