The (Dis)Advantages of Clearinghouses Before the Fed

                                           ABSTRACT

Operating in individual cities, U.S. clearinghouses were the closest thing to a central bank before
1914, but they only assisted banks that chose to join the association. Using an annual bank-level
database for seven states between 1880 and 1910, this paper shows that after the entry of a
clearinghouse member banks were less likely and non-member banks in the same city were more
likely to close. The results are driven by the fact that the presence of clearinghouses led all banks
to become more exposed to systemic liquidity risk, yet only provided liquidity to member banks
during panics.

1. Introduction
        Modern financial systems are governed by a patchwork of laws and supervisors. In

addition to increasing legal costs, the patchwork encourages the pursuit of regulatory arbitrage

whereby institutions alter their composition and services to operate under the loosest laws. This

arbitrage can also change the nature of the banking sector, bringing in new business and

expanding its exposure to certain factors. Therefore, even a well-regarded central bank could

cause negative spillovers when it does not cover the entire system. Leading up to the recent

financial crisis, shadow banks in the U.S. used their loose supervision to capture larger market

shares and increase their connection to depository institutions through the purchase of mortgage-

backed securities and the sale of credit default swaps. The Fed's lack of direct oversight over the

shadow banking system hampered their attempts to curb this risky behavior and quickly provide

liquidity to the entire system.1 At the same time, individual depositors trusted in the security of

their FDIC covered institutions. Narratives about the crisis argue that the growth of shadow

banking obscured the underlying market risk and left the nation vulnerable; however, it is

difficult to test this narrative using modern data because of the organizational complexity of

commercial and shadow banks.

        The National Banking Era (1863-1914) offers a uniquely valuable testing ground for

examining such spillovers. Private clearinghouse associations were the source of emergency

funds of that time. Each operating in a single city, clearinghouses acted as quasi-central banks,

monitoring bank behavior and providing short-term loan certificates backed by collateral during

panics. However, the private clearinghouses only assisted those banks that chose to join the

association. As many banks remained outside of the associations, the period allows for the

 Even with universal oversight, the Fed might not have prevented a downturn from occurring. For instance, some
banks under the purview of the Fed (e.g., Citibank) still took on excess risk during the 2000s housing market boom.

identification of the effect of clearinghouses based on within-city variation, explicitly controlling

for pre-existing factors that led to clearinghouse entry, local economic factors that influenced

bank stability, and bank-specific characteristics. A comprehensive bank-level database from

Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin from 1880 to

1910 allows this analysis for a large number of cities and years. In addition to having available

annual balance sheet data for the period, these states contained over half of all commercial bank

assets and had a wide range of urban, rural, manufacturing, and agricultural areas.

       Created by groups of commercial banks, clearinghouse associations were established to

facilitate the clearing of checks and bank notes, but quickly evolved to monitor banks, publish

information, and provide emergency liquidity during financial panics (Timberlake, 1984; Gorton,

1985; Gorton and Mullineaux, 1987). Timberlake (1984, p. 2) describes their creation: “In the

absence of a central banking institution, the commercial banks could not effectively cope with

emergency conditions in financial centers. However, the circumstances of their existence

prompted their defense; and the defense they developed in the United States was an extension of

the functions of the clearinghouse associations”. Gorton (1985, p. 277) states that the "powers

and functions that clearinghouses developed most resembled those of a central bank". Cannon

(1910, p. 96) calls them "one of the finest examples the country has ever seen of the ability of the

people when left to themselves to devise impromptu measures for their own relief".

Clearinghouses were created in over 200 cities by 1914, yet membership requirements prevented

many banks from joining and receiving the benefits.

       The disparity between members and non-members was evident during the Panic of 1907.

Banks that were part of the New York City Clearinghouse had few losses, whereas trust

companies that were not members suffered widespread deposit losses. Moen and Tallman (2000)



                                                  2
argue that the difference between the two types of institutions was due to public perception of

emergency liquidity as much as it was on the result of the liquidity itself. Depositors were much

more likely to run on institutions that were not covered by the clearinghouse, even those many

trust companies were found to be solvent when examined. As the clearinghouse refused to assist

banks outside the association, JP Morgan had to coordinate a bailout of the trust companies by

the U.S. Treasury and private individuals to provide liquidity to non-member banks.

        To the extent that non-members believed the presence of a clearinghouse prevented

panics through monitoring or emergency lending, the entry of a clearinghouse might have pushed

them to take more liquidity risk and be more susceptible to panics when they did occur. The

question of whether the entry of the clearinghouse influenced the closure rates and stability of

non-member banks has proved difficult to answer. Moen and Tallman (1994, 2000) and Hoag

(2011) examine clearinghouse members relative to non-members, but they restrict their analysis

to Chicago and New York during the Panics of 1893 and 1907 and find conflicting results.2

        Using a bank-level database stretching over seven states and 30 years, I confirm that the

creation of a clearinghouse significantly decreased the probability of closure for member banks

and significantly increased the probability for non-member banks. The result remains even after

controlling for balance sheet risk, economic growth, and restricting the analysis to just cities that

would establish a clearinghouse.

        Interbank liquidity risk seems to have been behind the differential closure risk amongst

members and non-members. Specifically, the creation of a clearinghouse allowed the location to

become a hub on the interbank deposit network. Banks in other cities began to deposit funds in


2
 While Jaremski (2015) analyzes the effects of clearinghouses on national banks from 1865 through 1914, the study
does not separate members from non-members. Since many national banks did not join the local clearinghouse, the
analysis only captures the effect of the clearinghouses on the average bank rather than on the average member bank.


                                                         3
clearinghouse members to take advantage of their extended clearing networks and access to

emergency funds, whereas non-member banks put more of their own funds on deposit in other

banks mistakenly believing that the creation of a clearinghouse would have protected the city as

a whole from liquidity shocks. As shown by Sprague (1910), Calomiris and Gorton (1991), and

Wicker (2000), the interbank network afforded gains in the efficiency of payment systems, but

during periods of seasonal stringency, it transmitted idiosyncratic shocks across the entire system

and led to nation-wide financial panics. Clearinghouses, therefore, increased systemic liquidity

risk for all banks, but only provided emergency liquidity to member banks when panics occurred.

       Even though clearinghouses increased interbank balances and systemic liquidity risk, the

data show that neither the decision to create a clearinghouse nor the decision to become a

member is related to interbank funds or measures of bank risk. Clearinghouse entry was based on

the population growth of a location, whereas the choice of clearinghouse membership was

related to the number of other banks in the location. The creation of a clearinghouse was thus

primarily a response to the demand for check clearing by local individuals and firms, and the

growth of the interbank network was an added bonus. To put it another, a clearinghouse allowed

banks to connect to the interbank network in a way that population or economic growth would

not have been able to achieve in its absence.

       In this way, the historical period also provides insight into the risks of central

counterparties (CCPs). Just like clearinghouses, CCPs reduce the costs and liquidity risk of

individual members, but at the same time, the resulting concentration of clearing could amplify

systemic risk and transmit shocks across the entire network. The crisis prone nature of the

historical interbank system, therefore, provides a cautionary tale of what could happen as the

system becomes more concentrated and proper risk-control measures are not put into place.



                                                  4
2. The Development of Clearinghouses in the United States
       The nation’s historical payments systems were highly fragmented. The general adherence

to unit banking meant that most banks could not open any branches. The lack of branching

severely increased the costs of clearing, as checks had to be cleared externally rather than

internally. A receiving bank would have had to either physically travel to the paying bank or

mail the check to the paying bank. The first option was easy enough if the receiving and paying

banks were located in the same city but costs rose as the distance between banks increased.

       Two institutions developed to mitigate these costs. The first of these was the interbank

correspondent system. In place of opening branches, banks created relationships with other banks

in key cities instead. The respondent bank opened a deposit account at the correspondent bank,

and the correspondent bank agreed to clear checks drawn on local banks at par (depositing the

proceeds into the respondent’s account). The respondent bank earned interest on its reserves and

gained a way to cheaply clear non-local checks, while the correspondent benefited from having

access to the respondent's funds. The Comptroller of the Currency and many state legislatures

even codified the interbank network into bank requirements by allowing banks to hold reserves

on deposit in a larger city. (James, 1978; James and Weiman, 2010; Bordo and Wheelock, 2013)

       Interbank connections within the network served a secondary purpose: channeling

interregional payments and interbank loans to fund seasonal peaks in local lending that exceeded

local retail deposits. Therefore, even if a bank was not concerned about clearing checks, they still

had an incentive to establish correspondent relationships to receive interest on their idle funds

and receive seasonal liquidity loans. Systemic liquidity risk, however, was an unintended

byproduct. Respondent banks suffered liquidity risk because their correspondent banks might

suspend convertibility of deposits into cash, and leave them without access to their accounts.

Correspondent banks suffered liquidity risk because they might be faced with sudden withdrawal

                                                 5
demands by respondent banks. Banks that were both receivers and providers of funds were the

worst affected, suggesting that those banks in the middle of the interbank network had the most

to lose (Calomiris and Carlson, 2016). Nearly all of the period’s nation-wide panics were caused

by idiosyncratic shocks that were transmitted and multiplied up through the interbank network.

(Sprague, 1910; Calomiris and Gorton, 1991; Wicker, 2000)

           Clearinghouse associations were the second type of institution that mitigated clearing

costs. First started in New York City during 1853, clearinghouses were private organizations

created by banks to reduce shoe leather costs by providing a central location and time to clear

checks and bank notes every day rather than to each local bank individually. Clearinghouses also

provided a central place to clear out-of-town checks and allowed member banks to quickly

redeem the checks sent by its respondent banks through the interbank connections of the entire

membership. This mechanism allowed clearinghouse cities to serve as the hubs on the interbank

network, and granted banks in the city the ability to drawn in even more interbank deposits. To

put it another way, the establishment of the clearinghouse gave a location a distinct institutional

advantage that no amount of population or bank growth could have achieved.

           Clearinghouse membership came with stipulations and requirements. To begin, banks

generally had to pay a fee, submit to a balance sheet examination, and certify their capital stock.

After becoming a member, banks had to submit financial statements, allow examinations, and

were often subject to higher minimum capital requirements and reserve requirements relative to

deposits than existing state regulations.3 These additional requirements could have been an

attempt to reduce the regulatory differences between national and state bank members as much

as they were to protect against risk-taking.


3
    During the period, capital requirements were generally entry barriers rather than prudential regulation.


                                                             6
       The requirements of clearinghouses often discouraged some banks from joining. For

instance, no trust companies became members of the New York City's clearinghouse due to its

high reserve requirements. As a result, only 56.3 percent of the 1,010 banks that operated in the

sample’s clearinghouse cities became members (Table 1). Due to their small size and low

regulations, state banks were less likely to adopt membership than national banks, but many still

became members.

       The ability of clearinghouses to lower costs depended upon establishing relationships

with member banks and keeping operations relatively local. Banks in other cities, therefore,

formed their own associations. The structure and bylaws of associations were fairly homogenous,

often following New York City’s example, and deviations were often changes to reserve

requirements or fees. Figure 1 provides a geographic view of the 59 clearinghouses created in the

sample states by 1910.

       Mutually owned by the member banks, clearinghouses were non-profit organizations and

only charged enough to pay their administrative bills. The determinants of clearinghouse creation

were thus based on the benefits that the clearinghouse offered to members: the cost of clearing

and desire for emergency liquidity. First, because the number of checks that would need to be

cleared in a given day was directly related to the number of people in that location, populated

cities would have benefited most from a centralized clearing system. Indeed, 46 of the 63 cities

in the sample states with more than 30,000 people established a clearinghouse by 1910, and only

2 of the 31 cities with more than 60,000 people did not create a clearinghouse by 1910. The early

expansion of clearinghouses was particularly limited to the largest cities: Cincinnati, Cleveland,

Columbus, Detroit, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, New York City, Philadelphia,




                                                 7
Pittsburgh, St. Paul, and Syracuse. As several clearinghouses were formed with less than five

banks in the city, the number of banks was a secondary factor to population.

       Second, banks might have valued a safety net during panics. Most panics during the

period were crises of systemic liquidity risk associated with moderate increases in insolvency

risk and a small proportion of bank failures. Lacking a central bank to provide funds, solvent

banks sometimes were forced to close their doors. As discussed in the next section,

clearinghouses provided emergency liquidity to member banks during panics. These issues

assisted the banking system and allowed member banks to withstand the panic. In fact, 16

clearinghouses were established within the three years after the Panics of 1893 and 1907, and

most of these were established in small cities, suggesting less of a desire for clearing and more of

a desire for emergency liquidity.



2.1 Clearinghouses as Lenders of Last Resort
       The clearinghouse system evolved to do much more than clear bank debt. During the

Panic of 1857, the policy committee of the New York City Clearinghouse authorized the issue of

clearinghouse loan certificates to qualified member banks. The certificates were backed by

collateral (typically commercial paper or government bonds) from the receiving bank, but they

were drawn on the clearinghouse, making them a joint-liability of the members. Members thus

could conserve their limited currency reserves by settling clearinghouse obligations with

certificates rather than currency, and while member banks were required to accept the certificates

during clearing, they gained interest on holding the certificates. When a member defaulted, the

remaining members bore the loss in proportion to their capital stock.

       Clearinghouse innovated in the subsequent panics. During the Panic of 1860, the New

York City Clearinghouse pooled their members' reserves to create a fund for mutual aid, the

                                                 8
practice was quickly discontinued. The Panic of 1873 ushered in the use of certified checks

which did not require collateral. The Panic of 1893 brought the use of lower denomination

clearinghouse notes which could be given to non-members. Clearinghouses also protected their

members from negative information releases during panics. This protection included replacing

the weekly publication of individual bank statements with the publication of a single aggregate

clearinghouse statement and guarding the names of banks that received loan certificates.

(Gibbons, 1859; Calomiris and Schweikart, 1991)

       The record shows that clearinghouses primarily protected their members from financial

panics and that non-member banks could not rely on them for protection. First, it was not until

the issue of clearinghouse notes in the 1890s that emergency liquidity could directly flow outside

of the association. Even then, many clearinghouses chose not to issue notes at all. Second, given

that interest rates were fixed for all borrowers and members were responsible for losses, the loan

committee had a vested interest in providing good loans. They thoroughly checked the borrowing

bank's collateral assets and often examined the bank itself. Third, clearinghouses did not

authorize any emergency liquidity until a shock began to harm their members. For instance, the

New York City Clearinghouse waited several months before authorizing loan certificates during

the Panic of 1893 because its members were not directly affected by the agricultural shocks that

started the panic.

       While the clearinghouse undoubtedly brought some positive benefits to member banks

during the panics, their public actions might also have caused some negative spillovers to non-

member banks. Moen and Tallman (2000) provide many accounts from the New York Times and

Chicago Daily Tribune on the actions of the clearinghouses. These accounts often highlighted

the protective actions of the clearinghouse and discussed the concern amongst other banks. For



                                                 9
example, the Times reported in October of 1907 that the Knickerbocker Trust Company "had not

been aided by the clearinghouse or JP Morgan and his associates because the company's capital

and surplus was impaired" and that Morgan “did not care to assume the responsibilities of

previous poor management” (p. 150). The reports likely decreased public distress over member

banks, yet increased distress over non-member banks. To put it another way, the clearinghouse

could have concentrated runs on non-member banks, regardless of their asset portfolio.

        Table 1 illustrates the effect of clearinghouses by calculating the fraction of bank closures

in the sample states from 1880 through 1910. The top panel shows that simple comparisons of

banks can be misleading when they do not take account of geographic and economic

characteristics. According to the panel, 35 percent of all member banks closed, yet only 25

percent of all non-member banks closed. However, clearinghouses (and thus members) were in

financial centers that were highly exposed to interbank risk, whereas most non-members were in

small towns that had much less interbank exposure and no clearinghouse. Indeed, the bottom

panel of Table 1 shows that clearinghouse members were much less likely to close than non-

members when restricting the sample to banks in cities with a clearinghouse before 1910.

Compared to the 35 percent of member banks that closed over the thirty year period, almost 55

percent of non-member banks in clearinghouse locations closed. These values amount to annual

probabilities of closure of about 1.2 percent and 1.9 percent respectively.

        These differences across banks in similar locations are dramatic, but could be caused by

endogenous selection into membership based on characteristics such as bank size, composition,

or age. The rest of the paper, therefore, accounts for other factors to isolate the differential effect

of clearinghouses on the closure rates of member and non-member banks.




                                                  10
3. Data
        I combine annual national and state bank data to examine the effect of clearinghouses on

members and non-members. The national bank data come from Jaremski (2013). Culled from the

Comptroller of the Currency's Annual Report, the data contain the annual balance sheet of every

national bank in operation each year. Data are missing for 1885 when balance sheets were not

reported and for 1905 when certain balance sheet items were combined. The state bank balance

sheet data come from the state reports of Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio,

Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.4 Due mostly to states reporting information biennially during the

early 1880s, state bank balance sheets are missing for Indiana in 1880, 1882, and 1884,

Minnesota in 1883, Ohio in 1883 and 1893, and Wisconsin in 1883, 1885, and 1887.

        To create consistent balance sheet measures, one must make some adjustments when

combining the various reports. First, I aggregate unique balance sheet items listed in a few state

reports into more common items. For instance, time deposits, checking deposits, demand

deposits, savings deposits, and certificates of deposits are merged into a single individual

deposits measure. I also avoid extreme outliers and data errors by dropping banks whose

deposits, capital, or loans were equal to total assets. Second, I fill missing balance sheet

observations to avoid years when only one type of bank was observed in a state. The

interpolation begins with a simple linear interpolation of each individual bank’s observations

  Data for Indiana are from the Annual Report of the Auditor of State of the State of Indiana. Data for Michigan are
from the Annual Report of the State Treasurer of the State of Michigan before 1889 and the Annual Report of the
Commissioner of the Banking Department of the State of Michigan thereafter. Data for Minnesota are from the
Report of the Public Examiner of the State of Minnesota to the Governor before 1910 and the Annual Report of the
Banking Department of the State of Minnesota thereafter. Data for New York are from the Annual Report of the
Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York. Data for Ohio are from Annual Report of the Auditor of State to
the Governor of Ohio. Data for Pennsylvania are from the Reports of the Several Banks and Savings Institutions and
Banks Organized under the Free Banking Law of Pennsylvania before 1895 and the Annual Report of the
Commissioner of Banking thereafter. Data for Wisconsin are from the Semi-Annual Statement on the Condition of
State and Private Banks of Wisconsin before 1895, the Annual Report of the Bank Examiner from 1896 to 1902, and
the Annual Report of the Commissioner of Banking thereafter.


                                                        11
(i.e., the midpoint of the two surrounding years). Using the Comptroller of the Currency’s state-

level data in the Annual Reports, I adjust those interpolated values by uniformly shifting all of

the values so that the average change for those imputed values is identical to the observed change

that year in the aggregate value of that variable for banks in that state. Lastly, I define the year of

bank closure as the year after the last balance sheet was published. While I account for reported

or slight name changes, it is possible that a few of these “closures” might be substantial name

changes or mergers. However, as these changes could also have been driven by distress and

insolvency, the results should not be greatly biased. The final database contains 81,721

observations for 3,102 national banks and 4,100 state banks from 1880 through 1910, and covers

over half of all bank assets in the United States.

       Clearinghouse information comes from the Merchants and Bankers Directory (1880-

1889), Rand McNally Bankers Directory (1890-1900), and the Polks Bankers Directory (1901-

1910). The directories provide a list of banks in each year denoting which cities had a

clearinghouse and which banks were members. Because the directories were generally published

in January, I designate membership as the year before the clearinghouse notation first appeared. I

verify or adjust clearinghouse entry dates with Cannon (1900) and the Comptroller’s Annual

Report whenever possible. Two clearinghouses cease operation in the sample. In the empirical

analysis, observations after closure from the county are dropped to avoid identifying on the

closure. Results are similar when the cities are dropped altogether.

       While the bank balance sheets exist for every year, the county-level Census database

assembled by Haines (2004) only contains information each decade. This limitation is restrictive

because many clearinghouses were not created at the end of a decade, and a decennial regression

model would pick up changes occurring before a clearinghouse entered. To obtain more precise



                                                  12
estimates of the effect of clearinghouses, I aggregate counties to their 1880 boundaries and

assume that the county-level census variables grew linearly over time to create estimates for the

years in-between each decennial observation.



4. Empirical Analysis
       Before determining whether clearinghouses affected bank behavior, I explore what led to

the creation of a clearinghouse and what led individual banks to become members. If either

decision was endogenous to the local economic or financial conditions, then we must control for

those conditions before testing for the effect of clearinghouses. I start in Section 4.1 by

examining the decision to create a clearinghouse based on the characteristics of the location and

the characteristics of the banks in that location. I also test whether clearinghouse locations had

differential pre-trends prior to the establishment of a clearinghouse. In Section 4.2, I then

examine the decision of individual banks to become a member based on the characteristics of

their location and balance sheet composition.

       I find that the factors associated with clearinghouse entry and membership are not related

to the risk profile of individual banks, and therefore, after controlling for environmental factors

as explanatory variables, the analysis can be confident of identifying the causal effect of

clearinghouses on bank behavior. First, Section 4.3 examines whether banks altered their balance

sheet composition after the establishment of a local clearinghouse. The analysis examines not

only the behavior of member banks but also the behavior of non-member banks to determine

whether there were differential responses to the creation of the clearinghouse. Second, Section

4.4 examines whether banks were less likely to close after becoming a member. Membership not

only provided banks with the ability to receive emergency liquidity during panics, but it also



                                                 13
provided positive media coverage that mitigated public fears of insolvency. As in the balance

sheet analysis, I separately test the behavior of member and non-member banks.



4.1 Determinants of Clearinghouse Entry
        I model entry using a linear probability model where the dependent variable takes the

value of "1" if a clearinghouse was created in the county during the following year and “0”

otherwise. As the entry of a clearinghouse was likely to have quickly influenced a county’s

banking system but not its economic activity, the banking measures are lagged one year but the

census variables are not. Moreover, observations after a clearinghouse entered are dropped to

avoid any subsequent changes, and counties without banks are dropped to avoid locations that

would not need a clearinghouse. The full specification is:



where      is a vector of county-level variables including the logarithm of population, the

logarithm of farm value per person, and the fraction of the population living in an area of 25,000

people or more. No manufacturing variable can be included in the regressions because none is

available at the county-level for the 1910 Census.                         , and

                are respectively the logarithms of the number of banks, bank assets, due from

banks and due to banks balances in the county in the previous year. When the balance sheet

variables are included alongside the number of banks, their coefficients are identified from the

average size of the balance sheet item, testing whether a few large banks rather than a few small

banks were more likely to start a clearinghouse. Fixed effects for each year ( ) control for

nation-wide shocks such as financial panics and either state or county-fixed effects ( ) control

for local economic conditions.     is the robust error term that is clustered by county. The



                                                14
definitions and summary statistics of the explanatory variables are provided in Table 2.

         Table 3 shows that clearinghouses were attracted to large cities. The coefficients on

population and the fraction living in a place of 25,000 or more are always statistically significant

and positive. The coefficients of both variables are largest when controlling for county-fixed

effects suggesting population growth mattered, not just the level of population. On the other

hand, the other variables suggest that the general size of the banking system matters, but not its

growth or the composition of its banks. The coefficient on the number of banks is positive and

statistically significant in the state-fixed effects regressions (columns (1), (5), and (8)), but

economically small. The logarithm of total assets is only statistically significant when neither

county-fixed effects nor the number of banks are included in the model (column (3)),5 and the

interbank variables are never statistically significant. Therefore, population growth rather than

bank growth seems to have been the main determinant of clearinghouse creation.

         Next, I test whether locations that would create clearinghouses were differentially

growing from those that would not. The model is:



where       is either the number of banks, total assets, individual deposits, due from banks, due to

banks, population, or urbanization,                  is a linear time trend,                           is a dummy

variable that takes a value of “1” if a clearinghouse was eventually established in the location,

    is the robust error term clustered by county, and the rest of the variables retain their prior

definitions. The model is estimated using two different samples. The first sample consists of data

from 1880 through 1890 and contains only those locations that had not established a


5
  The reduction in the effect of bank assets suggests that the overall size of the banking system mattered rather than
the distribution amongst banks. Indeed, using a Gini Coefficient of assets to account for the size distribution of
banks directly produces a negative but insignificant correlation with clearinghouse entry.


                                                          15
clearinghouse by 1890. The second sample consists of data from 1880 through 1900 and contains

only those locations that had not established a clearinghouse before 1900.

       Table 4 indicates that there were no differential trends in locations’ balance sheets before

they established a clearinghouse. The only bank variable that displays a differential pre-trend is

the number of banks in the 1880 through 1900 sample. However, confirming the result of Table

3, the population and urbanization of clearinghouse locations were growing much faster than

non-clearinghouse locations.

       To be clear, these results do not imply that the banking systems of clearinghouse

locations were stagnant, but rather imply that any differential bank growth was due to differential

population growth. Indeed, the coefficients suggest that places with high population growth were

also experiencing high bank growth, particularly for growth in the number of banks and due to

banks balances. Population growth thus brought in more banks, interbank liabilities, and

clearinghouses. As such, the models in the rest of the paper control for population as a separate

variable to avoid confounding the effect of a clearinghouse with the effect of population.



4.2. Determinants of Clearinghouse Membership
       The next potential source of endogeneity is the individual membership decision by banks.

Finding a proper control group for examining the choice of membership is more complicated

than controlling for location. Regardless of their composition, banks could not join a

clearinghouse if one did not exist in their city. The presence of a clearinghouse also could have

altered the decisions of entering banks. To mitigate these issues, I limit the sample to a cross-

section of banks in the year before a clearinghouse opened in their city. Each bank’s membership

decision is then observed just prior to when it was first confronted with a clearinghouse. The



                                                 16
restriction drops potentially endogenous new banks and banks that did not have a choice to join a

clearinghouse. The model is:



where        is a dummy denoting whether the bank became a member of a clearinghouse in the

following year,             and           are the logarithms of the number of national and state

banks in the county respectively,         is the logarithm of the bank’s age,        is a dummy

variable for whether the bank was a state bank,        is a vector of balance sheet items described

below, and        is the robust error term clustered by county. Due to the limited number of

clearinghouses established each year and banks per location, year and county-fixed effects are

not included in the model.

        I have chosen several key balance sheet risk indicators based on historical studies of

banking and the CAMELS measures used by modern bank regulators. Ln(Assets) measures bank

size. The ratio of Capital to Assets (where capital contains paid-in capital as well as surplus and

retained earnings) measures capital adequacy and insolvency risk. The ratio of Cash to Deposits

measures the bank’s capacity to meet bank runs in currency. The ratio of Loans to Assets

measures the size of a bank’s loan portfolio, and the ratio of Real Estate Owned to Assets is

included as a proxy for loan risk. Used by studies such as Calomiris and Mason (1997, 2003),

real estate owned contains foreclosed properties and is the best proxy of previous loan failures

available because the reports of the Comptroller and state officials do not include information on

income or asset quality. The ratios of Due From Banks to Assets and Due to Banks to Liabilities

measure the size of interbank relationships and the bank's exposure to other market participants.

The summary statistics of each variable are provided in Table 2.




                                                  17
        Table 5 shows that state banks were not necessarily more or less likely to become

clearinghouse members than national banks after controlling for age, location-specific factors,

and composition. Instead, banks located in towns with few other banks were the most likely to

adopt a membership. The results make intuitive sense given the sample captures founding

members. Banks in a city with few banks would only have started a clearinghouse if they all

agreed to join. Alternatively, the balance sheet characteristics are not significant determinants of

membership. Appendix Table A.1 shows that the results are similar when adding observations

from Illinois between 1889 and 1910 to the model, suggesting that the lack of statistical

significance is not just due to the low number of observations.

        The data indicate that the decision to become a clearinghouse member is based on a

bank’s environment rather than its balance sheet composition. However, the piecemeal approach

might mask the overall risk of banks’ portfolios. To examine overall risk, I estimate the

determinants of bank closures for two samples. The first examines the determinants of closure

for all locations without an active clearinghouse and the second examines the determinants of

closure for only clearinghouse locations before they gained a clearinghouse. Both samples avoid

any changes that the entry of a clearinghouse could have had on bank outcomes, and each

provides a different comparison group by which to measure risk. The model is:




where     is the robust error term clustered by bank and the rest of the variables retain their

definitions. Using the coefficients in Appendix Table A.2, I calculate each bank’s predicted

portfolio risk in the year before a clearinghouse entered. I then estimate equation (3) using

predicted portfolio risk as the only control variable. Seen in Table 6, the coefficient on both


                                                 18
predicted risk variables are negative but not statistically significant. As such, the results suggest

that selection into clearinghouse membership was not determined by individual bank risk and I

can proceed to analyze the effect of clearinghouses on bank outcomes.



4.3 Effect of Clearinghouses on Balance Sheets
       The previous sections have indicated that clearinghouse entry was based on a location’s

population and that banks in locations with few surrounding banks were more likely to join an

entering clearinghouse. While controlling for these factors that led to clearinghouse entry and

membership, the next step is to examine the behavior of banks after the entry of a clearinghouse

became members, starting with changes to their balance sheet composition.

       A detailed model is needed to isolate the effect of clearinghouses on bank balance sheets.

First, I control for the determinants of clearinghouse entry by including each county’s

population, urbanization, and farm value as well as the number of state and national banks.

Second, I include the logarithm of the bank’s age to capture growth trends that existed over the

lifetime of the bank, year-fixed effects to capture effects that existed across the financial system

in a given year, and bank-fixed effects to capture time invariant bank characteristics. Third, I

drop banks that entered a county after a clearinghouse was established because their composition

might have been endogeneous to the existing clearinghouse and drop banks in a city that

established a clearinghouse before 1880 because the model would not be able to separate the

bank-fixed effect and the clearinghouse dummy for those banks. Finally, to estimate the spillover

effects on non-members, I create a separate indicator variable that denotes whether the bank was

in a city with a clearinghouse but was not a member. The model takes the form of:




                                                  19
where          is a dummy denoting whether the bank was in a clearinghouse city and was a

member in the current year,                   is a dummy denoting whether the bank was in a

clearinghouse city but was not a member in the current year,                is a vector of bank-fixed effects,

    is the robust error term clustered by bank, and the other variables retain their definitions.

         The first column of each set in Table 7 shows that banks changed their balance sheet

composition after joining a clearinghouse. Member banks grew their total assets by 9 percent and

increased their proportion of due to banks balances by 0.8 percentage points.6 The second

column of each set shows that banks that did not choose to become members increased their

proportion of due from banks balances by 1.4 percentage points. The results also suggest that

non-member banks received some additional interbank liabilities after the creation of a

clearinghouse. The lack of statistical significance suggests that this effect was not universal. As

many interbank relationships were long-lived, respondent banks might have chosen to deepen

their relationship with a non-member bank rather than start a new relationship with a member

bank.

         While the effects on the interbank measures might seem small, they are over and above

the rise in total assets (and liabilities) as well as the trend in population. Indeed, in Appendix

Table A.4, the effect of a clearinghouse on the logarithms of due to banks and due from banks

balances ranged from 20 to 42 percent even with population as a control. The arrival of a

clearinghouse thus led to a large expansion of a location’s interbank balances and its exposure to

systemic liquidity risk. Most panics during the period were driven by seasonal stringency and

bank suspensions in other locations. Respondent banks lost access to their deposits in


6
 The effects of a clearinghouse’s entry had slightly different effects on state and national bank members. Table A.3
shows that state banks took on a little less risk and national banks took on a little more risk after becoming a
member. However, there is no differential effect on state member bank stability in Table A.5.


                                                         20
correspondent banks, and correspondent banks experienced runs from their respondent banks.

Even solvent banks might have been forced to close as a result of illiquidity.

       The effect of clearinghouse entry on interbank balances is not surprising. The

establishment of a clearinghouse provided the city with a central location to clear debt and

connected the correspondent networks of member banks. It thus vaulted a city from the edge of

the interbank network into the middle and allowed banks to become integrated in a way that

neither economic nor bank growth could have achieved. The differential interbank changes at

member and non-member banks likely reflect that: (1) banks in other locations saw increased

value from the connection of the member banks’ clearing networks and their access to

emergency funds and (2) non-member banks believed that the clearinghouse would provide

liquidity in times of panic and thus sought to receive interest on their reserves by placing them

on deposit in other banks. Many of the clearinghouses established after 1900 had full

membership amongst local banks, suggesting they learned from previous panics when

clearinghouses did not provide funds to non-members. Moreover, the data suggest that some

non-member banks placed funds in local clearinghouse member banks in order to have access to

their clearing networks.

       With some measures increasing and some decreasing, it is helpful to examine the overall

effect of clearinghouses on pre-clearinghouse balance sheet risk. I therefore test whether total

portfolio risk changed after the entry of a clearinghouse using the two predicted pre-

clearinghouse risk measures calculated in the previous section. In Table 8, the coefficients show

that member banks decreased their pre-clearinghouse predicted risk after the entry of a

clearinghouse. The negative coefficients on non-member banks suggest an overall reduction in

predicted risk, but it is not statistically significant. Therefore, the entry of a clearinghouse does



                                                  21
not seem to increase typical insolvency or loan risk, but rather increased systemic liquidity risk

of all banks by making the city a hub on the interbank network.



4.4 Effect of Clearinghouses on Bank Closure
       Similar to equation (4) except with the addition of clearinghouse member dummy, I

model the probability of closure over the following year using the model:




where the variables retain their previous definitions. In this case, I include either state or county-

fixed effects because the use of bank-fixed effects would restrict the examination in two ways.

First, the analysis could not include banks that survived the period as the fixed effects would

completely determine the outcome of surviving banks. Second, the inclusion of bank-fixed

effects (or demeaning the variables) would prevent the examination of any constant balance

sheet differences between banks. As such, the model would not be able to compare big and small

banks but rather would compare banks that were growing at different rates.

       In Table 9, banks that became members of the local clearinghouse were 0.8 to 1.6

percentage points less likely to close even after controlling of balance sheet risk, population

growth, and the size for the banking system.

       Bank closures were also more prevalent in high population counties. A 10 percent

increase in population increased the probability of closure by 0.08 to 0.3 percentage points.

Population not only captures the number of watchful depositors and size of potential bank runs,

but also captures interbank liquidity risk. The inclusion of population is thus important to control

for factors that would make banks in large cities more likely to close than those in rural areas. In

the following analysis, the model is also explicitly limited to clearinghouse locations to provide a

                                                  22
more homogenous comparison group. Appendix Table A.6 shows that the effects of interbank

funds and population are larger but the other results are similar when dropping rural areas from

the sample.

       The coefficients on the balance sheet ratios show that small banks with high proportions

of capital, real estate owned, and due to banks were more likely to close. When county fixed

effects are included in column (4), the probability of closure decreases by 0.19 percentage points

for every 10 percent increase in assets, increases by 0.54 percentage points for every 10

percentage point increase in capital to assets, and increases 0.51 percentage points for every 10

percentage point increase in due to banks to liabilities. Applying the balance sheet coefficients in

column (3) of Table 9 to the balance sheet changes in the first column of each set in Table 7

indicates that member banks reduced their probability of closure by 0.169 percentage points after

the entry of a clearinghouse.

       The evidence suggests that clearinghouses made member banks less likely to close, but

did they also affect surrounding non-members? Unlike the balance sheet regressions that

examine only the time series variation of bank membership, the bank closure regressions also

examine cross-sectional variation. The focus on both types of variation creates a problem when

including both clearinghouse dummies because the model would compare member and non-

member banks in populated cities that were subject to high interbank risk with banks in the

surrounding rural areas that were not as exposed. To avoid this problem, I drop cities that never

received a clearinghouse and focus only on cities that created a clearinghouse between 1880 and

1910, leaving the model to compare banks in similar locations before and after they created a

clearinghouse. The model is now:




                                                 23
where the variables retain their previous definitions.

       The regressions results in Table 10 indicate that members were less likely and non-

members were more likely to close after the entry of a clearinghouse. In column (4), the entry of

a clearinghouse increased the probability of closure by 3.2 percentage points for non-members

and decreased the probability of closure by 1 percentage point for members. The coefficient for

clearinghouse members falls just above the 10 percent cutoff when both state-fixed effects and

balance sheet measures are included in column (3), but it still remains economically significant.

       Comparing Tables 9 and 10, population becomes an even larger determinant of bank

closure in the clearinghouse location sample. The coefficients on the proportions of due to banks

and due from banks balances also significantly increase, confirming that interbank risk is more

prevalent in clearinghouse locations than areas that did not have a clearinghouse. The

comparison of tables also shows that positive and significant coefficient on the capital to assets

ratio is mitigated when focusing on clearinghouse locations, suggesting that the result was driven

by a comparison of banks in large financial centers that would have had higher failure rates and

capital requirements with banks in rural areas that would not.

       Again it is useful to calculate the size of a clearinghouse’s effect on closure through

balance sheet changes. Applying the balance sheet changes estimated in the second column of

each set in Table 7 to the coefficients in column (4) of Table 10 indicates there were small

reductions in risk for both types of banks. The probability of closure was reduced by 0.17

percentage points for the balance sheet changes of members and was reduced by 0.07 percentage

points for the balance sheet changes of non-members. Indeed, other than the shift towards


                                                 24
interbank liabilities for members and interbank assets for non-members, the rest of the balance

sheet changes generally lowered the loan and insolvency risk profile of banks.

       The empirical evidence is clear: the entry of a clearinghouse helped banks that became

members and hurt others. Even after comparing banks in the same city and controlling for

balance sheet composition, a member bank was less likely to close and a non-member bank was

more likely to close. The analysis suggests that the negative effect is not through increasing loan

or insolvency risk, but rather through increasing systemic liquidity risk and hanging non-member

banks out to dry during liquidity panics. Member banks could receive emergency liquidity to

help them weather the panic and remain open, while non-member banks had to make due with

whatever cash reserves they started with. The arrival of a clearinghouse also created a clear

public separation between “protected” and “unprotected” banks during panics. Depositors would

have been more likely to run on a bank that was not covered by a clearinghouse than one that

was regardless of their composition. Indeed, clearinghouse banks published weekly balance sheet

statistics compared to other banks that only provided them at most every quarter, leaving less

uncertainty about member banks than others during the panics.



5. Conclusion
       Kroszner (2000, p.158) writes "the 'lesson' learned from [the Panic of 1907] was that the

clearinghouse mechanism appeared to be inadequate to serve the financial system of the U.S. and

was used as a motivation for the creation of the Federal Reserve System.” This paper highlights

the positive and negative impacts of clearinghouses and why a more inclusive institution was

needed. For starters, the clearinghouse system audited its members’ balance sheets and provided

emergency liquidity during panics. As a result, member banks were less likely to close over the

highly cyclical period. However at the same time, the entry of a clearinghouse negatively

                                                25
influenced the stability of surrounding banks that did not become members. Because less than

60% of banks in clearinghouse cities became members, the introduction of clearinghouses might

have endangered the financial system as much as they stabilized it.

       Interbank liquidity risk seems to be the mechanism behind the differential closure risk.

The creation of a clearinghouse moved a location from the edge of the interbank network into the

middle. Seeking to take advantage of the clearing network of members, respondent banks in

other locations deposited funds into clearinghouse members. Banks that were not members of the

clearinghouse, on the other hand, began to deposit significantly more of their money in

correspondent banks, potentially under the mistaken belief that the location's clearinghouse

would protect them from liquidity shocks. The growth introduced systemic liquidity risk to an

area as both respondent and correspondent banks were influenced by shocks to other parts of the

system. As clearinghouses only provided emergency liquidity to member banks, non-member

banks would be left without needed funds when a panic occurred. Clearinghouses also mitigated

depositors’ fears of member banks by publically supporting member banks' solvency, while at

the same time casting suspicion on non-member banks.

       The exclusivity of the clearinghouses was a reason why the nation passed the Federal

Reserve Act (1913) rather than encouraging the expansion of the clearinghouse system. As

described by Wicker (2005), the establishment of a central bank was not just about emergency

relief to illiquid banks during panics. If it was the goal, then the combined funds issued under the

Aldrich-Vreeland Act (1908) and the clearinghouse system were likely sufficient (Jacobson and

Tallman, 2013). Instead the adoption of a central bank was an attempt to provide stability to the

entire banking system over time—something the exclusionary approaches of clearinghouses

could not achieve. First, the Federal Reserve forced every national bank to become a member



                                                26
and strongly encouraged state banks and trust companies to join. The pressure reduced the

number of non-protected banks and made sure that a lender of last resort was available to banks

in all cities. Second, it installed an active lender of last resort that was available to provide

emergency and seasonal liquidity during all periods rather than just during financial panics. The

accessibility of the discount window protected banks from all economic fluctuations and not just

wide-scale problems (Miron, 1986). Third, the Fed attempted to take over the interbank network

by forcing member banks to hold reserves at the Fed rather than in correspondent banks and

offering to clear checks at par. By placing reserves at the Fed instead of large correspondent

banks, the Fed sought to remove the systemic liquidity risk that led to the period’s many panics.

        While the Federal Reserve was intended to unify the banking system, it never stretched

over the entire system, and inevitably, the connection between institutions inside and outside the

system led to the depth of both the Great Depression and Great Recession. In 1929, only about

35 percent of state and national banks were members of the Fed. These non-member banks relied

heavily on their interbank networks for liquidity, just as they had during the National Banking

Period (Calomiris et al., 2015). However when the panic started, country banks withdrew their

deposits from money center banks specifically when they were needed the most (Mitchener and

Richardson, 2015). Leading up to the Great Recession, institutions moved outside the purview of

the Fed to avoid regulations and oversight. Again these institutions created tight connections to

the formal banking sector. Therefore, as their securitized assets took losses from the collapse of

the housing sector, they pulled the rest of the system down with them. This study along with the

historical narrative emphasizes policies that unify financial regulation and decrease the number

of institutions outside the formal system. By making sure that most if not all financial institutions




                                                   27
are under the same regulator, aggregate risks will be able to be properly measured and actions

taken by the regulator during panics would be more effective.

       The results also offer a cautionary tale on the recent push towards CCPs. In late 2009, the

G20 mandated that all standardized over-the-counter derivatives should be cleared through

CCPs. Similar to historical clearinghouses, CCPs reduce risk amongst participants by

multilaterally netting trades and imposing broader risk control measures, but the resulting

concentration could transmit shocks across financial markets and increase systemic risk. While

they fared well during the recent financial crisis as a small portion of the market (Cecchetti,

Gyntelberg, and Hollanders, 2009), the recent regulatory push has greatly expanded the number

and types of derivatives handled by CCPs (Domanski, Gambacorta, and Picillo, 2015; Rahman,

2015). Just as in the historical period (Calomiris and Carlson, 2016), the growing concentration

will only increase the exposure to systemic risk and could lead to large-scale financial crises. The

concern over systemic risk has been voiced by a number of recent studies including Duffie and

Zhu (2011), CPSS-IOSCO (2012), Steigerwald (2013), Domanski, Gambacorta, and Picillo

(2015), Wendt (2015), and Park and Abruzzo (2016), but there are few modern examples in

which to study the dynamics.

Notes: Table presents the fraction of banks that became a member of their local clearinghouse and their closure rate
over the period. The statistics are broken down for all banks, only national banks, and only state banks. Since
clearinghouses could have been attracted to certain types of locations the table displays the result for the full
sample as well as just those locations that gained a clearinghouse. Data span Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New
York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

Notes: Table presents the results of an OLS regression. The dependent variable is whether or not a county gained a clearinghouse in that particular year. Each
observation is a county-year and the sample spans Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Counties that had a clearinghouse
before 1880 or did not have a bank are dropped. Counties are also dropped from the sample after a clearinghouse was established. Dollar values are deflated to 1900
using Officer (2008). Robust standard errors clustered by county are provided in brackets. * denotes significance at 10%; ** at 5% level and *** at 1% level.

Notes: Table presents the results of an OLS regression. The dependent variable is whether the bank
became a member of the local clearinghouse in the first year it opened. The sample consists of banks in
Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin in the year prior to when
a clearinghouse entered their city. The predicted portfolio risk measure is obtained by applying the
regressions results of Table A.2 which examines the probability of bank failure in each period before a
clearinghouse entered as a function of bank and locational characteristics to the portfolios of each bank.
The two different risk measures come from estimating the bank failure regression using all banks
without a clearinghouse or when restricting the sample to only clearinghouse counties before a
clearinghouse entered. Dollar values are deflated to 1900 using Officer (2008). Robust standard errors
clustered by county are provided in brackets. * denotes significance at 10%; ** at 5% level and *** at

Notes: Table presents the results of an OLS regression. The dependent variable is described in the column
heading. Each observation is a bank-year and the sample spans Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Banks that entered after a clearinghouse was established and locations
that created a clearinghouse before 1880 are dropped. The predicted portfolio risk measure is obtained by
applying the regression results of Table A.2 which examines the probability of bank failure in each period as
a function of bank and locational characteristics to the portfolios of each bank. The two different risk
measures come from estimating the bank failure regression using a sample of all banks without a
clearinghouse or when restricting the sample to only clearinghouse counties before a clearinghouse entered.
Dollar values are deflated to 1900 using Officer (2008). Robust standard errors clustered by bank are
provided in brackets. * denotes significance at 10%; ** at 5% level and *** at 1% level.

Notes: Table presents the results of an OLS regression. The dependent variable is whether the bank became a
member of the local clearinghouse in the first year it started. The sample consists of banks in the year prior to when
a clearinghouse entered their city. In addition to Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and
Wisconsin, this sample also contains Illinois banks in the year before a clearinghouse was established in their city
from 1889 to 1910 to determine whether the results are driven by small sample sizes. Dollar values are deflated to
1900 using Officer (2008). Robust standard clustered by county are provided in brackets. * denotes significance at
10%; ** at 5% level and *** at 1% level.

 Notes: Table presents the results of an OLS regression. The dependent variable is described in the column heading. Each observation is a bank-year
 and the sample spans Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Banks that entered after a clearinghouse was
 established and locations that established a clearinghouse before 1880 are dropped. Dollar values are deflated to 1900 using Officer (2008). Robust
 standard errors clustered by bank are provided in brackets. * denotes significance at 10%; ** at 5% level and *** at 1% level.

 Notes: Table presents the results of an OLS regression. The dependent variable is whether or not the bank closed in the following year. Each
 observation is a bank-year and the sample spans Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. All banks in
 rural counties (denoted as those without a place of 2,500 people) are dropped. Column headings provide the sample of banks used. Dollar values
 are deflated to 1900 using Officer (2008). Robust standard errors clustered by bank are provided in brackets. * denotes significance at 10%; ** at
 5% level and *** at 1% level.
