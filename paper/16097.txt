                                              ABSTRACT

Using a panel of U.S. school districts spanning 1970 – 2000, we examine the relationship between
income inequality and fiscal support for public education. In contrast with recent theoretical and empirical
work suggesting a negative relationship between inequality and public spending, we find results consistent
with a median voter model, in which inequality that reduces the median voter’s tax share induces higher
local spending on public education. We estimate that 12 to 22 percent of the increase in local school
spending over this period is attributable to rising inequality.

1. Introduction

        According to the U.S. Census Bureau, inequality in household income as measured by the

Gini coefficient rose more than 20 percent from 1969 to 2006, an increase driven largely by income

growth in the top half of the distribution (Gottschalk 1997; Goldin and Katz 2001; Piketty and Saez

2003; Autor, Katz, and Kearney 2008).1 This surge has prompted two important and related strands

of research. The first has sought explanations for the growth in inequality, focusing primarily on

changes in the distribution of wages and earnings.2 A second has sought to assess the social and

economic consequences of growing inequality, including effects on mortality and health (Kawachi,

Kennedy, and Wilkinson 1999; Deaton 2001; Mellor and Milyo 2002) crime (Kelly 2000; Fajnzylber,

Lederman, and Loayza 2002), civic engagement and trust (Alesina and La Ferrara 2000, 2002; Costa

and Kahn 2003), and economic growth (Benabou 1996; Forbes 2000).

        Related to this second strand is a growing literature on the impact of inequality on the

demand for public goods and income redistribution. The recent literature in this field has found that

inequality and population heterogeneity more broadly defined tend to be associated with a lower level

of redistribution and support for public services, both across nations and within sub-national

jurisdictions (Goldin and Katz 1997; Alesina, Baqir, and Easterly 1999; Alesina, Glaeser, and

Sacerdote 2001; Luttmer 2001; Lind 2007; Fernandez and Levy 2008).




1 The Gini coefficients of household income in 1969, 1979, 1989, 1999, and 2006 were 0.391, 0.404, 0.431,
0.458, and 0.470 (U.S. Census Bureau 2008a). Gini coefficients for family income in these same years were
0.349, 0.365, 0.401, 0.429, and 0.444—consistently smaller, but increasing at a faster rate over time. The U.S.
is not unique in this trend—other industrialized nations witnessed a similar rise in inequality over this
period—but few experiences match that of the United States in terms of magnitude (Gottschalk and
Smeeding 1997; Kenworthy and Pontusson 2005).
2 One group of results suggests that skill-biased technological change, and—to a lesser degree—globalization

and trade are the primary forces driving earnings inequality (Katz and Autor 1999; Autor, Katz, and Kearney
2008) while a competing group of papers argues that institutional factors such as the minimum wage and
declining unionization have driven the rise in inequality (Card and DiNardo 2002; Dinardo, Fortin, and
Lemieux 1996).


                                                                                                             1
       This literature often stands in sharp contrast to the basic predictions of standard voting

models. In a classic set of papers, Meltzer and Richard (1981, 1983) proposed that under majority

rule, income inequality can result in greater public spending whenever mean income rises relative to

that of the median voter. In this model, growing wealth at the top of the income distribution lowers

the tax price of raising revenue, allowing the median voter to obtain greater public services at a

lower cost to them. Empirically, this model has met with mixed success over the years (Meltzer and

Richard 1983; Husted and Kenny 1997; Gouveia and Masia 1998; Alesina, Glaeser, and Sacerdote

2001; Borge and Raatsø 2003; Kenworthy and Pontusson 2005).

       One plausible explanation for the mixed evidence in favor of the Meltzer-Richard hypothesis

is that most of its empirical tests are applied in settings where the model’s assumptions are unlikely

to hold. The voting model in these papers presumes direct or representative democracy in which

voting is over a single-dimensional policy space and voters have single-peaked preferences over

policy options (Borck 2007). These assumptions are more likely to be approximated in local

government than in national ones, yet the Meltzer-Richard hypothesis is most often examined in a

national context (Turnbull and Mitias 1999; Fischel 2001; Mueller 2003).

       In this paper, we draw upon a balanced panel of more than 10,300 local school districts

spanning 1970 – 2000 to explore the relationship between rising income inequality and fiscal support

for public elementary and secondary education. In contrast with recent theoretical and empirical

work suggesting a negative relationship between inequality and public spending, we find results more

consistent with the Meltzer and Richard hypothesis—rising income inequality appears to be

associated with higher per-student expenditure in local school districts, driven primarily by an

increase in revenues from local sources. Given the redistributive nature of education, our results

suggest that some of the potentially negative consequences of rising social inequality may have been




                                                                                                    2
counteracted by local government’s ability to raise additional funds from growing incomes at the top

of the distribution.

        The empirical relationship between inequality in income and spending on public education is

an important one for several reasons. First, K-12 education is a significant component of the public

budget. It comprised upwards of 29 percent of aggregate state and local government expenditure in

2006, a larger share than any other general expenditure category (U.S. Census Bureau 2010). If any

public service were likely to be affected by changes in the income distribution, education should.

Second, not all households directly benefit from the quality and quantity of publicly provided

education. Households without school age children, the elderly, and families with children in private

schools may only indirectly benefit from investments in public education. As a result, the income

and demographic composition of the electorate will play an important role in the overall support for

public education (Cutler, Elmendorf, and Zeckhauser 1993; Poterba 1997; Harris, Evans, and

Schwab 2001). Third, the level and distribution of school spending has historically been tightly

linked with income (Goldin and Katz 1997; Hoxby 1998; Fernandez and Rogerson 2001). Much has

been written about the effects of income inequality on spending disparities across jurisdictions, but

less is known about the consequences of rising inequalities within districts. Fourth, theoretical work

has highlighted an important mechanism by which inequality can affect educational spending when

there are private alternatives: a coalition of the “ends against the middle” that reduces public school

spending (Epple and Romano 1996). This hypothesis has received insufficient empirical attention.

Finally, public education has an important redistributive aspect to it (Besley and Coate 1991; Hoxby

2003), and heterogeneity in income and hence school spending has implications for the level and

dispersion of income in subsequent generations (Benabou 1996).

        In our analysis, we begin by examining the relationship between income inequality within

school districts and local spending on K-12 education. Given the nature of education spending and



                                                                                                     3
our data set, we are able to address omitted variables to a much greater degree than in previous

work. Our use of panel data allows us to control for fixed characteristics of localities that would

contaminate cross-sectional analyses, and the fact that we have multiple observations per state per

year allows us to control for state-specific time varying shocks to school spending. We use variation

in spending brought about by court-ordered education finance reform to deal with the potential

endogeneity of intergovernmental grants. Further, we exploit the strong predictions of the median

voter model to construct arguably exogenous variation in income inequality, generated by changes in

the skewness of the income distribution.

        Estimating the relationship between within-district income inequality and local education

spending introduces several challenges. First, proponents of the Tiebout (1956) model might suspect

a relatively low level of income inequality in local districts, to the extent the demand for education is

related to income and households have the ability to sort into communities in line with their

preferences for school spending. In fact, we show that the lion’s share of income inequality in

metropolitan areas is within school districts, rather than between them, a feature of MSAs that

changed little over this period (see also Rhode and Strumpf 2003). Still, we address sorting in part

through the use of a within-group estimator that relies on changes in income inequality within

districts over time. Second, education finance during the 1970 – 2000 period was characterized by a

steady shift away from local funding and toward greater state funding, fueled in part by court-

ordered finance reforms (Murray, Evans, and Schwab 1998; Hoxby 2001; Corcoran and Evans

2008). On the one hand, this shift has diminished the importance of variation in local dollars, as

states have sought to equalize school spending. On the other hand, greater centralization may have

weakened pressures to sort by income (Aaronson 1999; Nechyba 2003). Among other things, our

models of local spending include controls for intergovernmental grants, as well as state-specific time

effects to account for the level effects of state finance reforms.



                                                                                                       4
       We next consider the relationship between within-district income inequality and the level of

expenditure and state aid per student. In making public spending decisions, local households are

concerned with both their local tax burden and the overall level of per-student expenditure. In the

U.S., education is a shared responsibility between local, state, and federal governments, and in many

cases, the structure of state aid programs influence the tax price of local spending (Hoxby, 2001).

Our models of expenditure per student thus capture the net effect of growing inequality on overall

expenditure per student. Finally, we examine the relationship between within-district income

inequality and rates of private school enrollment. We hypothesize that private enrollment will

respond to income inequality through several channels: families’ enrollment response to fiscal

changes brought about by changes in income inequality, to changes in the peer composition of

schools that accompanies higher inequality, or both.



2. Theoretical Framework

a. Inequality and Public Finance

       In recent years a growing literature in public finance has examined how inequality and

population heterogeneity impact the demand for public goods. Much of this literature attempts to

explain differences in government size and income redistribution policies across nations and within

countries over time. In a classic set of papers, Meltzer and Richard (1981, 1983) proposed a simple

model where the electorate votes via majority rule on a system of income redistribution funded by a

proportional income tax. They showed that changes in the relative position of the decisive (median)

voter in the income distribution can affect the level of redistribution and thus the size of

government. Specifically, they showed that growth in mean income relative to the median lowers the

“tax price” of redistribution facing the median voter, who rationally votes for greater government




                                                                                                   5
spending.3 The Meltzer-Richard model has been tested empirically in multiple contexts, with mixed

results. In the United States, Husted and Kenny (1997) found that extension of the voting franchise

led to greater state welfare spending as the income of the median voter fell relative to statewide

income.4 In contrast, cross-national comparisons of government spending in developed countries

have been less supportive of the Meltzer-Richard hypothesis (Perotti 1996; Benabou 1996).

Comparing U.S. and European welfare policies, Alesina, Glaeser, and Sacerdote (2001) note that

pre-tax income inequality is considerably higher in the U.S. than in European countries, while it is

Europe that has larger welfare systems on average.5

        An outgrowth of this literature asks whether racial and ethnic heterogeneity influences

support for public spending, if perhaps for different reasons. Alesina, Glaeser, and Sacerdote (2001)

found that racial heterogeneity can explain much of the variation in redistributive spending across

developed countries. Within the U.S., Luttmer (2001) modeled individual preferences for welfare

spending as dependent upon the share of beneficiaries from the same socioeconomic or ethnic

group. His analysis of the General Social Survey showed that while individual support for

redistribution decreases in the number of area welfare recipients, support increases with the fraction

of local recipients who are of the same race (see also Lind 2007). Similarly, Alesina, Baqir, and

Easterly (1999) showed in a cross-section of U.S. metropolitan areas that public expenditure on

education, roads, libraries, sewers, and trash pickup is negatively related to within-MSA ethnic

fragmentation. Cutler, Elemendorf, and Zeckhauser (1993) found analogous results at the county



3 This assumes a non-symmetric, positively skewed income distribution. Technically, the tax price of local
public goods—the cost to a taxpayer of an additional unit of services—is a function of more than just the tax
share (the proportion of the total tax base held by the taxpayer). In the case of education, the tax price will
also include the number of students per taxpayer, the per-student labor cost of teachers, and the like.
4 See Gouveia and Masia (1998), Borge and Raatsø (2003), and Perotti (1993) for contrasting evidence. Borck

(2007) provides a review of voting models of redistribution and empirical evidence on these models.
5 More recently, however, Kenworthy and Pontusson (2005) show that nations that experienced the largest

increases in inequality in the 1980s and 1990s experienced the greatest increases in redistribution.


                                                                                                             6
level, and demonstrated that the effects of population characteristics on public spending differ

considerably between levels of government (see also Turnbull and Mitias 1999).



b. Inequality and the Support for Public Education

        How income inequality and heterogeneity impact spending on public education is a

particularly interesting question, for several reasons. First, as mentioned previously, it is the largest

expenditure category in most state and local government budgets. Second, education is often

characterized as a publicly provided private good, where benefits are targeted disproportionately to a

minority of the population. To the extent interpersonal preferences for redistribution of the type

exemplified in Luttmer (2001) exist, they may be particularly important in education. Finally, the

presence of private alternatives to public education may alter the balance of political support for

public schooling in more heterogeneous populations.

        Epple and Romano (1996) provided an intriguing example of the latter. They argued that for

public goods like education where private options exist, the likely majority voting equilibrium will be

one in which there are two opposing coalitions of voters—one comprised of high- and low-income

households who prefer a low level of expenditure on public education, and another made up of

middle-income households who prefer a high level of school spending. This coalition of high and

low income families oppose greater education spending for different reasons: the low income group

prefers lower taxes and a greater level of consumption, while high income families opt for private

schools. In this case, greater income inequality increases the likelihood of an “ends against the

middle” result, with lower spending on public education and higher rates of private schooling.6

        Evidence favoring the “ends against the middle” hypothesis can be found in the expansion

of secondary schooling in the United States in the early 20th century, as demonstrated by Goldin and

6See Glomm and Ravikumar (1998) for an alternative model with private schooling options, where the
median voter is decisive.


                                                                                                       7
Katz (1997). They found that communities which supported the expansion of secondary education

were more likely to have relatively equal income distributions, as well as populations more

homogeneous in religious affiliation or ethnic background. The more heterogeneous communities

lagged behind in the growth of secondary schooling.

        Dimensions of community heterogeneity other than income have also been shown to play

an important role in the political support for public education. A commonly cited example is the age

distribution. Poterba (1997) found that states with higher growth in the fraction of residents over

age 65 experience slower rates of growth in per-child educational expenditure, an observation

consistent with a preference to vote down public programs the elderly do not benefit from

themselves. He found the effect is magnified to the extent the elderly population is racially

incongruent with the school-age population. Others who have tested for effects of a growing elderly

share on local, as against state, support for education have found a less stark relationship—in part

because the elderly benefit from schools through their property values (Ladd and Murray 2001;

Harris, Evans, and Schwab 2001; Hilber and Mayer 2007).



c. Local Population Heterogeneity and the Tiebout Model

        The Tiebout (1956) model is the workhorse economic model of local public good provision.

In the standard Tiebout framework, households sort into homogenous communities offering their

preferred level of public services and taxation. While the pure Tiebout model has restrictive and

generally unrealistic assumptions, it has enjoyed much success over the years (Ross and Yinger 1999;

Fischel 2001). In particular, empirical research has found that local taxes and school quality are

capitalized into property values, a key implication of the Tiebout model (Black 1999).

        Our effort to estimate the impact of income inequality on the support for local public

schools is complicated if the pure Tiebout model is a correct characterization of the real world. First,



                                                                                                      8
one might wonder: given Tiebout sorting, why would local communities have heterogeneous

populations? Second, one must be concerned that because of mobility across jurisdictions, within-

district income inequality is responsive to the level of public spending.

        The Tiebout model predicts homogeneity of demand for local public goods within

communities, not necessarily homogeneity in observable population characteristics (Epple and Platt

1998). In practice, we do not observe preferences but rather correlates with demand for public

goods, such as income, wealth, age, race, ethnicity, home ownership, and the like. Yet even if these

observable characteristics represent noisy measures of preferences, communities are often much

more heterogeneous than Tiebout might predict. This should not be too surprising. While

metropolitan areas in the U.S. exhibit features of the Tiebout model to varying degrees, in practice,

few come close to its ideal, given barriers to perfect sorting. Communities may also be willing to

tolerate population heterogeneity in exchange for economics of scale in the production of public

goods (Alesina, Baqir, and Hoxby 2000). Ultimately, the weaker are Tiebout forces, the more likely

conflicting household demands for public goods will be resolved through the political process.

        Rhode and Strumpf (2003) found that Tiebout sorting—that is, movement due to local tax

and spending policies—may be of only second order importance in the locational decisions of U.S.

households. Juxtaposed against dramatically falling transportation, commuting, and communication

costs—all of which in theory should increase sorting and heterogeneity across communities—they

found less stratification of observable household characteristics and policy outcomes across

municipalities over the 1850 – 1990 period. In their analysis of the Boston Metropolitan Statistical

Area (MSA)—often held up as an archetype of Tiebout competition—they found no evidence of

increased sorting in the post World War II period. Within-municipality income distributions in

suburban Boston have changed little, and the between-community component of income inequality

in Boston has risen only slightly since 1949. Along the same lines, Cutler, Glaeser, and Vigdor (1999)



                                                                                                    9
and Kremer (1997) found that sorting between neighborhoods has remained constant or declined in

recent decades

        We should stress that none of this research refutes the Tiebout hypothesis, and it is certainly

the case that local public goods and taxation are important factors in household locational decisions.

The results above, however, suggest that forces other than Tiebout sorting have been important

enough to maintain a relatively high level of within-community heterogeneity—a condition that is

key to our analysis. We do take the potential endogeneity of the income distribution seriously, and as

we outline below, attempt to reduce or eliminate any omitted variables bias through our choice of

estimation strategies.



3. Data and Empirical Strategy

a. Data Sources

        Our analysis draws upon a balanced panel of demographic and financial data from more

than 10,300 local school districts spanning 1970 – 2000. The district panel was constructed by

merging eight large national databases: the Census of Population and Housing special school district

tabulations for 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 (U.S. Census Bureau 1973, 1982, 2002a; U.S. Department

of Education 1994), the Census of Governments: School Districts for 1972, 1982, and 1992 (U.S. Census

Bureau 1987, 1992, 1993), and the F-33 Annual Survey of School Finances for 2002 (U.S. Census Bureau

2002b).7 The Census tabulations provide detailed information about household income and

demographics within each school district, while the Census of Governments and Annual Surveys of School




7 Similar matched panel datasets of school districts were used by Hoxby (1996, 2001) and Harris, Evans, and

Schwab (2001). Prior to 1989-90, school district financial data was only available from the Census of
Governments in years ending in a two or five. We thus match the 1970 and 1980 cross-sections of Census
data to financial data from the 1972 and 1982 fiscal years. For consistency across the four cross-sections, we
match the 1990 and 2000 Census data to financial data from the 1992 and 2002 fiscal years.


                                                                                                           10
Finances represent the primary historical source of school finance data in the United States. These

eight databases are supplemented by a number of others, as described in the Data Appendix.

        The construction of a matched panel database of school districts spanning more than three

decades presents a number of challenges. First, some school district boundaries changed over this

period as a result of consolidations, splits, and unifications (a merger of separate elementary and

secondary districts). We identified these district changes primarily by contacting all state departments

of education where such changes occurred. All of our districts are defined based on their 2002

geographic definitions, such that if District A and District B merged or unified in 1995, we have

combined the data from these two districts in all prior years for comparability with 2002.8 Districts

involved in splits have been dropped from the panel, though there were very few of these cases.

Second, we lose a number of school districts due to missing data in 1970 and 1990. In the 1970

Census, districts with fewer than 300 students were aggregated into one pseudo-district in each of 39

affected states, accounting for a loss of roughly 1,500 mostly rural districts. In the 1990 Census, a

small number of counties in California did not participate in the special school district mapping,

accounting for a loss of 196 districts. After excluding districts with outlying values of per-pupil

expenditure, our balanced panel contains 10,359 school districts observed in four years, for a total of

41,436 observations.9 While this panel comprises only 75.6 percent of existing elementary and




8 For our regression models, we have assigned an indicator variable to be equal to one for all school districts
involved in a merger or unification between 1972 and 2002. When an elementary and secondary district
covering the same geographic territory consolidate to form a unified (K-12) district, we do not aggregate
Census data from the two districts—this would be double-counting—but rather use Census data from the
larger area (usually, the secondary district).
9 School districts are excluded if their per-student local revenues are more than twice the 95th percentile

nationwide, or less than 25 percent of the 5th percentile nationwide, in any year. Alaska, Hawaii, and the
District of Columbia are also excluded (the latter two consist of only a single school district).


                                                                                                            11

enrollment in that year.10

           Income inequality measures are generally not available at geographic levels smaller than

states. Accordingly, we use Census data on the counts of families falling into ordered income

categories to calculate inequality measures for every school district in each panel year.11 To do this,

we assume a flexible functional form for the CDF of family income in each district, and use the

grouped income data to estimate the parameters of this distribution via maximum likelihood. With

these parameters, we can then generate estimates of various measures of income inequality.

           The procedure is implemented as follows. Suppose in a particular year there are K income

groups and nik is the number of families in income group k in district i. The K groups are families

with incomes ≤ a1, (> a1 and ≤ a2), …, (> aK-2 and < aK-1), and > aK-1 where a1 < a2 < …. < aK-1. Let y

represent income and the CDF of the income distribution Pr(y ≤ a) = F(a|βi), where βi are the

parameters of the assumed distribution of income for district i. Let Pik be the probability of

observing income in group k, where Pi1 = F(a1|βi), Pi2 = F(a2|βi) - F(a2|βi), … PiK-1 = F(aK-1|βi) - F(aK-

2   |βi), and PiK = 1 - F(aK-1|βi). Therefore, the likelihood function for district i in this year is Li =

Σknikln(Pik) which is maximized through the choice of βi.

           Based on McDonald (1984), we elected to fit a three-parameter Dagum (1980) distribution,

also known as the Burr Type III distribution. In his paper, McDonald fit a series of statistical

distributions to U.S. income in 1970 and 1980 and concluded that the Dagum distribution out-

performed all other three-parameter models, as well as some four-parameter models, in terms of fit.

This distribution also has the advantage of having a straightforward, closed-form solution for its

10 According to the F-33 Annual Survey of School District Finances (U.S. Department of Education 2002b) there

were 13,685 elementary and unified districts in operation in 2001-02. These districts had a total enrollment of
46 million, and 78 percent of these were unified districts. Our sample districts in 2002 had a total enrollment
of 44 million. In our panel, 90 percent of districts are unified.
11 We use family income as opposed to household income due to the 1970 Census, which only reports the

income of families and “unrelated individuals.”


                                                                                                            12
moments. For reasons described in the next section, our primary inequality measure of interest is the

ratio of mean to median family income. Both the mean and median are straightforward to calculate

given the estimated parameters of the Dagum distribution. For comparability, we also compute

alternative measures of income inequality, including the Gini coefficient, Theil index, and natural log

of the ratios of the 95th to 50th, and 50th to 5th percentiles of family income.12

        Although the income data we use in this project is categorical, the procedure outlined above

generates accurate estimates of income inequality. Evans, Hout, and Mayer (2004) used categorical

data on family income at the state level from various census years to estimate the parameters of the

Burr III distribution for each state, and then compared the implied Gini coefficient from these

estimates with those reported by the Census from the entire long form sample. The correlation

coefficients from the computed state-level Ginis in family income and the reported values for the

1970, 1980, and 1990 census were 0.998, 0.996, and 0.980, respectively.

        School district demographics are taken from the special Census tabulations, described in the

Data Appendix. From the Census data on race, we calculate a standard index of racial heterogeneity

as one minus the sum of the squared population shares of four race categories: white, black,

Asian/Pacific Islander, and other (following Alesina, Baqir, and Easterly 1999; Vigdor 2002; Alesina

and La Ferrara 2002). This index ranges from a lower bound of zero (perfect homogeneity) to an

upper bound of 0.75 (maximum heterogeneity with four groups).

        Descriptive statistics for our district panel are provided in Table 1. All observations have

been weighted by public school enrollment, such that these statistics can be thought of as

characterizing the school district in which the average public school student resides. Several trends

are worth noting. Average local education revenues per pupil rose 62 percent in real terms from


12 The number of income categories reported in the Census varies over time. However, as we show in the
Data Appendix, changes in the number of categories do not materially affect our estimates of income
inequality, nor do they create a systematic bias.


                                                                                                    13
1972 to 2002, at the same time local funds as a share of overall per-student spending fell from an

average of 54.5 percent to 42.3 percent. Real median family incomes rose an average of 18 percent

over the sample and at the same time, all measures of within-district income inequality increased

considerably. Within the standard median-voter model, the inverse tax share is typically measured by

the mean to median income; as the dispersion of income increases, the tax price of raising funds

falls. In this case the inverse tax share falls by 9 percent. Other measures of within-district inequality

in family income show much larger changes. The Gini coefficient increased 15 percent from 1970 to

2000, while the average Theil index rose a more sizable 39 percent. As was true nationally, income

inequality grew more in the top half of the distribution: the rise in the average (log) ratio of the 95th

to 50th percentile of income was 18 percent as compared with an 11 percent increase in the average

(log) 50th to 5th ratio, implying the log(95th/5th) ratio increased 29 percent. We elaborate more on this

growth in income inequality within school districts in later sections.

        Notably, school districts became considerably more racially diverse from 1970 to 2000, as

evidenced by the near doubling of the mean index of race fractionalization, and the doubling of the

mean percent nonwhite over this period. The elderly share in the average district rose almost three

percentage points, from 9.5 to 12.1.



b. Empirical Strategy

        Our goal is to examine how rising income inequality has affected the fiscal support for

public elementary and secondary education. We begin our analysis by examining the relationship

between within-school district income inequality, and locally raised revenues for public schools. Our

empirical model is similar in spirit to the demand function for local public goods introduced by

Borcherding and Deacon (1972) and Bergstrom and Goodman (1973). In these models, observed

expenditure on local public goods reflects the level desired by the median voter, which in turn is a



                                                                                                       14
function of the median voter’s income, tax share, and taste for public spending. In this instance, the

public good measure is local education revenues per pupil. “Taste” for local public services is

typically proxied by a vector of population characteristics thought to be associated with demand for

these services: age, race, educational attainment, school attendance, homeownership, and median

family income are frequent examples (Rubinfeld and Shapiro 1989; Harris, Evans, and Schwab 2001;

Hoxby 2001).

        Within a median voter framework, the tax share is the fraction of tax revenues that are paid

for by the decisive (median) voter. This is a simple measure of the cost of raising an additional dollar

in revenues and typically, as costs decline, local spending will rise. In the case of education spending,

if the outcome of interest is spending per pupil, all families have one child, and all income is taxed at

a constant proportional rate, then the tax share of raising an additional dollar to the median voter is

simply the median over mean income. While the true tax price of local spending on education is

more complex, this simple model helps illustrate the role of rising income inequality on local

spending. For example, suppose that inequality increases because of a rise in income in the top of

the distribution. The median will remained unchanged, but because aggregate income (as measured

by the mean) has increased, the cost of an additional dollar has declined for the median voter,

encouraging greater public spending.

        In our initial models, we use the inverse tax share or the within-district mean to median ratio

of family income. This is also a measure of inequality, in that distributions of income are more

unequal as the inverse tax share rises.

        Households choose communities in part based on unobserved preferences for taxes and

school quality, and as such, observable proxies may insufficiently control for these preferences. In

our model, we exploit the panel nature of our data and incorporate school district fixed effects to




                                                                                                      15
capture time-invariant household sorting on the fixed characteristics of school districts.13 District

fixed effects will also account for permanent features of the local tax base that determine the median

voter’s tax share, such as the presence of taxable commercial property or natural resources.

         Our basic empirical specification for local education revenues per student in school district i

in state j in year t (yijt) is given by:



(1)      yijt = Xijtβ + inequalityijt*γ + IGijt*θ + δi + δjt + uijt



where Xijt is a vector of population and housing characteristics in school district i in year t (which

includes median family income, percent of the population below the poverty line, percent of adults

who are college graduates, percent school aged (5-17), percent aged 65 and older, percent living in

an urbanized area, percent of housing units that are owner-occupied, percent nonwhite, and the

index of racial heterogeneity), inequalityijt is a measure of income inequality in district i in year t, IGijt is

the sum of all intergovernmental grants to district i in year t (from state and federal sources), δi is a

school district fixed effect, and δjt is a state-by-year effect intended to capture state-specific time

trends. uijt is an idiosyncratic error term representing all other time-varying determinants of local

spending in district i not accounted for by the model. All regressions are weighted using total public

enrollment, so that results can be interpreted for the district attended by the typical public school

student.

         Our coefficient of interest in equation (1) is γ, the impact of within-school district income

inequality on local per-student education revenues, holding constant certain observable district

characteristics, time-varying shocks at the state level, and intergovernmental aid. Our use of district


13 It is also the case that much of the variation in local revenues is between districts—not within districts over
time. In a regression of real local revenues per student on district fixed effects and year dummies alone, the R2
is 0.79 (adjusted R2 = 0.72).


                                                                                                               16
fixed effects implies that we are using a within-group estimator, where variation within school

districts over time is used to identify γ and other coefficients in the model. Aside from the inclusion

of income inequality in the model, equation (1) is a relatively straightforward extension of the

Borcherding and Deacon (1972) and Bergstrom and Goodman (1973) approach.14 As discussed in

Section 2, the role of income inequality in this model is as a proxy for the tax share facing the

median voter. If the “ends against the middle” voting model dominates, our estimated γ will pick up

the effects of these opposing income coalitions on local spending.

        It is important to note that public education has traditionally relied heavily on property

wealth, rather than income, as its primary tax base. Unfortunately, complete data on property wealth

by school district over this period is not available. In a series of robustness checks in Section 4c, we

re-estimate equation (1) for a subset of school districts for which we have information about

inequality in owner-occupied housing wealth.15

        Local revenues represent a sizable fraction of overall spending on public education in the

United States, but the local share varies significantly across states and over time (Table 1 and

Corcoran and Evans 2008). School districts in Vermont, for example, provided only 6.1 percent of

K-12 education revenues in 2004-05, while local districts in Pennsylvania contributed 53.9 percent to

school spending in that year. Thirty years earlier, Vermont localities provided a significantly higher

57.9 percent of revenues, while Pennsylvania districts contributed a lower 46.2 percent (U.S.

Department of Education 2008). Among other things, this variation reflects differences in revenue-


14 We are not the first include income inequality in a model of local education spending—see, for example,
Brown and Saks (1985), Hoxby (2000, 2001), and Urquiola (2000). However, income inequality is rarely an
explanatory variable of primary interest in these papers. For example, Hoxby (2000) included measures of
income inequality and racial and ethnic heterogeneity in her district-level regressions assessing the impact of
school district competition on school expenditure. These variables were intended to serve as controls,
however, and she did not discuss her empirical findings on these measures.
15 These models will still fail to incorporate information about local commercial and industrial property

wealth. Unfortunately, school district-level data on this form of property wealth is generally not available over
this period.


                                                                                                              17
sharing practices across states, legislative and court-ordered finance reforms altering the state-local

balance over time, and economic shocks impacting local districts’ ability to raise revenue. Our

inclusion of state-specific year effects δjt accounts for fixed differences across states in the size of the

local contribution, and the effects of temporal changes in school funding policy and economic

conditions on average local spending in each state. Still, it is likely that temporal changes in state aid

policies impacted local spending in ways that varied systematically with district characteristics. For

example, school finance reforms in the 1980s and early 1990s often used state aid as a means to

equalize spending, or to relieve tax burdens in low-wealth districts. In these cases, low-wealth

districts in reform states received more generous infusions of aid than high-wealth districts, or were

offered more compensatory aid formulas (Murray, Evans, and Schwab 1998; Hoxby 2001). To the

extent districts with growing income inequality were more likely to benefit from finance reforms

through greater aid or a lower tax price, we may improperly attribute the effects of these changes to

income inequality.

        We include state and federal aid per student (IGijt) as a covariate to capture the effects of

intergovernmental aid on local revenues; however, state aid will typically be endogenous to local

spending in cases where aid is not administered as a flat grant. Thus, in many specifications of model

(1), we instrument for intergovernmental aid in district i using an interaction of dummy variables for

court-ordered school finance reform at the state level and district i’s initial position in its state’s

income distribution in 1970. Equation (2) shows the first stage of this regression:



                 3
(2)     IG ijt   overturn jt * incomeq ijk , 70k + XijtΠ + inequalityijt*λ + θi + θjt + εijt
                k 1




                                                                                                         18
where overturnjt is a dummy variable that equals one if state j experienced a court-ordered school

finance reform prior to year t and the incomeqijk,70 are dummy variables that equal one if district i was

in quartile k of income in state j in 1970 (k = 1, 2, 3). Most existing research has made a strong case

for the exogeneity of court-ordered finance reforms: Card and Payne (2002), Figlio, Husted, and

Kenny (2004), and Baicker and Gordon (2006) all demonstrate that state supreme court rulings

affecting school funding systems are quite difficult to predict. Consequently, most empirical research

has treated court-mandated reforms as exogenous events, and we make this assumption here as well.

        Finally, one might be concerned that changes over time in local income inequality are itself

endogenous to the policies or performance of local school districts. High-income households

without children, for example, who perceive school taxes to be too high in one district may relocate

to a neighboring district, potentially affecting the income distribution in both the sending and

receiving district (Fernandez and Rogerson, 1996). School finance equalization and the number of

area jurisdictions may also influence the level of income sorting between and income inequality

within school districts (Aaronson 1999; Urquiola 2000).

        Identifying exogenous variation in inequality in this context is problematic at best. We need

to isolate a factor that alters within-district inequality but has no direct impact on local school

spending. Unfortunately, most of the candidate reasons for changing inequality (e.g. skill-biased

technical change, globalization, and institutional factors such as the decline in unions or the real

minimum wage) directly impact the level of income as well as its distribution.

        As one strategy for addressing such changes in inequality, we use higher moments of the

local income distribution as instruments for the mean-to-median ratio of income. In the strict form

of the median voter hypothesis, the median voter’s tax share is defined as the ratio of median to

mean income. As inequality in the top half of the distribution increases, the tax share falls and the

price of local public goods to the median voter declines. To the median voter, the distribution of



                                                                                                      19
income that determines the tax share is irrelevant—what is important is the tax price of local

services. To illustrate this, consider two districts with the same mean and median income, but

District A has a more positively skewed income distribution than District B, perhaps driven by a

larger share of income coming from the top few percentiles of income. In this simple case, holding

all else constant the median voter model would predict the same level of spending on local goods in

Districts A and B, since the tax share is identical for the decisive voter. However, in a cross-section

of districts we would anticipate that as the skewness of income rises, the mean rises faster than the

median and the tax share will fall. Subsequently, if the median voter model is correct, then the

skewness of income should be a valid instrument for the tax share. In the median voter model (and

holding mean income constant to eliminate income effects) an increase in skewness in the income

distribution will only increase spending through a reduction in the tax share. In this situation, a

change in skewness will only change the burden of who pays for local public goods.

        In addition to estimating equation (1) for local revenues per student, we estimate an

analogous model for per student current operating expenditures (which excludes capital expenditure)

and state aid per student. In these cases the model is identical, but for the exclusion of

intergovernmental grants. Here we control directly for the impact of exogenous school finance

reforms on expenditure and aid by including interactions between a court-ordered finance reform

and the district’s quartile of median income in 1970 (overturnjt x incomeqijk,70).



4. Results

a. Income Inequality in School Districts

        Table 2 provides some descriptive statistics for income inequality within and between U.S.

school districts over the 1970 – 2000 period. Panel A shows the distribution of 1970 – 2000 income

inequality growth as measured by percent changes in the mean to median ratio, the Gini coefficient



                                                                                                    20
and Theil index, for the 10,358 school districts in our panel. The numbers are weighted by school

enrollment which better represents the level of income inequality experienced in the typical student’s

school district.16 Panel B shows the average level and growth of income inequality at the

metropolitan area level for the same period, again weighted by school enrollment. In this panel, we

also decompose the MSA Theil index of income inequality into its within- and between- district

components, and present average within and between shares over MSAs.17

        We find that most U.S. school districts experienced growth in income inequality between

1970 and 2000. Over 90 percent of all districts saw an increase in income inequality as measured by

the mean to median ratio, and this number is around 70 percent for the Gini and Theil indices. The

average (median) student was enrolled in a school district that witnessed a 9.0 (8.1) percent rise in

income inequality as measured by the mean to median ratio, a 15.6 (15.7) percent rise according to

the Gini coefficient, and a 42.5 (39.2) percent rise as measured by the Theil index.18 More than one

in five districts saw increases of 20 percent or more, as measured by the Gini. Thus, the vast

majority of students were in districts where income inequality rose, and a substantial fraction lived in

districts where inequality increased by 25-30 percent or more.

        To examine changes in within- versus between-district income inequality, we look at

inequality in MSAs in Panel B. We observe a similar overall increase in income inequality in MSAs,



16 We use 2000 K-12 enrollment in public schools as weights. Weighting using 1970 enrollment does not
substantially affect these empirical distributions.
17 School districts are mapped to MSAs based on their 2002 MSA assignment in the NCES Common Core of

Data (N=329 MSAs). Thus a district i that was not a part of MSA m in 1970 but joined that MSA before 2002
would be counted as part of that MSA for the entire period. For a given MSA, our Theil decomposition is
calculated as follows:

                       nk yk       m

school district component. m is the number of districts within the MSA, n and nk are total enrollment in the

18 Nationally, the Gini coefficient for family income grew by 17.1 percent (see footnote 1).




                                                                                                         21
with mean increases of 10.1, 17.1 and 44.3 in the mean/median ratio, Gini, and Theil, respectively.

Decomposing the Theil index into its within- and between-school district components, we find

that—for the average MSA—89 percent of income inequality was within school districts in 2000,

while only 11.3 percent was between districts. This latter fraction has increased since 1970, when an

average of 7.9 percent of MSA-level inequality was between districts.19

        Taken together, we find that the surge in income inequality documented at the national level

is reflected in the income distributions of most local school districts. This finding is not tautological.

With close to 15,000 local districts in the United States, Tiebout sorting by income could have had,

in theory, a strong moderating effect on the growth of income inequality within local jurisdictions.

Instead, we find that the average student attended a district in which income inequality rose

anywhere from 9 to 42 percent, depending on the index. A substantial fraction of students attended

districts in which income inequality rose 25 percent or more. Even in metropolitan areas—where the

greatest opportunities for Tiebout sorting exist—we observe relatively low between-district income

inequality over the full 1970 to 2000 period. There is little doubt that Tiebout sorting by income

exists, and to a greater degree in MSAs with a larger number of available districts. But forces other

than income sorting appear to have been sufficiently important to maintain a relatively high level of

within-community heterogeneity, an observation key to our analysis that follows.



b. The Relationship between Income Inequality and Education Revenues and Expenditures


19In 2000 the MSA with the highest share of inequality between districts was Newark, NJ, where 31.7 percent
of the overall Theil index was due to between-district inequality. As one might expect, the between-district
component and the number of school districts in the MSA are highly correlated, reflecting greater
opportunities to sort by income. For example, in 2000, Cleveland (75 area districts), Chicago (258), and St.
Louis (113) had relatively high between-district Theil indices, while Miami, Las Vegas, and Shreveport—all
comprised of only one or several districts—had low between-district inequality. Unlike Rhode and Strumpf
(2003), we do find a small but steady increase over time in the between-school district component in Boston
and several other large MSAs. However—like those authors—we estimate the between-district component to
be small relative to the within-district component (¼ the size or less).


                                                                                                         22
        Table 3 presents our baseline estimates of the relationship between income inequality, local

revenues per pupil for K-12 education, current operating expenditures per pupil, and state aid per

pupil. We begin in the first column by estimating a standard demand function for local spending per

student, excluding any measure of income inequality. Then, in columns (2) we add the ratio of mean

to median income as our primary measure of income inequality; we examine alternative measures in

Table 5. Column (3) estimates the analogous model for operating expenditures per pupil, and (4) the

model for state aid. All models are estimated using ordinary least squares, with district and state-by-

year effects, as described in section 3b. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are reported in

parentheses.

        Our estimated coefficients in column (1) are generally of the expected sign, and similar to

those found in other empirical estimates of local demand functions for education. Per-student

revenues increase with median family income, with a $1,000 rise in income associated with a $29

increase in local per student spending.20 Revenues tend to be higher in districts with high poverty

rates, higher proportions of college graduates, higher proportions of renters, and a higher elderly

share. Revenues tend to be lower in more urbanized districts, districts with larger school-aged

cohorts, and greater racial heterogeneity, though the latter is statistically insignificant.21 Consistent

with the flypaper effect literature, local revenues are lower in districts receiving greater aid, though

the reduction is not one-for-one. (Later, we account for the endogeneity of state aid).

        As a direct test of the Meltzer-Richard hypothesis, in column (2) we add the ratio of mean to

median family income to this model. Consistent with that hypothesis, our estimated coefficient on

the mean/median ratio is positive and statistically significant at conventional levels, suggesting that a


20This implies an approximate income elasticity for local spending of 0.5 at the mean.
21See Poterba (1997) for evidence on cohort size effects on school spending, and Oates (2005) for a survey
of the “renter effect” literature. The renter effect found here is sizable: we estimate that a one standard
deviation decrease in the fraction of housing units that are owner-occupied (about 0.146) is associated with a
$154 increase in per-student revenues, almost 1/10 of a standard deviation in local revenues per student.


                                                                                                           23
lower tax share can induce greater local spending. Our estimated effect is also economically

significant. The average 1970 to 2000 growth in the ratio of mean to median income was 0.10, with a

standard deviation of 0.11. This implies that districts with one standard deviation above-average

growth in the mean/median ratio would be predicted to have $197 higher local revenues per

student—substantial when compared against the standard deviation of local revenue growth of

$1,486. To put these results in a different light, if the average 1970 – 2000 growth in the

mean/median ratio generated $179 higher local revenues per student; this would make it responsible

for roughly 12 percent ($179/$1,486) of the overall growth in local funding per-student over this

period.

          Because education is a shared responsibility of local and state government, this increase in

local taxes for public schools may not translate into greater spending per student, if these revenues

are offset by a similar reduction in state aid. It may also be the case that the increase in local

spending associated with inequality is actually a reflection of falling tax prices in those districts,

through state aid. If state aid formulas were re-written during this period to provide more generous

matching grants to poor districts, for example, and these districts were also experiencing rising

inequality, our finding may simply be picking up the effects of a lower tax price.

          Column (3) of Table 3 looks at the net effect of income inequality on current expenditure

per student. All of the same covariates are included as in the model of column (1), though we also

control directly for the effects of school finance reform at each quartile of the district income

distribution. We find that, on net, rising income inequality was associated with higher per student

spending, though the magnitude is attenuated from that found in model (1). The results of column

(4) suggest that the correlation between inequality and local spending is unlikely to be due to the

influence of favorable tax price due to state aid. We find that rising income inequality within districts

to be associated with lower state aid per student rather than more, which would be expected if state



                                                                                                      24
aid programs were driving our result. On average, a relative reduction in state aid appears to have

accompanied the rise in local taxes.

        In Table 4 we address two shortcomings of our OLS models, the endogeneity of

intergovernmental aid and the influence of inter-district sorting on our estimate of the coefficient on

income inequality. Because local taxes are responsive to state aid programs, and state aid is affected

by local spending, our aid variable should not be considered exogenous. In column (2), we present

two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimates where the level of real state and federal aid is instrumented

using interactions between a dummy variable indicating years following a court-ordered finance

reform and the district’s 1970 position within its state income distribution. Because our model

contains district fixed effects as well as state-year interactions, only three of the income quartile

interactions are uniquely identified. The first-stage estimates for this model are reported in column

(1) of Appendix Table 1. Consistent with Evans, Murray, and Schwab (1997), the first stage

demonstrates that court-ordered finance reform increased intergovernmental aid the most among

the poorest districts. Our results indicate that after reform, state and federal revenues per pupil

increased by $1,659, $702, and $326 in the lowest three income quartiles, relative to what happened

in the top income quartile group. All of these results are statistically significant at conventional

levels, and the first-stage F-test that the excluded instruments are all zero is 70 indicating that finite

sample bias is not a concern (Bound, Jaeger, and Baker, 1995). Note that the 2SLS estimates in

column (2) differ little from OLS estimates repeated in column (1), save for a lower local elasticity to

state and federal grants (a greater “flypaper effect”) and a larger standard error.

        An additional concern in our OLS model is the possibility that households sort into or out

of districts in response to changes in school spending (and in particular, local taxes). To the extent

this mobility varies by income, such sorting will affect the income distribution. To illustrate, suppose

an initially heterogeneous district witnesses a rise in inequality through growth at the top of the



                                                                                                       25
income distribution. The median voter responds to this change in tax price through greater local

spending (our observed correlation between inequality and local revenue). High-income households,

however, may respond over time to the rise in taxes by moving to another district, which reduces

income inequality in the sending district. Such a response would tend to bias our estimate of the

coefficient on income inequality toward zero. This example also generates a prediction that the

effect of income inequality on local spending should be greatest in districts with the least

opportunity for sorting, a point we return to in a later section.

        Column (3) presents two stage least squares using the skewness of family income as an

instrument for the mean to median income ratio. The first stage estimates for these three models are

reported in columns (2) - (3) of Appendix Table 1. In this model, we have two endogenous variables

(real state and federal revenues per pupil, and income inequality) so we include as instruments in all

models the finance reform/income quartile dummies and the instrument for inequality. In the

appendix table, the first stage dependent variable is real state and federal revenues per student, and

the three reform/income quartile instruments generate estimates nearly identical to the baseline in

column (1). In column (3), the dependent variable is the within-district mean/median ratio of

income. As expected, the skewness in income is positively correlated with the mean/median ratio,

and the t-statistic on this instrument is greater than 21. In columns (2) – (3), the F-statistic for the

null hypothesis that the coefficients on the identifying instruments in the first stage are all zero are

of a size so as to make finite sample bias not a concern.

        The resulting two-stage least squares estimate in column (3) of Table 4 is nearly twice as

large as that found in columns (1) and (2), and is statistically significant. We cannot, however, reject

the null hypothesis that the OLS estimate in column (1) and the 2SLS estimate in column (3) are the

same. For districts one standard deviation above the mean in income inequality, we estimate that

local revenues per student are almost $327 higher, on average, or 22% of growth in local spending



                                                                                                     26
per student over this period.22 In this case, the first stage is large and precise; the p-value on the test

of over-identifying restrictions is large as well, and the results with and without controlling for

endogeneity are statistically indistinguishable.

           In Table 5, we experiment with alternative measures of within-district income inequality: the

Gini coefficient, Theil index, natural logarithm of the ratio of 95th to 5th percentiles of income, and a

measure that divides overall income inequality into two components—inequality in the top half of

the distribution (the log 95/50 ratio) and inequality in the bottom half of the distribution (the log

50/5 ratio). Estimates in columns (2) and (4) are two-stage least squares estimates of the effects of

income inequality on local revenues for education, using the Gini and Theil index respectively, and

the skewness of income as an instrument for inequality.

           As in Table 3, all estimated coefficients on income inequality have positive signs, excepting

the log 50/5 ratio, which has a negative relationship with spending. All are statistically significant,

with the exception of the log 95/5 ratio. Our point estimate based on the Gini coefficient an effect

comparable to that found using the mean to median ratio in Table 3: districts where growth in

income inequality was one standard deviation higher than average (5.0) spent about $172 more per

student on average ($689 based on the 2SLS estimate).

           The pattern of estimated coefficients in column (6)—where income inequality is measured

using two components—is also consistent with the Meltzer and Richard model. Changes in income

inequality that increase mean income relative to the median should lower the tax share of the median

voter (promoting higher spending), while changes that decrease mean income relative to the median

should raise the tax share (promoting lower spending). We find exactly this pattern here. As the 95th

percentile of income rises relative to the median within a district, we observe increases in per-pupil

spending, on average. As the 5th percentile of income falls relative to the median, we observe


22   The first stage coefficient on the skewness statistic (in thousands) is 5.1E-6 with a t-statistic of 21.15.


                                                                                                                   27
decreases. Given the standard deviation of growth in these variables of 15 and 28 points,

respectively, one standard deviation higher growth in the log 95/50 ratio is associated with $136

higher spending per pupil, and one standard deviation higher growth in the log 50/5 ratio is

associated with $53 lower spending per pupil.

        Of course, a one percentage point rise in the log 95/50 ratio will not have an equivalent

effect on the tax share as a percentage point fall in the log 50/5 ratio. Because households at the top

of the income distribution earn a disproportionate share of aggregate income, an increase in the log

95/50 ratio will do more to increase mean income than an equivalent decline in the log 50/5 ratio.

To compare the magnitudes of our coefficient estimates on these inequality measures, we did the

following: using our estimated parameters of the income distribution in each district, we compute

the fraction of total district income earned by the bottom quartile (ℓ(0.25), where ℓ(x) is the Lorenz

curve for an individual district), and the fraction of total district income comprised by the top

quintile (1 - ℓ(0.75)). In the average district over all years, the top quartile earned 48.5 percent of

total income, while the bottom quartile earned 7.9 percent of income. Thus, for the average district,

a hypothetical increase in income of 10 percent in the top quartile (resulting in a 10 percent rise in

the 95/50 ratio) will increase mean income by 4.9 percent.23 Similarly, a rise in income of 10 percent

in the bottom quartile (resulting in a 10 percent fall in the 50/5 ratio) will increase mean income by

0.8 percent. Thus a proportional income change at the top of the distribution will have an effect on

mean income that is roughly 6.1 times that of a proportionally equivalent income change at the

bottom of the distribution. This ratio is not far from the 4.2 ratio of our two regression coefficients

in column (4), suggesting that our coefficient estimates, in relative terms, are reasonable.




23Mean income can be written as a weighted average of income across the four quartiles, where the weights
are the income shares. Holding constant the 0.485 income share for the top quartile, a 10 percent increase in
top quartile income translates into a 4.85 percent increase in mean income (0.485*0.10 = 0.0485).


                                                                                                          28
c. Extensions and Robustness Checks

        Empirical tests of the median voter model as an explanation for the growth of government

and redistribution almost exclusively use income inequality as a measure of the median voter’s tax

share. Public education, however, has traditionally relied heavily on the property tax.24 To the extent

school districts rely on property taxes, it is unclear how an increase in income inequality will

significantly lower the tax price of public spending without a corresponding change in the

distribution of housing wealth. Econometric specifications of demand functions for public

education often include a property wealth measure of the tax share when available, such as the ratio

of mean to median housing wealth (e.g. Bergstrom and Goodman 1973). Unfortunately, consistent

data on property values by school district is not available for all years of our analysis. The 1970,

1990, and 2000 Census school district tabulations do, however, provide counts of owner-occupied

homes falling into ordered valuation categories, which permit us to calculate measures of housing

wealth inequality comparable to the income inequality measures used above. (They do not,

unfortunately, provide information about local commercial and industrial property wealth). To do

this, we again fit the three-parameter Dagum distribution to the housing value data in each district-

year, in the manner described in Section 3.

        Our calculated measures of inequality in owner-occupied housing wealth (as measured by the

mean to median housing value ratio and the Gini coefficient) are consistently lower on average than

inequality in income, although the variation across districts is larger for property wealth inequality

than income inequality (Table 1). The two inequality measures are strongly correlated, at 0.45, 0.53,

and 0.70 in the case of the mean to median ratio in 1970, 1990, and 2000, and 0.60, 0.62, and 0.61 in

in the case of the Gini coefficient.

24 Among fiscally independent school districts in 2001-02, an average of 72 percent of locally raised revenues
were raised from property taxes (author’s calculations using U.S. Census Bureau 2002b). Aggregating to the
state level, the proportion of local revenues accounted for by the property tax ranged from a low of 35 – 40
percent in Alabama, Louisiana, and Vermont, to a high of 90 percent in New Jersey and Texas.


                                                                                                           29
        Columns (1) and (2) of Table 6 present the results of our baseline regression, with our

income inequality measure replaced by the mean to median ratio of housing wealth. (Due to missing

data in 1980 and for select districts in other years, our sample size drops to 29,391). We find that

growth in housing wealth inequality is also positively related to local spending per student, and its

coefficient is also comparable with that for income inequality. Here, districts one standard deviation

above the mean in 1970 – 2000 growth in housing wealth inequality (0.137) are found to spend $108

to $120 more per student on average. The estimated coefficient is quite similar when using

instrumental variables for state and federal grants (column (2)).

        The presence of rigid equalization programs that in some states impose a high tax price on

local school spending (Hoxby 2001) may cast doubt that our observed relationship between income

inequality and revenues reflects changes in the median voter’s preferred level of spending. The

textbook case is California’s Serrano v. Priest ruling (1971), which effectively ended the practice of

local finance in that state and centralized spending decisions at the state level (Brunner and Sonstelie

2006). Since Serrano, the California legislature has fixed the level of local school expenditure through

the use of “revenue limits,” to which the state and local school districts contribute. Due to property

tax limitations set by Proposition 13 (1978), local districts collect property taxes at a fixed rate of 1

percent, while the state fills the remaining gap between property taxes and the revenue limit.25

        Given restrictions imposed by the California school finance system, one would not expect

the median voter model to apply at the local level in that state. Because localities have little to no

leeway in determining per-student expenditure, median voters have no opportunity to respond to

changes in the local income distribution through higher (or lower) taxes. Because California


25 The system is actually more complex than this, and there is considerably more spending inequality in

California than is commonly believed. This is due in part to a local override option, which allows districts to
exceed the revenue limit, and the practice of raising funds through private educational foundations (see
Brunner and Sonstelie 2006). Still, the vast majority of spending on public education is dictated by the
revenue limits.


                                                                                                            30
represents a sizable share of the districts in our panel, we re-estimated our baseline OLS and 2SLS

models excluding California. The results are presented in columns (3) and (4) of Table 6. Their

exclusion has a very minor effect on our estimates.

        In an additional specification, shown in column (5) of Table 6, we interact our income

inequality measure with an indicator of the extent of between-district sorting opportunities: the

number of districts per student within a 25-mile radius (see Hoxby, 2000). We divide districts into

quartiles based on the number of available districts per student, as measured in 2000, with the lowest

(omitted) quartile representing the least district choice. Districts in the lowest quartile tend to be in

states with a relatively small number of geographically large districts (such as the South and West),

while those in the highest quartile tend to be in states with many community-based districts (such as

the Northeast and Midwest). We find that the largest coefficient on income inequality is indeed

among districts with the fewest sorting opportunities. The effect for districts in all other quartiles is

substantially smaller, and these differences, compared to the lowest quartile, are statistically

significant at conventional levels.

        We have estimated a number of alternative specifications not shown here. For example, we

re-estimated our baseline model of Tables 3 and 4 using local revenues per school aged child, rather than

per public school student. This allows for the possibility that increases in spending associated with

income inequality are a reflection of movement into private schools which mechanically reduces

public enrollment and inflates public spending per student, if resources are slow to adjust. We find a

point estimate that is only marginally smaller than that found in our original model. In addition, we

have estimated models that (1) restrict the sample to unified (K-12) districts, (2) use monetary

variables measured in natural log units, (3) omit enrollment weights, (4) use a measure of household

income inequality as opposed to inequality in family income (which precludes the use of 1970), and




                                                                                                      31
(5) restrict our panel to 1980 – 2000 (which recaptures approximately 2,600 districts). The results of

these models are qualitatively similar to those found in our baseline case.26



d. The Relationship between Income Inequality and Private School Enrollment

        In our look at the impact of rising income inequality on public school expenditure, we have

found little evidence favoring the “ends against the middle” hypothesis in which rich and poor

households jointly oppose educational spending. Rather, we find results more consistent with a

median voter model in which a lower tax price stimulates higher public spending. However, it may

be still be the case that growing income inequality affects support for public education in other

ways—in particular, through enrollment in private schools. In Table 7 we use our school district

panel to look directly the relationship between within- district income inequality and enrollment in

private school. Our empirical model for the percent of school-aged children enrolled in private

school (privateijt) roughly mirrors that presented earlier in equation (1):



(3)     privateijt = Xijtβ + inequalityijt*γ + EXPijt*θ + δi + δjt + uijt



where Xijt and inequalityijt are defined as in Section 3b and EXPijt is the level of current operating

expenditures for public K-12 education in school district i in year t. As before, we include school

district (δi) and state-by-year fixed effects (δjt) to capture fixed differences across districts in private

schooling rates and temporal changes at the state level.27 Of course, it is likely that public

expenditure is responsive to private schooling rates, so in column (2) we instrument for current

operating expenditure per student using our school finance reform/income quartile interactions


26Results are available from the authors upon request.
27In a regression of the proportion of K-12 enrollment in private school on district fixed effects and year
dummies alone, the R2 is 0.85 (adjusted R2 = 0.80).


                                                                                                         32
introduced above, relying solely on variation in expenditure that occurs through exogenous changes

in school funding formulas. We present results using two measures of income inequality: the mean

to median ratio of income, and the Gini coefficient.

        Our OLS estimates in column (1) and (3) find a positive but statistically insignificant

relationship between within-district income inequality and private schooling rates. Private schooling

is found to rise on average with median family income, and fall with district poverty, the percent

nonwhite, and the size of the school-aged population. Holding these variables constant, we also

observe a positive and statistically significant relationship between racial fractionalization and private

school enrollment that is meaningful in size. A standard deviation higher 1970 – 2000 growth in

racial fractionalization (0.157) is associated with a 0.5 percentage point higher rate of private

schooling—significant given a baseline private enrollment rate of 10 percent.

        Our estimated positive coefficient on expenditures per student in columns (1) and (3) is

somewhat counter-intuitive if we believe expenditure is linked to public school quality (admittedly a

tenuous assumption). However, expenditures may in part be a response to past school performance,

where poor or under-performing school districts receive an infusion of new spending designed to

improve outcomes. These districts also may be more likely to have high rates of private schooling.

As might be expected, our point estimate changes sign in our 2SLS estimates (columns (2) and (4)):

here, districts with higher spending on average have lower rates of private schooling.

        In our 2SLS estimates, both point estimates of the coefficient on inequality increase in size,

and in the case of the Gini coefficient becomes statistically significant. In the latter case, our estimate

of 0.055 implies that districts with one standard deviation above average growth in the Gini

coefficient (5.0) are estimated to have private schooling rates that are 0.28 percentage points higher

on average. While modest in size, it falls short of the effect implied by our coefficient on race

fractionalization. Here we find that a standard deviation higher 1970 – 2000 growth in racial



                                                                                                        33
fractionalization is associated with a 0.43 to 0.45 point higher private schooling rate—an effect

nearly twice as large.

        Finally, in columns (5) and (6) of Table 7 we interact our income inequality measure with the

quartile measures of district sorting opportunities (as measured by districts per student within a 25-

mile radius). One would expect the relationship between inequality and private schooling to be

moderated in districts were greater sorting opportunities exist. In the case of the Gini coefficient

(column (6)), we do find that the point estimate on income inequality is largest among districts in the

lowest quartile of district choice (0.082), but the difference is only statistically significant between the

1st and 2nd quartile. A similar pattern exists for the mean to median measure, but the point

estimates do not statistically differ from zero.



5. Conclusion

        As income inequality has risen in the U.S. and its population has grown more racially and

ethnically diverse, scholars have begun to ponder whether this growing heterogeneity will alter the

extent to which governments provide basic public services and a social safety net. Recent theoretical

and empirical work suggests that public goods provision and the generosity of welfare benefits are

lower in more racially and ethnically diverse jurisdictions. Models specific to public education

suggest a similar outcome. With respect to income, growing income inequality may encourage a

battle of the “ends against the middle,” where high income families opt out of public schooling into

the private sector and lower income groups choose lower taxes and greater private consumption

over investments in public education. As a result, forces at the ends of the income distribution may

reduce support for public schools in economically diverse populations.

        In contrast, growing income inequality may have unanticipated effects on local public good

provision. In a simple voting model like that of Meltzer and Richard, growing wage inequality at the



                                                                                                         34
top of the distribution reduces the tax price of public goods to the median voter, thereby

encouraging greater spending on government services. We examined the impact of growing income

inequality on local support for public schools using panel data for over 10,000 school districts over

the 1970 – 2000 period. In contrast to other recent literature, our results suggest that the median

voter model is a more accurate description of the experience in this governmental sector. As income

inequality has grown in local school districts, so too have local dollars into elementary and secondary

education. Our results indicate that 12 percent of the growth in local per-student revenues over the

past 30 years can be explained by a decline in the tax share facing the median voter, a consequence

of rising income inequality concentrated in top of the distribution.

       The Meltzer-Richard hypothesis has been extensively tested in the past, in a number of

settings, with conflicting results. The strength of the results in this paper may be driven by a number

of factors. First, much of the previous work has used national or state level data while our analysis

focuses on local school districts. Common wisdom in the public finance literature suggests that the

collective choice process in local government is much more likely to approximate the assumptions

of the median voter model assumptions (Fischel 2001; Mueller 2003). Second, we examine changes

in spending in more than 10,000 school districts during a period of rapidly changing income

inequality, giving us tremendous statistical power. Third, the panel nature of our data allows us to

limit our exposure to potentially contaminating omitted variables bias.

       Given the important redistributive nature of education, our results suggest that some of the

potentially negative consequences of rising social inequality may have been counteracted by local

government’s ability to raise additional funds from growing incomes at the top of the distribution.

The long term benefits of such a transfer are beyond the scope of this paper, but are obviously an

important topic for future discussion.

Data Appendix

A.1. Sources – District Panel

         Our balanced panel of school districts consists of matched demographic and financial data
on U.S. school districts from 1970 to 2000. We constructed this panel by merging eight large
national databases: the Census of Population and Housing school district tabulations for 1970, 1980,
1990, and 2000 (U.S. Census Bureau 1973, 1982, 2002a; U.S. Department of Education 1994), the
Census of Governments: School Districts for 1972, 1982, and 1992 (U.S. Census Bureau 1987, 1992, 1993),
and the F-33 Annual Survey of School Finances for 2002 (U.S. Census Bureau 2002b).
         These eight databases were supplemented by a number of others. First, because the 2000
Census school district tabulation (U.S. Census Bureau 2002a) failed to include a table for public and
private school enrollment, we used Census tract level data to compute private enrollment in every
school district. This procedure required overlaying boundary files for census tracts with those for
unified and elementary school districts, and aggregating enrollment counts to the district level.28
While tracts are almost always smaller than school districts, they are not necessarily contained
entirely within the boundaries of one district. In cases where tracts crossed district boundaries, we
allocated public and private enrollment to districts based on the fraction of tract land area in each
district. Of course, this method only works well when enrollment is uniformly distributed over the
tract—a less plausible assumption in rural, suburban or geographically diverse areas. In densely
populated urban areas, tracts are usually contained in only one district. Thus, measurement error in
our private school variable is likely to be highest in districts with the smallest populations. The use
of enrollment weights in our analysis should ameliorate at least some of this error.
         Second, all of our court rulings on state school finance systems are taken from Corcoran and
Evans (2008), which updates Murray, Evans, and Schwab (1998) and others. Only rulings from the
highest state court on the constitutionality of school funding are included. Finally, all school district
consolidations, splits, and unifications (a merger of separate elementary and secondary districts)
between 1970 and 2002 were researched individually, using dozens of sources, including official state
documents, news accounts, minutes from school board meetings, and school district websites. All of
school district observations are based on their 2002 geographic definitions, such that if District A
and District B merged or unified in 1995, we have combined the data from these two districts in all
earlier years, for comparability with 2002. Data was combined by aggregating across districts, or by
taking a weighted average of component district characteristics as appropriate. Districts involved in
splits have been dropped from the panel, although there were very few of these cases.

A.2. Inequality Measures

       As described in section 3, we fit the 3-parameter Dagum (or Burr Type III) distribution to
Census grouped income data in local school districts to calculate measures of income inequality. For

28 Boundary files can be downloaded from http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/ bdy_files.html (last
accessed August 9, 2003). The 2000 School District Tabulation does include one table (PCT23) that reports
school enrollment for males and females age three and older, by various age categories: 3-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-17,
18-19, etc., with no public-private distinction. Together with K-12 public enrollment counts from the Common
Core of Data, it would be possible to use the residual (census enrollment – CCD public enrollment) as an
estimate of the number of children enrolled in private school. This would, however, require the use of two
different data sources in the construction of one variable, as well as critical assumptions about the fraction of
five-year olds in kindergarten and the fraction of 15-17 and 18-19 year olds in secondary school.


                                                                                                              36
a random variable z, the cumulative distribution function for the three-parameter Dagum
distribution is as follows, for z ≥ 0 and (a, b, p) > 0:
                                      p
                    b a 
(4)     F ( z )  1    
                    z  

Given the parameters a, b, and p, the rth moments of this distribution are defined as:

                            r           r 
(5)     E[ z r ]  pb r   1   , p     ,
                            a           a 

where β(.) is the complete beta function. The cth percentile of the income distribution is found
using:

(6)             
        x c  b c 1 p   1    
                                  1 a
                                           .

Dagum (1980) showed that the Gini coefficient can be calculated directly as:

                                  ( p, p )
(7)     Gini  1                                     ,
                           p , p  1/ a 

and values of the Lorenz curve ℓ(x) calculated as:

        ℓ(x) = I  p  ,1  , x 1/ p  ,
                       1    1
(8)
                            a            a            

where I(.) is the incomplete beta function. Finally, for the Dagum distribution the Theil index (or
generalized entropy 1) is calculated as (McDonald, 1984):

                            1                       1
                      p    1  
                            a                       a          1        1
(9)     Theil                                               p     1      p   1 ,
                         a                         a               a        a

                                                                   z 
where ψ(z) is the digamma function                                      .
                                                                  z 

        In addition to its high level of accuracy at the state level (Evans, Hout, and Mayer 2004), we
were also interest in seeing how this procedure would perform in smaller geographic areas. Using
the same maximum likelihood procedure, we estimated county-specific parameters of the Dagum
distribution for 1970, 1980 and 1990. While the Census does not report Gini coefficients at the
county level, they do report several other aggregate measures of the income distribution. For
example, in 1990 the Census reports the fraction of families in each county earning $50,000 or more.
We compared these fractions to the same fraction calculated with our estimated Dagum parameters
(i.e. 1 – F(50,000; a,b,p)). Again, the correlation between these values is high: 0.996 for 1990.
Analagously, we calculated average family income in each county using the moment generating


                                                                                                    37
function for the Dagum distribution, and compared these to the average family income reported by
the Census. The correlation between the actual and predicted values in this case was 0.997. On the
whole, it appears our maximum likelihood procedure performs remarkably well.
        Finally, we were concerned that changes in the number of income categories reported over
time in the Census might affect our estimates of income inequality. To test for this possibility, we
collapsed the 16 income groups reported in the 2000 Census to 8, and re-estimated the Dagum
parameters and Gini coefficients. In a regression of Gini_16 (the Gini coefficient estimated using 16
income groups) on Gini_8 (the Gini estimated using 8 groups), we estimate an intercept of 0.01 and
a slope of 0.96, but cannot reject the null hypotheses that the intercept is zero and the slope is one.
This implies that there is no systematic bias in using a smaller number of income groups (a smaller
number of groups creates classical measurement error).

  Notes: Robust standard errors in parentheses (*** p<0.001, ** p<0.01, * p<0.05). S+F represents real state +
  federal revenues per pupil. Mean/media in columns (3), (4), (5) and (8) and the within-district family income
  mean/median ratio. In column (6), mean/median is within-district mean/median housing price ratio. The
  first-stage estimates for S+F from Table 5 columns (2) and (4) are identical to those from Table 4, column
  (3). All models include school district fixed-effects, plus state x year effects. Demographic covariates shown
  in Table 3 are also included in these regression models. Columns (1) – (5) only use district observations from
  1970, 1990, and 2000 (the only years for which we have Census housing values). Column (6) uses only
  observations from 1970, 1990 and 2000. Columns (7) and (8) use exclude data from California districts from
  1970 – 2000. Column (9) includes the sample from the private schooling results in Table 7.
