                                         ABSTRACT

Using a large-scale survey of U.S. households during the Covid-19 pandemic, we study how new
information about fiscal and monetary policy responses to the crisis affects households’
expectations. We provide random subsets of participants in the Nielsen Homescan panel with
different combinations of information about the severity of the pandemic, recent actions by the
Federal Reserve, stimulus measures, as well as recommendations from health officials. This
experiment allows us to assess to what extent these policy announcements alter the beliefs and
spending plans of households. In short, they do not, contrary to the powerful effects they have in
standard macroeconomic models.

Shaw.
“[for monetary policy to be most effective] not only do expectations about policy matter, but, at least
under current conditions, very little else matters." Woodford (2005)

I.      Introduction
Monetary and fiscal policies affect the economy (Romer and Romer 2004, 2009) but how they operate
remains a point of contention. A common thread across many macroeconomic models is the role of
expectations: policies have powerful effects in modern mainstream models in large part because firms and
households incorporate these announcements into their decision plans. In real business cycle models, for
example, an announcement of higher government spending should make households feel poorer (since they
will have to pay for this spending via higher taxes now or in the future) which induces them to work more.
Forward guidance on the part of monetary policy-makers is predicted to have large effects in New
Keynesian models because the promise of future lower interest rates by the central bank should induce
households to anticipate higher inflation in the future which in turn should lead them to consume more
today before those price increases materialize.
        How powerful are these mechanisms in practice? Recent research should give one pause: there is a
growing body of evidence documenting that, in advanced economies, inattention to macroeconomic policy
and the broader economic environment is pervasive among households and firms. Announcements by
monetary and fiscal policy-makers are rarely found to have large effects on the expectations of economic
agents other than those participating directly in financial markets, suggesting that these expectational forces
may in fact be quite weak. Still, one might expect a strengthening of these forces in a crisis, as a worried
population turns its attention to its leaders for guidance and support.
        Using a large-scale survey of U.S. households during the COVID-19 pandemic, we study how new
information about policy responses affects the expectations and decisions of respondents. Specifically, we
provide random subsets of participants with different combinations of information about the severity of the
pandemic, recent actions by the Federal Reserve, stimulus measures implemented by Congress, as well as
recommendations from the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC). We then characterize how their
economic expectations and spending plans respond to these information treatments. This allows us to assess
to what extent these policy announcements alter the beliefs and plans of economic agents.
        By and large, we find very little effect of these information treatments on the economic expectations
of agents for income, mortgage rates, inflation or the unemployment rate nor do we find an effect on their
planned decisions, contrary to the powerful effects they have in standard macroeconomic models. Why
might agents’ economic beliefs not respond to this information? One possible explanation is that they were
already aware of the information provided in the treatments. While we do not have the prior beliefs of

                                                                                                             1
agents for all information treatments, those for which we do suggest that this is not a likely explanation.
For example, households’ prior beliefs about the transmission rate of COVID-19 or its recovery rate were
wildly misinformed prior to the information treatments. Furthermore, previous work has documented how
uninformed households tend to be about most monetary and fiscal policies and how even large policy
announcements do not make their way into households’ aggregate expectations, even in the midst of a crisis
(e.g., Coibion et al. 2020). Furthermore, Binder (2020) documents that even after the historic policy actions
of the Federal Reserve in response to the COVID-19 crisis, only a third of U.S. households had heard about
these policy actions. A second possible explanation is if households are skeptical of the information that
we provide. Again, we view this as very unlikely because other information treatments in identical settings
have previously been found to lead to dramatic revisions in households’ views about the economy (e.g.,
Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Weber 2019). A third possible explanation rests on the idea that, because of
cognitive constraints, many households might not directly understand the implications of complex policies
for their optimal savings and consumption decisions (e.g., D’Acunto et al. 2020a,b). The fourth, and in our
view most likely, explanation is that households do not believe that the policy responses described in the
treatments are effective: i.e., the multipliers they associate with the described policy responses are close to
zero. Note that zero multipliers may be observed because so-called information effects (i.e., policy actions
reveal a bad state of the economy) offset any positive effects of a policy action.
        Our paper builds on a recent but growing literature in macroeconomics that relies on surveys to
measure expectations and randomized information treatments to establish causality (e.g., Cavallo et al. 2017,
Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Kumar 2018, Armona et al. 2019). We depart from previous work along several
dimensions. First, we use a large-scale survey of U.S. households participating in the Nielsen Homescan panel,
providing us with a sample size that is an order of magnitude larger than in commonly available surveys.
Second, our survey was run in April 2020 in the midst of the COVID epidemic, so we are able to study the
dramatic policy actions taken specifically in response to the outbreak. In addition, we are able to provide new
insight about how informed households were about both the deadliness of the disease and how it spreads
across the population. There has been a surge of research on the corona virus in recent months, much of it
relying on surveys. We build on this growing body of work by utilizing randomized control trials (RCT) to
study the effects of economic policy responses to the crisis. Third, we combine treatments about the severity
of the disease with treatments not only about economic policy responses (e.g. fiscal and monetary) but also
about health policies (recommendations from the CDC). This allows us to speak about the relative benefits of
very different types of policy responses within a common framework.
        Previous work has documented extensively how inattentive households (and firms) tend to be to
macroeconomic conditions (Bachmann, Berg, and Sims (2015), Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Kumar
(2018), Coibion et al. (2019), D’Acunto et al. (2019)). We find the same qualitative patterns hold during

                                                                                                             2
the COVID crisis but also document that this lack of understanding extends to information about the
coronavirus. For example, when we ask households what they think the recovery rate is once infected with
COVID, they report an average answer of 73%, far lower than the 97% reported by the World Health
Organization (WHO). Similarly, when we ask them how many people tend to be infected by someone
carrying the COVID virus, their average answer is 21, far higher than the actual rate of around 2 estimated
by the WHO. This suggests that information treatments that provide factual information about transmission
and recovery rates could potentially have important effects on households’ expectations about the economy.
        Despite this, we find very small effects of providing information about the deadliness and ease of
spread of the disease on households’ expectations. When respondents are treated with information that, on
average, the disease is harder to spread and less deadly than they had original thought, their views about future
inflation, mortgage rates and unemployment are effectively unchanged. They reduce their reported expected
future income on average but the change is economically insignificant. Their perceptions about whether now
is a good or bad time to buy durables are also effectively unchanged. The one exception is for unemployed
workers who are asked about the likelihood of finding a job: those who are treated with information about the
disease raise their likelihood of finding a job by about twenty percentage points. These results suggest that the
large changes in expectations during the COVID-19 pandemic for income, the stock market, or mortgage rates
are less likely driven by direct concerns about the virus but more likely a response to the lockdowns imposed
by local authorities in line with findings in Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Weber (2020).
        Information treatments about fiscal, monetary or health policies similarly do very little to the
expectations of households, both about the aggregate economy or about their own income. And when they
do, those effects are not necessarily positive. For example, among the unemployed who become more
optimistic about their future job prospects when they are told that COVID-19 spreads less easily and is less
deadly than they thought, providing additional information about the responses of policy-makers fully
offsets the effect of the information about the disease. This is consistent with the presence of an information
effect to policies: finding out that fiscal, monetary or health policy-makers are implementing large policy
changes makes the unemployed less optimistic about their job prospects, but only when done in conjunction
with information about the disease. Information treatments that are only about policy changes have
effectively no effect on most agents’ macroeconomic or individual expectations. These results are
consistent with recent findings documenting an information effects of monetary policy which suggest that
large policy moves might reveal information about the state of the economy which is called Delphic in the
context of forward guidance (see, e.g., Campbell et al. 2012)
        By studying the effect of policy actions on households’ macroeconomic expectations through RCTs,
our paper is closest to Andre et al. (2019). They present specific scenarios of both fiscal and monetary shocks
to households (as well as experts) to assess how they believe these shocks will affect the economy. They find

                                                                                                               3
that households’ views about fiscal shocks are similar to those of experts, but their perceptions of how
monetary shocks affect the economy differ significantly from those in standard models or those perceived by
experts. One important difference is that Andre et al. (2019) present respondents with hypothetical exogenous
shocks to either fiscal or monetary policy whereas we present households with information about clearly
endogenous policy responses. Our results therefore speak directly to the effects of systematic policy changes
whereas theirs are focused on exogenous policy. Our findings suggest that these systematic policy responses
have little effect on households’ expectations, either because they believe they are ineffective or because
policy responses induce an information effect (in which households interpret the sheer fact of a policy
response as indicative of a weaker economy) that effectively offsets the effect of the policy change.
        Our work is also closely related to Binder (2020) and Fetzer et al. (2020) that assess how
randomized provision of COVID19 health facts influences concerns (about personal financial situation and
about aggregate economy) of households participating in online surveys.1 Apart from the fact that we are
using a survey that is an order-of-magnitude larger in size (and hence more precise estimates of treatment
effects), we also study how the provision of health facts and/or policy responses shapes expectations.
        Our research also relates to a broader literature on the effect of monetary policy on household
expectations. That literature has documented that monetary policy decisions and announcements have little to
no effect on household inflation expectations (e.g., Lamla and Vinogradov 2019, Coibion et al. 2020). This
result is generally interpreted as indicating that households are unaware of the policy actions. Our results
suggest an additional possible mechanism underlying these results: even when households are made aware of
these policy decisions, they do not view them as having meaningful effects on the aggregate economy. Hence,
it is not only important to reach households with communication but also to design and implement policies
that are easy and simple to grasp for non-expert households and to explain the implications of policies for
optimal consumption, savings, and investment decisions (D’Acunto, Hoang, and Weber, 2020a).


II.     Survey Description
In this section, we describe the implementation of the survey as well as the information treatments. We
build on our earlier work (Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Weber 2019, Coibion, Gorodnichenko,
Georgarakos, and Weber 2020, and D’Acunto et al. 2020c,d) using the Nielsen Homescan panel to study
expectations and spending decisions.

A       The Survey

 Binder (2020) also uses a difference-in-difference approach to study how informing households about the Fed’s
policy rate cut changes expectations.

                                                                                                            4
Our survey was run in April 2020 on the Nielsen Homescan panel of households. This panel consists of 80-
90,000 households who track their spending daily for A.C. Nielsen. Following Coibion, Gorodnichenko
and Weber (2019) and Coibion et al. (2020), we ran a survey on these households that included various
information treatments that we provided in a randomized fashion. The survey consisted of an initial set of
questions designed to measure the prior beliefs and plans of households, followed by a randomized
information treatment, and concluding with a final set of questions meant to assess how/whether treatments
affected the expectations and plans of participants. 13,771 individuals responded to the survey, yielding a
response rate of 27%. The response rate compares favorably to the average response rates of surveys on
Qualtrics which is the most commonly used survey platform for online surveys that estimates a response rate
between 5% to 10%. Survey questions are provided in the Appendix.
        Nielsen attempts to balance the panel on nine dimensions: household size, income, age of household
head, education of female household head, education of male household head, presence of children,
race/ethnicity, and occupation of the household head. Panelists are recruited online, but the panel is balanced
using Nielsen’s traditional mailing methodology. Nielsen checks the sample characteristics on a weekly basis
and performs adjustments when necessary. Nielsen provides sampling weights to correct for possible
imbalances in the composition of respondents in our survey. All of our reported results use sampling weights.
        Nielsen provides households with various incentives to guarantee the accuracy and completeness
of the information households report. They organize monthly prize drawings, provide points for each
instance of data submission, and engage in ongoing communication with households. Panelists can use
points to purchase gifts from a Nielsen-specific award catalog. Nielsen structures the incentives to not bias
the shopping behavior of their panelists. The KNCP has a retention rate of more than 80% at the annual
frequency. Nielsen validates the reported consumer spending with the scanner data of retailers on a
quarterly frequency to ensure high data quality. The KNCP filters households that do not report a minimum
amount of spending over the previous 12 months. Information on scanned consumer spending is available
only with a pronounced lag however, so we are not yet able to combine information from our survey
responses with underlying spending decisions on the part of households.
        Table 1 reports moments of initial beliefs and expectations reported by households. We present both
raw moments as well as “robust” moments controlling for outliers using Huber (1964) robust methods, and
we focus on the latter in our discussions. On average, households in April 2020 perceived an inflation rate of
2.6% and expected a lower inflation rate of 1.7% over the next twelve months, significantly lower than in
other comparable survey waves of Nielsen panelists (e.g., Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Weber 2019, Coibion
et al., 2020). Inflation expectations and perceptions exhibit significant cross-sectional dispersion, with a
standard deviation of close to 3%. This dispersion can also be seen in Figure 1, which plots the distribution of
answers as well as the current value of the variable at the time of the survey (red, vertical line). Unlike in

                                                                                                              5
previous waves, households believed that the unemployment rate was nearly 10% in April and expected an
even higher rate of unemployment twelve months later (nearly 11%). Disagreement about both current and
future unemployment was also pervasive, as illustrated in Panels C and D of Figure 1. Table 1 also reports
households’ perceptions of the current mortgage interest rate as well as their expectations for this interest rate
at the end of 2020, 2021 as well as over longer horizon of 3-5 years. The average belief about the current
mortgage rate was 3.6%, close to the average value of 3.3% on March 26 2020, with households anticipating
a very gradual increase in mortgage rates over the next 3-5 years.2 As illustrated in Panels E-F of Figure 1,
however, there is significant disagreement across households about the path of future interest rates.
        Respondents were also asked questions about COVID-19. First, we asked them about the infection
rate, i.e. how many uninfected people might be expected to be infected by one person carrying the virus.
As Panel A of Figure 2 documents, households reported a wide range of answers with many answering 100
or more. Very few gave answers close to the WHO’s estimate of an infection rate of 2, suggesting that most
households significantly over-estimated how contagious the virus actually is. Second, they were asked
about how lethal the virus is. Specifically, we asked them how likely a person was to survive after having
been infected with the virus, i.e. the recovery rate. We plot responses to this question in Panel B of Figure
2. Again, the range of answers provided by households is enormous, with a recovery rate of 50% being the
most commonly provided answer, nowhere near the answer of 96-97% provided by the WHO. We conclude
that, consistent with Binder (2020) and Fetzer et al. (2020), households were very uninformed about the
actual contagiousness and danger of the disease, with most households being far more pessimistic about the
disease than health authorities.
        Finally, respondents were also asked about expectations about their own economic situation. For
example, we asked them to report how they expected their income to change over the next twelve months. As
reported in Table 1, the raw average was -2.4%, again masking significant variation (cross-sectional standard
deviation of 14 percentage points). In addition, we asked respondents to tell us whether they were currently
employed. Those reporting being employed were then asked about the probability of losing their jobs over the
next 12 months. Panel B of Figure 3 plots the resulting distribution of answers. Most respondents report a
probability very close to or equal to 0%, indicating limited concerns about losing their jobs. For those reporting
that they were not currently employed but are looking for a job (approximately 7% of respondents), we asked
them about the probability of finding a job over the next 12 months. As illustrated in Panel A of Figure 3,
answers were extremely dispersed. While some report probabilities of finding a job close to 100%, almost as
many report a probability of just 50% and 32% report a probability of 10% or less.

 The survey is conducted over mortgage lenders originating loans in the U.S. See FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of
St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US

                                                                                                                6
B       Treatments
After being asked this initial set of questions, respondents were then randomly assigned to one of multiple
treatments groups. The first group is the control group, which gets no information provided to them.
However, they still receive the same set of follow-up questions which allow us to measure any change in
their expectations for comparison to treatment groups. Even though they are not provided with information,
we may still observe changes in expectations because the wording of questions pre- and post-treatment is
generally different, a strategy we employ to avoid respondents leaving the survey if they are being asked
the same questions twice. For example, inflation expectations are initially measured using a distributional
question while posterior beliefs are measured by respondents being asked to provide a point estimate.
Because the wording of questions can lead to some differences in answers, having the control group
answering both sets of questions allows us to control for any effect that different wording may induce.
        Respondents not assigned to the control group were randomly placed in one of nine groups, as
summarized in Table 2. These nine groups differ first in terms of whether they received information about
the COVID-19 virus, and second in terms of whether they were provided with additional information about
fiscal, monetary or health policies of the government. With respect to the information about the virus,
approximately half of non-control group participants received the information about the virus (treatment
groups 6-10), while the other half did not (treatment groups 2-5). The specific wording used in providing
the WHO information about the virus to treatment groups 6-10 was:

         “According to official estimates of the World Health Organization for these rates: The recovery
        rate from the corona virus is approximately 96-97 percent (that is, there is 96-97 in 100 chance to
        recover). Approximately 2 non-infected people will catch the coronavirus from a person who has
        the coronavirus.”

In addition to the possibility of being treated with information about the severity of the COVID epidemic,
households could also randomly be treated with information about the fiscal policy response (treatment
groups T3 and T8), the monetary policy response (treatment groups T2 and T7), both (treatment groups T4
and T9), neither (control group T1 and treatment group T6), or the recommendations from health officials
(treatment groups T5 and T10). For each type of policy treatment, we therefore have two treatment groups:
one that also received the information treatment vis-a-vis the severity of the disease and one that only
received the policy treatment. The objective of this exercise is to measure the effectiveness of policy
communication when background information is also provided. This feature of our survey is a key
innovation relative to previous research that studies the effects of information provision on expectations
such as Coibion et al. (2020) that treat households with forward guidance by the Federal Reserve.
Treatments about the path of future interest rates as in Coibion et al. (2020) allows clean identification of


                                                                                                           7
treatments on revisions of expectations but possibly does not provide all necessary information to policy-
makers that are interested in the response of households to endogenous policy actions. In the context of
forward guidance for example, one might want to study the effect of providing information on future interest
rates with conditional statements typically used by the Federal Reserve such as ‘until the unemployment
rate falls below x%’. We build on this work by providing real-world information treatments that explicitly
identify endogenous policy actions.
        The specific, truthful policy treatments that we consider are as follows. The monetary policy
treatment is given by the following quote:

         “In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the Federal Reserve reduced short-term interest rates to zero
        and implemented additional measures similar to what it did during the last recession.”

The fiscal policy treatment is given by:
         “In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the Congress approved a $2 trillion package to stimulate the
        economy, including one-time $1,200 check per person (plus another $500 per child) to persons
        with annual income less than $75,000. Couples who filed jointly and made less than $150,000 will
        get a one-time $2,400 check (plus another $500 per child).”

The joint monetary and fiscal treatment is:

        “In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the Federal Reserve reduced short-term interest rates to zero
        and implemented additional measures similar to what it did during the last recession. In addition,
        the Congress approved a $2 trillion package to stimulate the economy, including one-time $1,200
        check per person (plus another $500 per child) to persons households with annual income less than
        $75,000. Couples who filed jointly and made less than $150,000 will get a one-time $2,400 check
        (plus another $500 per child).

While the health recommendation treatment is:

        “The U.S. government health officials encourage social distancing, avoiding discretionary travel,
        and working remotely. Three in four Americans are in areas with local governments declaring
        “shelter in place” (lockdown).”

If provided, these information bits about policy responses appear immediately after the WHO health facts.
Note that both the fiscal and monetary treatments (as well as the joint monetary-fiscal treatments) explicitly
tie the policy response to the COVID-19 crisis, indicating that these are endogenous policy responses unlike
the exogenous shocks proposed to households in Andre et al. (2019). Consistent with random assignment



                                                                                                            8
of treatments, we find (Appendix Table 1) that treatment status is not predicted by personal/household
characteristics.


III. Econometric framework
To measure the effect of policy communications on households’ beliefs and plans, we use the following
specification as a baseline:

        𝐸     (𝑋) − 𝐸          (𝑋) =   𝛽 × 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡      ,   + 𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟,                                (1)


where 𝑖 indexes respondents, 𝑋 is an outcome variable, 𝐸                 (∙) and 𝐸      (∙) are post-treatment
(“posterior”) and pre-treatment (“prior”) beliefs of respondent 𝑖 about variable 𝑋, 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡          ,   is an
indicator variable equal to one if respondent 𝑖 received treatment 𝑠 and zero otherwise. The 𝛽 coefficients
provide an estimate of the average effect of each treatment on the revision in beliefs. Although one may
expect that 𝛽 for the control group is equal to zero, differences in the wording of the pre- and post-treatment
questions, mean reversion in the responses, and the like can generate non-zero belief revision for the control
group. We will therefore report 𝛽 for a treatment group relative to 𝛽 for the control group.
        While specification (1) provides a useful summary of information treatments on the beliefs, it may
give an incomplete picture of how treatments influence beliefs if the provided signals happen to be in the
middle of the distribution for prior beliefs. For example, if households believe on average that inflation will
be 2 percent, treating households with a 2-percent inflation projection prepared by professional forecasters
will not move the average belief in the treatment group but it should make the posterior distribution more
concentrated on 2 percent by moving beliefs of those who initially predicted inflation other than 2 percent
closer to 2 percent after the treatment. While our treatments do not have a numeric forecast and so it is
hard to assess whether provided information is in the middle or tail of prior distributions, we can nonetheless
utilize an alternative specification to measure this more subtle adjustment of beliefs:

        𝐸     (𝑋) =      𝛽 × 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡      ,   +    𝛾 × 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡       ,   ×𝐸      (𝑋) + 𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟.      (2)

In this specification, 𝛽s and 𝛾s measure “level” and “slope” effects of treatments respectively. If a signal
happens to be above (below) the average pre-treatment belief, 𝛽 should be positive (negative). As discussed
in e.g. Coibion et al. (2020), estimated slopes should be smaller for treated groups relative to the control
group if respondents are Bayesian learners. If there is no difference in slopes between control and treatment
groups, then the provided message is not informative for households. We will report 𝛽 and 𝛾 for a treatment
group relative to 𝛽 and 𝛾 for the control group.



                                                                                                              9
        Specifications (1) and (2) utilize pre-treatment and post-treatment beliefs but some survey
responses are available only at the post-treatment stage. For these responses, we employ the following
specification:

        𝐸        (𝑋) =   𝛽 × 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡      ,   + 𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟.                                              (3)

        Given that treatment assignment is random, specifications (1)-(3) do not require controls to account
for respondents’ heterogeneity to estimate treatment effects. Including controls only reduces standard errors
and does not make material impact on our estimates (results are available upon request). To keep our analysis
simple, we thus do not include controls in the reported results. To attenuate the adverse effects of extreme
survey responses and, more generally, influential observations on our estimates, we winsorize data at the
bottom and top 1 percent, drop implausible values (e.g., mortgage rates greater than 40 percent), and estimate
specifications (1)-(3) using Huber (1964) robust regressions. Huber-robust regressions differ from using
winsorized data in standard regressions because they also take correlations across variables into account.


IV. Results
Using these empirical specifications, we now turn to how treatments affect households’ beliefs and plans.
We discuss each of these in turn.

    A. Macroeconomic expectations
Modern macroeconomic theory emphasizes the central role of expectations and the power of
communicating policy actions to economic agents. Indeed, credible announcements about current or future
policy are predicted to have large effects on perceptions and expectations about macroeconomic variables
and thus influence firms’ and households’ choices. We now examine whether informing households about
COVID-19 facts as well as policy actions taken in response by various government bodies can move
households’ expectations.
        Table 3 reports results for specification (1). We generally find that the average size of belief
revisions in the control group is economically small with the only exception being inflation expectations
(column 1). The large revision for inflation expectations reflects the fact that the pre-treatment expectations
are elicited via a distribution question with pre-set upper and lower bounds at +/-12% similar to the wording
in the New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations, while post-treatment expectations are collected as
point predictions.
        We find that informing households about COVID-19 recovery (opposite of fatality) and contagion
rates (treatment T6) generally has no material effect on expectations for inflation (column 1), the
unemployment rate (columns 2 and 3), mortgage rates (columns 4-7) or households’ expected income

                                                                                                             10
growth. Note that the vast majority of households is overly skeptical about the COVID-19 recovery and
contagion rates and therefore this treatment presents a clear, one-sided surprise for households. While the
estimated coefficients are statistically significant for the current mortgage rate and expected household
income growth, the economic significance of these effects is very small. For example, this information
treatment lowers households’ expected income growth by 0.094 percentage point, which is small relative
to the standard deviation of the belief revision in the control group (0.906 percent point; column 8, bottom
row, Table 3) by an order of magnitude. Our results are line with the findings in Binder (2020) and Fetzer
et al. (2020) who also document that randomized provision of COVID-19 health facts has at most a very
modest (if any) effect on economic (personal or aggregate) expectations. These results are consistent with
two views. One is that households are unable to interpret health facts in a macroeconomic context, that is,
they cannot draw a connection between the severity of COVID-19 and macroeconomic outcomes. The
second viewpoint is that households believe that COVID-19 does not influence economic outcomes. This
alternative view is unlikely to be empirically relevant. For example, Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Weber
(2020) document that households attribute pervasive, large losses in their income and wealth to the COVID-
19 outbreak and that they are highly concerned about their financial situation because of the COVID-19
pandemic. Thus, we interpret this result as implying that households are unable to quickly draw connections
between the severity of the disease and macroeconomic outcomes. One implication of this is that policy
responses which focus on communicating about the disease and its health consequences cannot be expected
to significantly affect households’ economic expectations. Health communications cannot be a substitute
for economic communications unless it is clearly communicated how these health facts are relevant for
individuals and the broader economy.
        Appraising households of the Federal Reserve’s actions (treatment T2) lowers inflation expectations
by 0.7 percentage point. While one might have expected to see an increase in households’ inflation
expectations in response to this policy, our finding is consistent with Coibion et al. (2020) documenting a
positive comovement of inflation and interest rate expectations unconditionally and in response to treatments
with numeric inflation/interest rate information. Specifically, when the Fed lowers interest rates, households
lower their inflation expectations, which could capture an “information effect” of policy announcements. Also
in agreement with Coibion et al. (2020), our estimates suggest that households do not believe in the ability of
the Fed to influence the unemployment rate: treatment T2 has no discernable effect on the expected
unemployment rate in either the short- or long-run (columns 2 and 3 in Table 3 respectively). Nor do we find
any economic effect on the mortgage rate expectations: the estimated coefficients are close to zero. This result
suggests that, given how low mortgage rates were by historical standards before the COVID-19 crisis,
households may view the Fed’s power to lower mortgage rate even further as limited. Finally, households do
not observe a connection between monetary policy and their income growth. This latter results suggests that

                                                                                                             11
indirect effects of monetary policy on income expectations are weak in household surveys contrary to
theoretical predictions in Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) models.
         In contrast, informing households about the fiscal policy response (“Congress actions”; treatment
T3) raises inflation expectations modestly by 0.3 percentage points. Interestingly, this treatment also raises
short-run expectations for the unemployment rate (column 2) by a similar magnitude. This positive
comovement of inflation and unemployment (“stagflation”) is consistent with Kamdar (2018): households
tend to view high inflation as positively associated with high unemployment. It is also in line with the
simple affective heuristic proposed in Andre et al. (2019). However, this fiscal policy action does not move
households’ longer-run expectations for the unemployment rate (column 3) or mortgage rate expectations
(columns 4-7). Strikingly, although the fiscal policy involves a direct transfer to households (which we
provide in the treatment) and the vast majority of households participating in the survey qualify for these
transfers, households do not view this policy as having a materially important effect on their expected
income growth. In fact, the estimated coefficient is negative (column 8), again suggesting a potential
information effect.
         When we tell households about the fiscal and monetary policy response (treatment T4), the
estimated responses are roughly a mix of responses to treatments T2 and T3. We do not observe any
evidence suggesting that the policies reinforce each other. Similar to T2 and T3, treatment T4 does not
generate economically large responses of macroeconomic expectations. This finding is particularly
remarkable given that policy responses are enormous by historical standards and yet the American public
treats these as largely irrelevant for the economy.
         Treating people with information about good practices and the share of people under shelter-in-
place orders (treatment T5) similarly has no noticeable effect on macroeconomic expectations. One might
expect this treatment to have a pronounced effect on macroeconomic expectations if a) households were
not fully aware of how nationally pervasive lockdown orders were at the time and b) if households believed
that lockdowns significantly affected economic activity. While we do not observe individuals’ prior beliefs
about the share of the U.S. population under lockdown at the time and therefore cannot test a) directly, the
fact that households were so uninformed about the recovery rates and transmission rates of the disease
suggests that they were unlikely to be significantly more informed about lockdown policies. Thus, we
interpret our finding of no effect from the health policy information treatment on households’
macroeconomic expectations as indicative that they did not perceive lockdowns as very costly in economic
terms.
         One might anticipate that combining information on policy responses with health information on the
severity of COVID-19 (treatments T7-T10) could alter how households translate policy responses into
macroeconomic expectations. While we fail to find any marked difference in the responses of expectations

                                                                                                           12
for unemployment, mortgage rates, and income growth, we do observe several interesting facts for inflation
expectations. First, the effect of the Fed’s actions is considerably mitigated: when households were informed
about the Fed policy response, they lowered their inflation expectations but when households are also
informed that COVID-19 is not as bad as they thought, the deflationary effect of the Fed policy response is
largely gone (and is similar to the effect in response to information about only the recovery and contagion
rates of COVID-19). Second, while the fiscal policy response (“Congress actions”) raised inflation
expectations, combining this response with health information lowers inflation expectations (although the
effect is not statistically significant). Finally, providing information about COVID-19 recovery/contagion rate
and information about CDC recommendations and the share of people under lockdown orders lowers inflation
expectations. These results suggest that the broader context is important for inflation but other macroeconomic
expectations are largely insensitive to information about health facts or policy responses.
        To further explore the effect of treatments on macroeconomic expectations, we report estimated
effects for specification (2) in Table 4 and visualize the distribution of post- and pre-treatment beliefs in
Appendix Figures 1-7. Column (1) of the table shows the results for inflation expectations. Note that the slope
for the control group is 0.3 (rather than approximately 1) and the average revision (intercept) is 3.9 (rather
than 0) because of the differences in the pre-treatment and post-treatment questions eliciting inflation
expectations (distribution vs. point prediction). Relative to this benchmark, we find that the estimated “level”
effects (i.e., coefficients 𝛽 in specification (2)) tend to be negative. These results suggest that the received
signals are interpreted by households as providing information that is below the average initial beliefs of
households. At the same time, the slope effects tend to be close to zero in economic terms although some
coefficients are statistically different from zero. Therefore, the treatments generally shift the distribution of
inflation expectations to the left without a discernable change in the cross-sectional variation in expectations.
Interestingly, while some information treatment may be conceived as disinflationary, the monetary and fiscal
policies that employed a wide arsenal of tools to fight the COVID-19 crisis are hardly disinflationary by
themselves. This reaction to treatments thus appears to be consistent with significant information effects, that
is, households could interpret strong policy responses as signaling a confirmation of an economic catastrophe.
        Short-term unemployment rate expectations (column (2) of Table 4) show little “level” or “slope”
reaction to the treatments. In contrast, longer-term expectations (column (3)) have some variation in the
“level” effect ranging from 0.762 percentage point increase for treatment T10 (COVID facts and health
information) to -0.364 percentage point decrease for treatment T5 (COVID facts only). The slope effects
are generally negative suggesting some compression in the post-treatment disagreement across respondents.
Consistent with the results in Table 3, we find no material “level” or “slope” response in expectations for
mortgage rates (columns (4)-(7) of Table 4). Similarly, there is generally little variation in response to
treatments for households’ income growth (column (8) of Table 4).

                                                                                                              13
        In summary, our results suggest that while inflation expectations have some limited sensitivity to
information treatments, other macroeconomic expectations (especially, expectations for mortgage rates) do
not exhibit any discernable reaction to the provided information. Given that households are (on average)
poorly informed about macroeconomic policies or health facts and that the benefits of having access to
information about the enormous policy responses as well as health facts are predicted to be high by mainstream
macroeconomic theory, this weak (if any) reaction to the information treatments is indeed striking.

    B. Labor market expectations
We now consider how these treatments affect households’ expectations for their labor market outcomes,
specifically the probability of keeping their job if employed and the probability of finding a job if
unemployed. Because we do not have pre-treatment measures of these subjective probabilities, we use
specification (3) to estimate the effect of information treatments on perceived labor market outcomes. We
find (Table 5) that information treatments do not have a materially important effect on the subjective
probability of losing a job (column (1)): the estimated coefficients are small (fractions of a percentage point)
and generally not significant statistically. In contrast, when it comes to how the unemployed perceive the
probability of finding a job, the provision of COVID-19 facts (treatment T6) raises this perceived
probability by 20 percentage points, a large effect. Interestingly, any other treatment, including treatments
where information about COVID-19 facts is combined with information on policy responses, generate no
statistically significant effect on the perceived probability of finding a job. This pattern appears to suggest
two conclusions. First, households do not view policy responses as having an important effect on their labor
market outcome. Second, providing basic COVID-19 facts appears to be helpful in making unemployed
households less pessimistic about their labor market prospects—thus suggesting some role for information
campaigns highlighting public health implications of the COVID-19 outbreak—but the information effect
in the policy response seems to offset this positive effect.

    C. Planned consumer spending
Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Weber (2020) and Dietrich et al. (2020) document that, during the COVID-19
crisis, households significantly downgraded their plans to buy durable goods such as houses/apartments, cars,
and large appliances. In part, the policy response to the crisis was aimed to make households more enthusiastic
about purchases of durable goods. For example, policy interest rates where cut down to zero and new rounds
of quantitative easing reduced mortgage rates thus making the financial cost of durable purchases more
enticing. However, it remains unclear to what extent these policies turned the tide of pessimism and




                                                                                                             14
encouraged purchases of new goods.3 To gauge the influence of these policies on consumer spending, we
asked respondents at the post-treatment stage to report whether it is a good time to buy a durable good.
Specifically, respondents can report their beliefs on a 1 (very good time) to 5 (very bad time) scale.
        Using specification (3), we find (Table 6) that information treatments generally make households
more positive about buying a house (the coefficients are negative) but the magnitude of the response is
quite small. The largest responses are approximately -0.1 to -0.15 while the scale varies from 1 to 5 and the
standard deviation of scores in the control group is approximately one. The views for car or appliance
purchases in response to the treatments are more mixed with some treatments resulting in less positive
views and some treatment resulting in more positive views. However, the economic magnitudes remain
rather small. These results suggest that although informing households about policies or health facts is
somewhat helpful in improving consumer sentiment, the effects are modest at best, thus again pointing to
limited effectiveness of information provision on economic outcomes.

    D. Policy approval
While consumers seem to not understand the economic implications of the policy responses, they may still
appreciate the reaction of various government bodies to the crisis. To measure this potential effect, we ask
respondents to rate the actions of the President, the Congress, the Federal Reserve, and U.S. health officials
by answering the following question on a scale running from 0 (not helpful at all) to 10 (extremely helpful):
“How much do you trust the actions taken by [GOVERNMENT BODY] will be helpful for you? And the
overall American population?” Note that we ask households to assess the value of the actions for them
personally and for the country as a whole so that we can get a metric—however imperfect—about the ability
of households to grasp partial equilibrium and general equilibrium effects.
        For the control group, U.S. health officials have the highest scores (the averages are 6.3 for the
country and 6.1 for the respondent) followed by the Fed (5.6 for the country and 5.0 for the respondent),
the President (4.9 for the country and 4.6 for the respondent), and then Congress (4.5 for the country and
4.3 for the respondent). Households consistently perceive policy institutions as being better for the country
than for them personally. At the same time, we observe a high correlation (ranging from 0.7 for the Fed to
0.9 for the President) between responses for personal and country-level implications and much weaker
correlation between assessment for various government bodies (e.g., the correlation between personal effect
from the President’s actions and the Fed’s actions is 0.3), thus suggesting that households differentiate
actions of various government branches during the crisis.



3
  At the same time, historically low rates did generate a wave of mortgage refinances. According to information from
the Mortgage Bankers Association, refinances increased to $1.5 trillion as of early May, a 51% jump compared to
2019.

                                                                                                                 15
        Information treatments have highly heterogeneous effects on these scores. Using specification (3),
we find (columns (1) and (2) of Table 7) that information about actual policies does not improve approval
of the President’s actions. If anything, treatments T2 (monetary policy) and T4 (monetary and fiscal policy)
reduce the approval of the President’s actions. These results are consistent with the view that respondents
generally have strong priors about the President. In contrast, every treatment raises the appreciation of
Congress. This includes treating households with information about monetary policy which is not controlled
(at least directly) by the Congress. The Federal Reserve is viewed less positively when households are
informed about monetary policy (treatment T2) but the Fed gets some credit for fiscal policy. The views on
the actions of U.S. health officials are weakly improved by the treatments when respondents are informed
about basic COVID-19 facts. The latter observation suggests that when households are told that COVID-
19 is not as contagious and fatal as they think initially, they tend to credit U.S. health officials.
        While treatment effects are statistically significant, the economic significance of the effects varies.
For example, treatments can materially improve the image of Congress while views on the President’s
actions appear to be rather unresponsive to the provided information. Thus, similar to the responses of
macroeconomic expectations, consumer expenditure plans, and labor market expectations, the perceptions
of policy effectiveness show some reaction to information treatments but the effects range from zero to
modest. This is again consistent with the notion that the general public is rather confused about the
responsibilities of various government bodies as well as implications of the bodies’ actions. Specifically,
fiscal and monetary policies get fairly little credit.


V. Discussion and Concluding Remarks
Understanding the way in which policy actions affect the economy has long been a challenge for
macroeconomists. Standard models imply that households’ expectations play a large role in driving these
effects, as households incorporate the announcements into their expectations and their decisions. Our results
challenge this key mechanism: we find little evidence that even large policy decisions have much of an
effect on households’ economic expectations or their planned actions. This result obtains for both monetary
and fiscal policies during the COVID-19 crisis, and extends to some of the health recommendations made
by the federal government as well.
        This result is in the same spirit as recent work documenting pervasive inattention on the part of
households and firms to monetary policy actions and announcements. However, it goes beyond inattention
because we directly inform participants about recent and dramatic policy decisions, yet even this directly
provided information has essentially no effect on household beliefs. Perhaps, cognitive constraints as
modeled in Gabaix (2019), Woodford (2018), Farhi and Werning (2019), and Angeletos and Lian (2018)
and the singular nature of COVID-19 limit the ability of households to reason through the implications of

                                                                                                            16
the pandemic and policy responses (see e.g. Iovino and Sergeyev (2020) for an application of this notion to
quantitative easing) and, as a result, inattention and cognitive constraints reinforce each other in dampening
the response of beliefs and hence economic outcomes to policy announcements.
        Our results are also distinct from and complementary to Andre et al. (2019) who study how
households respond to exogenous fiscal and monetary policy actions: we explicitly describe the policy
treatments as an endogenous response to the COVID19 crisis. Taken together, these results point toward a
world in which policy shocks have non-trivial effects on household expectations and actions while
systematic policy decisions have much smaller (if any) effects, which is the complete opposite of what we
tend to observe in standard macroeconomic models in which systematic policy is close to all-powerful while
policy shocks have much smaller effects. We view this as a fundamental challenge to workhorse models
used by macroeconomists in which the rapid and endogenous adjustment of household expectations is a
key driver of macroeconomic outcomes.

Notes: Each panel plots the distribution of pre-treatment beliefs in the Nielsen household panel. The red, vertical line shows the current
value of the corresponding variable at the time of the survey. Panels A, C, and E report perceptions of current values. Panels B, D, and
F report one-year ahead forecasts.

                   Figure 2. Distribution of beliefs about how contagious and fatal the COVID19 virus is.




Notes: Panel A: Infection rate is measured as the response to the following question, “Think of a person who has the coronavirus. How
many non-infected people do you think will catch the virus from this person?”. The response is winsorized at 100. Panel B: the recovery
rate is measured as the response to the following question, “If a person contracts coronavirus, what do you think is the probability that
this person recovers from the virus? Please enter a number between 0 (Do not recover) and 100 (Recover for sure)”. In each panel, the
red, vertical line shows the estimates provided by the World Health Organization.

Notes: The histograms plot distribution of perceived probabilities to find a job (Panel A) and to lose a job (Panel B). Both
panels report data for the control group only. Panel A is only for people who are unemployed (don’t have a job and look
for a job). Panel B is only for people who have a job.

Notes: pre-treatment expected inflation (12 months ahead) is computed as mean implied from the reported probability distribution over a range of bins. All other measures of inflation
are reported as point predictions. Perceived and expected mortgage rates are elicited for “a person like you” at the pre-treatment stage and for “someone with excellent credit” at the
post-treatment stage. Moments in columns (1) and (2) are computed using the Huber-robust method. Because many households report zero changes in household income, the Huber
method to compute moments robust to outliers does not converge and hence robust moments are not available for pre-treatment expectations for household income growth.

     Notes: The table reports Huber-robust estimation of specification (1) for macroeconomic expectations. All dependent variables are measured in percent. Revisions in inflation
     expectations are measured as post-treatment inflation forecast prediction minus pre-treatment implied-mean inflation forecast. Inflation expectations is at the one-year horizon.
     Revisions in short-run unemployment expectations are measured as post-treatment unemployment rate expected at the end of 2020 minus pre-treatment one-year-ahead forecast of
     the unemployment rate. Revisions in long-run unemployment expectations are measured as post-treatment unemployment rate expected at the next 3-5 years minus pre-treatment
     unemployment rate expected in the 3-5 years. Revisions in mortgage rate expectations (perceptions) are measured as post-treatment expected mortgage rate for “a person with
     excellent credit” minus pre-treatment expected mortgage rate for “a person like you”. Revision in household expected income is measured as post-treatment expectations (one year
     ahead; “How much higher or lower do you think your household’s total net income will be over the next twelve months compared to the last twelve months? Please provide an
     answer in percentage terms.”) minus pre-treatment expectations (one year ahead; “How much higher or lower do you think your household’s total after-tax (i.e., ‘take home’) income
     will be over the next twelve months compared to the last twelve months? Please provide an answer in percentage terms.”). Robust standard errors are in parentheses. ***, **, *
     denote statistical significance at 1, 5, and 10 percent levels.

Notes: The table reports results for estimating the following linear-probability regression for each treatment 𝑘 separately:
               ( )                                                                ( )
𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 = 𝑿 𝑏 ( ) + 𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 where 𝑖 indexes respondents, 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 is a dummy variable equal to one if household 𝑖 is
provided with treatment 𝑘 and zero otherwise, 𝑿 is a vector of household/individual characteristics. Individual characteristics are gender,
age, age squared, employed indicator, unemployment indicator, and race. Household characteristics are household income (binned;
indicator variable for each bin), household size (indicator variable for each size), census region (indicator variable for each region), male
head education (indicator variable for each group), female head education (indicator variable for each group). The table reports F-
statistic for the joint statistical significance of 𝑏.
