Inflation Illusion and Stock Prices

JEL No. G12, G14, N22

                                          ABSTRACT

We empirically decompose the S&P 500's dividend yield into (1) a rational forecast of long-run real

dividend growth, (2) the subjectively expected risk premium, and (3) residual mispricing attributed

to the market's forecast of dividend growth deviating from the rational forecast. Modigliani and

Cohn's (1979) hypothesis and the persistent use of the "Fed model" by Wall Street suggest that the

stock market incorrectly extrapolates past nominal growth rates without taking into account the

impact of time-varying inflation. Consistent with the Modigliani-Cohn hypothesis, we find that the

level of inflation explains almost 80% of the time-series variation in stock-market mispricing.

   The “Fed model” of equity valuation

    The influence of the macroeconomy on the stock market is a subject of enduring
importance and fascination to academics, investment professionals, and monetary
policymakers. Academics have devoted much of their eﬀort to models that link stock
prices to consumption through the first-order conditions of individual investors. Most
investment professionals have adopted a radically diﬀerent perspective. The leading
practitioner model of equity valuation, the so-called “Fed model,” relates the yield on
stocks (as measured by the ratio of dividends or earnings to stock prices) to the yield
on nominal Treasury bonds. The idea is that stocks and bonds compete for space
in investors’ portfolios. If the yield on bonds rises, then the yield on stocks must
also rise to maintain the competitiveness of stocks. The model is often augmented to
include a measure of the relative risk premium on stocks versus bonds, for example,
the historical relative volatility of the returns on these two asset classes. Practitioners
argue that the bond yield plus a risk premium defines a “normal” yield on stocks, and
that the actual stock yield tends to revert to this normal yield. If the measured stock
yield exceeds the normal yield defined by the Fed model, then stocks are attractively
priced; if the measured yield falls below the normal yield, then stocks are overpriced.

    Historically, the major influence on nominal bond yields has been the rate of
inflation. Thus the Fed model implies that stock yields are highly correlated with
inflation. In the late 1990’s practitioners often argued that falling stock yields, and
rising stock prices, were justified by declining inflation.

    As pointed out by Asness (2000, 2003), the Fed model has been quite successful
as an empirical description of stock prices. Most notably, the model describes the
rise in stock yields, along with inflation, during the 1970’s and early 1980’s, and the
decline in stock yields during the past 20 years. Of course, movements in stock
and bond prices are highly persistent, and so it is desirable to evaluate the empirical
performance of the Fed model over a longer period. In Table 1 we use a series of
regressions to illustrate the performance of the model in the period 1927-2002. Each
regression has a measure of the stock yield as the dependent variable, and proxies
for the risk premium and the nominal discount rate as the independent variables.
Our basic measure of the stock yield is the dividend-price ratio, but we also consider
the earnings-price ratio, smoothed by averaging earnings over five years. Our first
proxy for the risk premium is a cross-sectional beta premium within the stock market,
calculated by Polk, Thompson, and Vuolteenaho (2003) as the rank-order correlation
of stock-level yield measures with the stock’s CAPM beta. When this correlation


                                            1
is high, it implies that market participants expect a high reward for bearing market
risk since riskier (higher-beta) stocks are much cheaper than less risky stocks. Our
second risk premium proxy is the historical volatility of excess stock returns relative
to that of nominal bonds, a measure previously employed by, e.g., Asness (2003).
To measure the nominal discount rate we use either the average historical rate of
inflation, calculated as an exponentially declining moving average of past monthly
inflation rates, or the nominal yield on ten-year Treasury bonds.

    The benchmark regression in the first row of Table 1 explains 49% of the variation
in the dividend-price ratio using the cross-sectional risk premium and the histori-
cal inflation rate. Both variables are strongly statistically significant. Beyond the
statistical significance, the fit of this regression is illustrated in Figure 1. Here the
triangles are the demeaned dividend-price ratio, the solid line is the contribution of
the cross-sectional risk premium to the fit of the regression (the multivariate regres-
sion coeﬃcient times the risk premium), and the dashed line is the contribution of the
inflation rate to the fit of the regression. The figure shows that much of the volatile
movement of the dividend-price ratio during the 1930’s and 1940’s was related to
volatile movement of the cross-sectional risk premium. At the bottom of the Great
Depression, this explained the high level of the dividend-price ratio despite the pres-
ence of deflation, which our estimated model suggests should have supported stock
prices. As inflation rose during the late 1930’s and 1940’s, its negative influence on
stock prices was outweighted by the declining risk premium. In the postwar period
the cross-sectional risk premium generally trended downward, reaching a low point in
the early 1980’s. The inflation rate rose steadily during the 1960’s and 1970’s, and
accounts for the high dividend-price ratio (depressed stock prices) of the early 1980’s.
During the later 1980’s and 1990’s, the dividend-price ratio was driven downwards
both by a declining cross-sectional equity premium and by a declining inflation rate,
although the run-up in stock prices during the 1990’s was too extreme to be fully
explained by our two variables.

   Alternative specifications are reported in subsequent rows of Table 1. Row two
uses the five-year smoothed earnings yield rather than the dividend yield; this change
reduces the R2 substantially, but has little eﬀect on the estimated coeﬃcients. A
regression that substitutes relative volatility for the cross-sectional risk premium (row
three) has a very similar fit to the benchmark regression. Substituting the nominal
bond yield for historical inflation reduces the fit somewhat if the risk measure is
the cross-sectional risk premium (row four), but not if the risk measure is relative
volatility (row five).

   Interpreting the Fed model

    Despite the empirical success of the Fed model as a behavioral description of stock
prices, there is a serious diﬃculty with this model as a rational explanation of stock
prices (Modigliani and Cohn 1979, Ritter and Warr 2002, Asness 2000, 2003). To
understand the diﬃculty, consider the classic “Gordon growth model” (Williams 1938,
Gordon 1962) that expresses the dividend-price ratio in steady state as
                                     Dt
                                         = R − G,                                   (1)
                                    Pt−1
where R is the long-term discount rate and G is the long-term growth rate of divi-
dends. The Fed model argues that the discount rate on stocks is the yield on bonds
plus a proxy for the risk premium of stocks over bonds. These two variables will
explain the movement in stock prices if G is constant.

    The problem with this interpretation is that the main influence on the long-term
nominal interest rate is the expected long-term rate of inflation (Fama 1975, 1990,
Mishkin 1990a, 1990b). The long-term real interest rate is comparatively stable
and does not move closely with the long-term nominal rate. While the Gordon
growth model can be written in nominal terms, this requires that dividend growth
G is measured in nominal terms. Since stocks are claims to the productive capital
of the real economy, one would expect that a change in long-term expected inflation
would move nominal G one-for-one, oﬀsetting the eﬀect on nominal R and leaving
the dividend-price ratio unaﬀected. In real terms, neither R nor G should change
with expected inflation. This criticism of the Fed model is forcefully expressed by
Asness (2003).

    If the above conventional argument does not explain the empirical relation between
stock prices and inflation, what does explain this relation? One possibility is that
inflation (or the monetary authority’s response to inflation) damages the real economy,
and particularly the profitability of the corporate sector. In this case real G might
fall when inflation rises, justifiably driving up the dividend-price ratio. A variant of
this idea reverses the causality, arguing that poor economic prospects induce fiscal
and monetary responses that ultimately increase inflation (Geske and Roll 1983).
The diﬃculty with this argument is that G is correctly interpreted as a long-term
real dividend growth, not the conditional expected growth at business-cycle horizons
such as three years. A second possibility is that inflation makes investors more risk
averse, driving up the equity premium and thus the real discount rate R. Brandt
and Wang (2003) present a model of this eﬀect.

                                           3
    Modigliani and Cohn (1979) propose a more radical third hypothesis. They claim
that stock market investors (but not bond market investors) are subject to inflation
illusion. Stock market investors fail to understand the eﬀect of inflation on nom-
inal dividend growth rates and extrapolate historical nominal growth rates even in
periods of changing inflation. Thus when inflation rises, bond market participants
increase nominal interest rates which are used by stock market participants to dis-
count unchanged expectations of future nominal dividends. The dividend-price ratio
moves with the nominal bond yield because stock market investors irrationally fail
to adjust the nominal growth rate G to match the nominal discount rate R. From
the perspective of a rational investor, this implies that stock prices are undervalued
when inflation is high, and may become overvalued when inflation falls. The div-
idend yield that emerges from the interaction of rational and irrational investors is
positively correlated with inflation and the long-term nominal interest rate. In recent
work, Ritter and Warr (2002) support this idea with a detailed empirical analysis of
the 1983-2000 bull market.

    In this paper we try to distinguish among these three alternative views. To
understand our approach, it is helpful to return to the simple Gordon growth model
and subtract the riskless interest rate from both the discount rate and the growth
rate of dividends. We define the excess discount rate as Re ≡ R − Rf and the excess
dividend growth rate as Ge ≡ G − Rf . We are considering the possibility that some
investors are irrational, so we must distinguish between the subjective expectations
of irrational investors and the objective expectations of rational investors. As long
as the irrational investors simply use the present value formula with an erroneous
expected growth rate, both sets of expectations must obey the accounting identity of
the Gordon growth model. Thus we have
                  D
                    = Re,OBJ − Ge,OBJ = Re,SU BJ − Ge,SU BJ                           (2)
                  P
                    = −Ge,OBJ + Re,SU BJ + (Ge,OBJ − Ge,SU BJ ).

In words, the dividend yield has three components: (1) the negative of objectively ex-
pected excess dividend growth, (2) the subjective risk premium, and (3) a mispricing
term that is due to a divergence between the objective (i.e, rational) and subjective
(i.e, irrational) growth forecast.

    The first step in our analysis is to show that Ge,OBJ = Re,OBJ − D/P tends to
rise, not fall, and that Re,SU BJ tends to fall, not rise, with inflation, thus ruling out
the rational justifications for the comovement of the dividend yield with inflation.

                                            4
The second step is to show that, consistent with the Modigliani-Cohn view, high
inflation coincides with a positive divergence between objective and subjective growth
expectations Ge , the wedge between the growth expectations of rational investors and
irrational investors who are subject to inflation illusion.

   Empirical implementation and results

   In our empirical implementation we use the loglinear dynamic valuation frame-
work of Campbell and Shiller (1988), since this framework, unlike the simple Gordon
model, allows for time-varying discount rates and dividend growth rates. The Gor-
don model (1) has the limitation that the expected returns and expected growth
must be constant, thus it is suitable for our purposes only as an illustration. The
Campbell-Shiller formula for the log dividend-price ratio can be written as

                                k    X∞                X∞
                                          j      e
               dt−1 − pt−1   ≈     +     ρ Et−1 rt+j −     ρj Et−1 ∆det+j ,               (3)
                               ρ−1   j=0               j=0

where ∆d denotes log dividend growth, r denotes log stock return, ∆de denotes ∆d
less the log risk-free rate for the period, and re denotes r less the log±¡risk-free rate for¢
the period. ρ and k are parameters of linearization defined by ρ ≡ 1 1+exp(d − p)
and k ≡ − log(ρ) − (1 − ρ) log(1/ρ − 1). A typical value for ρ is 0.97. When the
dividend-price ratio is constant, then ρ = P/(P + D), the ratio of P     the ex-dividend to
the cum-dividend stock price. Comparing Equations (2) and (3), ∞                 j     e
                                                                           j=0 ρ Et−1 rt+j is
                                            P  ∞
analogous to Re,OBJ and Re,SUBJ , and j=0 ρj Et−1 ∆det+j is analogous to Ge,OBJ and
Ge,SUBJ , depending on whether the expectations taken in Equation (3) are objective
(i.e., rational) or subjective (i.e., irrational).
                                                         P
    In our empirical work, we will estimate the term ∞           j OBJ e
                                                            j=0 ρ Et−1 rt+j under objective
expectations.
           P∞ The     objective expected growth can then be inferred from Equation (3)
     k            j OBJ e
as ρ−1 + j=0 ρ Et−1 rt+j − (dt−1 − pt−1 ). The subjective risk premium is estimated
                                          P
as the fitted value of a regression of ∞           j OBJ e
                                             j=0 ρ Et−1 rt+j on a subjective risk-premium
proxy λt (for example, on the relative volatility of stocks vs. that of bonds):

                          X
                          ∞
                                ρj EOBJ  e
                                    t−1 rt+j = constant + γλt + εt                        (4)
                          j=0

Mispricing, or the diﬀerence between objective and subjective expected dividend
growth, is the residual εt of this regression. When stocks are subjectively perceived

                                              5
to be very risky, then the fitted value γλt is high. In contrast, when stocks are un-
derpriced the residual εt is high. Selecting γ with a regression implies an assumption
that mispricing is independent of the subjective risk premium. This choice for γ is
in a sense conservative since it minimizes the variance of mispricing.

    Following Campbell (1991) and Campbell and Ammer (1993), we combine the
valuation framework with a vector autoregression (VAR) that predicts stock returns.
The VAR includes the excess log return on S&P 500 index over the three-month Trea-
sury bill (re ), the cross-sectional beta premium of Polk, Thompson, and Vuolteenaho
(2003, λSRC ), the log dividend-price ratio (dy), and the exponentially smoothed mov-
ing average of inflation (π). The sample period for the dependent variables is 1927:6-
2002:12, and the sample thus consists of 303 quarterly data points. Table 2 shows
the estimated parameters of the VAR system. We use this VAR to infer objective
and subjective excess dividend growth and returns.

    Table 3 shows the standard deviations and FigureP  2 a time-series plot of the three
estimated components of the log dividend yield: − ∞          j OBJ     e
                                                        j=0 ρ Et−1 ∆dt+j , γλt
                                                                               SRC
                                                                                   , and
εt . Together the three series add up to log-dividend yield. According to Table 3,
mispricing is the most volatile component of the log dividend-price ratio, while the
subjective risk component is the least volatile. Table 3 also shows the functions that
map the four VAR state variables into the three components of the log dividend price
ratio. Dividends are expected to grow rapidly when the subjective risk premium
and/or inflation is high. Objectively expected excess returns on stocks are high
when the subjective risk premium, dividend yield, and/or inflation are high.

    Below each number in Table 3 is a standard error, calculated from 10,000 bootstrap
simulations of the VAR in Table 2, and an estimate of bias, calculated from the same
set of simulations. These standard errors and bias estimates must of course be treated
with caution since they are conditional on the validity of the estimated VAR as a
description of the data generating process. However, they provide some evidence
that the volatility of mispricing, and the eﬀects of inflation on expected dividend
growth and mispricing, are statistically significant and are if anything understated by
our point estimates.

   Perhaps surprisingly, our model detects stock prices significantly overpriced in
the summer of 1933, although the dividend-price ratio is approximately at its sample
average. This detected overpricing can be explained by two simultaneous phenomena:
First, the expected long-run dividend growth was extremely low at 2.5 standard
deviations below its sample mean. Second, the subjective risk premium was 1.3

                                           6
standard deviations above its unconditional mean. Together, these two facts would
have predicted a high dividend yield and low stock prices, contrary to the about
average dividend yield observed at the time. Perhaps not surprisingly, another time
when stock prices are detected as overpriced is the end of 1999, a point in time many
consider the top of the technology bubble. Although at the end of 1999 the subjective
risk premium was 0.74 standard deviations below its unconditional mean, expected
dividend growth was close to its unconditional mean. The two variables together
justify a dividend-price ratio of 3.3% versus the observed 1.2%, leaving a gap of 2.1%
to be explained by mispricing. At the other end of the spectrum, our VAR detects
stock as overpriced in 1947 and 1983, years in which dividend yields weree more than
two and half times our fair yield estimates.

    The central prediction of the Modigliani-Cohn (1979) hypothesis is that high in-
flation leads to stock market underpricing and low (or negative) inflation leads to
overpricing. The main competing hypotheses are that low stock prices coinciding
with high inflation are rationally justified because high inflation coincides with low
expected dividend growth or a high subjective risk premium. To examine these hy-
potheses, we regress the three components P∞of dividend yield on smoothed inflation in
Table 3. The regression coeﬃcient of − j=0 ρ Et−1 ∆det+j on inflation is -11.25 with
                                                j OBJ

an R2 of 95%, implying a positive, not negative, relation between rationally expected
excess dividend growth and inflation. To the extent that inflation coincides with
poor economic conditions, the worst seems to be over and future growth looks bright
(perhaps because of the low initial level). The subjective risk premium seems largely
unrelated to inflation. Thus, we reject the rational hypotheses justifying the positive
association of dividend yield and inflation.

     In contrast, our VAR results in Table 3 provide strong support to the Modigliani-
Cohn (1979) hypothesis. The regression coeﬃcient of εt on inflation is strongly
positive, and statistically and economically significant. The strength of this relation
is illustrated in Figure 3 that plots mispricing, εt , and inflation scaled by its regression
coeﬃcient, against time. The 78% R2 is evident in the figure as the lines plot almost
perfectly on top of each other, as predicted by Modigliani and Cohn.

   Table 4 examines the robustness of these results to minor variations in the VAR
specification. The first row of the table show the main results from Table 3 as
a basis for comparison. Rows two and three alter the data frequency to monthly
and annual, with little changes in our main results. Row four uses the relative
volatility of stocks vs. bonds as the subjective risk measure, significantly reducing


                                             7
the positive correlation between expected excess dividend growth and inflation but
actually increasing the R2 of inflation on mispricing. Row five substitutes five-year
smoothed earnings yield for dividend yield, row six adds the TERM yield spread (the
yield diﬀerence between long-term and short-term government bonds) to the VAR,
and row seven defines excess returns and excess dividend growth rates relative to
long-term bond holding-period returns, again with little impact on our main results.
Adding three additional lags to our VAR specification adds noise to the estimates; it
almost eliminates the positive correlation between dividend growth and inflation, but
reduces the R2 of inflation on mispricing only to 49%. Finally, row nine accounts
for the possibility that the conditional variance of returns may systematically move
with the VAR state variables and thus create a time-varying wedge between expected
simple and log returns, with no change in results.

   Conclusion

    This paper presents a three-way decomposition of the stock market dividend yield
into a term due to rationally expected long-run dividend growth, a term due to the
subjective risk premium on the market, and a residual term that we attribute to a
deviation of subjectively expected dividend growth from objectively expected growth.
We use a VAR system to construct empirical estimates of these three components.
We find that high inflation is positively correlated with rationally expected long-run
real dividend growth; thus the negative eﬀect of inflation on stock prices cannot be
explained through this channel. We find that inflation is almost uncorrelated with
the subjective risk premium. However, inflation is highly correlated with mispricing,
supporting the Modigliani-Cohn (1979) view that investors form subjective growth
forecasts by extrapolating past nominal growth rates without adjusting for changes
in inflation.

    In interpreting this result, it is important to keep in mind that inflation, the
stock market dividend yield, and its estimated components are all highly persistent
processes. Thus we have relatively few independent observations even in a 75-year
history, and our results should be regarded as suggestive rather than decisive. In
future work it will be important to gather additional evidence by examining the
relation between inflation and stock returns in other countries. It may also be
helpful to use survey data to measure subjective inflation expectations. In addition,
we cannot rule out the possibility that some part of what we call mispricing is in fact
a second component of the subjective risk premium, one that is common to all stocks
and thus does not appear in our cross-sectional measure of risk.


                                          8
    The Modigliani-Cohn hypothesis has interesting implications both for investors
and for monetary policymakers. Investors need to know whether stocks, as real
assets, provide a hedge against inflation. Fama and Schwert (1977) and others
have documented the negative eﬀect of inflation shocks on realized stock returns.
The Modigliani-Cohn hypothesis explains this as the result of mispricing driven by
inflation illusion, an eﬀect which should diminish over the longer run. Boudoukh and
Richardson (1993) examine this issue directly and find that stocks are better inflation
hedges over five-year periods than over one-year periods.

    There has been an active recent debate about whether monetary policy should be
used to combat stock market mispricing. The Modigliani-Cohn hypothesis suggests
that disinflation may itself generate mispricing by confusing stock market investors
who are subject to inflation illusion. It also implies that a successful stabilization
of inflation will reduce the volatility of mispricing and thereby contribute to the
eﬃciency of the stock market.

Table 1: Explaining the stock yield with a subjective risk-premium measure and
nominal bond yield
The table shows the OLS regressions of stock yield (either dividend yield, DY , or
smoothed earnings yield where earnings are averaged over the past five years, 5EY )
on a subjective risk premium measure (either the Spearman rank correlation between
firms’ valuation multiples and estimated CAPM beta, λSRC , or relative past volatility
of stocks relative to bonds, λRV ) and on a nominal yield measure (either the ten-year
taxable Treasury bond yield, LT Y , or smoothed past inflation, π). The t-statistics
are computed using Newey-West (1987) standard errors with 60 leads and lags. R2
is adjusted for the degrees of freedom. The regressions are estimated from the full
sample period 1927:5-2002:12, 908 monthly observations.

           Table 3: Regressions of dividend yield’s components on inflation
The table shows derived statistics implied by the VAR model of Table 2. We decom-
pose the demeaned log dividend yield, dyt ,Pinto three components: (1) The negative
of long-run expected dividend growth, − ∞              OBJ
                                                  i=1 Et    ∆det+1 , where ∆det+1 is the de-
meaned dividend growth; (2) the subjective risk-premium component, γλSRC             t    ; and
(3) the mispricing component. The subjective risk-premium and mispricing   P            compo-
nents are defined as the fitted values and residuals of the regression ∞     i=1 Et
                                                                                    OBJ e

γλt    + εt , where rt+1 is the demeaned excess log return on S&P 500 and λt                 the
demeaned cross-sectional beta premium. The upper-left section of the table, labeled
“Stdev” shows the unconditional standard deviations of the three components. The
lower left section shows the linear functions that map the VAR state variables into the
three components of demeaned log dividend yield. The VAR state variables are the
log excess S&P 500 return (rM    e
                                    ), the cross-sectional beta premium measure (λSRC ),
log dividend-price ratio (dy), and smoothed inflation (π). The right half of the table
shows the simple regression coeﬃcients of log dividend yield and its three components
on smoothed inflation (π) and the corresponding regression R2 s. Standard errors (in
parentheses) and bias estimates [in brackets] are computed from 10,000 simulations
from the VAR of Table 2.

Figure 1: Dividend yield, subjective risk premium, and inflation.

This figure plots the time-series of three variables: (1) Demeaned dividend
yield on S&P 500 index, marked with triangles; (2) demeaned subjective risk-
premium measure computed by Polk, Thompson, and Vuolteenaho (2003) as the
cross-sectional Spearman rank correlation between firms’ valuation levels and
estimated betas, marked with a solid line; and (3) the demeaned smoothed inflation
computed from the producer price index, marked with a dashed line. Subjective
risk premium and inflation are multiplied by their respective multiple regression
coeﬃcients in the regression of dividend yield on the subjective risk premium and

Figure 2: The three components of log dividend yield.

This figure plots the time-series of three variables that add up to demeaned
log dividend yield: (1) deviation of the long-run expected excess dividend growth
from it’s unconditional mean, marked with a dotted line; (2) demeaned subjective
risk-premium, marked with a solid line; and (3) the mispricing component, marked
with circles and a line. The subjective risk premium component and the mispricing
components are produced by regressing the discounted sum of future expected returns
on the subjective risk-premium proxy. The subjective risk-premium component is
the fitted value of this regression, and the mispricing component is the error term of
this regression. The series are computed using the VAR of Table 2.

Figure 3: Inflation and mispricing.

This figure plots the time-series of two variables: (1) The mispricing compo-
nent of log dividend yield, marked with circles; and (2) the fitted value from a
regression of mispricing component on inflation, marked with a line. The mispricing
components is produced as the residual of the regression of discounted sum of future
expected returns on the subjective risk-premium proxy. The series are computed
using the VAR of Table 2.
