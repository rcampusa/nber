         The Covariance Structure of Earnings and Income,
                     Compensatory Behavior and
                      On—The-Job Investments

                             ?BSTRACT

     Observationally alike individuals who make different choices

about on—the—job investments should have earnings profiles that
differ in systematic ways.   In particular, investments in non-
specific human capital should result in lower initial earnings
but higher earnings growth rates. Human capital models of this
sort admit testing, then, by examining the covariance between
the level of earnings and the growth rate of earnings. This
paper reports estimates of this covariance using the sample
covariance among income observations across time for the same
individuals. The sample covariances are drawn from the Utah
Panel Data, a panel of some 16,000 households with income and
wealth observations at various intervals over the period from
1850 to 1900. The parameter of interest is negative. This
estimate is robust to various specifications of the model.     I

also reexamine earlier work by Lillard and Weiss and Hause, who
use data on earnings, and conclude that there is strong support
for the on—the—job investment hypothesis using data from three
quite different sources covering different economies and differ-
ent time periods.

     Age-related profiles in earnings or income are among the most

robust regularities in economic data. However, the interpretation of

these profiles in either cross sectional or longitudinal data is

problematic. In a cross section, age and cohort effects are difficult

to disentargie; in longitudinal data, age and economic growth effects

are difficult to disentangle. Nevertheless, the inverted-U shape has

usually been interpreted as reflecting growing individual productivity

with experience and other kinds of investments in human capital,

followed by the depreciation, obsolescence and declining physical and

mental abilities that accompany aging.

     Initial investment in human capital increases average earnings at

any given age and may change the shape of the time related profile as

well. For example, Mincer (1974) found a positive association between

schooling attainment and the slope of the mean age-earnings profile and

between schooling attainment and the length of time over which the

profile has a positive slope.

     In general, initial investments in human capital are thought to

occur before employment, usually in a formal schooling environment or at

home. Mincer (1970, 1974), however, has emphasized the investment

possibilities that accompany the initial years in any occupation. It

turns out that the on-the-job training opportunities provide a testable

hypothesis about one aspect of the notion that individuals deliberately

make investments in themselves. Tests of this 'sown" investment

hypothesis using relationships between means were explored by Mincer.

However, tests using individual data, which are more appropriate for the

hypothesis, were developed and explored primarily by Hause (1977, 1980),
                                       2

Chamberlain   (1978)   and Liliard and Weiss (1979) (see also Borjas and

Mincer (1978)).

     Tests using panel data are based on a compensatory notion:

observationally equivalent individuals who choose different levels of

on—the—job investment should have systematically different individual

time—related earnings or income profiles. More specifically,

individuals who "invest" in generalized human capital will have lower

initial earnings as they purchase capital (in the form of training from

their employers but will only make this investment if there is a

compensatory increase in the rate of growth of their earnings over time.

This implies that there should be a negative covariance between early

earnings and the slope of an individual's earnings profile. Differences

in earnings among individuals will be determined, then, by individual

differences in the level of earnings and individual differences in the

growth of earnings.

     However, the test is not quite as clear-cut as this suggests since

individual differences in earnings may also reflect differences in

observationally-alike individuals that have nothing to do with

on—the-job investments and everything to do with ability, individual

values, cultural values and other differences that distinguish

individuals but which are difficult to observe and measure. In this

case, earnings differences would reflect permanent differences among

individuals that persisted through time. A negative covariance between

initial earnings and the slope of an earnings profile is consistent with

on—the-job investment in human capital but it may also be that

individuals with lower initial earnings simply work harder and that

there is a negative covariance between initial earnings and subsequent
                                    3

effort. It may also be, of course, that higher ebility is reflected

both in initial earnings and in the growth of earnings so that there is

a positive covariance between initial earnings and earnings' growth

reflecting the consequences of underlying ability differences.

     Thus, while a negative covariance may reflect things in addition to

choices about on-the-job investments, a positive covariance between the

level of earnings and the growth rate in earnings would be a clear

refutation of a compensatory behavioral model.

     Possible compensatory individual earnings profiles are also

important because they imply that the cross-sectional variance in

earnings or income, a measure of "inequality," reflects different

choices made by otherwise similar individuals as well as stochastic

elements and persistent individual dissimilarities. This gives rise to

the much debated issue of measuring the 'true" inequality in a

population where the measured inequality using observable earnings or

income does not reflect (generally overestimating) actual disparities in

economic position. That is, compensatory profiles imply a lower

variance in lifetime earnings than in annual earnings.

    Whatever its limitations, a compensatory model of individual

earnings is an appealing explanation of the age or experience-related

pattern in earnings and important in our understanding of the underlying

distributional dynamics in an economy. Despite the appeal of the

covariance test, the empirical evidence is mixed. Mincer could not

directly test the hypothesis since his data only allowed for

comparisions of means. However, he found that for less schooled groups,

there exists a longer initial period during which persons with greater

earnings growth have lower earnings. In another indirect test, Borjas
                                    4

and Mincer conclude that individuals who make larger investments have

lower initial earnings which, in turn, grow more rapidly than others.

      Similarly, Lillard (1977) found that both the more able and the

more schooled were compensated by more rapidly rising earnings and by

higher earnings later in their lives. Hause (1977) provides an indirect

test using Swedish data. He found substantial systematic dispersion in

earnings profiles for workers of the same age when education is factored

out. He also found that discounted lifetime earnings had a

substantially lower variance than did annual earnings (Lillard's

analysis also supports this conclusion).

     Chamberlain (1978), in a paper primarily focused on the biases in

estimating returns to education, found a substantial variance in the

growth rates of individual earnings and a large negative correlation

between initial earnings and subsequence growth rates.

     In later work, Hause and Lillard and Weiss directly confronted the

possibilities of individual compensatory behavior. Hause (1980) used

the sample covariance of earnings obtainable from Swedish panel data to

estimate directly the covariance between initial earnings and earnings

growth. The estimated model suggests that the on-the-job investment

hypothesis is an empirically significant phenomenon. The data exhibit a

negative covariance between the level of individual earnings and the

slope of individual earnings profiles. The sign of this critical

covariance is robust to a variety of specifications with complex error

generating mechanisms. However, statistical significance is not robust

and the variance of the individual slopes is small, indicating that the

sample is quite homogeneous. In addition, the models of the error

process that generate statistical significance for the covariance
between slopes and intercepts have serious problems elsewhere that make

them less credible.

     Lillard and Weiss (197°" provide evidence from a panel of

scientists that is not consistent with the on—the—job training

hypothesis. When the effects of observed characteristics on earnings

are controlled for, there is a positive correlation between the level of

individual earnings (intercepts) and the growth rate of the individual

earnings profiles (slopes). As Lillard and Weiss note "(the positive

covariarce between the level and growth error components indicates that

for scientists who are observationally alike, high average earnings is

associated with high growth. .   ." (page   445'.

     Since differences in the level and growth of earnings could arise

either because of ability differences which increase both initial

earnings and growth rates or because of investment patterns that tend to

lower initial earnings while raising the subsequent growth rate, Lillard

and Weiss speculate that for scientists, ability differences drive the

observed relationship between initial earnings and subsequent growth

rates instead of compensatory behavior. They conclude: "We find

diverging earnings development over the decade among observationally

alike individuals. That is, individuals with greater mean earnings also

had greater earnings growth" (p 437'.

     It turns out that computational errors apparently lead to the wrong

sign on the crucial parameter in the Lillard and Weiss analysis.

Reestimating their model, using the residual variance-covariance matrix

published with their paper, provides evidence that is consistent with an

on-the-job investment or compensatory model and to conclusions quite

different from those noted above. Indeed, there is strong evidence that.
                                      6

the covariance is negative and mostly unaffected by the problems

associated with modelling the error process in data used by Hause and by

Lillard arid Weiss. Section II deals with these issues.

     I provide additional evidence about the covariance structure of

earnings and income by examining data from a quite different era, the

19th century, in which on—the—job training is likely to be relatively

quite important since formal schooling was less widespread than it is

today. Following the specification of an error components model

suitable for testing the relationship between the level of individual

income and subsequent individual growth rates (Section I), I provide

tests of a simple model in Section III. Since most of the previous work

has been done with data sets of fairly short duration and the data that

I use extends over the lifetime of many of the individuals in the

sample, I then provide estimates of a more complex model that allows us

to examine more of the age—income profile and, in particular, what

happens to individual profiles past the typical peak in the inverted U.


  I. Compensatory Behavior and the Covariance of Earnings

     We assume that the aggregate or mean age-earnings pattern (what

Hause (1980) calls the coarse structure of earnings) can be described by

a regression of the logarithm of earnings on a quadratic in age, g(A,6),

with intercept differences depending upon observed individual character-

istics, f(C,), such as occupation, gender, place of birth, etc,

     (1) ln y =    f(C,)   +   g(A,   +
                                          u,
where i, i = 1,N, indexes observations on individuals, t, t =    1,T,
indexes observations through time and      is a vector of parameters.

     This coarse structure, developed first by Ben—Porath (1967), has

been explored extensively by Mincer (1974) and many others. Elsewhere
                                                          7


we have examined age-income and age-wealth profiles more carefully using

data from the Utah Panel and have examined possible interactions between

individual characteristics and age and nonlinearities in age that are

not allowed for with a simple quadratic specification (Kearl and Pope,

1984a, 1984b and 1985').

     What 1-fause (1980) calls the fine structure of earnings is embodied

in the specification of the structure of u. For example, if we allow

for individual error components () and individual time dependent error

components () plus a purely random error

      This   simple model is not identified with a two-observation panel

since there are four parameters (a, a, a, a) but only three

      With at least three observations on each individual, some of the

parameters are overidentified since there are now at least six

independent pieces of information about the covariance structure,

specification of the covariance structure or for a more complex

autoregressive model where the uncorrelated random element is drawn from

a distribution with constant variance through time. Hause estimates a

model with a non-stationary autoregressive structure where the period by

period innovations have independent or time-varying variances.

Chamberlain assumes time-invariant variances for the random element but

estimates a more complex two-factor model with time varying parameters

(or heterogeneity) which he interprets to be the time-varying shadow

prices of unobserved individual characteristics.

      The structure of it poses a problem in all the empirical results,

including our own. As we note below, models with time-varying error

variances, that is, where

      (12) it f(O, a
dominate models where the error variance is assumed to be drawn from a

distribution with a constant variance across time. However, there is no

clear pattern in the error variances and hence, no easily generalizable

observations.

      Since complex structures for 'jt are mostly uninformative, it seems

useful to consider a richer specification of the "behavioral" part of

the unobservable. Chamberlain's two-factor model is one approach.

Within a variance components structure, we consider a model that allows

for a more complete individual life cycle by allowing for curvature,

This model, with seven possible parameters, (o, o,

     If   observationally alike individuals make different on—the-job

investments, their respective individual age— (or experience-) earnings

profiles must cross. While there is no reason that the individual

profiles for a population should cross at the same point, Mincer derives

an upper bound for the crossover or "overtaking" point of 1/r, where r

is the return to on—the-job investments. The importance of the

"overtaking" point or region is that it provides a closer estimate to

the underlying inequality associated with individual differences that

are not the outcome of individual choices. That is, if all profiles did

cross at the same point, the variance in earnings at that point would

reflect persistent individual differences that are not related to

individual intertemporal choices about investment in earning

potential. a is biased upward as a measure of such inequality

because part of the variance is attributable to compensatory choices

that individuals make.

     Hause provides an argument for tmjn as the lower bound for the

"overtaking" point when ability cannot be directly measured and when the

random component, it' is drawn from a stationary distribution.


 II. Estimates from Hause and Lillard and Weiss

     Papers by Hause (1980') and Lillard and Weiss (1979) are the most

ambitious efforts to estimate models that allow for compensatory

behavior. Hause estimates a covariance structure for log earnings but

does not have observations on individual characteristics and cannot

estimate the covariance structure of the residuals, that is, his results

of earnings less the effects of observed individual characteristics

weakly support the compensatory hypothesis. Lillard and Weiss estimate

the covariance structure for log earnings and for the residuals from a

regression of log earnings on observed individual characteristics.

Their results are inconsistent with the compensatory hypothesis since

the covariance between the level and growth rate of earnings is

positive.

     Columns 6 and 7 of Table I partially reproduce Hause's estimates.

(All of the reported covariance models are estimated with maximum like-

lihood techniques using LISREL.) The asymptotic     statistic tests the

specified model as the null hypothesis against the hypothesis that the

sample variance-covariarice matrix is any positive definite matrix of the

same dimensions. While the null hypothesis is often rejected,

differences in x2 statistics are sometimes useful for comparing models.

Joreskog and Sorbom (1980) show that for nested models, the difference

between the asymptotic x2 of the models is itself asymptotically      with

degrees of freedom equal to the difference between the degrees of

freedom of the two models.

     When Hause allows for a complex error structure, where each

period's error is drawn from a distribution with time-varying variances

and where there is a period-specific autocorrelation (column 6,

reproduced from Hause without the autocorrelation estimates', none of

the parameters of interest are significant. The covariance between the

initial earnings, , and earnings growth, ,     a,   has a negative sign

across time and only the first period's error drawn from a distribution

with a different variance than the remaining five periods, produces

parameter estimates for the variance components that are substantially

larger than their standard errors and of a sign consistent with a com-

pensatory model of investment. For this model,      is -.0091 with a

standard error about one quarter the size of the parameter. There is,

however, a very large difference in the x2 statistics that measure the

goodness of fit of the model to the sample covariance.   Indeed, Hause

shows that a purely statistical model of the error process dominates any

model with a covariance structure.

      Column 8 of Table I summarizes my estimates of a simple model

using the sample covariance matrix provided in Hause's paper. The

covariance between level and growth components is negative and

statistically "significant" (in the sense that the estimate is almost

10 times the asymptotic standard error) as are the estimated variances

for level, growth and random error components. A covariance model

allowing the error variance to differ from period to period (column 9)

provides a somewhat better fit than the second of Flause's models and a

substantially better fit than a model with a time—invariant error

variance. One can clearly see the large difference between the first

period's error and subsequent period's errors which decline slowly

consistent with simple autocorrelation, patterns that are reflected in

the parameter estimates in Hause's second model. However,

the parameter estimates for a, o and       are virtually unaffected by
                                      13

the change in   specifications.
      The complex error structure tells us little about the behavior that

generated the sample covariance. It can be, as we noted, estimated with

a much simpler model (where the error structure is, obviously, equally

unrevealing) that is 'closer" to the explanatory power of Hause's first

model. In this case, the variance components associated with the on—

the—job investment model are more precisely estimated (column 9). When

we allow for time—varying error variances, the variance in growth rates

is substantially higher than in Hause's second model (.003 versus

.0018). While the covariance between level and growth components

remains about the same (-.009), the correlation between these components

decl ines somewhat.

     Reestimating Lillard and Weiss's model, using the sample covariance

matrices published with their article, provides a quite different

interpretation of their data. Columns 1 and 3 of Table I are reproduced

from Lillard and Weiss's Table II.     In neither case is the critical

parameter, a, negative. However, if the models summarized in 1 and 3

are reestiniated, columns 2 and 4, all of the parameters are very close

to those reported by Lillard and Weiss except for       which is now

negative. Comparing columns I and 2, there are very small differences

in the new estimates of a, a, 2 and          and each retains about the

same level of "significance" as in the results reported by Lillard and

Weiss. However,       changes substantially, from .00101 to -.0006, and

the interpretation of the earnings covariance structure is completely

cN fferent.

        It does not matter whether or not autocorrelation is modelled

(compare columns 3 and 4),        remains negative and from 7.5 to 11
                                   14

times its standard error. The Lillard-Weiss data are consistent with a

compensatory model of behavior even when the effects of observed

characteristics are considered.

     Estimates of a model using the Lillard—Weiss data where the errors

are drawn from distributions with time-varying variances loosely

analogous to Hause's more complex error structure (columns 6, 7 or 9).

They are reported in column 5. The parameter estimates of interest do

not change much, but remain consistent with a compensatory model and are

"significant. This model, based on difference in x2 statistics, is a

much better fit of the data than either of the models reported in

columns 1 and 2 or 3 and 4.   (The x2 statistic is 357 with 12 degrees of

freedom compared with a x statistic in the range of 700 with 16 degrees

of freedom.)

     The estimates of the time-varying errors do not, in contrast to

Hause, evidence any easily detected pattern.

     I have also estimated a model for the Lillard-Weiss data that

allows for time-varying error variances using the logarithm of earnings

as the dependent variable, Table II, column 3. This is comparable to

the estimates for log earnings by Lillard and Weiss which are reproduced

as column 1, and is niore directly comparable to the Hause estimates.

The model in column 3, with an uninformative error structure to be sure,

dominates column 1 but the parameter estimates are essentially unchanged

from the reestimated Lillard-Weiss model (column 2). Since the signs of

the coefficients correspond to those estimated by Lillard and Weiss, the

model for log earnings retains the same general interpretation they

suggested. However, the covariance between initial earnings and

earnings growth is larger than that estimated by Lillard and Weiss and
                                   15

the coefficients differ in relationship to one another. This is

important in estimating the "overtaking point." The change in the

relationship between the variance component associated with growth and

the covariance between growth and initial earnings extends the point of

minimum variance, the "crossover" point, from 1.5 years (using Lillard

and Weiss's estimates) to seven years (using either column 2 or 3').

     Hause's data produce a larger correlation between growth and level

variance components for log earnings than do Lillard and Weiss's data,

—.65 (from column 9 of Table I) versus -.52 (from column 3 of Table II,

the reestimated model).

     Since the error structure is apparently quite different for the two

samples, there is little that can be generalized from efforts to

estimate the random component(s) differently.    Indeed, as noted,

allowing for time-varying error variances for the distributions of the

errors produces a pattern with a large first year variance and smaller

but declining variances in subsequent years in the Hause data and

essentially a U—shaped pattern in the Lillard—Weiss data. However, the

covariance structures in both data sets are consistent with a model of

compensatory behavior.


III. Some Further Evidence from the Utah Panel

     The Utah Panel is composed of observations on heads of households

from 1850 to 1900. We have income estimates at five-year intervals and

wealth and occupation estimates at ten-year intervals. In addition, we

know the age of the household head and when that person "entered" the

Utah economy either by migration or by marrying and establishing an

independent household. Households migrate into Utah, leave Utah, are

created and die during the sample period. Thus, we can compose "panels"
                                             16

of from two to ten observations per household head for income and from

two to five observations for wealth. The panel sizes range from 10,367

individuals for three consecutive income observations (covering 10

years to 218 individuals for eight consecutive income observations

(covering 36 years). Panels of this sort will be nested. That is, all

persons in a four-consecutive observation panel will also be in a

three-consecutive observation panel and so forth. The data are

described in greater detail in the accompanying appendix.

     Detailed analyses of the coarse structures of income and wealth are

found elsewhere (see Kearl and Pope, 1984a, 1984b, and 1985). The

general properties of the log income regressions can be seen in the

following (estimated from a four-observation panel):

ln y =   4.58 +     .0613 A -        .00067 A2 +       .031 T -       .0034 FB
         (.069'     (003)            (.00003)         (.0025)         (.011)

     -    .091    R +     .292     W -    .067 C +      .049    S —     .257     L
         (.014)          (.023)          (.016)        (.037)          (.021)

     -    .081    Y2 —     .253    Y3 —     .420 Y4
         (.017'           (.020)           (.022)

     SE = .814
     23044 observations
     mean log y, 6.27

where A, 1, FB, R, W, C, S and L are age, time within the Utah economy,

foreign birth, residence in a rural area, white—collar, craft, service

and common labor, respectively, and Y2, Y3, and Y4 are dummy variables

for the second, third and fourth observations on the same individual in

the panel. The regression is normalized on farmers who live in the

"urban" county. (The sample is a pooled set of panels; I have omitted

the dummy variables associated with the pooling.)

     The data exhibit a pronounced age-income pattern that is concave;

income increases at a decreasinci rate until age 46 and then declines.
                                    17

The foreign born and those livino in rural areas have lower incomes than

U.S.-born individuals living in the urban area. Those living in the

economy for a longer period of time have higher incomes than

observationally alike individuals who are more recent immigrants or who

formed households later in the half century covered by our data, perhaps

reflecting Ricardian-type rents.

     Occupations are aggregated into five categories, W, C, S, L and F.

The relative effects of a particular are very robust over various

samples and specifications: white—collar workers have incomes

substantially above farmers while common laborers have incomes substan-

tially below farmers. Those identified as craft workers have incomes a

bit below farmers and there is generally no statistical difference

between farmers and those identified as working in services.

     I do not have data on earnings, only on income. For many in the

sample, earnings and income will coincide. However, for others, income

will include earnings and returns on capital. Hence, we would expect to

have more noise in income than in earnings relative to the compensatory

model.

     Table III provides estimates of the covariance structure for both

log income and the residuals from the regression of log income on the

observed characteristics of the household head, including a quadratic in

age, place of residence, place of birth, time in the Utah economy, and

occupation. (Following Lillard and Weiss, I iointly estimated the

covariance structure and the parameters associated with observed

individual characteristics. The parameter estimates changed very

little. Therefore, I concentrate on the covariance structure and the
                                       18

parameters for the jointly estimated coarse structure are essentially

the same as those noted above and reported elsewhere.)

     The estimated variance of the individual level effect is generally

about .25 while the variance in growth rates is about .001. There is a

strong negative covariance between individual income levels and growth

rates consistent with compensatory behavior on the part of the

individuals. This crucial parameter is highly significant in every

sample. The correlation between initial income and income growth ranges

prom -.2   to   -.6.   The variance is minimized at three years for the

four—observation panel and at eight years for the eight-observation

panel. These overtaking" points appear reasonable although the large

difference between the two is puzzling.

     Although the samples are nested, they differ considerably in size

as individuals are lost to migration, death or our inability to trace

them from year to year. Nevertheless, the covariance structure is quite

stable across the various samples.

     When the effects of observed individual characteristics are swept

from log income, the estimated variance of the individual level effect

declines by about 40 percent for the two large samples but by a

considerably smaller amount for the longer but smaller samples (from

about .25 to .19 or by about 25 percentL The decline is to be expected

since, for log income, the individual effect picks up the contributions

of both observed and unobserved individual characteristics while for the

residuals, only the contributions of the unobserved characteristics will

matter. The year by year effects (a loose measure of economic growth

and price changes) are very small since the estimated error variance is

virtually the same for log income as it is for the residuals. That is,
                                   19

virtually all of the explained variance is explained by the observed

individual characteristics and very little is explained by the dummy

variables associated with the year of observation. The random error

variance is about 50 percent of the variance in log income; about 10

percent of the variance in log income can be explained by the observed

individual characteristics and the remaining 40 percent is explained by

the "behavioral" part of the covariance structure.

     The variance attributed to growth remains the same for residuals as

for log income. However, the covariance between growth and individual

level components declines. Nevertheless, it remains highly significant.

Because both the individual level component and the covariance between

initial income and income growth decline, the correlation between the

two remain essentially in the range noted earlier, from -.2 to -.6.

     Table IV provides estimates of the covariance structure when the

error variance is not assumed to be drawn from a time-invariant

distribution. For the short panels, covering from 10 to 20 years, the

estimated error variances exhibit a hump shape, increasing and then

declining. For the longer panels, the estimated error variances bounce

around without a clear pattern. We do not observe a pattern comparable

to that in Hause's data, where the error variance declined with time.

In the Lillard-Weiss data, the error variances decline and then

increase. In any event, the parameter estimates of the "behavioral"

part of the covariance structure are essentially insensitive to the

change in specification.

     These data, from a very different economy, are strongly consistent

with an on-the-job investment model of individual behavior. Indeed, even

though the dependent variable is income rather than earnings and, as a
                                         20

consequence, there ought to be more variance in the data that is not
associated with compensatory choices, the results are stronger than

those using contemporary data. We might expect, however, that on—the—

job investment was more important in an economy that had limited

opportunities for formal education but which had skilled occupations

than in a contemporary economy, where formal education is widespread.

Hence, the relative importance and significance of the parameter

estimates are not surprising but they provide important additional

evidence consistent with compensatory behavior and the on—the-job

training hypothesis.


Changing Growth Rates

        Lillard and Weiss provide some evidence that both the variance in

growth rates and the variance in income levels increases with

experience. We can directly explore the first possibility by

considering a more complex covariance structure where,

              it . + .(t 1 + a.(t -
        (16) u. =
                    1    1
                             -
                                     1
                                              + v.
                                                  it
        The model is identified so long as the panel has at least four

observations on each individual. The parameters of interest are the

covariances between the earnings/income level and the change in the

growth rate and between the growth rate and the change in the growth

rate.

        Table V provides estimates using data from Hause, Lillard and Weiss

and the lJtah Panel for this more complex covariance structure. It turns

out that while I extended the covariance structure in an effort to

capture whatever information was contained in the time—varying error

variances, the more complex covariance structure fails to do this and

models that allow for time-varying error variances dominate those where
                                     21

the innovations are assumed to be drawn from a distribution with

constant variance.

     Models that allow growth rates to differ through time dominate the

covariance models estimated to this point. For Hause's earnings data,

   falls from 94 to 49; for Lillard and Weiss's earnings data, x2 falls

from 566 to 213; for their residual data, x2 falls from 357 to 72; for

the Utah Panel,      falls from 103 to 16 for a five—observation panel and

from 103 to 18 for a six-observation panel.

     For every data set, there is a negative covariance between        and

   that is, between the growth rate and the change in the growth rate in

earnings or income. Since it is likely that cz.j has a negative sign

(that is, that the life cycle profile is concave), the negative

covariance implies that those individuals having high growth rates have

a greater rate of decline in those growth rates. Since there is a

negative covariance between the level of earnings/income and the growth

rate, those with higher initial earnings/income who have lower growth

rates should also have growth rates that decline more slowly than those

with lower initial earnings. The covariance estimates are consistent

with this since the covariance between the earnings/income level and the

change in growth rate is positive. Comparable results hold for the

Lillard—Weiss and Utah Panel residuals.

     Put somewhat differently, the mean life cycle pattern in earnings

and income is a composite of individual life cycle profiles where those

with higher initial earnings (or income) have a flatter profile while

those with lower initial earnings (or income) have a profile that is

initially steeper but which is more concave.
                                   22

     The individual level variance component does not change much with

the change in specification. However, for each of the samples, the

variance in growth rates is larger with the change in specification

(e.g., for Hause's data, the growth variance component increases from

.003 to 0.18'. The covariance between the level and growth components

is also substantially larger.

     The variance in growth rates is substantially higher than that

suguested by previous work. The implied correlations between level and

growth components increase for all samples except the Lillard-Weiss log

earnings data, providing somewhat stronger evidence of compensatory

behavior.

     Nothing in the models distinguishing on-the-job investments from

other forms of human capital accumulation suggests that on-the—job

investments should have higher (or lower) rates of depreciation compared

with other kinds of investment. In all three data sets, however, the

effects of the substantially larger variance in growth rates across the

population are tempered by the greater concavity of the earnings/income

profile. This suggests that on-the-job investments depreciate more

rapidly than other forms of human capital that individuals bring with

them to the workplace.


Conclusions

     Data from three very different sources are consistent with a

compensatory model of earnings or income differences among individuals.

This does not mean, of course, that on—the-job investment and

compensatory behavior fully explain the observed variance in earnings or

income. A substantial part of the variance is apparently stochastic and

another large part can be attributed to individual differences that are
                                   23

probably associated with ability. However, individual differences in

growth rates and in changes in growth rates are important as well and

are consistent with on—the-job investment. The observed consistency is

robust to a variety to underlying stochastic processes that may

contribute to the observed variance. Moreover, the consistency is

robust in samples from different places, periods of time and covering

different age spreads among individuals.

     It is particularly interesting that we find compensatory behavior

where it might be expected, in an economy with little reliance on formal

education, and yet where the economy is quite different from a

contemporary industrial economy.

     We also find that there is good evidence that growth rates vary

depending upon both the level of earnings/income and the growth rate

itself. Models that allow for growth rates to vary for individuals

across time appear to dominate those with simpler covariance structures.

In addition, the variance in growth rates across individuals at a moment

of time varies a good deal more than simpler models suggest.

     It is, of course, not possible to tell if the discounted

earnings/income are greater or less with the difference in the concavity

of the age—earnings or age-income profile, but the data suggest that

there is faster depreciation in capital acquired on the job.

The Utah Panel

     Our data are drawn from some or all of the following sources:

census manuscripts of 1850, 1860, 1870, 1880, and 1900; tax assessment

records of 1870, 1880, 1890, and 1900; financial records of the LDS

Church for 1855, 1857, 1859, 1861, 1866, 1870, 1875, 1880, 1885, 1890,

1895, 1900; and family vital records from the Genealogical Library of

the LDS Church.

1850, 1860, and 1870 and from tax assessment records for 1870, 1880,
1890, and 1900. We sampled from both records in 1870                       in order to splice
the wealth series from 1850 to 1900 at decade intervals. Both tax
assessment and census records provide estimates of gross rather than net

wealth.

     Income estimates are obtained from the financial records of the LDS

Church for the 12 years noted earlier. Essentially we cover five-year

intervals from 1855 to 1900. LDS financial records indicate the

contribution an individual made to the Church. Church members accepted

the moral obligation to contribute a tithe——ten percent of one's income.

In eight of the twelve sample years we have a record of the percentage

that an individual's contribution was relative to this full tithe.

These assessments of tithing paid versus tithing owed were made by local

Church leaders who would personally know the individual contributor.

The individual would also be consulted as to the percentage of a full

tithe that he or she paid. Families usually made their contribution

under the name of the male spouse if there was one although some young

men contributed independently to the Church. The combination of the
                                    32

 amount contributed with the percentage of this amount relative to a full

 tithe yields an estimate of income. We made adjustments for those who

 reported income in a particular year but for whom we did not have

 percentages by averaging the percentage paid from other years.

     Occupational data have been collected from each census manuscript,

available from 1850 to 1900. Occupations were transcribed into a

three—digit code that combined occupations that were essentially the

same, e.g., lawyer and attorney. We did not create an occupational

status scale. Rather, for purposes of analysis, these codes were

aggregated into four categories: white collar workers, managers, and

proprietors (W); farmers, ranchers, dairy owners, etc., (F); craft

workers (C); laborers, farm laborers and other unskilled occupations

(L). This left a heterogeneous mixture of occupations that were largely

service oriented, such as hotel clerks, policemen, lower level clerks,

etc., which we classified in a fifth group as service workers (S).

     Both census and genealogical records provide place of birth and

age. When these sources disagreed, the genealogical record was used.

From these two records we could obtain most of the vital statistics of

interest, including birth, death, and marriage information, as well as

the implied information about household location at particular times,

family size and family structure. These records also provide sibling

names (linking brothers) and multiple marriage information (linking half

brothers).

    We used place information to provide a record of residence and

internal migration and to provide an estimate of the length of time a

household had been within the economy (T). For analysis purposes, we
                                   33

consider only rural (R) and urban (U) residence where urban is defined

as Salt Lake County.

     We have linked individuals through time and across records and we

have linked these individual histories by family relationship. The core

of the sample was created by linking census wealth records using name,

location, age, and birthplace data. We then added a random sample of

the households from each census year that did not appear in more than

one of these censuses. We separately coded links that were "certain

from those for which there were some discrepancies in name spellings or

age estimates between census years, uncertains." We were, however,

conservative in our efforts and subsequent analysis has shown no

statistically significant differences between "certains" and

"uncertains" and hence we no longer carry the coding distinguishing the

two. To this core of linked and randomly sampled individuals, we added

as many LDS financial records as we could, linked by name across the

records and through the years from 1855 to 1900. We then reversed the

procedure: first linking households in the Church financial records and

then adding as much census information as was possible.

     We added to this sample, now linked through time and between census

and church financial records, records from either the censuses or

financial records that were potentially fathers and sons. We verified

these father-son links using the family vital statistic records from the

Genealogical Library. We then searched the family vital statistic

records for those in the core sample creating pointers linking those

within the sample who were either fathers and sons or brothers. In

addition, we added any records from the population data for those we
                                          34

could identify as sons or brothers of those in the sample by using the

family vital statistic information.

      Not all family links between brothers occur with a link to a

father. Since we searched the family vital statistic records for those

in our sample, we would often find brothers without finding fathers, who

might have been dead or who might not have migrated to Utah with their

sons. This particular aspect of the sample means that the sibling

connections cover the full age range in each year of the sample and are

of new households that were formed over the fifty-year period where we

observed the father for some years and then observed the father and son.

Because of the extended period over which we sampled, we also observed

fathers and sometimes sons who died and a small group of three

generation links.

      We added to this linked data additional wealth data from the tax

assessments and probates as well as occupational data from the 1880 and

1900 censuses. For these records we have neither population data nor

random samples from population data. Rather we sought out only those

records for individuals already in our sample. Otherwise, however, we

have population data for wealth from 1850 to 1870 and income from 1855

to 1900.

     When we added data, anomolies would appear. At each point we

purged from the data those links that became questionable with the new

information. Obvious checks included: records past death or for an

individual who was 'too old"; records prior to birth or for an

individual who was "too young'; the same name on multiple records from

the same source in the same year; substantial age inconsistencies.
                                   35

    We believe that we have been fairly conservative at each point but

we should note that all linking is by names with the attendant problems

of misspelling and same names for different individuals. We tried to

avoid both problems by not selecting or subsequently eliminatinq those

with common names where the probability was high that there would be

several individuals with the same name (e.g., John Jones, James Green).

We have differentially coded "certain" family links from those that were

"less certain."

     The completed data set is essentially a panel ,   although   an

individual need not appear in each year either because the individual

migrated in or formed a household later in the period; because the

individual migrated out or died during the period; or because we could

not make a link in a particular year. It is a panel with the unique

characteristic that it is drawn from a fifty-year history of an economy

and that it has immediate family links.
