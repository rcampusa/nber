US households' consumption and car purchases collapsed during the Great Recession, for reasons
that are still poorly understood. In this paper we use the Consumer Expenditure Survey to derive
cohort and business cycle decompositions of consumption profiles. When decomposing the car
expenditure data into its extensive and intensive margins, we find that the intensive margin
contracted sharply in the Great Recession, a finding in stark contrast to conventional wisdom and
to the experience of prior recessions. We interpret the evidence through the prism of a very rich
life-cycle model where individuals are subject to idiosyncratic uninsurable income shocks,
aggregate income shocks, wealth shocks, and credit shocks. We show that, because of their
salience and the transaction costs, cars are particularly sensitive to changes in the perception of
fu- ture expected income and its variability. We find that on top of a large aggregate income
shock, life-cycle income profile shocks and wealth shocks are important determinants of
consumption choices during the Great Recession.

1       Introduction

Expenditure on durables, and cars in particular, have long been known to exhibit much
more variability than other components of private sector consumption. Kydland and Prescott
(1982), for instance, report that durables consumption expenditures display a standard de-
viation more than three times that of output over the business cycle while non-durables
consumption expenditures are only two thirds as volatile as output. Some large-ticket items
amongst durables are even more volatile. In the US, the variance of (detrended) real motor
vehicles expenditure is more than 20 times higher than the volatility of non-durables spend-
ing. In an early contribution, Bernanke (1984) tests the permanent income hypothesis (PIH)
for car expenditures using household panel data from the Survey of Consumer Finances and
finds that high car spending volatility may not be inconsistent with the PIH. Bernanke (1985)
instead develops a test of the PIH considering jointly durables and non-durables allowing for
convex adjustment costs of the former. He rejects the PIH for aggregate data due to excess
volatility. Gal´
               i (1993) finds that in 6 OECD countries, not only durables are substantially
more volatile than non durable consumption, but are also excessively smooth, in that they
not react enough to changes of the permanent component of income.1 In the case of the
expenditure on cars, Bar-Ilan and Blinder (1992) also point out that most of the business
cycle fluctuations could be explained by the extensive rather than the intensive margin; that
is in the number of households buying a car rather than on the amount spent conditionally
on buying.
    One possible interpretation of these facts is that, as durable consumption (and cars) are
usually large and lumpy, involving substantial transaction costs, they might be more salient
and informative about news and innovations to permanent income. The fact they react
strongly to aggregate shocks indicates that expenditure on durables and cars might be partic-
ularly informative about the business cycle and, more generally, about individual expectations
about economy-wide conditions. Sales of new motor vehicles tend to lead the business cycle,
a feature the former Chair of the Board of Governors Alan Greenspan was well aware of, see
Cohen and Greenspan (1990).
    Given the saliency of car purchases to expectations of future income, we investigate whether
cars expenditure can be used to unpack individual perceptions of economic prospects. For
    1
        Gal´
           i interprets this evidence as a consequence of possible liquidity constraints or adjustment costs.

such a purpose we develop a sophisticated model of individual behaviour and calibrate its
parameters to data observed before the Great Recession. We then investigate what combina-
tions of shocks and perceptions can fit the Great Recession data on car purchases. Effectively,
we use our model to infer from important and salient choices households make, their implied
subjective expectations about future incomes. We put particular emphasis on durable goods
adjustments, which we argue to be informative about subjective beliefs. This work comple-
ments macroeconomic research aimed at understanding the root causes of the Great Recession
and follows in a line of work which has argued that household consumption dynamics can be
highly informative of the shocks perceived by households.2
   We first provide evidence on household consumption spending by analyzing data drawn
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX). By constructing
synthetic cohort panel data, we examine life-cycle and business cycle features of the data. We
decompose the CEX average car spending data into an extensive and an intensive margin,
which measure, respectively, how many households engage in car transactions and how much
households spend on average conditional on buying or selling. During the Great Recession, the
extensive margin contracted more than in previous recessions. Moreover, the intensive margin
also declined. This latter phenomenon is novel and goes against the perceived wisdom,which,
as we mention above, was that the extensive margin is the main source of cyclical variations in
car spending. We also find succinct cohort patterns of adjustment with younger and middle-
aged households being subject to larger movements in both margins of adjustment than older
households when life-cycle patterns are taken into consideration.
   We then examine a sophisticated 60-period life-cycle model. Households choose expendi-
ture on non-durables and cars and can save in a liquid asset subject to a sequence of budget
and borrowing constraints. Adjustment of the household's car stock is associated with non-
convex costs, but cars can also be used as collateral against car loans. Households labor
income stream is stochastic while retirees draw certain pension benefits. The household in-
come process is subject to permanent and transitory shocks to the level of income and to its
drift reflecting the fact that household income has a strong life-cycle pattern. Income shocks

dell and Preston (1998), Blundell et al. (2008), Guvenen and Smith (2014), Heathcote et al. (2014), Kaplan
et al. (2020), and Olivi A. (2019)

may be idiosyncratic, cohort-specific, or aggregate, which allows us to model both the hetero-
geneity across households in income realizations and business cycle fluctuations deriving from
aggregate shocks. Households are also subject to stochastic changes in the premium on car
loans and to wealth shock which capture changes in house prices and in equity prices.
   The model generates (S, s)-type dynamics of household car stocks, as studied by Attanasio
(2000) and, more recently, by Berger and Vavra (2015). The procyclical variation in the
extensive margin often observed in the data is consistent with the model and reflects delayed
car adjustments of the large share of households who experience adverse conditions during
recessions. Intensive margin adjustments, relate only to households who actively adjust their
car stock, i.e. households less severely affected by the aggregate contraction or those that are
forced to adjust their car stock (e.g. due to a car breakdown). As pointed out by Bertola, Guiso
and Pistaferri (2005), the decision at the two margins are driven by different economic factors.
The probability of adjustment depends upon the dynamic history of shocks experienced by the
household, whereas the size of adjustment is chiefly based on forward looking considerations.
   We estimate the model's key structural parameters by indirect inference and then subject
households to a sequence of aggregate shocks during the Great Recession, while retaining
idiosyncratic shocks as well. We find that the combination of different shocks allow us to
reproduce different patterns observed in the data. In particular, our model can account for the
size of the consumption adjustments both for non-durables and for cars, for the extensive and
intensive car adjustment dynamics, and for the cohort-level adjustments of consumption and
savings. First, a large aggregate income shock matters for the large decline in consumption
expenditures. However, the unusually large income shocks, by itself, cannot account for
the size of the contractions at the extensive and the intensive margins of car purchase: as
idiosyncratic shocks are sufficiently large, many households go through the recession relatively
unscathed. Second, asset price shocks appears to be an important determinant of household
consumption dynamics. While we do not explicitly include housing choices into our model,
housing is the main component of household wealth. Therefore booming housing markets are
llikely to be an important important explanation for the consumption boom that took place
in the US in the late 1990s and the early 2000s. The impact on wealthier household of the
housing and equity markets collapses at the onset of the Great Recession helps understanding
why consumer durables spending collapsed. Finally, to account fully for the cohort features of
the consumption adjustments and savings, we find that it is important to allow for a negative

                                               3
shock to the household life-cycle income profile. This shock does not impact on the level of
income (we restrict the actual income decline to match aggregate US income during the Great
Recession) but it does impact on future expected income, especially for younger households.
Because of this feature, younger households increase their savings as observed in the data.
   We also carry out a number of additional policy experiments, analysing the role of fuel
prices and uncertainty shocks to the income processes as well as the impact of car purchase
subsidies, such as the Cash for Clunkers programme introduced in 2009. We find fuel prices
and changes to uncertainty to have minor impacts. As for Cash for Clunkers, its main impact
is to bring forward car purchases but once the programme is terminated, its positive impact
on expenditures quickly reverts.
   Our paper adds to several literatures. We confirm the importance of the combination of
wealth and income shocks highlighted by e.g. Mian, et al. (2013). However, in our analysis
deteriorating beliefs about future income growth prospects play a key role in explaining the
observed patters of data. This emphasis on beliefs echoes Kaplan, et al (2020), who show that
such beliefs matter for the house price boom and bust cycle during the Great Recession. The
quantitative importance of the wealth channel is also in line Berger et al's (2020) analysis of
the impact of income uncertainty in a life-cycle setting.
   Our use of consumption choices for making inference about risk extends Guvenen and
Smith's (2014) analysis in a number of dimensions. First and foremost, we argue that consumer
durables are particularly informative while these authors focus on a composite non-durables
and services good. Secondly, we add aggregate shocks on top on the lifecycle dimension.
Thirdly, this rich set of shocks goes beyond labor income risk and we show that the model has
sharp predictions about their impact. Unlike other studies, such as Berger and Vavra (2015)
who examine the role of transaction costs in consumer durables dynamics we focus on both
the extensive and intensive margins of car adjustment and the very rich set of shocks that
we allow for when conducting inference. The emphasis on the intensive margin enables us to
show how income expectations matter for the consumption slump during the Great Recession.
In particular, the model is able to capture the novel empirical fact we document of an unusual
decline in the intensive margin during this episode. This aspect of our analysis is new to
the literature on consumer durables and investment spending. Following the seminal work of
Caballero and Engel (1999), the literature has focused on the extensive margin. Our analysis
                                ¨
also relates to Harmenberg and Oberg    (2019) who consider the impact of persistent income

                                               4
shocks deriving from unemployment in a model with non-convex costs of consumer durables.
Our analysis considers a significantly richer setting in terms of asset choices and the source
of shocks but a major difference is that we use the model for drawing inference on the shocks
rather than understanding the impact of unemployment risk.
      The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we examine CEX data
on household consumption. Section 3 presents the life-cycle choice model. We then discuss
the parameterization of the model and properties of the policy functions in Section 4. Section
5 contains our analysis of the Great Recession. Finally, Section 6 presents various extensions
and the analysis of Cash for Clunkers.


2       Consumption and the Great Recession
2.1       Data

Data for aggregate variables are from NIPA while household data are obtained from the CEX.
The CEX is attractive for our purposes both because of the long sample and because of its
detailed information on consumption at the household level.3 We focus on the CEX sample
for households with heads between the age of 25 and 84 years for the 1981-2012 period. Our
sample contains around 234,000 household observations, with each household's consumption
observed for a maximum of four quarters. Table A.1 in the Appendix contains summary
statistics of the data broken into pre and post-Great Recession periods.

2.2     Life-Cycle Dynamics

We first document some salient facts of the life-cycle aspects of the data. An important
data obstacle in this dimension is that each household in the CEX is followed only for four
consecutive interviews. We therefore adopt a synthetic panel approach by grouping households
by the date of birth of the household head, see the appendix for details. Figure 1 illustrates
estimates of the life-cycle profiles (using 10 year groupings) of household spending on non-
durables and services, total after-tax household income (including financial income apart

     The CEX data has been criticized not aggregating up to NIPA statistics. However, the CEX spending
categories are very similar to those in NIPA data when controlling for items cand population coverage. Gar-
ner, McClelland and Passer (2009) show, as does Figure 3, Panel B that car spending closely mirrors NIPA
data when aggregated across households.

from capital gains), the number of cars owned and the percentage of households purchasing a
vehicle.4 The life-cycle pattern of spending on non-durables and the household car stock and
services is very clear. Expenditures on non-durables and services (Panel A) and the car stock
(Panel C) both rise with age for young households until the household head enter their 40s
or early 50s, respectively, then flattens out and start declining gradually for older households.
The growth in the number of cars per household is slower for younger households than that in
non-durables and services expenditures and the age at which the car stock peaks exceeds the
peak age for non-durables spending. Panel B shows the life-cycle profile for income which also
increases in the first part of the life cycle and declines in later life but with much clearer cohort
effects than for consumption. Finally, Panel D shows the share of households purchasing a
car which displays downward trend during the life-cycle especially after the age of 50.

      We divide consumption and income by the CPI to convert in 2014 dollars. Figure A.2 shows the pro-
files for for adult equivalents variables.

   Figure 2, Panel A, illustrates the value of each cohort's car stock as a function of age which
still displays a life-cycle pattern also some scarring effects of business cycles. To see this, Panel
B of illustrates the same data but now plotted against calendar time. The long boom in the
U.S. economy from the early 1990's recession until the financial crisis increased the value of
household car portfolios across cohorts while the leaner aggregate conditions in the mid 1980s
saw declines in the value household car stock holdings across households regardless of age.
Such scarring effects are even more evident when inspecting the value of the car stock relative
to spending on non-durables and services across cohorts, see Panel C. There is no easily visible
life-cycle pattern to this measure but, as shown in Panel D, there are very evident common
movements over time.

2.3   Consumption Adjustments During the Great Recession

Figure 3 shows year-on-year growth rates of NIPA data on aggregate real spending on non-
durables and services, consumer durables and on motor vehicles (quarterly data, 1970-2019,
shaded areas indicate NBER recessions). Consumption expenditures display notable procycli-
cal business cycle fluctuations. Non-durables and services are relatively smooth while spending
on durables, and motor vehicles in particular, is much more volatile having a standard devi-
ation more than seven times higher than consumer non-durables. The impact of the Great
Recession on consumption expenditures stands out for a number reasons; spending on non-
durables declines during this episode as opposed to slowing down during previous recessions;
the decline in spending on motor vehicles is the largest in the sample and, at its maximum
in 2008Q4, fell by 24 percent on a year-by-year basis. Panel B of Figure 3 shows that the car
spending in the CEX closely replicates the NIPA series. We exploit the CEX data to draw

out more information about consumption adjustments at the household level. We estimate
the extensive margin of car spending by computing the fraction of households in the CEX
data who purchase a car per quarter over the sample. In our sample this fraction averages
6.8 percent per quarter and Figure 4, Panel A, illustrates the (seasonally adjusted) estimated
time-series. While there is a secular decline in the frequency of car purchases, cyclical varia-
tions in the extensive margin of adjustment are evident and particularly so during the Great
Recession where this fraction falls abruptly from 6 percent per quarter pre-recession in 2006

to below 5 percent per quarter in late 2008.5 Panel B shows the response of the intensive
margin, the value of car purchased conditional upon the household buying a car. Over time
there is a positive secular trend towards more expensive vehicle purchases, with the trend
peaking in about 2005. In contrast to the frequency of car purchases, the intensive margin
remained fairly unaffected in previous recessions as argued by Bar-Ilan and Blinder (1992). In
the Great Recession instead the intensive margin drops significantly and this holds true both
for new and used cars. This intensive margin drop occurs almost coincidentally with the Great
Recession and is very persistent. Table 1 reports the outcome of regressing dummy variables
for either the probability of purchase or the dollar value of purchases on a dummy variable for
NBER recession periods, a dummy for the Great Recession and a quadratic time trend using
household level quarterly data. The data covers the period 1979.IV-2012.IV. NBER recessions
are associated with a 0.4 percentage point decline in the probability of car adjustment. This
is evenly split between new and old purchases. The probability of purchase falls additionally
in the Great Recession, although this decline is not statistically significant. In contrast we see
that in previous recessions, the average value of cars purchased does not change. However,
during the Great Recession the value of the average car purchase fell by almost $1300 dollars
and this occurred in both new and old car markets. One explanation could be that these
results merely reflect that severity of the Great Recession. To check this, in Table A.2 in

   5
    The fall in the frequency of car purchases during recessions occurs for both transactions in the new car
market as well as in the second-hand market, see Figure A.4 in the Appendix

the Appendix we replace the NBER recession dummies with the GDP growth rate and the
results are largely unchanged. In combination with the results above, we find that the Great
Recession stands out for both a large drop in the extensive margin and an atypical contraction
in the intensive margin.

2.4   Extensive margin behavior

To understand better the extensive margin variations, we now estimate a probit model for
the probability of purchasing a car using individual household data from the CEX. We relate
the probability of purchasing a car to the value of the household's stock of cars controlling for
household characteristics such as family size, education, age and income. We also experiment
with scaling the value of the household's car stock with annual spending on non-durables. In
order to evaluate the stability of the correlation structure, we introduce time-fixed effects. The
average marginal effects reported in Table 2 show that, consistent with theories of non-convex
car adjustment costs, a larger car stock makes car purchases less likely and that higher weekly
consumption spending increases the probability of household car investment. The latter is
consistent with an income effect and/or non-separabilities between non-durables and durables

spending on non-durables, we find a slightly better fit and this specification also delivers a
negative impact of the car stock indicating that non-separabilities matter.

the time-fixed effect from 2006 suggesting that extensive margin decline during the Great

the probability that the household survives between age a - 1 and a. At age T mortality
risk goes to unity, T = 0. The size of each household also varies over the life-cycle but in a
deterministic manner. We let a denote the household size of a household of age a. Households
work the initial Tr - 1 periods of their life-cycle after which they retire.
      Households maximize expected discounted life-time utility. Let xa

Household Car Dynamics: The law of motion of the household's stock of cars is given as:

where ij                                  j
       a,s denotes investment in cars and a,s is the depreciation rate. To capture realistic
car dynamics, the household depreciation rate can be in one of two states: normal  N or
breakdown  B which have the following properties  B   N , 1 .  N  0,  B . The transition
between these two states follows a Markov process. A breakdown occurs with probability  and
is an absorbing state. When the household adjusts the car stock they move deterministically
to the normal depreciation state  N next period.
    We assume that `actively' adjusting the car stock implies a cost of adjustment, :

   The household income process in (10) - (12) generalizes commonly used specifications in
the literature. First, we allow for aggregate as well as cohort-specific and purely idiosyncratic
income shocks. Correlation of shocks across households allows for movements in aggregate
income. Cohort specific shocks open up for aggregate income shocks impacting differently on
households depending on their age. Secondly, the drift component, ga,S is allowed to vary
stochastically over time between a normal growth state and a low growth state. This changes
the perceived life-cycle profile for different cohorts. Third, we allow for shocks to conditional
income uncertainty through changes in the variances of s , a,s and j
                                                                   a,s which may matter
due to non-convex adjustment costs and the general non-linear nature of the model.
   Car loan rate: The car loan borrowing rate follows the stochastic process:

                             c          log (rc - r)          c          r
                       log (rs - r) =                + r log rs -1 - r + s                  (14)
                                           1 - r
where r        2
      s  N (0,  ). r is persistence of the log car loan interest rate and its long-run mean
is rc .
   Wealth: Mian, et al. (2013) emphasize the importance of household wealth shocks as
important for consumption adjustments during the Great Recession. We introduce these

                                                15
through stochastic capital gains and losses on financial assets. We assume that qa,s , which
impacts wealth for household's with positive net financial assets, follows a random walk:
                                        log qa,s = log qa,s-1 + q
                                                                a,s                                    (15)
where q         2
      a,s  N 0, q,a .
      Finally, we assume that new households entering the economy with initial income and
asset portfolios (consisting of cars, car loans and risk-free assets) which are drawn from log
normal distributions.

3.3     Household Dynamic Programming Problems

Consider the dynamic programming problem for a household of age a. Such a household
                                  j                     j        j
chooses the vector hj      j               j     j
                    a,s = ca,s , da,s+1 , ia,s , a,s , ba,s+1 , ka,s+1 given the relevant state variables
      j      j        j
sj                            j         j      j      j                          2    2     c
 a = da-1,s ba-1,s , ka-1,s , a,s , a, pa,s , ua,s , ma,s , xs where xs = ga,s , ,s , ,s , rs , qa,s are ex-
ogenous aggregate variables.
   We remove time, age, and individual indicators. The household choices will be determined
by the outer envelope of two value functions:
                                    W (s) = max (Wp (s) , Wnp (s))                                     (16)
where Wp (s) is the value of actively adjusting the household car stock (i.e. purchasing or
selling) and Wnp (s) is the value of non-adjusting (maintenance). Bellman's equation for an
adjusting household is given as:
                             Wp (s) = max ua (c, d ) +  (a) E (W (s ))                                 (17)
                                          h

subject to the constraints in equations (3) - (15), and imposing  =  N such that households
who adjust their car stock avoid breakdown risk in the first period thereafter.
      The value of non-adjusting is:
                             Wnp (s) = max
                                        np
                                           ua (c, d ) +  (a) E (W (s ))                                (18)
                                          h

subject to (3) - (15), imposing that car investment equals required maintenance, d = (1-)d.
      Having solved the household choice problems, we define aggregate variables as:
                                              amax
                                              a=1    a     z j (sa ) dµa
                                                         sa a
                                                                           (sa )
                                   zs =                   amax                                         (19)
                                                          a=1 a
where µa (sa ) denotes the distribution of cohort a agents over the states.

                                                         16
3.4     Parametrization and Policy Functions

We solve the model numerically by value function iterations assuming discrete but very fine
grids for cash on hand, the riskless asset and cars (see Appendix A.2 for details). We
parametrize the model using both calibration and estimation (indirect inference) using in-
formation only for the Pre-Great Recession period.

3.5     III.1 Calibrated parameters

The calibrated parameters and their values are reported in Table 3. A model period is a
calendar year. Households enter the economy at age 25, work for 40 years and live for a
maximum of 60 years. All households face mortality risk, we calibrate (25 , .., 84 ) to match
the population averages in the 2009 Lifetable of the United States. These probabilities imply
a life expectancy of 50 years at age 25.
   The annual real return on the risk free asset is 4 percent. Based on the estimates of
Attanasio and Weber (1995) and Eichenbaum, Hansen and Singleton (1986), we set the elas-
ticity of intertemporal substitution, 1/, equal to 2/3. The premium on car loans over the
risk free rate is 1.78 percent annually. This estimate is consistent with the difference between
the assumed risk free rate and the average real interest rate on auto loans issued by Auto
Finance Companies and commercial banks (5.78 percent adjusted for CPI inflation) in the
1970-2006 sample. The parameters of the stochastic process for the car loan interest premium
are derived by fitting an autoregressive process to the Auto Finance Company lending rate
premium using monthly data from 1970 to 2006. This gives us estimates of r = 0.500 and
 2
r  = 0.2972 .
      The variance of the idiosyncratic income risk is calibrated using the estimates of Blundell,
                                                                       2
Pistaferri and Preston (2008) and Gourinchas and Parker (2002). We set u = 0.2462 and
 2
   = 0.1402 so that amongst the idiosyncratic income risk, transitory shocks dominate. We
assume the transitory aggregate income shocks are related to variation in unemployment type
states. Therefore, we calibrate it to the share of households reporting zero annual income in
                                                        2
the Current Population Survey. This gives a variance of   = 0.0082 .8
   8
     For simplicity in household's expectations we abstract from the correlation between the aggregate per-
manent and transitory shocks. However, in the simulation we impose a correlation of 0.44 between these two
aggregate shocks. As the idiosyncratic components of both permanent and transitory shocks is much greater
than the aggregate ones, from the household's perspective, this restriction in quantitatively unimportant.

   We initially assume that the drift term in the life-cycle income process is constant over
time, i.e. ga,s = ga . We calibrate ga so that it implies life-cycle income profiles consistent
with a polynomial approximation of average income over the life-cycle that we estimate in the

We estimate the mean share of household's asset in housing, a , and stocks, a , over the
life-cycle from the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finance.10 We then estimate the variance of
innovations to the (linearly detrended) log of the house price index produced by the Federal

Housing Finance Association. For the 1975-2007 sample, this gives us an estimate of q,H       =
0.0312 . We estimate the variance of innovations to the log of the stock price, using the S&P500
                                                   2
for the period 1960-2007. This gives us a value of q,E = 0.1332 . Finally, the covariance of
the shocks is q,HE = -0.0002.
  We calibrate initial income and assets of newborn households by matching data from the
CEX and from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). Initial income is log normally dis-

tributed with mean one and variance Y 0
                                        = 0.5822 . This variance matches the cross-sectional
variance of (log) income residuals of households aged 24-26 in the CEX. The distribution of
                                                                                2
initial assets is also assumed to be normal with a mean b0 = 0.086 and variance b 0

These values match the mean and variance observed in the 2007 sample of the SCF for house-
holds at age 24 re-scaled by income of households aged 24-26. We assume that the logarithm
of households' stock of cars at birth at birth is given by a normal distribution with mean

      In particular, we regress the family earnings on an age polynomial controlling for cohort, race and edu-
cation. We include time dummies for imputed family income in 2004 and 2005.

d0 = -1.39 and variance d = 1.0402 , values that match the average value of cars per house-
hold at age 24 (re-scaled by income as well) from the CEX. Finally, to avoid excessive car
purchases in the first period of life, 70 percent of the households entering the economy can
optimally adjust their car stocks conditional upon their initial asset draw.11
      The retirement replacement rate, , is set such that in the absence of shocks the household
would receive 60 percent of their average income in the last five years of working life, see
Bernheim, Skinner and Weinberg (2001). This gives a value of  = 0.668. Finally, we assume
that the probability of a car breakdown is set to  = 0.15.

3.6      Estimated parameters

We estimate the remaining parameters by indirect inference targeting a number of household
and aggregate statistics. We initially assume that the aggregate shocks impact equally on all
                   2            2
cohorts, i.e. that    = 0 and      = 0. The estimated parameters then consist of the vector
 , , µ, , ,  N ,  B , 2
                        , .
      Model moments are computed over simulations of the model for 2,000 periods with 2,000
households per cohort (and using the first cohort to burn in) and we minimize a quadratic
form in deviations of the model moments (averaged over panels of cohorts) from the empir-
ical targets using an identity matrix as the weighting matrix. The targets that we use for
estimation of the structural parameters all refer to the pre-Great Recession period. In this
way, we parametrize the model, including agents' expectations, so that they refer to `normal'
circumstances. The first subset of targets refer to household specific moments derived from
the CEX. We target the average share of households who purchase a car at the annual fre-
quency (19.1 percent on average in the CEX data); the average spending on cars per year
relative to non-durables spending, 9.89 percent in the data; the mean spending on cars rela-
tive to their car stock for households that purchase a car, 83.3 percent in the CEX. We also
target the growth in the household spending non-durables spending from age 25 to peak, 41.9
percent on average, and the share of households below the age of 45 years who do not have
a car loan, 55.5 percent according to the SCF. Finally, we target the standard deviation of
aggregate real car purchases computed in the CEX data (2.69 percent). The second set of
moments that we include are aggregate moments computed from annual NIPA data for the

       We impose that no household breaks its collateral constraint at the initial asset allocation.

sample period 1970-2006.12 We target the standard deviation of real non-durable consump-
tion goods expenditure (0.77 percent), the standard deviation of real car expenditure (5.91
percent), and the cross-correlation of these two time series (72.1percent). The targets are
summarized in Table 4 along with their model equivalents while Table 5 contains the esti-
mates of the structural parameters. We find an estimate  of 82.7 percent and an elasticity
of substitution between non-durables and cars slightly larger than one, µ = 1.14. The normal
car depreciation rate,  N , is estimated to be 14.6 percent per year, while the breakdown value
is estimated as  B = 20.7. This gives an average depreciation rate that is close to the value
of earlier estimates such as Attanasio (2000). The estimate of the proportion of depreciation
that correspond to maintenance,  , is 81.7 percent. In combination these two estimates imply
that a passive strategy of simply carrying out maintenance induce a net depreciation rate of
cars of 11.9 percent per year. Combining these parameters with the fact that 19.1 percent of
households adjust their car stock every year, implies that households (without a breakdown)

   The transactions cost,  , is estimated as 13 percent of the car value. We then calibrate 
which enters the collateral constraint when purchasing a car so that we rule out default (due
to inability to pay) by setting it equal to  = (1 -  -  ) / (1 + rc ) which delivers a value of

68.4 percent. Finally, the volatility of non-durables consumption implies that   = 0.022 .
  The model does an excellent job at matching the targets (see Table 4). Many moments are
matched to within a few percent deviations from the target and the matches are particularly
close for the mean of the extensive margin and the ratio of spending on cars relative to non-
durables. We also report the match of the model to the data for a few non-targeted moments,
the ages at which household spending on non-durables and cars peak, the growth of the
household car stock from age 25 to peak, and the cross-sectional variances real spending on
non-durables and on cars. The model matches each of these non-targeted moments closely.

dent for younger households due to binding borrowing constraints induced by expectations of
future income growth. Panel B illustrates car spending plotted against cash on hand. These
policy functions illustrate the lumpiness of investment in cars: Poor households choose not to
adjust their car stock because of the non-convex adjustment costs and because of the need to
generate sufficient savings to provide for the down payment. Therefore, as cash in hand rises
it eventually reaches a threshold value at which households invest positively in cars but the
size of the car that they choose depends on their asset position.
   Panel C illustrates a households' current choice of the value of their car stock plotted
against their beginning of period car stock. The policy function brings out in a very clear
fashion the (S, s) properties of car adjustments; There are upper and lower bounds on the
household's car stock and whenever the car stock is outside this zone, it is adjusted to d ; Inside

the zone, the car stock declines gradually over time as the household pays for maintenance
costs only. The adjustment point is higher for older and middle-aged households because
they have higher household consumption equivalence requirements. However, since younger
households find themselves on the part of the life-cycle where income is expected to rise,
the optimal adjustment point will be increasing over time and the policy function for these
households displays significant asymmetry insofar as households tolerate much more deviation
of the actual car stock from its target on the upside than on the downside.
    Panel D shows the policy function for an agent who has experienced a 10 percent drop in
income. This triggers a downward revision in the no-adjustment zone of the policy function
as well as in d . Consequently, in recessions where many households experience negative
income shocks, the extensive margin contracts as households delay adjusting their car stock.
Moreover, high idiosyncratic income variance implies that those who purchase cars during
recessions tend to be households that, despite the economy-wide contraction, are doing well.
Thus, in `normal' recessions, the drop in durables spending derives from the extensive margin
while the intensive margin tend not to adjust much as in `normal' recessions but not the Great
Recession.


4     The Great Recession

We now use the model to examine the sources of the Great Recession with the aim of drawing
inference on the shocks and beliefs about these that triggered this large contraction in the
U.S. economy.

4.1     Method

We simulate the model in response to idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks under alternative
assumptions about their nature. We then inspect the consumption responses during the
Great Recession in each case constraining ourselves by drawing idiosyncratic shocks from
their asymptotic distributions and aggregate shocks that match in size those observed in the
data.
   The rich wealth distribution in the model and the presence of non-convex adjustment costs
imply that the model has path dependence. We address this issue by simulating the Great
Recession from an initial condition that takes into account the conditions leading up to this

                                             24
recession in terms of aggregate income and the credit market situation. We first feed in a long
series of the aggregate shocks pre-Great Recession and then simulate the model from 2007 to
2015 feeding in either one or more aggregate shocks. We simulate a panel of 120,000 households
and compute aggregate variables by cross-sectional aggregation while cohort specific variables
are found by aggregating at the cohort level. We repeat this exercise 100 times.

4.2     Aggregate Income Shocks

Perhaps the most obvious explanation for the dramatic consumption adjustments during the
Great Recession is that the aggregate income shocks were very large relative to what agents
could reasonably have expected on the basis of past data. Figure 7, Panel A shows log
detrended aggregate real income per capita from 1980 (estimated from the CPS by cross-
sectional aggregation). The innovations to aggregate income are combinations of permanent
and transitory shocks. The permanent innovations are measured as changes in (detrended)
                        1              1
average log income it = N  i log yit - N i log yit-1 , while the transitory shocks are measured
as deviations from trend in the share of households with zero income it = Pr(yit = 0).13 Panel
B illustrates the combined innovations to the aggregate real income series, the first difference
of log income.

     The CPS income series is deflated by the GDP deflator. We use CPS income series from 1964, while we
use the BLS wage and income series prior to this. For most of the period this series move together closely.

similar sized shocks realized in 2009 and 2010. Our first experiment thus considers this source
of aggregate shocks in isolation. We expose all households in the economy to the aggregate
income shocks, (1946:2015, 1964:2015 ), in addition to idiosyncratic shocks, uj           j
                                                                              1920:2015 , 1920:2015
which we draw from their respective asymptotic distributions.
   Figure 8, Panel A reports the resulting time-series for the log of aggregate consumption
expenditures plotted along with the detrended cross-sectionally aggregated log consumption
estimate from the BLS and CEX (both in real per capita terms). The model provides a
perhaps surprisingly precise account of consumption pre-Great Recession although it cannot
fully account for the pre-Great Recession consumption boom and exaggerates the consequences
of the early 1990s recession. The large income shocks observed in the Great Recession do not,
however, generate consumption responses consistent with the empirical evidence: While the
drop in overall consumption expenditures implied by the model is qualitatively similar to the
data, in the NIPA data consumption expenditures drop approximately 10.5 log points from
2006 to 2015 but only 7.6 log points in the model.
   More importantly, the responses of total car investment (Panel B) and its extensive and
intensive margins (Figure 9, Panels A and B respectively) are entirely inconsistent with the
data. The decline in car investment over the Great Recession implied by the model, 18 log
points between 2005 and 2010, is only a half of what is observed in the data (35 log point).14
This far smaller decline in car investment reflects both a more modest contraction of the
extensive margin (1.8 percentage point as opposed to 5 percentage points in the data) and
in the intensive margin (12.3 log point compared to the 17.8 percent decline in the data,
during the same period).          The reason for this finding is that, although the size of the
aggregate income drop during the Great Recession was large, it is still moderate relative to
the variance of idiosyncratic income risk. Therefore, there will always be households that do
well in a recession. Such households dominate amongst those that adjust car stocks and have
no reason to reduce the size of their cars.
   Cohort consumption responses: Figure 10 presents the percentage deviations from a
predicted life-cycle trend for three working age cohorts: young (aged 25-34 in 2007), middle
(aged 35-44 in 2007) and older (aged 45-55 in 2007). In the CEX, the consumption growth

     In the NIPA the decline is 25 percent in the CEX (where our definition excludes maintenance) the de-
cline is 43 percent.

and car expenditures of the youngest cohort declined much more than the other two cohorts.15
This was primarily driven by a very large extensive margin response. The oldest cohort's car
expenditure fell the least. On the intensive margin it is the middle cohort the responds most.
These consumption adjustments contrast with the model where the consumption growth rates
are very similar across cohorts when we assume a uniform aggregate income shock and no other
aggregate shocks. Although financial portfolios and expected future income paths differ across
cohort, the common shock implies common (and counterfactual) consumption adjustments.

  15
     The methodolody is described in the appendix. For consumption growth we take advantage of the
short panel dimension of the CEX and compare the log change of non-durables consumption of a household
in the last quarter they are interviewed to the first quarter: log Cint:4 - log Cint:1 .

                                                                           27
                    Finally, we look at savings where for each cohort we show the proportion of households
with higher income (including returns on financial assets) than consumption expenditures.
In the CEX, middle and older cohorts reduced net savings but younger households increased
their savings. The model instead implies a fairly uniform savings decline across cohorts.

4.3                       Cohort Specific Shocks

We now examine the importance of cohort-specific income shocks during the Great Recession.
We feed in cohort specific income shocks, {a,s , a,s }, under the restriction that these induce
exactly the same path of aggregate income shock as in Section 4.2. To estimate a,s we
first remove aggregate time and life-cycle trends from log income; we then divide the CPS
households into age-year groups defined by the age of the household head; for each group we
compute fluctuations in income over time which are aggregated up to decennial cohorts by
averaging over the shocks of the age-year groups in a given year. We use deviations from the
life-cycle trend in the age 25 households to define an initial income shock for each year for
each birth year cohort. The transitory shocks, a,s , are estimated similarly, full details are

                                                                                                      28
provided in the Appendix. The cohort income shocks as measured in the CPS imply a similar
size decline in income for the young and medium aged cohorts and a smaller decline for the
old cohort (see Figure 10).
    Figures 8 and 9 report the implications of this model for the aggregate variables (shown
in blue). The cohort specific shocks increase the extent to which the model undershoots the
consumption boom in the pre-Great Recession period. As far as aggregate car investment is
concerned, there is hardly any impact of allowing for cohort specific income shocks. Consid-
ering the extensive and intensive margins, we see the extensive margin is unchanged, while
the intensive margin decline is slightly reduced, but less so than consumption.
      While introducing cohort specific shocks fails to improve the aggregate performance of
the model, its ability to account for the cohort level adjustment of car expenditures does
improve. In particular, this version of the model is now consistent with older households
cutting their car investment less during the Great Recession than the younger cohorts and
with the 25-34 year old cohort adjusting the extensive margin more than other cohorts (Figure
10). Nonetheless, the model still under-predicts the decline in consumption growth and the
increase in net savings observed for the young cohort; and it fails to account for the fact that
the middle cohort adjusts the intensive car purchase margin more than other cohorts.

4.4     Cost of Car Finance

During the financial crisis the spread of interest paid on car loans above the risk free rate
jumped from 50 percent below trend in 2006 to more than 50 above trend in 2010 (see Figure
A.9 in the Appendix). This surge in the cost of car finance might be an important factor
behind the unusual car purchase dynamics during the Great Recession. We therefore now
allow for stochastic shocks to the car loan premium. We calculate the sequence of shocks to
the interest rate premium using the autoregressive specification in (14):
                                                              log (rc - r)
                       r         c                c
                       s = log (rs - r ) - r log rs-1 - r -
                                                                 1 - r
imposing that r = 0.50 as estimated earlier. This delivers the sequence of interest rate shocks
reported in Figure A.9 Panel B including the very large positive shock at the onset of the
recession.
    Figure 11 shows how the surge in the car loan premium impact on the extensive and
intensive margins of car purchases. We show both the impact of the financial shock in isolation,

                                              29
the impact of the cohort income shock in isolation and the two aggregate shocks in combination
from 2007 onwards. In isolation, the increase in the car loan premium actually leads to an
increase in the intensive margin because only richer households choose to adjust car stocks
when car finance becomes more expensive. A minor fraction of the reduction in the extensive
margin during 2007 and 2008 appears to derive from the car premium shock but its impact
is dwarfed by the income shock. Car debt is concentrated on very young households and on
households very close to the end of the life-cycle (who short-sell their cars), households that
have low wealth and account for only a small share of spending. Hence, the contribution of
this source of shocks is marginal.

4.5      Wealth Shocks

Mian et al. (2013), argue that the bust of the housing market at the onset of financial crisis had
a large impact on consumption. Berger et al (2018) show that incomplete markets models such
as ours can potentially generate large marginal propensities to consume out changes in wealth
induced by real estate price changes. Thus, we now introduce shocks to the aggregate house
and stock price which impact on the wealth of households with positive net asset positions.
We estimate the sequence of shocks as the innovations to the log of the house price index
produced by the Federal Housing Finance Association and innovations to the log of the stock
price, using the S&P500 for the period 1960-2007 assuming both follow a random walk.16
  16
       We remove linear trends from the log house price index and from the log stock price index.

                                                                              30
   As above we introduce asset price changes on top of income shocks and changes in the
car loan premium. The effect of these respective shocks on the household's wealth depends
on their age specific portfolio shares. Figure A.11, Panel A, in the Appendix shows that
both shocks are important, with the stock price raising the average (asset-weighted) price in
the late 1990s boom, while house prices played a significant role in the lead up to the Great
Recession.

   When we add the boom-bust asset price cycle, the model matches the consumption spend-
ing boom from the mid-1990s to 2006, see Figure 12, Panel A. Furthermore, during the Great


                                                                          31
Recession, the combined effects of income and asset price shocks imply a peak-to-trough de-
cline in consumption expenditures very similar to what is observed in the data. In isolation,
the decline in aggregate income dominates that of housing wealth but the latter occurs in a
very persistent manner and accounts for an increasing share of the consumption decline as
the crisis moved forward in time. Thus, in line with Kaplan, Mitman and Violante (2020), we
find that housing prices matter for consumption dynamics.
    Introducing wealth shocks also has important consequences for consumer durables dynam-
ics. The combined impact of lower incomes and falling house prices imply that aggregate
spending on cars in the model falls by around 25 log points from 2006 to 2010, a decline which
is not quite as large as in the data but much larger than in the absence of wealth shocks.
Furthermore, the introduction of the wealth shock allows us to match almost perfectly the
peak-to-trough decline in the extensive margin, see Figure 13, and the intensive margin now
contracts by more albeit less than in the data.
      The asset price shock matters for our analysis because it impacts on wealthy households
who are "consumption intensive" and account for a large fraction of total consumption. A
household that is simultaneously hit by a negative income shock and a decline in their wealth
will have a strong incentive to reduce their car stock size while the size of the asset price shock
induces an incentive to delay car adjustment for households with positive net wealth even if
they should be lucky enough not to experience a drop in income.

4.6     Long-Run Income Risk

The Great Recession induced a severe deterioration in the labor market prospects of U.S.
households which in combination with the slow recovery, raised concerns about secular stag-
nation, e.g. Summers (2014). Such expectations of persistently low growth of the aggregate
economy may also have spilled over to households and impacted on their consumption choices
beyond the direct effects of lower income.
      So far we have assumed ga,s = ga (constant life-cycle income profiles) but we now want to
allow for shocks. We assume that changes in the life-cycle income profile are rare but persistent
so that they can be thought of as introducing long-run household income risk similar in nature
to the long-run risk shocks studied by Bansal and Yaron (2004) in the asset pricing literature.
One can therefore think of the combination of the two permanent income shocks, ej
                                                                                a,s and ga,s ,




                                                32
as determining household beliefs in a similar fashion to the house price beliefs examined by
Kaplan, Mitman and Violante (2020).
   The hypothesis that we are pursuing is that life-cycle income profile expectations may
have flattened as a result of the Great Recession. Figure A.12 illustrates the life-cycle income
profiles estimated using CEX income data for the 1989-2006 sample and for the 2009-2012
sample. These estimates do seem consistent with the idea that ga declined post recession, see
also Kong, Ravikumar and Vandenbroucke (2018).
    Assume that ga follows a two-state discrete Markov chain with values:

                                                 g (a)high if g (a)high > 0
                                 g (a)low =                                 ,
                                                 g (a)high       o.w

where ga is a polynomial approximation to the estimates of the life-cycle profiles, see Appendix
A.3 for details.17 We find  = 0.58 indicating a very dramatic decline in the life-cycle income
growth profiles. As is evident from Figure A.14, this shock have potentially large impacts on
especially younger households up to the age of 40 or so. We then simulate the model assuming
that the economy starts with g (a)high and switches to g (a)low in 2007 where it remains for
the remainder of the simulation. We assume that the high growth state is an absorbing state
with households placing zero probability on the prospect of a low growth economy. The low
income growth state has expected duration of 40 years, such that households expect the state
to last for the duration of their working life. The income shocks that hit the economy from
2007 onwards are then mixes of the cohort-specific levels shock, a,s , and the growth rate
shock, ga,s , constrained so that aggregate income changes by exactly the same amount as in
the data.
   Figure 14 illustrates the results. The long-run income risk shock contributes significantly
to explaining the consumption dynamics. In particular, income shocks and wealth shocks
now not only explain most of the decline in total non-durable consumption expenditures but
also helps model account for almost all of the decline in spending on cars from 2007. When
we assume the growth shock hits in 2009, car investment fall further to its lowest point,
matching the data. Turning to the extensive and intensive margins we see the growth shock
primarily operates on the extensive margin, generating an additional decline in purchases in
2009 (Figure 15, Panel B). This implication comes from the long-run risk shock's impact on
  17
       We restrict the fall in the growth rate to households on the growing section of the lifecycle profile.

younger households such as those in their 30s who account for a large fraction of car purchases
and whose expected life-time incomes are particularly sensitive to the perceived flattening of
the life-cycle income profile.
   The growth rate shock is important for explaining the cohort pattern of car spending
adjustments during the Great Recession, see Figure 10. We see that the allowing for asset
price, interest rate and income level and growth shocks, produces cohort level consumption
changes that match the data very well, closer than those implied by the model with cohort
income shocks, and much better than the model with uniform income shocks. Moreover, the
model now also generates the U-shaped response across cohorts on the intensive margin, with
the middle cohort reducing the value of purchases most strongly. Importantly, the model now

                                                                            34
also matches that savings increase for the young cohort, whereas the middle and older cohorts
see savings fall. The reason behind that is a shallower life-cycle income profile induces the
young cohort to save more.

5     Extensions

This section of the paper discusses a number of extensions to the model. For simplicity and
computational expediency, the extensions are solved in the version of the model with only
income shocks.

5.1   Fuel price

Fuel prices moved dramatically during the Great Recession. Such movements might have im-
pacted on car choices. To examine this, we introduce car utilization into the model. Utilizing
cars at a higher rate is assumed to involve higher consumption of fuel. Let the fuel input be
             j
denoted by fa,t , and its stochastic price by qF,t . Car services are now assumed to be a nested
CES aggregator of the car stock, dj                       j

ratio of fuel expenditure to car expenditure (0.606 in the CEX data) and the correlation
between (detrended) car expenditure and the fuel price, which is -0.308. The rest of the
parameters are reestimated using the moments used previously. The full set of estimated
parameters is presented in Table 5. Figure A.17 in the Appendix shows the substantial

increase in the cost of fuel between 2001 and 2007. The cost of fuel continued to rise following
the onset of the Great Recession, before collapsing precipitously in the face of a decline in
demand for oil. We then feed the estimated car fuel shocks into the model and examine the
car expenditure dynamics. We find, however, that the paths of the extensive and intensive
margins of car purchases during the Great Recession are insensitive to fuel shocks relative
to the income shocks (Figure 16). The reason for this is that most of the production of car
services comes from the car stock, and this is a slow moving variable. Thus, while higher fuel
prices depress car demand, quantitatively this aspect matters little.

5.2    Higher moment shocks

An influential literature has highlighted that uncertainty increased significantly during the
Great Recession and that this can have important implications for firm and household choices.18
We now explore the importance of this for our analyses.

  18
    See: Storesletten, Telmer, & Yaron (2004); Justiniano & Primiceri (2008); Bloom (2009); Bloom et al
(2018), Bayer et al (2019), Fernandez-Villaverde et al (2011).

                                                                             36
5.2.1   Uncertainty

We first introduce uncertainty shocks assuming that the variances of the shocks to the
                                                          2              2
permanent income process are state dependent with t  N 0, ,S , a,t  N 0, ,S ,
j           2
 a,t  N 0, ,S . We assume a two state Markov process for the variances so that S moves
between a high and low uncertainty regime with transition probability Pu (S, S ). We adopt
the probabilities for the Markov chain over the uncertainty regime from Bloom et al. (2018)
transformed to an annual frequency. The variance of the shocks in the low uncertainty regime
is the same as in the baseline model. In the high uncertainty regime the variance of the ag-
gregate and cohort shocks increases by a factor of 1.6, also following Bloom et al. (2018). For
the idiosyncratic shocks we consider a two standard deviation increase and use the estimate
of Bayer et al. (2019) who find a one standard deviation increase in income uncertainty raises
the variance of income shocks by 54 percent. This gives a scaling factor of 1.44. The full list
of parameters can be found in Table A.6.
   We assume that prior to the Great Recession the economy was in the low uncertainty state.
Then in 2008 with the onset of the recession the economy switches to the high uncertainty
regime and remains there for the rest of the simulation. The aggregate shocks are those
estimated from the data so these are unchanged, but the idiosyncratic persistent shocks are
now drawn from the higher variance distribution.

   The response of the probability of car purchase can be seen in Figure 17, Panel A. The
increase in uncertainty substantially reduces the share of households purchasing cars, relative

                                                                        37
to the model with income shocks. The effect of uncertainty on increasing the size of the (S, s)
region has previously been highlighted by Eberly (1994). Most of this effect occurs in the first
period of the shock, but there is some persistence in the reduction in household adjusting their
car stock. However, once one allows for higher uncertainty, it becomes even more important
to allow for wealth shocks and long-run risk. In particular when uncertainty rises, those who
chose to adjust their car are wealthier and faced with favorable income shocks and therefore
the the intensive margin response moves even less when uncertainty increases contrary to the
data.

5.2.2    Negative Skewness

An alternative formulation involving higher order moment that has been discussed in the
literature is negative skewness. Guvenen et al. (2014) argue that countercyclical left skewness
of income shocks better captures the US data than countercyclical variance.19 We follow the
Guvenen, Ozkan & Song (2014) and specify the income shocks with a mixture of normals
with state varying parameters. Each period idiosyncratic permanent shocks can be drawn
from either a high variance or (a close to degenerate) low variance distribution:
                                      N µS    2
                                         ,1 , ,1         with probability p
                         j
                         t,a,S        N µS    2
                                         ,2 , ,2       with probability 1 - p
   The state S is a Markov process which moves between boom and recession with probability
PN (S, S ). The means of the two normals differ in boom and recession. The differing means
of these distributions generate the skewness of the shocks. We use the parameter values from
Guvenen et al. (2014), and estimate an annual transition matrix for NBER recession years.
The full list of parameters can be found in Table A.6.20 As in Guvenen et al. (2014), skewness
falls by around 15 points on Kelly's measure of skewness during a recession
    We simulate the Great Recession experiment using the same income shocks, but with the
economy moving to the recessionary negative skewness regime at NBER recession dates so
that skewness of income returns to normal in 2010. As can be seen from Figure 18, Panel
  19
      There is an obvious relation between negative skewness shocks and the growth shock we investigated
in the baseline model. However, as negative skewness shocks affect all ages they have a less clear lifecycle
dimension.
   20
      We add an additional moment to target the standard deviation of income in the baseline model. As
idiosyncratic shocks now effectively contain an aggregate component, the model requires smaller aggregate
                 2
income shocks      = 0.0092 .

B the negative skewness has a dramatic effect on the value of cars purchased, significantly
reducing the value during the period of the recession. However, given the temporary nature
of the shock this variable rebound strongly once the recession passes.21 The skewness shocks
also result in large falls in the value of car purchases in the previous recessions. This is not
consistent with the data shown in Section 2.3. The effect on the share of agents adjusting in
more muted, with negative skewness reducing the fall in agents purchasing cars (Figure 18,
Panel A).

5.3    Cash for Clunkers

The Obama administration enacted in 2009 a programme to support the automotive sector
during the Great Recession, the Car Allowance Rebate System or Cash for Clunkers program.
Under this stimulus policy, the government provided $3 billion of subsidies worth $3,500 to
$4,500 per household purchasing new cars and trading in an old vehicle fulfilling certain age
and environmental criteria. In empirical analyses, Mian & Sufi (2010), Hoekstra et al (2017),
Green et al (2018) find this program significantly stimulated car purchases while subsidies
were available but mainly through altering the timing of purchases rather than by spurring
additional purchases; that the policy design implied a decline in the value of car purchases;
and that household liquidity constraints interacted with policy's effectiveness.

  21
    If instead the period of negative skewness was assumed to last for the rest of the simulation period the
negative affect on the intensive margin would persist.

    It is interesting to introduce Cash for Clunkers matters in the life-cycle model to examine
its impact on choices. The short duration of the program, which lasted from July 1, 2009 to
August 24, 2009, makes our annual model unsuitable for analysis so we instead simulate a bi-
monthly parametrization.22 The policy itself is modelled as a two state Markov process, where
switching to the policy is a zero probability event, but the household understands the policy is
a time limited state. During the Cash for Clunkers regime, households that receive the subsidy
and adjust their stock such that a purchase that changes the stock by dj           j    j
                                                                       a,t+1 - 1 - a,t da-1,t

                             a,t+1 - 1 - a,t da-1,t with   (0, 1).23
   We calibrate the policy such that the expected duration of the state is two periods, as
initially the program was scheduled to end in November. The size of the subsidy,                                                                                                                                              , is

  22
      Unsurprisingly, when simualted in the baseline annual model, we see a large increase in the probability
of purchase and a fall in the value of purchases in 2009. The monthly model is however, exceedingly compu-
tationally intensive.
   23
      To capture the policy incentive to purchase a lower value vehicle, the household is only eligible for the
subsidy if dj       j

chosen to target a 10 percent subsidy on the value of a purchase, in line with the data.
The car size threshold, D, is set so that eligible households make car purchases that are
6.8 percent lower than similar control households during a one year window. This matches
the quasi-experimental results of Hoekstra et al (2017).24 The eligibility fraction is chosen
to match the total size of the government subsidy relative to total car expenditure in 2008.
Total expenditures on new and used cars in 2008 were $287.9 billion, which gives a target of
approximately one percent. Table 6 summarizes the parametrization.
    We simulate the bi-monthly model with the Cash for Clunkers policy taking place in July
2009 for one period. As can be seen from Figure 19, Panel A the policy results in a substantial
increase in car purchases of around 2 percentage points during July 2009 and a fall in the value
of cars purchased (Panel B), with the latter a model target. Consistent with the empirical
studies cited above, the increase in cars purchased then depresses future car purchases. As
such a significant fraction of the purchases can be classified as a change in timing rather than
additional purchases. It is also interesting to observe that the fall in the value of purchases
occurs mostly after the policy rather than during the policy period itself. The reasoning is that
the "average purchase" are preempted, so it only the more constrained households making
purchases in the period that follows and these tend to be of lower value.
   In the bottom row of Figure 19 we re-aggregate the monthly data into annual variables.
  24
     In Hoekstra et al (2017), Table 3 reports an average fall in spending of $1,900 and an average purchase
price of $28,160.

                                                     41
At the annual frequency the effects of the Cash for Clunkers program are fairly modest with a
small increase in share of household adjusting and small decline in the value of cars purchased
relative to the decline due to aggregate shocks.25


6        Conclusion

We have provided new empirical facts about household consumption adjustments during the
Great Recession and confronted these facts with a sophisticated life-cycle model with the aim
at drawing inference on household perceptions of the shocks that affected them during this
business cycle episode. Expenditures on cars, a large ticket consumer durable, fell dramati-
cally during the Great Recession and that this decline derived from both an unusually large
contraction in the extensive margin and from a unique decline in the intensive margin. We
also documented that the Great Recession impacted differentially on cohorts with younger co-
horts reducing their consumption the most while intensive margin reduction on car purchases
derives mainly from 35-44 year old households.
   We find that wealth shocks are important on top of the large aggregate income shock
are required to account for the car purchase dynamics during the Great Recession because
otherwise the intensive margin does not move much. Moreover, to account for the cohort level
adjustments, we argue that negative expectations about future income growth are required.
The latter may indicate that negative expectations were an important determinant of the
severity of this business cycle episode.
     Our analysis has considered a consumer choice problem. It would be interesting to intro-
duce equilibrium features into the modeling so that one could ask about the sources of the
large declines in wealth and income. It would also be interesting to consider housing more ex-
plicitly in the model and to allow for long-term housing finance. Similarly, we do not explicitly
model the sources of very persistent income changes and it would be interesting to consider
these in more detail by, for example, introducing search and matching features in the labor
market as these may interact with portfolio choices. We leave these and other extensions for
future work.

A.1         Data description

A.1.1        Consumer Expenditure Survey

Our core CEX extract covers 1981 to 2012. For the aggregate level series, we use quarterly
expenditure by a household (summing across monthly reported expenditures) and calculate the
average expenditure in each quarter. For aggregate moments we use all households in the
survey and apply a seasonal adjustment. For lifecycle cohorts we take an average across
households quarterly spending in a given cohort-year cell. We assign the cohort the median age
of the group and multiply by 4 to get the average quarterly expenditure. For household level
micro moments we aggregate expenditure to the household level and assign the relevant year.
For model targets we use the sample of households aged 25-84, consistent with our model
calibration.
Except for the value of car purchases, we adjust for households with missing quarters by a
simple 4 divided by # of quarterly observations present weighting. For the value of car
purchases we weight missing quarters with an age-year specific probability of purchase to avoid
inflating infrequent purchases. Non durables expenditure and income are deflated by the CPI.
For car expenditure we deflate by the new or used car CPI except in the aggregate figures
where we use the all item CPI.
The value of car purchases is the value of new and used car purchases. In aggregate statistics
we include the value of trade in credit.1 A household is recorded as purchasing a vehicle if they
report a positive purchase value. The value of a household's stock of cars comes from an
average of CEX imputed values using dummies for the car model. Our definition of
non-durables includes: food in and out, alcohol and tobacco, fuel, education, clothing, insurance
payments, transport costs, childcare, medical and hospital bills, entertainment, and donations.
For estimation of the lifecycle profile we use the log of the sum of head and spouse/partner
labor earnings. We drop observations earning less the $10,000 or where the household head
works less than an average of 20 hours a week to avoid conflating the wage profile with
    1
        This is excluded when comparing the model to the data as the definition is more applicable.

households that exit the labor market.


A.1.2    National Income and Product Account

From the Bureau of Economic Affairs National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) we use
wages and salary, compensation of employees (Table: 2.1, line: 3) for the income shocks
pre-1964. Aggregate consumption is Non-durable goods (Table: 2.3.5, line: 8) and Services
(Table: 2.3.5, line: 13). Car expenditure is Motor vehicles and parts (line: 2.3.5, line: 4). All
variables are deflated by the the Personal consumption expenditures deflator (Table: 1.1.4, line:
2) and divided by the mid-year population (Table 2.1, line: 40). The savings rate is Personal
saving (Table 2.1, line 34) divided by Disposable personal income (Table 2.1, line 27).


A.1.3    Current Population Survey

For the income measure from 1964 onwards we use the Current Population Survey Annual
Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC). Our measure of income is income from wages
for all household members. In the ASEC, income reported in the March survey is for the
previous year. We set income to zero if households report no income, but report being
unemployed. The wage is deflated by the personal consumption expenditures deflator.


A.1.4    Other

Rate spread: To calculate the spread we combine the New Car Average Finance Rate at Auto
Finance Companies (1971-2010) and the Finance Rate on Consumer Installment Loans at
Commercial Banks, New Autos 48 Month Loan (1972-2015) both from Federal Reserve Board's
G.19 Consumer Credit tables.
To calculate the total loan rate on cars we subtract inflation and weight the series according to
Attanasio, Goldberg, and Kyriazidou (2008) which puts 41 percent on auto finance and 59
percent on bank finance. The car loan rate is the average value over 1970-2006.
To estimate the spread process and shocks we take subtract the 1-yr treasury rate from both
series and combine with the weighting above. From 2011 we put 100 percent weighting on bank
loans, adjusting the level to match the series up to 2011. We then estimate an AR(1) process
for the detrended log of this series.
Asset price: We use the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finance to estimate the housing and stock


                                                 2
share of net wealth. Housing is primary residence and other real estate. Stock holdings includes
corporate stock, mutual funds and other business equity.
For the house price index we use the US Federal Housing Finance Agency's All-Transactions
House Price Index (1975-2015). For the stock price we use the S&P500 Adjusted Close Price
(1960-2015). Both variables are deflated with the CPI. We detrend the log series and assume
both prices follow a random walk.
Car loans: Aggregate car loans is Motor Vehicle Loans Owned and Securitized, Outstanding
from Federal Reserve Board's G.19 Consumer Credit tables.
Fuel price: The fuel price is the Price index for Gasoline (All Types), deflated by the CPI.
BLS Consumer Price Index tables (1967-2015). We then estimate an AR(1) process for the
detrended log of this series.


A.2     Solution method

For ease of exposition and with no loss of generalisation we condense the decision whether to
adjust or not into the choice of d . Further, given the positive interest rate spread rk > 0 it is
not optimal for a household to hold both savings and a car loan. Therefore, we can consider a
single asset k , with a kink in the interest rate schedule, and shocks to the return that are only
present when k > 0.


A.2.1    Redefine variables in terms of permanent assets and income


                  Va (k, d, rk , q, P, U, Ga,j ) = max u(c, d ) +  EVa+1 (k , d , rk , q , P , U , Ga+1,j )
                                                   c,d ,k

                                            s.t.

    c + qk · 1[k  0] + k · 1[k < 0] + d =(1 + r)qk · 1[k  0] + (1 + r + rk )k · 1[k < 0]+

                                                (1 -  )d - d · 1[adj] + Y

                                           k  - d

                                           Y =P U

                                           P =Ga,j P-1 V

                                    q = q-1 W




                                                            3
Given the restriction q > 0 we can define2 :
                                                       
                                                        qk         if k  0
                                                   k =
                                                        k          if k < 0

And therefore if k > 0:

                                                                   q
                                                           qk =         k
                                                                  q-1
                                                              Wk


We can rewrite the problem, removing the asset price q as a state variable:


             Va (k, d, rk , P, U, Ga,j ) = max u(c, d ) +  EVa+1 (k , d , rk , P , U , Ga+1,j )
                                                  c,d ,k

                                           s.t.

                          c + k + d =(1 + r)W k · 1[k  0] + (1 + r + rk )k · 1[k < 0]+

                                              (1 -  )d - d · 1[adj] + Y

                                          k  - d

                                          Y =P U

                                          P =Ga,j P-1 V


Now redefine assets in terms of the maximum collateral constraint, b = k' + d :


   Va (b, d, rk , P, U, Ga,j ) = max u(c, d ) +  EVa+1 (b , d , rk , P , U , Ga+1,j )
                                 c,d ,b

                          s.t.

       c + b + (1 -  )d =(1 + r)W (b - d) · 1[(b  d)] + (1 + r + rk )(b - d) · 1[(b < d)]+

                                 (1 -  )d - d · 1[adj] + Y

                         b 0

                         Y =P U

                         P =Ga,j P-1 V

   2
    If the interest rate premia is not impose for k < 0 we cannot make this simplification as k > 0 does not
guarantee k > 0

Define variable in current permanent income: c

                                                                     5
A.2.2    Computation

The model is solved by Value Function Iteration. We use 200 grid points for cash in hand, x,
200 grid points for assets a , 150 grid points for cars, d and 5 grid points for the interest rate
spread, rk . Expectations are taken over future shocks, using 7 grid points for permanent
income, V , 5 grid points for transitory shocks U and 5 grid points for the asset price shock, W .
As the model is partial equilibrium, the household does not need to distinguish between
aggregate and idiosyncractic shocks to permanent income, V .
We then simulate a panel of households with 2,000 household born age 25 each period, for
4,000 periods to calculate the aggregate properties of the economy. We also simulate the
lifecycle of a panel of households without aggregate shocks to uncover the lifecycle properties.
Finally, we feed in a series of shocks estimated from the data to income {Yt }2015
                                                                              t=1946 , the interest

rate spread {rc }2015                          2015
                 t=1972 , the asset price {qt }t=1976 and deterministic growth rate of economy to

replicate the behaviour of the economy in the period 1980-2015


A.3     Estimating growth profile

A.3.1    Growth rate measurement

The primary measure is Financial Income Before Tax. We drop household who have income
below $10,000 or work less the 20 hours a week. For the estimation of the growth rate annual
household income aggregated to year,t. age, a cell: Yta . Then for each year age income growth
is calculated:

                                                          -1
                                         dYta = Yta - Yta
                                                        -1



For each age the average of these growth rates across years was calculated for the pre-recession
(1990-2005) and post-recession (2010-2012) period.

                                                             2006
                                       ^ a,pre =     1
                                      dY                             dYta
                                                   T pre    t=1990
                                                             2012
                                     ^ a,post =      1
                                    dY                               dYta
                                                   T post   t=2010




                                                    6
Having calculated the average growth rate at each age in the pre- and post- recession period we
fit a polynomial f (a) across all ages to smooth the pattern:


                                               ^ a,x = g x (a) +
                                              dY                    a                          (1)


The implied lifecycle can be calculated by cumulating the estimated growth rate polynomials
^pre (a) and g
g            ^post (a).


A.3.2    Lifecycle measurement

Lifecycle estimation is directly estimating the lifecycle by regression of income on age
polynomial and controls, using household level data. The pre-recession period is 1989-2005 and
the post recession period is 2009-12. Controls are included for demography, education (e),
cohort (j ) and year. The estimation equation is:

                                               M            E
                                                   j
                          yit = 0 + f (a) +         +            e + 1 racei t + t +   it      (2)
                                               j            e


                                           ^pre (a) and f
Having estimated the lifecycle polynomials f            ^post (a) the implied growth rate is then
            pre           post
computed, g
          ^LC   (a) and g
                        ^LC    (a).


A.4     Growth rate shock calibration

Given model specification:


                                        Gpost = min (Gpre ) , G                                (3)


and growth rate polynomials, we estimate                                    ^pre (a) to g
                                         ^ to find model that fits decline: g           ^post (a).
We estimate ^ for both the growth rate estimated series and implied growth from the lifecycle
estimated series and take the average of these two measures.

A.5      Growth rate shock calibration

Given model specification:


                                          Gpost = min (Gpre ) , G                                               (4)


and growth rate polynomials, we estimate                                    ^pre (a) to g
                                         ^ to find model that fits decline: g           ^post (a).
We estimate ^ for both the growth rate estimated series and implied growth from the lifecycle
estimated series and take the average of these two measures.


A.6      Estimating cohort shocks

Our income measure of choice is household income from wages. We use a sample in the CPS of
households aged 25-64, for the years 1963-2015. We generate shocks for 10 year cohorts, such
that a household is a member of cohort s if born in the 10 year period 19s3 to 19(s + 1)2.
We use two measures to uncover aggregate permanent income shocks and aggregate
"transitory" shocks.3 Let yit = log (Yit ) be the log of household income and pit = 1[Yit  0] and
indicator variable for household income being zero (or below).


A.6.1     Permanent shocks

We first remove a trend from log income, using the period 1975-2007. To find the permanent
income component we regress the detrended income data, y^it , on a lifecycle age polynomial,

cohort (s) dummies, and demographic controls using data for  2007:


                                  y
                                  ^it =  + f (ageit ) +             s + Xit + it
                                                              s


We then construct a "year of birth" synthetic cohort, j , such that year of birth earnings is:

                                                             1
                                             ¯jt =  s +
                                             y                          it
                                                             Ntj   ij


   3
    Note: Our definition of aggregate transitory shocks differs somewhat from that typically used in the literature.
We are seeking to capture the share of households with zero income, which increased during the Great Recession.
These observations would typically be excluded from standard wage estimation.




                                                         8
The initial income of each household during the simulation is then:

                                                         1
                            ^
                            y            ¯j,t=j +25 -
                            ¯j,t=j +25 = y                                 y
                                                                           ¯j,t=j +25
                                                        N J 25
                                                                  j J 25


where we normalise such that the average initial income is zero.
We then use y
            ¯jt as the year of birth permanent income. Given the random walk in permanent
income a shock for a year of birth cohort is:


                                             ¯jt - y
                                        jt = y     ¯jt-1 t


Finally, we the average over these year of birth cohort shocks to find the cohort shocks that we
feed into the model.

                                                  1
                                          ^st =               jt
                                                  Nts   j s


A.6.2   Transitory shocks

For the transitory shocks we subtract a trend and then construct "year of birth synthetic
cohorts", this is the share of a year of birth cohort with zero income.

                                                  1
                                          p
                                          ¯jt =               p
                                                              ^it
                                                  Ntj   ij


We regress share of cohorts with zero income, p
                                              ¯, on a lifecycle age polynomial, and cohort (s)
dummies using data for  2007:


                                p
                                ¯jt =  + f (agejt ) +                s + it
                                                              s


The aggregate transitory shock for the year of birth cohort is it . We the average over these
year of birth cohort shocks to find the cohort shocks that we feed into the model.

                                                  1

A.7       Estimating cohort responses

To estimate the deviations in the consumption response of households during the Great
Recession, we regress the log of a consumption variable, xit , on a lifecycle age polynomial,
cohort (s) dummies, and linear trend, using data for  2007:4


                                  xit =  + f (ageit ) +           s + t +        it
                                                             s


For each household we can now predict consumption in each year during the Great Recession,
in the absence of the crisis as:


                                     x
                                     ^it =   ^(ageit ) +
                                           ^+f                               ^
                                                                       ^ s + t
                                                                       
                                                                 s


We divide the sample up into three cohorts j based on their age in 2007: j = 1 if
25  age2007 < 34, j = 2 if 35  age2007 < 44 and j = 3 if 45  age2007 < 54. We measure
average consumption for a cohort in year t as:

                                                      1
                                              Xjt =              xit
                                                      Ntj   ij


Actual consumption growth for year t in the recession is, growth relative to the 2007 baseline
year5 :


                                           Xjt = Xjt - Xj,2007


While predicted consumption growth is the analogue:


                                           ^ jt = X
                                           X      ^ jt - X
                                                         ^ j,2007

   4
  Where it makes more sense we use the level of a variable rather than logs and calculate percentage deviations:
Xjt = (Xjt - Xj,2007 )/Xj,2007 . We do this for car expenditure and the value conditional on purchase.
   5
     For the value of car purchase conditional on adjustment we use a baseline year of 2006-07, to increase the
available observations. We also use a longer impact period (2008-12)




                                                      10
Again to reduce measurement error, we also tend to focus on the average value of consumption
during the recession. i.e.:

                                                 2009
                                ^ j,08:09 =   1        ^ jt - X
                                                              ^ j,2007
                                X                      X
                                              2 t=2008

The reported consumption deviation is then measured as:


                                   j              ^
                                   x = Xj,08:09 - Xj,08:09



We undertake the same operation on model generated data. The measures are comparable as
we are controlling for cohort specific level effects and and trend growth in the data.


A.7.1    Cohort time period definitions

Our base line is the average 2008-09, relative to the level in 2007, using the same time period in
the data and model. However, for a few variables we make an adjustment. In particular we
choose a longer time period for the value of purchases as this is measured less precisely due to
fewer observations. For net saving (Pr(income>expenditure)) we move the effect one period
onwards in the model to capture the full effect of the growth shock.

Notes: Variable of interest is total car expenditure relative to counterfactual with no Cash for Clunkers policy.
No threshold, removes the maximum stock size threshold from eligibility for the discount. Same cost rescales
the share of eligibile households to deliver the same program cost, same share retains the same eligibility share
as in the calibrated policy.

Notes: Top row shows the results of the monthly model, the bottom row is the results of the monthly model
aggregated on a household basis to yearly averages. The dashed red line is without the policy intervention. The
solid thick blue line is with the policy, calculated on a post subsidy household expenditure basis. The thin blue
line is with the policy and includes the value of the subsidy. No shocks is a model without aggregate shocks,
monthly shocks is the aggregate shocks from the data averaged across the year.
