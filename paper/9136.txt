                                         ABSTRACT

        We consider the efficiency implications of policies to reduce global carbon emissions in a world

with pre-existing tax distortions. We first note that the weak double-dividend, the proposition that the
welfare improvement from a tax reform where environmental taxes are used to lower distorting taxes
must be greater than the welfare improvement from a reform where the environmental taxes are returned
in a lump sum fashion, need not hold in a world with multiple distortions. We then present a large-scale
computable general equilibrium model of the world economy with distortionary taxation. We use this
model to evaluate a number of policies to reduce carbon emissions. We find that the weak double

dividend is not obtained in a number of European countries. Results also demonstrate the point that the
interplay between carbon policies and pre-existing taxes can differ markedly across countries. Thus one

must be cautious in extrapolating the results from a country specific analysis to other countries.

I.          Introduction

            The past ten years has seen a tremendous amount of interest in the interaction

between distortionary taxation and optimal environmental policy. Much progress in

our understanding of this interaction has occurred, and general equilibrium modeling

has played a key role. A popular but often ill-defined concept is the "double

dividend," the idea that imposing an environmental tax can both improve economic

performance and the environment. The attraction of a double dividend arose in the

1980s from the conjunction of an increased concern about climate change and the

consequent need for a policy response on the one hand and the U.S. federal budget

deficit on the other hand. Environmental taxes appeared desirable given both these

concerns.

            Goulder [23] provides a useful taxonomy of double dividends as well as an

explanation of their appeal.1 Goulder distinguishes a "strong" and "weak" double

dividend. A strong double dividend occurs when welfare is increased in response to

an environmental tax regardless of the improvement in environmental quality. Given

the great difficulties associated with quantifying the economic benefits of an improved

environment, a strong double dividend is appealing in that a case can be made for an

environmental tax without having to worry about the magnitude of the environmental

gains. It is possible for welfare (net of environmental improvements) to increase in

response to a green tax reform if the environmental tax revenues are used to lower a

                                                                                             1
particularly egregious distorting tax. This simply points out the obvious fact that any

tax reform to replace a highly distorting tax with a less distorting taxes is, in general, a

good idea. See Bovenberg and Goulder [13] for further discussion of this point. We

find, as discussed below, that a strong double dividend is unlikely for the climate

policy targets in the Kyoto Protocol.

       A "weak" double dividend occurs when the welfare improvement from a tax

reform where environmental taxes are used to lower distorting taxes is greater than the

welfare improvement from a reform where the environmental taxes are returned in a

lump sum fashion. A general consensus has emerged that the weak double dividend is

an uncontroversial idea; it just says that lowering a distorting tax is better than simply

handing out the money. We show below, however, that in an economy with multiple

distortions, a weak double dividend need not occur. Moreover, we argue that climate

policies under consideration in response to global warming will likely not provide a

weak double dividend in a number of European countries.

       We proceed as follows. In the next section, we provide some intuition for why

a weak double dividend need not hold. We then turn in the third section to a

computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Most general equilibrium models

typically focus on a single country. The MIT Emissions and Policy Analysis (EPPA)

model allows us to carry out cross-country comparisons as well as analyses that

evaluate international policy schemes (e.g. Kyoto) in a world with pre-existing




                                                                                               2
taxation. Section 4 provides results from a number of experiments we carry out using

the model. Section 5 concludes.

II. Must a Weak Double Dividend Occur?

         A weak-double dividend arises when welfare is increased by using

environmental tax revenues to lower distorting taxes as opposed to returning the

revenues in a lump-sum fashion. Economists view this as an uncontroversial

proposition.2 In this section, we provide an intuitive demonstration that the weak

double-dividend need not hold in general.

         The following simple model will help explain the intuition.3 Consider an

economy with a representative agent whose utility is a function of consumption of two

goods (X, Y), leisure (V) and environmental quality (E):

(1)                                            U(X,Y,V;E)

Environmental quality falls with increased amounts of pollution (Z) which is

associated with the production of one of the two commodities (good Y for specificity).

Consumers maximize utility subject to the budget constraint

(2)                                        pXX + pYY = L + T

where pX and pY are the consumer prices for X and Y, the gross wage rate equals 1

(labor is taken as the numeraire good) and T is a lump-sum transfer. Leisure and labor

  Starrett [39] notes, for example, that "this result is quite general and reflects the fact that we are
always better off using the green tax revenue to reduce some other distorting tax rather then [sic] (for
example) returning it in a lump sum manner." (p. 36) See also the discussion in Goulder [23] on pages
159-161.

                                                                                                           3
sum to a fixed time endowment. Consumer prices are related to producer prices as

follows:

(3a)                                              pX = 1 + tX

(3b)                                          pY = qY(tZ)(1+tY)

where tx and ty are commodity taxes levied on goods X and Y, respectively, to raise

revenue, and tz is an environmental tax levied on Z. Initially tz equals zero. Increases

in the environmental tax raise the marginal cost - and hence the producer price - of Y,

denoted by qY. The government budget constraint is given by

(4)                                       tXX + tYqYY + tZZ = T,

again noting that tz initially equals zero.

           Consider the options in Table 1 for effecting a revenue neutral tax reform in

response to a new environmental tax initiative (tz):

                              Table 1: Revenue Neutral Tax Policies
                              Policy         Hold Fixed       Adjust
                                1               t X, t Y          T
                                2               t Y, T           tX
                                3               t X, T           tY

A weak double dividend occurs when the welfare gain from policy 2 (or 3) is greater

than the welfare gain from policy 1.

           A weak double dividend can be easily shown to occur if commodity Y is

untaxed in the model above. Policy 1 raises a tax on pollution and uses the revenue to

lower a lump-sum tax.4 Policy 2 raises a tax on pollution by the same amount as in


4
    Or equivalently, it increases a lump-sum subsidy.




                                                                                           4
policy 1 but returns the tax revenue by reducing the tax on X. To see that a weak

double dividend must hold, consider policy 1 run in reverse: lower a tax on pollution

and finance this tax reduction by increasing a lump-sum tax. Call this policy 1r (for

reverse). Now run policy 2 followed by policy 1r. This is equivalent to a policy

which lowers the tax on X and raises a lump-sum tax in a revenue neutral manner.

This policy experiment clearly raises welfare from which we can conclude that the

welfare gain from policy 2 exceeds the welfare gain from policy 1. The weak double

dividend in this simple model in which there is only one distorting tax (other than the

tax on the polluting good) is simply a restatement of the principle that lump-sum taxes

are preferred to distortionary taxes on efficiency grounds.

       To see why a weak double dividend need not hold more generally, assume that

pY >> pX > 0 (perhaps because of a high rate of taxation on Y relative to X) and that

utility is weakly separable between leisure and the two commodities and that the sub-

utility function over commodities is homothetic. An implication of this preference

structure is that the optimal commodity tax structure (ignoring the environmental

problem) is one of uniform commodity taxes (Deaton [17]). Thus, ignoring

environmental considerations, a revenue neutral tax reform would be welfare

enhancing if it reduced the difference between pY and pX. With this preference

structure, it would be preferable on efficiency grounds to implement an environmental

tax reform that returned the revenue lump-sum rather than in a way that increased the

pY-pX differential. In other words, policy 1 in Table 1 above would be preferred on




                                                                                          5
efficiency grounds to policy 2 since this latter policy increases pY - pX. The policy

prescription from this simply analysis is that in an economy with multiple distortions,

one must choose carefully which distortions to reduce, or one can do worse than a

lump sum redistribution. Put simply, there is no theoretical basis to conclude that a

weak double dividend must exist. We next demonstrate in a large-scale CGE model

that climate policies under consideration in response to global warming will likely not

provide a weak double dividend in a number of European countries.

III. Empirical Estimation of Revenue Recycling

       Empirical investigations of the potential importance of the double dividend in

climate policy date to the early 1990s, with several different types of models used (see

for example Shackelton, et al. [38]). The models include Keynesian-type macro-

econonomic models such as the DRI and LINK models, econometrically estimated

general equilibrium models (e.g. DGEM, Jorgenson and Wilcoxen [32]), and

parameterized CGE models (e.g. Goulder [22]; Boyd, et al. [15]). A comparison of

these early results for the US (Hourcade, et al. [25]) showed widely varying results.

The Keynesian-type economic models found very large strong double-dividends from

investment tax credits. A problem with the econometrically based Keynesian-type

macroeconomic models, however, is that theoretical underpinnings of the estimated

relationships are weak. DGEM results found strong double-dividends from corporate

income tax cuts as did the DRI model. In contrast, the parameterized CGE model of

Goulder did not find evidence of strong double dividends; recycling revenue to the




                                                                                           6
investment tax credit ended up just balancing losses from the carbon tax itself. These

results were in terms of discounted present value of GDP and thus do not directly

measure welfare.

       Later reviews (Goulder [22]; Parry [34]; Bovenberg [12]) have helped to

clarify issues surrounding the Double Dividend. Since then there has been more

empirical analysis and speculation on the existence of the double-dividend in other

countries, particularly Europe, as reviewed by Hourcade and Shukla [26]. One CGE

analysis posited a strong double dividend in Europe (Carraro and Soubeyran [16]) but

another empirical analyses using a CGE model suggested little evidence of a strong

double dividend in France (Bernard and Vielle [11]). A Keynesian-type model

estimated for Europe systematically found a large strong double dividend (Barker [9]).

There has been very little investigation of the potential double-dividend benefits in

developing countries, in part perhaps, because developing countries have not agreed to

an emissions cap. An exception is Boyd and Ibarrarian [14] who investigate the

potential for a double dividend in Mexico, should Mexico seek to control emissions,

but find little support for its existence except under unusual circumstances.

       To comparably study the existence of a double-dividend in different countries,

we employ the Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, a recursive

dynamic multi-regional general equilibrium model of the world economy that has been

developed for analysis of climate change policy (see, for example, Babiker, et al. [1];

Babiker, et al. [7]; Babiker, et al. [8]; Ellerman and Sue Wing [19]; Babiker and




                                                                                          7
Eckaus [2]; and Babiker and Jacoby [3]. Previous versions of the model have been

used extensively for this purpose (e.g., Jacoby, et al. [29]; Ellerman and Decaux [18];

Jacoby and Sue Wing [30]; and Reilly, et al. [36]). The current version of EPPA is

built on a comprehensive energy-economy data set (GTAP4-E5) that accommodates a

consistent representation of energy markets in physical units as well as detailed

accounts of regional production and bilateral trade flows. The base year for the model

is 1995 and it is solved recursively at 5-year intervals. A full documentation of EPPA

is provided in Babiker, et al. [6]. In this paper, we use a new version of the model

(EPPA-EU) including a breakdown for the European Union. The reference case for

Europe in EPPA-EU is presented and compared with other economic models in

Viguier, et al. [40]. As significant advantage of this approach compared with previous

work is that a common method and data set is applied to all countries and the cross-

country results are thus comparable. As reviewed above, the existing empirical

studies are for the most part based on single country models.

III-1. EU Disaggregation

           EPPA-EU extended the current version of EPPA by bringing in a detailed

breakdown of the EU and incorporating an industry and a household transport sectors

for each region. The regional, sectoral, and factors aggregation shown in Table 2,

together with the substitution elasticities in Table 3 completely specify the benchmark

equilibrium.

                                                                                            8
        The European Union is disaggregated into 9 countries and 1 region

representing the Rest of Europe (ROE). Four out of the 9 EU countries (France,

Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands) were aggregated together with ROE in the GTAP4-

E database. We disaggregated this region using data from the GTAP-5 Pre-release

that provides a complete disaggregation of the EU.6 To accomplish this task we

developed an optimization algorithm that uses the economic structure of these 4

countries in GTAP-5 Pre-release while imposing the output, demand, and trade

balances for their corresponding aggregate region in GTAP4-E. This allowed us to

leave unchanged all other regions of the standard EPPA based on GTAP4-E.

III-2. Transportation Sector Disaggregation

        A second change in this version of the model is the disaggregation of the

transportation sector. With transportation disaggregated, there are nine output sectors

for each of the 22 regions in EPPA-EU, as shown in the left-hand column of Table 2.

The EPPA model also includes future or “backstop” sources of fuels and electricity,

but they do not play a significant role in this analysis which looks only out to 2010.

Eight of the production sectors follow the standard EPPA definitions. The GTAP

database does not include a separate transportation sector within industry, nor does it

contain a separate category for private automobile services in the household sector.

We followed the methodology developed by Babiker, et al. [1] for the United States to

 Though GTAP-5 Pre-release has all 9 of these countries broken out we chose to focus on
disaggregating only the 4 largest of these countries.

         The basic approach for the TRANS sectors is to use GTAP’s trade and

transport sector that combines transport with trade margins in combination with data

from Input-Output tables produced by the European statistical office (Eurostat). These

tables provide the data to disaggregate trade margins from transportation for each

European country. For the other regions in the model, we used the US input-output

coefficients from Babiker, et al. [1]. The TRANS industry supplies transportation

services (both passenger and freight) to other sectors and to households.




                                                                                                            11
       We have also made adjustments directly to the Household (H) sector to

represent own-supplied transportation services, primarily that provided by personal

automobiles. Households produce transportation services for their own consumption

using inputs from the Other Industry Products (OIND) and Refined Oil sectors.

Consumption expenditure of private households reported by Eurostat [20] and energy

statistics from the International Energy Agency ([27, [28] along with the coefficients

reported in Babiker, et al. [1] were used to separate the household purchases that are

part of household production of transportation from other household purchases.

       The new breakout yields a sector of own-supplied personal transportation

(private automobiles) separate from other household activities, and a separate

transportation sector in industry that supplies transport services to both industry (i.e.,

freight transportation and any passenger transportation purchased by business) and

households (purchased transportation service, mainly passenger transportation services

such as air and rail service). Services from private automobiles involve inputs from

OIND that include the automobile itself, repairs, insurance, parking, and vehicle fuel

from the REFOIL sector. The procedure involves allocating the total household use of

OIND and REFOIL between household transportation and other household uses.

III-3. Incorporating Labor Leisure Choice

      Critical to the investigation of the distortionary effect of taxation are the effects

of factor taxes on factor usage. We have adjusted the Social Accounting Matrices for

OECD regions in the database to account for the leisure component in the utility




                                                                                              12
function, to represent the labor-leisure tradeoff and thus the effect of taxes on labor

supply. The standard version of EPPA models labor as inelastically supplied. Based

on the literature (e.g., Goulder [22]; Fullerton and Metcalf [21]; and Bovenberg [12])

we have assumed a leisure-labor ratio of 0.25, and an uncompensated labor supply

elasticity of 0.25. We investigate the sensitivity of this latter assumption below.

III-4. Incorporating factor taxes and non-energy consumption taxes

       To correctly assess the economic impacts of climate change policy proposals,

it is important to have a good representation of the existing tax distortions. In

particular, incorporating taxes will be important to consider the interaction between

environmental policy and pre-existing tax distortions. Adding taxes to the dataset

used to calibrate a CGE model for any particular country is not particularly difficult.

What is more challenging is to construct a methodology that is consistent across

countries and relies on readily available data. Mendoza, et al. [33] sets out a method

by which effective tax rates on labor and capital income as well as consumption can be

calculated from National Accounts data from OECD for different countries. By using

OECD data, the constructed rates are consistent across countries and time and are

amenable for inclusion in the GTAP data base, which is particularly poor in its

representation of existing consumption and factor taxes. We follow this approach in

our work. The detail of this methodology is explained in the appendix and the

computed tax rates for a number of developed countries are reported in Table 4 for the

year 1995.

Consumption taxes, reported here inclusive of energy taxes, are high in Europe

relative to Japan and the United States. The United States does not rely on a Value

Added Tax as do the other countries and Japan's VAT is both a low tax VAT and

subject to a relatively narrow base. The countries included in Table 4 differ in their

relative taxation of capital and labor. It has long been argued that the double taxation

of corporate capital income unfairly burdens capital income. The relative taxation of

capital and labor in the United States in Table 4 lends support to that argument.

       In terms of modeling, we have treated factor earnings from the GTAP database

as gross earnings. Accordingly, we use the factor taxes schedule in Table 4 to compute




                                                                                            14
the net factor flow services and maintain the income-expenditure balance in the

database by transferring the tax revenues to the consumer as lump sum. Also the

consumer expenditure on non-energy goods gross of tax has been adjusted to reflect

the tax in Table 4 and the income-expenditure balance is maintained as in the factor

tax case by lump sum transfer of the tax revenues to the consumer.

         As noted above factor payments in GTAP are gross (of tax) payments and so

overestimate the amount of capital and labor used in production. Once we break out

factor taxes, we obtain the same amount of output with fewer inputs. One implication

of the higher productivity of factors is that welfare in the reference scenarios was

initially higher in the EPPA model with taxes than in the model without taxes, but for

comparability purposes the model was rebenchmarked by lowering exogenous growth

in labor productivity so that growth in welfare was nearly identical (see Table 5).

Productivity growth in EPPA is essentially Harrod-neutral (i.e. labor-augmenting),7

and this exogenous growth factor is set to achieve exogenous GDP growth targets (e.g.

in the reference we approximately match IMF GDP growth projections as described in

Babiker et al. 2001). Without the rebenchmarking GDP growth is much more rapid

than other standard forecasts.




7
 The Autonomous Energy Efficiency Increase (AEEI) increases productivity and we separately
describe improvements in the fixed factor input to agriculture (i.e. land) that also contribute to
economy-wide growth but these factors contribute only a very small share to overall growth.

       for country codes. Labor and capital taxes were not introduced for non-OECD
       countries. Changes in welfare for these regions are small and due to trade effects
       resulting from the changes in OECD countries.



       The rebenchmarking of the model also assured that carbon emissions were not

appreciably changed in the reference scenario with taxes explicitly incorporated.

IV.    Kyoto Policy in a World With Tax Distortions

       At the Third Conference of the Parties (COP-3) to the United Nations

Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Kyoto, Annex B8

Parties committed to reducing, either individually or jointly, their total emissions of




                                                                                            16
six greenhouse gases (GHGs) by at least 5 percent within the period 2008 to 2012,

relative to these gases’ 1990 levels.

           The European Union (EU) is a full Party to the UNFCCC and a signatory of

the Kyoto Protocol, has accepted a quantitative absolute reduction of 8 percent from

1990 levels of its GHG emissions. Article 4 of the Protocol allows the EU to allocate

its target among the Member States. A political agreement on that redistribution was

reached at the environmental Council meeting in June 1998, and is referred to as the

“Burden Sharing” Agreement (BSA). Table 6 shows the BSA adopted at the

environmental Council meeting by Member States on June 1998. The sharing scheme

specifies emissions targets for each member country with the objective to reflect

opportunities and constraints that vary from one country to another, and to share

“equitably” the economic burden of climate protection.

           The BSA was meant to equitably allocate the burden of the EU-wide cap

among member countries. The wide difference in reduction targets for different

countries reflects, to a large degree, the very different experiences of EU countries

between 1990 and 1995 (the Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997), with the UK and

Germany exhibiting large declines in emissions. In the UK this was due to a

significant conversion to natural gas in electric power production because of the newly

available off-shore gas resources. In Germany, this was due to reunification and the

resultant shut-down of inefficient industrial plants in the former East Germany.

8
    Annex B refers to the group of developed countries comprising of OECD (as defined in 1990), Russia




                                                                                                         17
Differential expected growth and relative income levels was also a factor. As we

show below and as has been explored in greater detail elsewhere (Viguier, et al., 2001)

even with this differentiation the cost burden varies across EU member states.

         We next report results from the EPPA model of caps on carbon emissions in

Annex B to achieve the carbon reductions set forth in the Kyoto Protocol, including

the United States. We model the policy by implementing carbon permits sold by each

national government with revenues from permit sales recycled to the country's

representative agent through a lump-sum rebate within each country.9 Below, we

consider alternative revenue recycling policies. We consider carbon emissions from


and the East European Associates.
9
  This is equivalent to each country implementing a carbon tax (rebated lump-sum) at a level sufficient
to achieve the reductions required under Kyoto.




                                                                                                          18
energy only, ignoring forest sinks for carbon and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) and

in all cases here we assume that the caps are met domestically without emissions

trading among countries. These assumptions require fairly sizable reductions in

emissions from reference so the welfare effects are evident. This differs considerably

from all that is included in the Protocol but serves as a convenient scenario against

which to evaluate the double dividend issue.10 Table 7 reports changes in welfare

relative to reference scenarios.

   As finally negotiated in Marrakech with the US not participating, allowances for extra forest sinks for
carbon, other GHG abatement potential, and with full emissions trading among the countries that
remained parties to the Protocol, it turns out that the Kyoto cap is only marginally binding. Excess
allocation of permits to Russia, Ukraine, and other transition countries in Europe (i.e. an allocation
beyond their projected emissions) means that virtually no actual reductions in any country are required
if these credits can be applied in other countries as allowed under the Protocol (Babiker, et al. [4]).
While that result is an important policy conclusion in itself, it means the permit price is near zero, there
is little possibility for revenue generation, negligible welfare effects of the policy, and little scope for
revenue recycling making it an uninteresting case for the questions we consider here. Many European
countries may choose to meet their targets mainly through domestic action as the EC originally objected
to full emissions trading and nothing in the Protocol requires that they use international credits to the
full extent they are available.

       This table reports percentage changes in EV relative to the reference scenarios (either
       with or without taxes). Labor and capital taxes were not introduced for non-OECD
       countries. Changes in welfare for these regions are small and due to trade effects
       resulting from the changes in OECD countries.



Given the improvement in welfare in the reference we observed before

rebenchmarking, we thought it possible that simply including the tax wedges might

change the costs of meeting a target. We hypothesized that resource substitutions

might be less costly, thus making it easier for firms to shift out of carbon intensive

production in response to Kyoto. In other words, fewer resources would need to be




                                                                                                 20
shifted across sectors for a given reduction in carbon use.11 As can be seen from Table

7, there was little difference in the cost of Kyoto when simulated using the standard

EPPA version and the tax version of EPPA. For the most part, the remaining

differences appear due to the fact that even after rebenchmarking there remained some

minor differences between the two reference scenarios. The inclusion of fuel taxes did

not by itself change estimates of the cost of Kyoto policy when the carbon revenues

are recycled in a lump sum manner, nor do the differences in tax rates for capital,

labor, and consumption taxes appear to explain differences in estimates of the costs

among countries. The standard version of EPPA includes distorting energy taxes and,

elsewhere, it has been shown that the presence or absence of energy taxes does affect

the cost of Kyoto substantially (Babiker, et al. [8]).

        We next report on simulations in which carbon permits are used to achieve

Kyoto with tax recycling of the proceeds a possibility, here focusing on only the tax

version of EPPA where the results across scenarios are strictly comparable. We

consider four possible uses of carbon tax revenues as described in Table 8.

                           Table 8. Tax Recycling Scenarios

                    All scenarios impose caps on carbon emissions to achieve
                    Kyoto reductions. Caps are achieved through permits sold by
                    the national governments.


11
  Without rebenchmarking the results would have been convoluted with the fact that the required
reductions would have been larger in the tax version of EPPA.

The first scenario returns carbon permit revenues to the representative agent in a lump

sum fashion. The other three scenarios use proceeds to lower some distorting tax (or

set of taxes). Table 9 reports the change in welfare in 2010 relative to the reference

scenario for the various proposals. We report here only the impacts for those countries

with binding commitments under the Kyoto Protocol as originally signed.12

         Not surprisingly, carbon reductions to achieve Kyoto with lump sum recycling

reduce welfare relative to the reference scenario. Welfare losses range from a low of

0.6 percent in the United States and Japan to over 4 percent for the Netherlands. The

Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden suffer large losses because 1) they agreed to large

cuts in emissions as part of the European burden sharing agreement by which the EC

intends to meet its target under the Kyoto accord and 2) emissions growth in those

countries since 1990 has been more rapid than in other European countries.13

        The next three columns provide results for various tax reductions. In no case

does welfare rise relative to the reference scenario. In other words, a strong double

dividend is not possible in any of the EU countries or the United States and Japan as a

result of a carbon tax to achieve Kyoto. The use of carbon taxes to reduce labor taxes

does give rise to a weak double dividend. Welfare losses under the LRP scenario are

always lower than under the NRP scenario.

        Interestingly, the weak double dividend does not hold in all cases when carbon

tax revenues are used to lower non-energy consumption taxes (CRP). France, the

Netherlands, and Spain are all better off with lump-sum recycling of the carbon permit

revenues than if the alternative is to reduce non-energy consumption taxes. The

failure of the weak double dividend to hold simply reflects the existence of distorting

energy consumption taxes that have not been reduced in this policy experiment.

Intercommodity distortions are increased by a selective reduction in consumption

taxation; second best considerations mean that the weak double dividend is not a

universal phenomenon.




that is not the focus of the analysis presented here.
13
   Sweden actually was allowed a four percent growth in emissions for 2010 relative to 1990. Its
emissions in the reference scenario grow by 44 percent however. Germany and the UK agreed to very
large cuts in emissions from 1990 (i.e.~20%) but there emissions fell by large amounts between 1990
and 1995 so that these cuts do not involve as large a cut from their projected reference emissions in
2010.




                                                                                                        23
       We next turn to the question of whether a strong double dividend is possible by

varying the labor supply elasticity. Increasing factor supply elasticities will increase

the distortions from pre-existing taxes and so increase the probability of a strong

double dividend. Table 10 reports welfare changes in 2010 relative to the reference

scenario for differing labor supply elasticities.

                             relative to the reference scenario.

       We draw a couple of conclusions from this analysis. First, an increase of the

labor supply elasticity to 0.5 is insufficient to achieve a strong double dividend under

the Kyoto Protocol. Moreover, an increase to 1.0 is required before we begin to see a

possible strong double dividend. Such an estimate of the labor supply elasticity is so

far out of the bounds of reasonable estimates as to preclude the existence of a strong

double dividend. Second, Table 10 illustrates sharp welfare differences between the

United States and many EU countries. This illustrates the important point that policy




                                                                                           24
conclusions drawn from studies of the United States may not be transferable to EU

countries (and vice versa). 14

V.       Conclusion

         We began with the observation that the weak double dividend does not hold

unambiguously. Relative tax distortions play an important role in this result. Revenue

recycling through a tax cut can be welfare worsening relative to lump-sum recycling if

the tax cut increases the relative distortion among goods. This suggests that a careful

assessment of just which distortions to reduce is necessary or one can do worse than

lump sum recycling.15 While this result is of theoretical interest, it turns out also to be

of important practical interest. As the results from the EPPA model demonstrate, the

weak double dividend is unlikely to hold for a number of European countries when

policies are considered to reduce carbon emissions. This result can be traced to the

high existing energy taxes in most European countries. Placing a carbon constraint on

top of existing fuel taxes raises the effective tax on fuels still further and then

redistributing the revenue by reducing existing taxes on labor further worsens the

relative distortions between energy and labor. The result is that the interplay between

carbon policies and pre-existing taxes can differ markedly across countries, depending

greatly on the existing levels of different distortionary taxes that exist in an economy.


14
   This point is reinforced by another scenario in which we fix the labor supply elasticity at 0.25 and
measure the marginal welfare cost of carbon abatement for various levels of reductions. Results
reported in Babiker, et al. [5] show very different marginal welfare losses across countries.
15
   The EPPA model taxes capital uniformly across sectors. If the model allowed for differential
taxation across sectors, additional opportunities for violations of the weak double dividend would
present themselves. We thank a referee for pointing this out.




                                                                                                          25
       Much of the empirical evidence on the double-dividend has been drawn from

the US where energy taxes are very low compared to most other developed countries.

Conclusions drawn from empirical analysis of the US are, therefore, particularly

unlikely to apply elsewhere. In fact, globally, energy markets are some of the most

heavily distorted markets. Many developed countries heavily tax consumption of fuels

whereas prices on fuels are often subsidized in developing countries as a means of

making energy affordable to consumers. As both energy taxes and carbon constraints

are directly affecting fuel use, it is perhaps not surprising that correctly representing

distortions in these markets is essential to correctly evaluating the economic impacts

of climate policy. One must be cautious in extrapolating the results from a country

specific analysis to other countries, and one must accurately representing existing

distortions in energy markets to accurately estimate the economic impacts of climate

and fiscal policy.

                         Appendix: Modeling Taxes in EPPA

        The basic methodology is quite simple and we illustrate it for consumption

taxes16. If p is the consumer price for a good and q the producer price, then p and q

are linked by the relation

(A1)                                      p=q+t

where t is a unit tax on the consumption good. We can re-express the unit tax as a tax

exclusive ad valorem tax (τ):

(A2)                                         τ = t/q

We'd like to calculate τ using observable data and so Mendoza et al. suggest the

following:

                                             pC − qC
(A3)                                    τ=           ,
                                               qC

where C represents aggregate consumption. The tax rate is the difference between the

value of consumption in consumer prices and its value in producer prices divided by

the latter. In other words, it is the tax revenue divided by the tax base (producer

receipts).

        For this consumption tax measure to be comprehensive, we need to capture

both general and specific taxes. The tax on consumption (τc) is the sum of general

(TG) and specific (TS) taxes divided by private consumption (C) and government

consumption (G) after subtracting consumption taxes paid by consumers and




                                                                                         27
government and also subtracting compensation of government workers (GW) which is

included in G. Thus the tax rate on consumption is given by

(A4)                                 τc =

For OECD countries, collecting the required tax data is relatively straightforward as it

is published annually in their Revenue Statistics series. The other required data are

published for OECD countries in the National Accounts series. Obviously, OECD

data can not be relied on for the 65 regions contained in the GTAP data base. United

Nations National Accounts data can substitute for the OECD National Accounts. A

challenge for GTAP will be to assemble the tax data across countries beyond the

OECD countries. We hope to show below that the effort will have substantial payoff.

Even if it is not possible to extend the tax data beyond OECD countries, it would be

useful to offer an OECD module with taxes broken out.

         The tax on labor income (τL) requires an estimate of the individual income tax

on wages. Since this is not broken out in the tax data set, Mendoza et al. begin by

calculating the average tax on household income (τh). This is individual income tax

collections (TP) divided by wage (W) and capital income (KP) subject to the individual

income tax:

                                                       TP
(A5)                                          τh =
                                                     W + KP


16
   Mendoza et al. note that Razin and Sadka [35] develop these tax rates from specific tax rates faced
by a representative agent in a general equilibrium model.




                                                                                                         28
They then assume that the marginal tax rate on all sources of income is the same. This

is clearly a restrictive assumption but it is not clear a priori what sort of bias this

imparts to the labor income tax rate. The tax on labor income is then the sum of taxes

on wage income plus payroll taxes (PT) divided by total compensation (including the

employer contribution for Social Security (SSE)):

                                                   τ hW + PT
(A6)                                        τL =                .
                                                    W + SS E

         Finally, the tax on capital income (τk) is corporate and non-corporate tax

payments divided by total surplus.17 All capital income distributed to individuals (KD)

is assumed taxed at rate τh. In addition, corporate tax payments (TC), as well as taxes

on real property and financial transactions (TPF) must be included in the numerator of

the tax rate expression. The base is total operating surplus in the economy (OS):

                                                τ h K D + TC + TPF
(A7)                                     τk =                        .
                                                       OS

         Mendoza et al. compare their estimates of tax rates to aggregate marginal tax

rates as constructed by Joines [31], Seater [37], and Barro and Sahasakul [10] and find

that the levels are different but that they move similarly over time. The MRT

estimates are close to those of Joines, lower than Barro-Sahasakul and higher than

Seater's. Table 4 in the main text reports our calculations of tax rates for a number of

OECD countries for 1995.

    This tax rate assumes a constant returns to scale aggregate production function and thus the absence
of economic rents.
