                                      ABSTRACT


       Confederate monetary reforms encouraged holders of Treasury notes to exchange these notes
for bonds by imposing deadlines on their convertibility. We show that Confederate funding acts
aimed at precipitating the conversion of currency into bonds did temporarily suppress currency
depreciation. These acts also triggered upsurges in commodity prices, however, as note holders
rushed to spend the currency before their exchange rights were reduced. Asset price stabilization
policies seem to have increased the velocity of circulation and counterproductively channeled
inflationary pressures into other areas of the economy.

             Suppressing Asset Price Inflation: The Confederate Experience, 1861-1865


        The absorption of Treasury notes by the funding process is progressing favorably, and will
        counteract the tendency to a further depreciation of our currency arising from the heavy
        issues since the 1st of January last.

                                 (Richmond Dispatch, April 15, 1863)


        During the Civil War commodity prices rose in the Confederacy while the gold value of

Confederate currency and bonds declined. The rate of asset price inflation lagged behind commodity price

inflation, however, and there was a greater than 2:1 divergence at the time of two Confederate financial

reforms aimed at encouraging exchanges of currency into bonds. These exchanges raised the demand for

bonds and boosted bond prices while also supporting the gold value of the currency as the supply of money

was reduced. But the period between the announcement and implementation of these reforms saw upward

surges in commodity prices with no matching depreciation in the value of the currency against gold. This

suggests that the reforms may have channeled inflationary pressures into commodity markets and that an

examination of both asset and commodity markets is needed in order to assess the effectiveness of

Confederate monetary policy. Just as Bernanke and Gertler (1999) criticize the Bank of Japan for focusing

on asset price inflation at the expense of the general price level in the 1989-1997 period so too may

Confederate monetary policy have been directed too much towards stabilizing asset markets with less

favorable consequences for the prices of other goods and services.

        The bursts of commodity price inflation after the reforms were announced suggest that individuals

exchanged money for goods as well as for bonds in the run up to the deadline. A real balance effect seems

to have operated whereby decreased demand for the old money created excess cash balances that were

translated at least in part into an excess demand for goods. Even after the financial reforms reduced the

total money supply, the initial surges in commodity price inflation were never fully reversed. There was,

in fact, a boost to wealth holdings when the reforms took effect insofar as the stocks of money being retired



                                                     1
were exchanged for bonds at par -- even though these bonds were then trading at a premium. In this way

consumption expenditures may well have been fueled by the gains on the bonds when the exchange

occurred. Despite the questions concerning the relative weights that should be attached to bond holdings

and money balances as components of private sector net financial assets (see, for example, Patinkin, 1965,

pp. 289-290), the changes in the level and market value of bond holdings surely cannot be ignored in the

Confederate case. This is especially so given the existence of a ready market for the bonds received with

no restrictions on reselling.

        From the outset, Confederate currency and bond markets were linked by the fact that note holders

enjoyed an imbedded call option on Confederate government bonds. Non-interest-bearing Confederate

Treasury notes were issued with the proviso that holders could, at their pleasure, exchange these notes for

8% government bonds at par. This call option would naturally become increasingly valuable if the bonds

rose above par and implied that noteholders would be able to participate fully in any bond market rally

even while keeping their funds in the form of highly liquid currency. The 8% bonds issued under the 1861

$100 million loan (authorized by the Act of August 19, 1861 with a minimum denomination of $100)

generally traded at or below par during 1862, however. And, with no deadline for the exercise of the

option, there was no incentive for holders of Confederate Treasury notes to actually convert their money

into bonds at that time. In an attempt to induce -- and ultimately force -- early conversion of money into

bonds the government instituted three funding acts that limited the time period over which Treasury notes

could be exchanged for the higher yielding 8% bonds. After the deadline, these notes could only be

exchanged for lower yielding bonds -- or in some cases would no longer be convertible at all.

        As the funding acts were imposed, Confederate bonds finally rose above par. And significant

volumes of Treasury notes were exchanged for bonds prior to the deadlines imposed by the respective acts.

At least by the beginning of 1863, Confederate Secretary Memminger (1863a, pp. 442-45) was clearly

concerned that the initial voluntary exchanges of money for bonds would be insufficient to curb



                                                     2
inflationary pressures, however, and urged much more draconian steps -- some of which were eventually

adopted under the March 23, 1863 Act:

        Prices will reach the height adjusted by the scale of issues, and they can only be restored
        to their usual condition by a return to the normal standard of currency. In other words, the
        only remedy for an inflated currency is a reduction of the circulating medium ... I would
        respectfully propose that ... the issues of treasury notes bearing date prior to the 1st
        December, 1862 shall cease to be currency ... Hitherto the policy of the government has
        sought to absorb the circulation by inducements alone ... It is proposed now to supply the
        deficiency by a small portion of constraint. We see on every side of us indications of the
        abundance of money ...

        In this paper we assess the overall consequences of the Confederate funding acts for asset prices

and commodity prices. We combine newly-collected weekly data on Confederate bond prices with a

weekly series on the gold value of Confederate currency also collected from primary newspaper sources

(see Burdekin and Weidenmier, 2001, and Weidenmier, 2002).1 We compare our data on currency

depreciation with available monthly data on commodity prices in Richmond (Berry, 1985) and the eastern

Confederacy (Lerner, 1955). We show that significant reductions in the rate of currency depreciation

followed the implementation of two of the three reforms but also illustrate the surge in commodity prices

that occurs between the announcement and implementation dates. An acceleration in commodity prices

relative to the gold price of Confederate currency is evident not only for the later February 17, 1864 Act -

- that essentially repudiated nearly one-third of the Confederate money stock -- but also for the earlier

October 1862 Act that merely imposed a deadline for exchanging Treasury notes into higher yielding

bonds. Econometric analysis of the weekly data confirms that there was a significant increase in gold

values when the reforms were implemented. Only the March 1863 Act did not match this pattern. This

exception may be partly due to the much smaller quantity of notes actually exchanged for bonds as well as

the fact that the effective date of August 1, 1863 occurred in the aftermath of the Battle of Gettysburg

fought in July 1863.




                                                      3
I.     The Evolution of Confederate Interest Rate Policy

       The first funding act was passed on October 13, 1862. Notes issued prior to December 1,

1862 could only be exchanged for 8% bonds until a deadline eventually set at April 22, 1863.

Thereafter these notes, together with all subsequent notes issued after December 1, 1862, would

be exchangeable only for 7% bonds.2 The effects of this Act on the demand for money appeared

to be well-anticipated by Confederate Treasury Secretary Memminger in his letter of October 6,

1862 to President Davis:

       If after a certain date no 8 per cent bonds be issued, except to fulfill existing
       contracts, it is obvious that the currency now in circulation would have an
       advantage over that afterwards issued, and the effect would be a general effort on
       the part of moneyed men to get possession of ... those notes that were fundable in
       bonds at the higher rate of interest.3

As the 8% funding deadline approached, the older notes still convertible into 8% bonds prior to

April 22 did indeed rise to a premium against the newer notes that were exchangeable only into

7% bonds. The Richmond Dispatch (April 15, 1863) states that these older notes were “in

demand” and trading at a more than 2% premium. The day before the deadline the old notes

were still being offered at a 1% premium to the new notes but, with their exchangeability into 8%

bonds about to end, “most of the brokers declined to buy” (Richmond Dispatch, April 22, 1863).

This implies not only that holders attached significant value to the right to exchange notes for

8% bonds rather than 7% bonds but also that the right to exchange Treasury notes for bonds at

par was still viewed as a valuable option in the spring of 1863.

       After the act took effect, the impact on commodity prices was noted by the Richmond

Dispatch (April 16, 1863):




                                                 4
       During the past few days, a downward tendency in the prices of nearly all articles
       of merchandise has been developed–the chief cause of which, as heretofore stated,
       is the reduction of the amount of currency by the rapid funding of Treasury notes.

The gold value of the currency also rose in late April 1863. The Richmond Dispatch (April 29,

1863) noted that the “rate of premium for specie has undergone a decided decline since our last

report.” At the same time, the value of the 8% bonds in terms of Confederate currency rose

substantially and during the second half of April 1863 these bonds climbed to a 10% premium

(see Data Appendix). The period between the announcement of the funding act in October 1862

and its implementation in April 1863 was marked by a burst of commodity price inflation,

however. The growth of commodity prices -- as measured both by the Lerner and Berry price

indices -- over and above our currency price index for the price of a gold dollar in terms of

Confederate Treasury notes can be seen in Figure 1. The Lerner and Berry indices each more

than doubled between October 1862 and April 1863. The ratios of these two commodity price

indices to the currency index also rose sharply after November 1862, and there is a greater than

2:1 differential during April 1863 – see Figure 2 and the Data Appendix. Both ratios later briefly

went back to just above 1:1 in August 1863 prior to embarking on a renewed upward trends.4

The disparate reactions of currency and commodity prices to the first funding act suggests that

inflationary pressures were heavily channeled into commodity prices and offers support for

Lerner’s (1954, p. 516) argument that the Confederate funding acts boosted the velocity of

circulation as note holders sought to unload their notes before their exchange rights were reduced

under the terms of the funding acts. As noted earlier, this is also consistent with the direct link

between money and spending implied by the real balance effect.




                                                  5
       In the face of rapid issuance of new notes needed to fund the Confederacy’s military

efforts in 1863, a second funding act was passed even before the first act had taken effect. Under

the Funding Act of March 23, 1863 the right to exchange Treasury notes for even 7% bonds was

to end on August 1, 1863. After that date, notes issued prior to December 1, 1862 would not be

fundable in bonds at all while notes issued after December 1, 1862 would be fundable only in 4%

30-year bonds. The imposition of this new funding deadline again reportedly had a significant

impact on Confederate money markets. The Richmond Dispatch (August 4, 1863) states:

       As the time within which the old issues of Treasury notes were fundable has
       expired, they have been refused since 1st August by a number of persons who
       continued to receive them up to that date. Fortunately there are not many afloat
       here, and persons holding them need not fear any loss, as the Confederate tax
       collectors will soon afford the means for retiring them from circulation. Let
       everybody pay taxes in the old notes, and get them out of the way.

       Todd (1954, p. 72) estimates, however, that the second funding act withdrew only $21

million in Treasury notes from circulation in exchange for bonds.5 The total for the first act was

much higher with Todd (1954, p. 67) stating that more than $163 million in notes were

withdrawn form circulation.6 Godfrey (1978, p. 120) summarizes the overall impact of the first

two acts as follows:

       Prior to the funding, nearly every dollar of currency issued by the Confederate
       government added a dollar to currency in circulation and thereby, to the money
       stock. However, funding reduced the volume of Confederate currency in
       circulation. Between mid-February 1862 and January 1863, the Confederate
       Treasury issued $389 million in currency, and the volume in circulation rose
       slightly over 90 percent of this amount. This contrasts with the following nine
       months when Treasury notes issued rose $415 million, but notes in circulation
       were up only $245 million. Notes in circulation increased only about 60 percent
       of the notes issued. . . Of course, the volume of Treasury notes removed from
       circulation by funding accounts for the difference. . . The Confederate Treasury
       issued more notes in the latter period but increased the money supply less because
       a significant amount of the notes were converted into long-term bonds.


                                                6
       Notwithstanding the effects of the funding acts, the overall supply of non-interest-bearing

notes in circulation still expanded from $289 million at the beginning of 1863 to more than $720

million by January 1, 1864. The premium on the 8% bonds in terms of Confederate currency

rose mildly to around 15% at the end of 1863. But the gold premium began to soar in late 1863,

reaching 20:1 in Richmond on January 2, 1864 (Burdekin and Weidenmier, 2001). As a last

resort, the Confederate government passed the February 17, 1864 Act that mandated that most

Confederate Treasury notes then outstanding be exchanged for 4% bonds by April 1, 1864 or else

face a 33 1/3 % “tax.” (The deadline was extended to July 1, 1864 west of the Mississippi.) The

premium on the 8% bonds east of the Mississippi was driven up to 25% after this Act was passed

and the gold value of Treasury notes also rose. In contrast to previous measures whereby the

funding of notes for bonds had quickly been more than offset by issues of new notes, the 1864

Act produced an overnight near-one-third shrinkage in the Confederate money supply east of the

Mississippi in April 1864.

       As with the first act, however, there was a surge in commodity prices in the period

between the announcement of this new act in February 1864 and its implementation in April

1864. Indeed, even though the gold price of Confederate currency increased by only 2% over this

period, Lerner’s index increased by over 51% and Berry’s index increased by over 43%. For

Lerner’s index, the ratio of commodity prices to currency prices increased from 1.31 in February

1864 to 1.94 in April 1864 before peaking at 2.54 in May. In terms of Berry’s index, the ratio

accelerated from 1.61 in February to 2.26 in April before, again, peaking in May. Although each

of the commodity and currency indices then fell until at least August 1864 – with the decline



                                                7
continuing until October 1864 in the case of Lerner’s index – only the currency index ever

dropped below its February 1864 level. As far as commodity prices are concerned, it appears

that the subsequent deflationary effects of the reduced money stock never entirely offset the

initial inflationary effects of increased velocity of circulation. And the Confederacy’s success in

effectively supporting the gold value of Confederate assets came at the expense of initially

channeling strong inflationary pressures into the commodity markets.

       The gold premium itself remained below the February 1864 level until September 1864

and did not rise significantly until November 1864, by which time expanding new issues of

Confederate Treasury notes reversed the temporary decline in the money supply effected by the

February 1864 Act. Memminger’s replacement as Treasury Secretary, Trenholm (1864, p. 6)

accurately summarized the bleak situation near the end of the war: “Unless a uniform and stable

value can be given to the treasury notes, the effort to carry on the war through their

instrumentality, must of necessity be abandoned.” Thereafter even direct government

intervention in the gold market in early 1865 could not arrest the accelerating rate of currency

depreciation that continued until Confederate currency was rendered essentially worthless with

the surrenders of General Lee and General Johnston in April 1865.



II.    Quantifying the Effects of the Funding Acts on Confederate Asset Prices

       We identify a consistent relationship between the gold price of Confederate currency and

the gold price of Confederate bonds.7 Using new weekly data on bond prices collected from

contemporary Richmond, Wilmington and Mobile newspapers we first show in Figure 3 the

rising trend of the gold yields on Confederate bonds. As with Davis and Pequet (1990) – whose


                                                  8
analysis focused only on monthly bond data – these are yields to maturity calculated based on an

1881 end-date.8 Figure 4 plots the gold price of the 1861 $100 million dollar loan and the gold

price of Confederate currency between January 1862 and January 1865.9 The two series appear

to move together both in the pre-May 1864 period and also over the remaining July 1864-January

1865 period for which data on both series exist. Empirical testing can only be employed over the

January 1862-April 1864 portion of the sample, however, owing to the lack of bond price quotes

during May and June 1864. In the face of the vast bond issues required once the February 17,

1864 took effect in the eastern Confederacy on April 1, 1864, regular bond quotes temporarily

disappear in the Richmond newspapers (and those of other major Southern cities) until July

1864.

        Consistent with the near-perfect correlation evident in Figure 4, Johansen maximum

likelihood tests show the gold price of the bonds and the gold price of Confederate currency to be

cointegrated between January 1862 and March 1864 (see Table 1). The existence of a one-to-one

relationship between bond prices and currency prices can be rejected at better than the 99%

confidence level, however.10 Thus, at least up until March 1864, holders apparently did not view

money and bonds as perfect substitutes – implying also that they were not yet convinced that all

the bonds would be monetized eventually. Based on the long-run equilibrium relationship

uncovered by the cointegration testing, we then estimate error-correction equations for the

change in the gold value of the bonds and the change in the gold price of Confederate currency.

Lagged values of the changes in these two variables are entered on the right-hand-side of each

equation together with a constant and the error-correction term. We initially add a dummy

variable for each of the three funding acts, a war dummy for Northen victories (defined as +1 for


                                                9
a major Union victory and zero otherwise) and a war dummy for Southern victories (defined as

+1 for a major Confederate victory and zero otherwise).11 A list of the battles is provided in

Table 2 (see also Weidenmier, 2002). The dummies for the funding acts are set equal to +1 for

the week leading up to the funding deadline that was imposed and zero otherwise.12 The

expected sign on the Northern dummy is negative but the expected sign on each other dummy

variable is positive as the funding acts and favorable war news should all raise the gold value of

Confederate financial instruments, ceteris paribus. We also re-ran the regression with each of

the battles entered individually so as to avoid imposing the restriction that each Northern or

Southern victory had an equal-sized effect.

       Table 3 sets out the reaction of money and bond price changes to the deviations from

long-run equilibrium represented by the error-correction term, the reform dummies and the

grouped Northern and Southern victories (labeled “North” and “South”, respectively). Although

the money price response is insignificant, the bond price response is significant at the 5% level.

The relatively large coefficient of -0.755 on the error-correction term implies rapid bond market

adjustment back towards the long-run equilibrium -- with just over three-quarters of the

adjustment completed within one week. Money and bond prices also respond significantly to the

funding acts and to war news. There is a large shift in gold values at the time of the first funding

act that took effect in April 1863. The results suggest that there was an approximate 12% boost

to the gold value of Confederate 8% bonds at that time and a 9.5% boost to the gold value of

Confederate Treasury notes. These coefficients are similar in size to those associated with the

Northern war dummy, which like the first reform dummy is significant at the 5% level or better

in both the bond equation and the currency equation. The insignificance of the Southern war


                                                 10
dummy, meanwhile, implies that (contrary to McCandless, 1996) the effects of war news were

asymmetric – perhaps because, in the absence of a decisive victory on Northern soil, the given

Confederate victories were not seen as hastening a favorable end to the conflict. The 1864

Currency Reform also has the expected positive sign but is significant only at the 10% level in

the bond and money equations. The indicated effects remain surprisingly strong, however, given

that the 1864 reform takes effect only in the last month of the sample period, making any such

shift hard to detect econometrically.13

       Re-running the regression with the 12 battles entered individually generally has little

effect on either the size or significance of the coefficients associated with the reform dummies.

The third reform dummy does now, however, fall just below the 10% significance level in the

money equation. The implied adjustment speed decreases slightly as the coefficient on the error-

correction term declines from -0.755 to -0.666. But this still implies that approximately two-

thirds of the adjustment takes place within the first week. The results for the battle dummies

themselves confirm the earlier inference that there is no positive impact of Confederate victories.

None of the dummies for the Seven Days Battles around Richmond, Second Manassas,

Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville or Chickamauga is significant at even the 10% level.14

Meanwhile, among the Northern victories, Gettysburg/Vicksburg and Sharpsburg (Antietam)

produce large negative effects that are in each case significant at the 1% level. The strong effects

apparently associated with these two battles are consistent with them typically being considered

to form major turning points in the Civil War (see also Weidenmier, 2002).




                                                11
       We have not so far discussed the dummy for the second reform act, which took effect on

August 1, 1863, however. This dummy is itself significant either at the 10% level -- or, in one

case, at the 5% level -- in the bond and money equations in Tables 3 and 4, but has the wrong

(negative) sign. We believe that the explanation for the seemingly-perverse effects

accompanying the implementation of the second funding act lies not only in the relatively small

number of notes actually exchanged for bonds but also in its coming on the heels of news of

Confederate defeat at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Although our war dummies capture

the immediate impact of news of this defeat, more persistent negative effects on Confederate

financial instruments held abroad are demonstrated by Brown and Burdekin (2000) and

Weidenmier (2000). Whereas Confederate cotton bonds traded in London and Confederate

bonds traded in Amsterdam begin a months’ long plunge of over 30% after Gettysburg, the gold

values of domestic Confederate bonds and Confederate currency actually remain quite stable

between August and November 1863. The Confederate bonds held abroad were not subject in

any way to the provisions of the funding acts. Therefore their extended decline in value in the

latter half of 1863 may offer a rough counterfactual of what would have happened to the gold

value of domestically-held Confederate currency and bonds in the absence of the funding acts. In

other words, the second funding act may still have at least blunted the depreciation in the gold

value of domestically-held Confederate financial instruments that followed the Battle of

Gettysburg.

       Support for this view arises from the price movements for sterling bills of exchange

during 1863. These bills represented exchanges of Confederate currency for the future delivery

of pounds sterling – usually 60 days after the bill was drawn up. The premium for sterling in


                                                12
terms of Confederate currency rose with the expected rate of Confederate currency depreciation.

Table 5 reports all available quotes for 60-day sterling drafts that could be located in the National

Archives. A continued uptrend in the sterling premium is evident in the data for 1861 and 1862.

After reaching 200 on December 30, 1862 the premium increases only slightly to 230 on April 6,

1863. But the next quotation from July 22, 1863 shows a near doubling of the premium. This

greatly increased premium occurs in the aftermath of the Battle of Gettysburg and appears to be

consistent with the quite devastating declines evident in Confederate bonds that were traded

abroad. We can only conclude that the estimated coefficient on the dummy for the second

funding act conflates positive effects of the second funding act on domestically-held bonds with

the continued negative effects of the Gettysburg defeat evident in other Confederate financial

instruments.



III.   Conclusions

       By imposing deadlines on convertibility into higher yielding bonds the government was

able to induce substantial exchanges of money for bonds. We present evidence that at least two

out of the three Confederate funding acts were effective in temporarily suppressing the rate of

currency depreciation. These acts also triggered upsurges in commodity prices, however, as note

holders rushed to spend the currency before their exchange rights were reduced. The widening

gap between commodity and asset prices following the passage of the first and third acts is

consistent with the rising velocity of circulation noted by Lerner (1954). Confederate asset price

stabilization policies seem, therefore, to have initially channeled inflationary pressures into other

areas of the economy -- with decreased money demand being translated, at least in part, into an


                                                 13
excess demand for goods. The declining prices after the acts took effect must therefore be set

against the preceding sharp run-up in prices after the monetary reforms were announced.

1.   Past research has been hampered by the lack of a reliable series on the gold value of

     Confederate currency with, for example, McCandless (1996) relying upon a newspaper

     column of unknown origin that differs significantly from actual trades reported in

     contemporary Richmond papers.

2.   As Congress had neglected to provide the Secretary of the Treasury with the authority to

     issue the bonds called for under the October 13, 1862 Act, the first Act had to be

     supplemented with a further Act of February 20, 1863 so as to allow the new bonds to be

     issued (Todd (1954, p. 66).

3.   Quoted in Todd (1954, p. 66). Memminger (1863a), in his Treasury Report of January

     10, 1863, also pointed out that rapid depreciation of the notes in which the interest on the

     bonds was paid had been reducing the incentive to convert by lowering the real return:

     “Bonds at a high rate of interest have been offered; but the inducement has been abated

     by the depreciation of the currency in which the interest is paid” (see Capers, 1893, p.

     445).

4.   This closing of the gap may well reflect arbitrage between the relatively cheaper gold and

     the relatively more expensive commodities. At the very least, there is more to this picture

     than the effects of progressive supply shortages that, while potentially helping to account

     for a widening of the gap, could scarcely explain its subsequent closure.

5.   The new notes issued in 1863 were to be fundable in 6% bonds for the first year and

     thereafter would be fundable only in 4% bonds.




                                              15
6.    Although Memminger (1863b, p. 458) reported that only $65 million in Treasury notes

      were funded and cancelled between January 1, 1863 and September 30, 1863, Todd’s

      figures are based on Thian’s (1878) exhaustive analysis of the primary Treasury records.

7.    We do not attempt econometric analysis with the commodity price indices as the monthly

      data yields too limited a number of observations.

8.    Davis and Pecquet (1990) stress the importance of substitution between call certificates

      and bonds and point to the existence of an approximate 2% premium on the bonds over

      much of the 1862-1864 period. The role played by call certificates changed substantially

      when their free exchangeability for Treasury notes ended under the March 23, 1863 Act,

      however. As Todd (1954, pp. 70-71) points out: “All call certificates of every

      description, outstanding after July 1, 1863, were to be considered bonds ... [and] every

      certificate not reconverted within six months ... was to be exchanged for 6% 30-year

      bonds.”

9.    Although we have seen no references to these bonds actually circulating, they were

      nevertheless viewed as liquid financial instruments with active secondary markets (Davis

      and Pecquet, 1990).

10.   This finding holds even if we include the reform dummies in the cointegrating space in

      addition to their existing role as short-run shift factors.

11.   The rationale for adding these war dummies is that negative war news could signal

      greater expected future money growth and/or a higher probability that the bond issues

      would have to be entirely monetized in the future.




                                                 16
12.   The reform dummies are not defined for the earlier post-announcement period because

      there are no economic rationale for option holders to exercise the option prior to the

      expiry date (Copeland and Weston, 1988, pp. 253-255).

13.   The potency of the 1864 Act is, however, convincingly demonstrated by the contrasting

      experience of the eastern Confederacy vs. that of the Trans-Mississippi. The Act took

      effect three months later in the Trans-Mississippi and the temporary reversal of the

      depreciation of Confederate currency was also similarly delayed (see Burdekin and

      Weidenmier, 2001).

14.   In the case of Chancellorsville the dummy also likely captures word of General

      “Stonewall” Jackson’s death on May 11, 1863 from wounds received by friendly fire on

      the evening of May 2 -- thus conflating negative news with the favorable outcome of the

      battle itself.
