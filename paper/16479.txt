We contribute to the debate on the macroeconomic effects of fiscal stimuli by showing that the impact
of government expenditure shocks depends crucially on key country characteristics, such as the level
of development, exchange rate regime, openness to trade, and public indebtedness. Based on a novel
quarterly dataset of government expenditure in 44 countries, we find that (i) the output effect of an
increase in government consumption is larger in industrial than in developing countries, (ii) the fiscal
multiplier is relatively large in economies operating under predetermined exchange rates but is zero
in economies operating under flexible exchange rates; (iii) fiscal multipliers in open economies are
smaller than in closed economies; (iv) fiscal multipliers in high-debt countries are negative.

            We contribute to the debate on the macroeconomic e¤ects of scal stimuli by show-
         ing that the impact of government expenditure shocks depends crucially on key country
         characteristics, such as the level of development, exchange rate regime, openness to
         trade, and public indebtedness. Based on a novel quarterly dataset of government ex-
         penditure in 44 countries, we nd that (i) the output e¤ect of an increase in government
         consumption is larger in industrial than in developing countries, (ii) the scal multi-
         plier is relatively large in economies operating under predetermined exchange rates but
         is zero in economies operating under exible exchange rates; (iii) scal multipliers in
         open economies are smaller than in closed economies; (iv) scal multipliers in high-debt
         countries are negative.

       As scal stimulus packages were hastily put together around the world in early 2009,
one could not have been blamed for thinking that there must be some broad agreement

in the profession regarding the size of the scal multipliers. Far from it. In a January
2009 Wall Street Journal op-ed piece, Robert Barro argued that peacetime scal multipliers
were essentially zero. At the other extreme, Christina Romer, Chair of President Obamas
Council of Economic Advisers at the time, used multipliers as high as 1.6 in estimating the
job gains that would be generated by the $787 billion stimulus package approved by Congress
in February 2009. The di¤erence between Romers and Barros views of the world amounts
to a staggering 3.7 million jobs by the end of 2010. If anything, the uncertainty regarding
the size of scal multipliers in developing and emerging markets is even greater. Data are
more scarce and often of dubious quality. A history of scal proigacy and spotty debt
repayments calls into question the sustainability of any scal expansion.
   How does nancial fragility a¤ect the size of scal multipliers? Does the exchange regime
matter? What about the degree of openness? There is currently little empirical evidence to
shed light on these critical policy questions. This paper aims to ll this gap by conducting
a detailed empirical analysis that establishes the relevance of key country characteristics in
predicting whether and when scal stimulus is e¤ective or ine¤ective.
   A big hurdle in obtaining precise estimates of scal multipliers has been data availability.
Most studies have relied on annual data, which makes it di¢cult to obtain precise estimates.
To address this shortcoming, we have put together a novel quarterly dataset for 44 countries
(20 high-income and 24 developing). The coverage, which varies across countries, spans
from as early as 1960:1 to as late as 2007:4. We have gone to great lengths to ensure that
only data originally collected on a quarterly basis is included (as opposed to interpolated
from annual data). Using this unique databaseand sorting countries based on various key
characteristicswe estimate scal multipliers for di¤erent groups of countries and episodes in
our sample. The papers main results can be summarized as follows:

  1. The degree of development is a critical determinant of the size of the scal multipliers.
     We nd that, in developing countries, the response of output to increases in government
     consumption is negative on impact (and not statistically signi cantly di¤erent from
     zero). In contrast, the response of output in industrial countries is positive on impact
     (and signi cantly di¤erent from zero). Further, in developing countries, the cumulative
     response of output is negative and not statistically di¤erent from zero. In contrast,
     the positive output e¤ect in industrial countries is highly persistent and statistically


                                              2
  signi cant from zero in the long run. Fiscal policy di¤ers in developing countries not
  only in its e¤ect, but also in its execution, as increases in government consumption are
  far more transient (dying out after approximately 6 quarters), in contrast to highly
  persistent government consumption shocks in high-income countries.

2. The degree of exchange rate exibility is a also critical determinant of the size of s-
  cal multipliers. Economies operating under predetermined exchange rate regimes have
  long-run multipliers that are larger than one, but economies with exible exchange
  rate regimes have negative multipliers both on impact and the long run. The scal
  multiplier in countries with predetermined exchange rates is statistically di¤erent from
  zero and from the multiplier in countries with exible exchange arrangements at any
  forecast horizon. We nd that the main di¤erence between the response to govern-
  ment consumption in countries with di¤erent exchange rate regimes is in the degree
  of monetary accommodation to scal shocks. Our evidence supports the notion that
  the response of central banks to scal shocks is crucial in assessing the size of scal
  multipliers.

3. Openness to trade is another critical determinant. Economies that are relatively closed
  (whether due to trade barriers or larger internal markets) have long-run multipliers of
  around 1, but relatively open economies have negative multipliers. The di¤erence in
    scal multiplier across these two groups is statistically signi cant for the rst ve years.
  In economies with small proportions of trade to GDP the multiplier is statistically
  di¤erent from zero in both the short and long run.

4. During episodes where the outstanding debt of the central government was high (ex-
  ceeding 60 percent of GDP), the scal multiplier was not statistically di¤erent from
  zero on impact and was negative (and statistically di¤erent from zero) in the long run.
  Experimentation with a range of sovereign debt ratios indicated that the 60 percent of
  GDP threshold, used for example by the Eurozone as part of the Maastricht criteria,
  is indeed a critical value above which scal stimulus may have a negative impact on
  output in the long run.

5. We nd that the multiplier on government investment in developing countries is posi-
  tive, larger than one in the long run, and statistically di¤erent from the multiplier on

                                            3
      government consumption at forecast horizons of up to two years. This indicates that
      the composition of expenditure may play an important role in assessing the e¤ect of
       scal stimulus in developing countries. Our point estimate of the scal multiplier on
      government investment is larger than that of government consumption in high-income
      countries and other country groupings as well, but this di¤erence is small and not
      statistically signi cant.

    Given increasing trade integration and the adoption of exible exchange rate arrangements
particularly the adoption of ination targeting regimesour results cast doubt on the e¤ec-
tiveness of scal stimuli. Moreover, scal stimuli may even become even weaker, and poten-
tially yield negative multipliers in the near future, because a large number of countries are
now carrying very high public debt ratios. Moreover, our results provide new evidence on
the importance of scal-monetary interactions as a crucial determinant of the e¤ects of scal
policy on GDP.
    The paper proceeds as follows: Section 1 discusses the empirical methodology and puts
our paper in the context of the existing literature. Section 2 describes the new dataset used
in this study. Section 3 presents the econometric analysis and reports the results. Section 4
concludes.


1     Methodology and Contribution
A central issue in the ongoing debate on scal multipliers is that there is substantial dis-
agreement in the profession regarding how one should go about identifying scal shocks.
This identi cation problem arises because there are two possible directions of causation: (i)
government spending could a¤ect output or (ii) output could a¤ect government spending
(through, e.g., automatic stabilizers and implicit or explicit policy rules).
    Two main approaches have been used to address this identi cation problem: (i) the
structural vector autoregression approach (SVAR ), rst used for the study of scal policy
by Blanchard and Perotti (2002) and (ii) the natural experiment of large military build-
ups in the United States rst suggested by Barro (1981) and further developed by Ramey
and Shapiro (1998).
    In this paper, we employ the SVAR approach as in Blanchard and Perotti (2002). In our


                                               4
case the choice is forced because the military buildup approach has so far been applied only
the US and is not practical for a large panel of countries. The validity of military expenditure
as an instrument for public spending hinges on two assumptions. First, military expenditure
and war e¤orts must be driven by global geopolitical factors and not domestic economic
conditions. Second, these wars must have had no impact on macroeconomic outcomes ex-
cept through the increases in public spending they induced. But while US wars have been
fought primarily on foreign soil and have not involved signi cant direct losses of productive
capital, this is certainly not the case in developing or smaller developed countries. Identify-
ing government consumption through military purchases would risk conating the e¤ects of
government consumption on output with those of war, risking signi cant mis-estimation of
 scal multipliers in these countries.
   The basic assumption behind the SVAR approach used in this paper is that scal policy
requires some time to respond to news about the state of the economy. After using a VAR
to eliminate predictable responses of endogenous variables, it is assumed that any remain-
ing correlation between the residual (unpredicted) components of government spending and
output is due to the impact of government spending on output.
   We wish to highlight the importance of high-frequency data for the validity of this iden-
ti cation scheme. As Blanchard and Perotti (2002), who pioneered this approach, pointed
out: We use quarterly data because, as we discuss below, this is essential for identi cation
of the scal shocks. (p. 1332). While it is reasonable to assume that scal authorities
require a quarter to respond to output shocks, it is unrealistic to assume that an entire year
is necessary. For example, many countries, including developing countries, responded with
discretionary measures as early as the rst quarter of 2009 to the economic fallout following
the collapse of Lehman Brothers and AIG, at the end of the third quarter of 2008. While, in
this particular instance, the shock and response occurred in di¤erent calendar years, it sug-
gests it is not generally valid to assume that governments require an entire year to respond
to the state of the economy.
   A notable contribution of our paper, therefore, is in cataloguing quarterly data on gov-
ernment expenditure for a large sample of countries, including developing countries. We
outline the details of our new dataset in the following section. To our knowledge, all previ-
ous research on the e¤ects of scal policy on output using international data (e.g. Beetsma
et al, 2008 and Corsetti et al, 2011) have relied on lower frequency data.

                                               5
   In particular, this is the rst study to use quarterly-frequency data from, and provide
estimates for, developing countries. As we point out below, recent improvements in data
quality in a number of developing countries have made working with quarterly data possible.
Inclusion of developing countries may also aid in the identi cation of scal shocks.
   One critique of the SVAR approach is that scal shocks identi ed using an SVAR were
predicted by the private sector although they are unpredictable by the econometrician (see
Ramey, 2011, for example). In Appendix A.1, we provide some suggestive evidence that
this is not the case in developing countries. We show that even central banks in developing
countries had little ability to estimate government expenditure in real time and that their
data revisions are correlated with SVAR residuals. This indicates that their information
set on high-frequency movements in government expenditures was similar to that of the
econometrician. Overall,       scal policy in developing countries is su¢ciently volatileeven
within the course of a scal yearthat it is unlikely that private agents had good real-time
estimates of scal shocks.
   Broad surveys of the literature estimating the scal multiplier are provided in Ramey
(2011b) and Parker (2011). Here we highlight work that has used a similar methodology to
the one we employ. In the few OECD countries that have been studied so far, the existing
range of estimates in the SVAR literature varies considerably. Speci cally, Blanchard and
Perotti (2002) nd a multiplier of close to 1 in the United States for government purchases.
Perotti (2004a, 2007), however, shows that estimates vary greatly across ( ve OECD) coun-
tries and across time, with a range of -2.3 to 3.7. Other estimates for the United Statesusing
variations of the standard SVAR identifying assumptionyield values of 0.65 on impact but
-1 in the long run (Mountford and Uhlig, 2009) and larger than one (Fatas and Mihov, 2001).
   Given the range of scal multiplier estimates, it is natural to ask what determines where
and when scal policy has had a greater impact. The short sample of macroeconomic data
makes this a di¢cult question to answer for an individual country and recent studies have
turned to panels of international data in attempt to shed light on this question.1 Beetsma
et al (2008) estimate the scal multiplier for EU countries in a Panel VAR and nd a peak
multiplier of 1.6. However, they use annual data to obtain this estimate, and the main
focus of their paper is the response of the trade balance to scal shocks. Similar to our

   1
    There is also a growing literature using cross-sectional or panel data of US States. See for example
Nakamura and Steinsson (2011) and Wilson (2012).

                                                   6
results regarding the importance of exchange rate regimes and highly-indebted countries,
Corsetti et al (2011) show in a panel of industrialized countries that scal multipliers are
larger under xed than under exible exchange rates, lower when debt is high (greater than
100% of GDP), and larger during nancial crises. However, their dataset is annual and they
use the identi cation method of Perotti (1999) rather than the SVAR approach. Auerbach
and Gorodnichenko (2011, 2012) use structural VARs for the US and a panel of high-income
countries to compare the e¤ects of scal policy in expansion and recession. They nd that
 scal multipliers are larger in recessions than in expansions.2 Their panel data, however, is
semi-annual.
    Our paper also explores how the magnitude of scal multipliers depends on the eco-
nomic context. We provide estimates using quarterly data for a broad panel of countries,
including developing countries. Our larger sample allows more accurate estimates of the
 scal multiplier and more robust evidence on the di¤erences in scal multipliers across coun-
tries. We introduce quarterly dataimportant for the credibility of the SVAR identifying
assumptionin an international panel estimate of scal multipliers. Our paper also intro-
duces high-frequency scal data for developing countries.


2        Data
To the best of our knowledge, this paper involves the rst attempt to catalogue quarterly
data on government consumption in a broad set of countries. Until recently, only a handful
of countries (Australia, Canada, the U.K. and the U.S.) collected government expenditure
data at quarterly frequency and classi ed data into functional categories such as government
consumption and government investment.
    The use of quarterly data that is collected at a quarterly frequency is essential for the
validity of the identifying assumptions used in an SVAR. SVAR analysis assumes that scal
authorities require at least one period to respond to new economic data with discretionary
policy. As noted above, we believe that the use of quarterly data is crucial in order to
maintain the identifying assumption that scal authorities require one period to respond to
output shocks.

        In an earlier version of this paper, we obtained similar results in our sample.

                                                         7
   In addition, data reported at a quarterly frequency but collected at annual frequency
may lead to spurious regression results. Many standard datasets provide data that was
reported at quarterly frequency, but was interpolated from annual data. For example, a
series for quarterly (general) government consumption expenditure can be readily obtained
from the International Monetary Funds (IMF) International Finance Statistics database
(series 27391F.CZF). However, a look at Mexicos country page on the IMFs Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) website shows that annual calculations provide the levels
of GDP by production and by expenditure category, which are extrapolated by appropriate
indices to obtain quarterly values3 . The quality of high frequency data on government
consumption reported in standard sources cannot be taken for granted.
   There are signi cant pitfalls stemming from the use of interpolated data for empirical
analysis. One common method of interpolating government expenditure data that was col-
lected at annual frequency is to use the quarterly seasonal pattern of revenue collection as a
proxy for the quarterly seasonal pattern of government expenditure (data on tax revenues are
more commonly collected at quarterly frequency).4 As tax revenues are highly procyclical,
this method of interpolation creates a strong correlation between government expenditure
and output by construction. Using an SVAR to identify scal shocks with data constructed
in such a manner would clearly yield economically meaningless results.
   The new dataset used in this paper exploits the fact that a larger number of countries
have begun to collect scal data at a quarterly frequency. Two recent changes have made
high-frequency scal data available for a broader set of countries. First, the adoption in
1996 of a common statistical standard in the European Monetary Union, the ESA95, en-
couraged European countries to collect and classify scal data at quarterly frequency.5 In
its 2006 Manual on Non-Financial Accounts for General Government, Eurostat reports that
all Eurozone countries comply with the ESA95, with quarterly data based on direct infor-
mation available from basic sources that represent at least 90 percent of the amount in each
expenditure category.6
   Second, the IMF adopted the SDDS in 1996. Subscribers to this standard are required
to collect and report central government expenditure data at annual frequency, with quar-

     Austria was an exception with a coverage of 89:6% and is not included in our sample.

terly frequency recommended. A number of SDDS subscribers have since been collecting
 scal data at quarterly and even monthly frequency and classifying expenditure data into
functional categories at high frequencies.
   For several countries, these improved data standards translated into reliable quarterly
data on government consumption and investment in commonly used data sources. For ex-
ample, quarterly data on these series are available via the Eurostat database for many EU
countries, starting 1999 or earlier. For many other countries, notably developing countries,
additional work was required. To illustrate how we arrived at quarterly series for government
expenditure categories where these were unavailable elsewhere, we return to the example of
Mexico. As mentioned earlier, the quarterly government consumption data in Mexicos
national accounts are interpolated from annual frequency. However, the Mexican nance
ministry documents expenditures of the central government at monthly frequency. These
are classi ed into current and capital expenditures. Summing sub-categories within
the current category, one can obtain a measure of expenditures that could be classi ed
as government consumption (total compensation of employees, purchases of materials and
supplies, purchases of services). From sub-categories within the capital category, one can
similarly obtain a measure of gross xed capital formation (government investment). A
country-by-country description of data sources is available in Appendix A2 and Appendix
Tables A1-A2.
   The main speci cation in our empirical analysis includes real government consumption,
GDP, the ratio of the current account to GDP and the real e¤ective exchange rate. Other
speci cations include real government investment, and the short-term interest rate targeted
by the central bank. Nominal data was deated using the corresponding deator, when
available, and using the CPI index when such a deator was not available; using a GDP
deator instead of CPI for those countries where both were available left the papers results
unchanged. We took natural logarithms of all government expenditure and GDP data and
of the real e¤ective exchange rate.
   The data show strong seasonal patterns. Our selected de-seasonalization method was the
SEATS algorithm (see Gómez and Maravall, 2000). In an earlier version of this study, we
used the X-11 algorithm and obtained similar results. All variables were non-stationary, with
the exception of the central bank interest rate and the ratio of the current account to GDP.
The data used in the reported regressions are deviations of the non-stationary variables from

                                             9
their quadratic trend. Using a linear trend yielded similar results. The current account and
the policy interest rate were included in levels, while the real exchange rate was included in
 rst di¤erences. After detrending the data, the series were stationary, with unit roots rejected
at the 99 percent con dence level for all variables in both an Augmented DickeyFuller test
and the Im, Pesaran, and Shin (2003) test.
   With this new dataset, a decade or more of quarterly observations is now available for
a cross-section of 44 countries, of which 24 are developing countries. While ten years (40
observations) of data are hardly enough to estimate the e¤ect of scal policy on output for
an individual country, the pooled data contains more than 2,500 observationsan order of
magnitude greater than used in VAR studies of scal policy to date.
   Table 1 provides summary statistics for the main new variable in the dataset: quarterly
government consumption. The table reports the proportion of government consumption
to GDP, the autocorrelation of (detrended) government consumption, and the variance of
(detrended) government consumption relative to the variance of GDP. These statistics are
calculated for a number of country groupings, which will be used in the empirical analysis of
the following sections. The proportion of GDP devoted to government consumption varies
from 9.6 percent in El Salvador to 27.4 percent in Sweden during the sample period. This
reects the larger government size (with government consumption averaging 20.8 percent)
in high income countries than in developing countries (15.6 percent).
   There is also a di¤erence between high-income and developing countries in the persistence
of government consumption. The cyclical component of government consumption has an
autocorrelation coe¢cient of 0.74 in high income countries, compared with 0.6 in developing
countries. With respect to volatility, the greatest di¤erence appears again in comparing
developing to high-income countries. In both groups of countries, government consumption
is more variable than GDP. However, in developing countries government consumption is
more than six times more volatile than output, compared to a factor of two in high-income
countries.

                                           X
                                 AYn;t =         Ck Yn;t   k   + Bun;t ;                      (1)
                                           k=1


where Yn;t is a vector of variables comprising government expenditure variables (e.g., gov-
ernment consumption and/or investment), GDP, and other endogenous variables for a given
quarter t and country n. Ck is a matrix of the own- and cross-e¤ects of the k th lag of the
variables on their current observations. The matrix B is diagonal, so that the vector ut
is a vector of orthogonal, i.i.d. shocks to government consumption and output such that
                         
Eun;t = 0 and E un;t u0n;t is the identity matrix. Finally, the matrix A allows for the pos-
sibility of simultaneous e¤ects among the endogenous variables Yn;t . We assume that the
matrices A, B, and Ck are invariant across time and countries in given regression.
    System (1) is estimated by Panel OLS regression with xed e¤ects. OLS provides us with
estimates of the matrices A 1 Ck . As is usual in SVAR estimation of this system, additional
identi cation assumptions are required to estimate the coe¢cients in A and B. In our bench-
mark regressions Yn;t = (gn;t ; yn;t ; CAn;t ; dREERn;t )0 , where gn;t is government consumption,
yn;t output, CAn;t the ratio of the current account balance to GDP, and dREERn;t the
change in the natural logarithm of the real e¤ective exchange rate. We follow Blanchard
and Perotti (2002) in assuming that changes in government consumption require at least
one quarter to respond to innovations in other macroeconomic variables. Our remaining
identifying assumptions apply a Cholesky decomposition, where we follow Kim and Roubini
(2008) and others in ordering the remaining variables after GDP and ordering the current
account balance before the real e¤ective exchange rate. The ordering of these two additional
controls in any sequence, while retaining the identifying assumption of the lagged response
of discretionary scal policy to macroeconomic variables, had virtually no e¤ect on reported
results. While we include the current account and the real exchange rate as controls, results
are virtually identical when these controls are excluded. In addition, it is reassuring that
our identi ed shocksthe estimated government consumption and GDP residuals from the


                                                  11
VARare highly correlated when the controls are included and when they are excluded.7
    We do not control for tax policy. Ignoring the tax-expenditure mix of scal policy and
the response of tax policy to shocks to both government consumption and output could,
in principle, bias our results. We omit tax variables due to data limitations. However,
Ilzetzki (2011) shows that controlling for tax policy does not signi cantly alter our results
for countries overlapping between his study and ours. This suggests that the bias due to this
omitted variable is not substantial in practice.
    We choose to pool the data across countries rather than provide estimates on a country-
by-country basis. With the exception of a handful of countries, the sample for a typical
country is of approximately ten years, yielding around forty observations. We exploit the
larger sample sizealmost always exceeding one thousand observationsdelivered from pool-
ing the data. We divide the sample into a number of country-observation groupings and
estimate and compare the scal multiplier across categories.


3.2     Fiscal Multipliers: De nitions
There are several ways to measure the scal multiplier and a few de nitions are useful. In
general, the de nition of the scal multiplier is the change in real GDP or other output
measure caused by a one-unit increase in a scal variable. For example, if a one dollar
increase in government consumption causes a fty cent increase in GDP, then the government
consumption multiplier is 0:5.
    Multipliers may di¤er greatly across forecast horizons. We therefore focus on two speci c
 scal multipliers. The Impact Multiplier, de ned as

                                                                y0
                                       Impact Multiplier =          ;
                                                                g0

measures the ratio of the change in output to a change in government expenditure at the
moment the impulse to government expenditure occurs. In order to assess the e¤ect of
 scal policy at longer forecast horizons, we also report the Cumulative Multiplier at time T;



    7
      Regressing the residuals from these two speci cations on each other yields a coe¢cient of 1 with t-
statistics exceeding 100. This result is reassuring, as it indicates that additional controls do not a¤ect our
view on the predictability of scal shocks in our VAR.

                                                                   (1 + i)       yt

where i is the median interest rate in the sample. We use the median rather than the
average to avoid placing excessive weight on extreme events, or particular countries (e.g.
Brazil, Turkey) with unusually high interest rates. This measures the net present value
of the cumulative change in output per unit of additional government expenditure, also in
net present value, from the time of the impulse to government expenditure to the reported
horizon.8 A cumulative multiplier that is of speci c interest is the Long-Run Multiplier
de ned as the cumulative multiplier as T ! 1.


3.3     Lag Structure
In choosing K, the number of lags included in system (1), we conducted a number of speci -
cation tests. As is often the case, the optimal number of lags varies greatly across country-
groups and tests. In VAR analyses, results often change signi cantly depending on the
number of lags chosen in the VAR. For simplicity, and to assure the reader that di¤erences
across country groups are not driven by di¤erences in selected lags, we set K = 4 in all
reported results.
    It is reassuring that all of the papers results are robust to choosing any alternative number
of lags from 1 to 8. Using a more formal criterion to select the lag length of each regression
does not alter our results. We report in Appendix Figures A6 to A12 our main results
when the number of lags in each regression is chosen separately according to the Akaike
information criterion. Results are similar as are results obtained when lags are chosen by
other criteria, or using a pretest data-based model selection.




    8
      This de nition follows Mountford and Uhlig (2011). Our results are not driven by di¤erences in in-
terest rates across regressions. In earlier versions of this paper we reported cumulative multipliers without
discounting (i = 0) with similar results.

                                                     13
3.4     High-income and developing countries
As a rst cut at the data, we divided the sample into high-income and developing countries.9
Figures 1 and 2 show the impulse responses of all endogenous variables to a 1 percent shock
to government consumption at time 0. Dashed lines give the 90 percent con dence intervals,
based on Monte Carlo estimated standard errors, with 1000 repetitions. Figure 1 presents
responses for high-income countries and Figure 2 for developing countries. A few di¤erences
stand out between the impulse responses. First, the impact response of output to government
spending is positive and statistically signi cant from zero in high-income countries (0.08
percent), but is negative in developing countries (-0.01 percent). The di¤erence between the
responses of GDP to government consumption in the two groups of countries is statistically
signi cant at the 95 percent con dence level. Second, GDPs response is positive throughout
the simulation in high income countries, while it is negative in the long run in developing
countries. Third, while the real exchange rate is barely a¤ected on impact by the shock
to government consumption in high-income countries and shows a depreciation in the long
run, the real exchange rate appreciates by a statistically signi cant margin in developing
countries on impact.10
    Based on the impulse responses depicted in Figures 1 and 2, we can compute the corre-
sponding scal multipliers, using the de nitions of Section 3.2 These are shown in Figure 3.
The impact multiplier for high-income countries is 0.39. An additional dollar of government
spending delivers only 39 cents of additional output in the quarter of implementation. This
e¤ect, while small, is statistically signi cant. For developing countries, the impact multiplier

   9
      We use the World Banks classi cation of high income countries in 2000, and include all other countries
in the category developing. The marginal countries are the Czech Republic, de ned as developing in 2000,
but high-income in 2006; and Slovenia, categorized as high-income in 2000, but as upper-middle income
(and thus developing by our typology) before 1997. Excluding or reclassifying these two countries does not
alter the results. Israel is classi ed as high income, based on this de nition, but was categorized as an
emerging market in J.P. Morgans EMBI index. Excluding or reclassifying Israel does not alter the results.
   10
      Kim and Roubini (2008); Ravn, Schmitt-Grohe, and Uribe (2007); and Monacelli and Perotti (2008)
all document a depreciation in the real exchange rate in response to government consumption shocks in
subsets of our high-income sample. We obtain a similar result in the long run. The two latter papers provide
theories wherein non-standard preferences lead to this outcome. This would imply, however, di¤erences in
preferences between agents in high-income and developing countries. A possible alternative explanation for
this di¤erence is that real exchange rate movements in industrialized countries reect mainly changes in
exchange-rate-adjusted relative prices of tradable goods, while in developing countries there is an important
component due to uctuations in the relative price of non-tradable goods relative to tradables. Government
consumption is mainly in the form of non-tradables, so an increase in government consumption pushes up
the relative price of non-tradables and the real exchange rate.

                                                     14
is negative at -0.03 and is not statistically signi cant from zero. The di¤erence between the
impact multiplier in the two groups of countries is statistically signi cant at the 95 percent
con dence level.
   Focusing on the impact multiplier, however, may be misleading because scal stimulus
packages can only be implemented over time and there may be lags in the economys re-
sponse. We see that the cumulative multiplier for high-income countries rises to a long-run
value of 0.66. Even after the full impact of a scal expansion is accounted for, output has
risen less than the cumulative increase in government consumption, implying some crowding
out of output by government consumption at every time horizon. The multiplier is statis-
tically di¤erent from zero at every horizon. On the other hand, the cumulative long-run
multiplier for developing countries is negative and not statistically signi cant from zero at
any horizon. Government consumption is more-than-fully crowded out by other components
of GDP (investment, consumption, or net exports) in the long run.


3.5     Exchange rate regimes
As a second cut at the data, we divided our sample of 44 countries into episodes of prede-
termined exchange rates and those with more exible exchange rate regimes. We use the de
facto classi cation of Ilzetzki, Reinhart, and Rogo¤ (2008) to determine the exchange rate
regime of each country in each quarter. Table A3 lists for each country the episodes in which
the exchange arrangement was classi ed as xed or exible.11
   The cumulative multipliers, shown in Figure 4, suggest that the exchange rate regime
matters a great deal. Under predetermined exchange rates, the impact multiplier is 0.15
(and statistically signi cantly di¤erent from zero) and rises to 1.4 in the long-run. Under
exible exchange rate regimes, however, the multiplier is negative at any forecast horizon,
and statistically signi cant from zero both on impact and in the long run. The di¤erence
between the outcome for the two groups is statistically signi cant at any forecast horizon.
   These results are, in principle, consistent with the Mundell-Fleming model, which pre-

  11
     We divided the sample into country-episodes of predetermined exchange rates. For each country we
took any 8 continuous quarters when the country had a xed exchange rate as a  xed episode and any 8
continuous quarters or more when the country had exible exchange rates as ex. As xed we included
countries with no legal tender, hard pegs, crawling pegs,and de facto or pre-anounced bands or crawling
bands with margins no larger than +/- 2%. All other episodes were classi ed as exible. Based on this
de nition, Eurozone countries are included as having xed exchange rates.

                                                  15
dicts that scal policy is e¤ective in raising output under predetermined exchange rates but
ine¤ective under exible exchange rates. In the textbook version, a scal expansion increases
output, raises interest rates, and induces an inow of foreign capital, which creates pressure
to appreciate the domestic currency. Under predetermined exchange rates, the monetary
authority expands the money supply to prevent this appreciation. Monetary policy accom-
modates the rise in output. Under exible exchange rates, however, the monetary authority
keeps a lid on the money supply and allows the real exchange rate appreciation to reduce
net exports. Output does not change because the increase in government spending is exactly
o¤set by the fall in net exports.
    The broader monetary context of the scal stimuli is explored in Figure 5. This gure
reports impulse responses to a 1 percent shock to government consumption in a VAR that
now includes a fth variable: the short-term interest rate set by the central bank. We exclude
this variable from our baseline regressions, as its inclusion reduces our sample by 20 percent,
but all results are robust to its inclusion as an additional endogenous variable.12
    The rst row of Figure 5 presents government consumption shocks in episodes of xed and
exible exchange rates. The second row presents the response of GDP to these shocks. Al-
though the impulses to government consumption are broadly similar, the increase in GDP is
positive and statistically signi cant under xed exchange rates, but negative and statistically
insigni cant under exible exchange rates.
    The following two rows explore the traditional Mundell-Fleming channel. They show the
response of the current account as a percentage of GDP (third row) and the real e¤ective
exchange rate (fourth row). We nd only weak evidence for the traditional channel. As
expected, the real exchange rate appreciates on impact under exible exchange rates, but by
a statistically insigni cant margin under xed exchange rates. But this does not translate
into a larger decline in the current account in episodes where the exchange rate was exible,
as the Mundell-Fleming model would predict.
    On the other hand, we do nd evidence for the monetary accommodation channel,

  12
     In the reported results, we order the central banks policy rate after government consumption, but before
other macroeconomic variables. The ordering of the scal variable before the central banks instrument
follows from the assumption that the monetary authority can respond more rapidly to news than scal
decision-makers can. Results are virtually unchanged if the policy interest rate is ranked lower in the
Cholesky ordering. However, the response of the interest rates is signi cantly weakened if the ordering of
the scal and monetary variables is reversed.

                                                     16
as shown in fth row of Figure 5. Monetary authorities operating under predetermined
exchange rates lower the policy interest rate by a cumulative 30 basis points in the year
following a government consumption shock of 1 percent of GDP. In contrast, central banks
operating under exible exchange rates increase the policy interest rate by a statistically
signi cant margin on impact, with interest rates increasing an average of 25 basis points
within the year following a scal shock of similar magnitude.
    Our results are related to the notion that monetary accommodation plays an important
role in determining the expansionary e¤ect of scal policy. Davig and Leeper (2011), for
example, show in a DSGE model with nominal rigidities that the e¤ect of scal policy di¤ers
greatly depending on whether monetary policy is active or passive. Coenen et al (2010) show
that monetary accommodation is an important determinant of the size of scal multipliers in
seven di¤erent structural models used in policymaking institutions. This result also relates
indirectly to the theoretical studies of Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011) and Erceg
and Lindé (2010), who show that scal multipliers are larger when the central banks policy
interest rate is at the zero lower bound.
    We nd that di¤erences in monetary accommodation are a potential explanation for dif-
ferences in the magnitude of scal multipliers across exchange rate regimes. But the weak
evidence on di¤erences in the response of the current account raises the question as to which
components of GDP di¤er in their response across monetary regimes. The insigni cant dif-
ference in current account response implies via GDP accounting that either consumption or
investment must di¤er in its response across these regimes. In a new set of regressions, we
replaced GDP with two variables: private consumption and private investment.13 Data avail-
ability restricted our attention to OECD countries and a small number of Latin American
countries. Nevertheless, Figure 6 shows that there is a marked di¤erence in the response of
private consumption to government consumption shocks across exchange rate regimes. Con-
sumption, shown in the rst row of the gure, responds positively to a shock in government
consumption under xed exchange rates, but negatively under exible exchange rates. The
responses are statistically signi cant in both cases. The response of investment is similar
under either predetermined or exible exchange rate regimes. In both cases, the response is
   13
      Consistent with our earlier identifying assumption, we do not allow for a contemporaneous response of
government consumption to unpredicted shocks to private consumption or private investment. The ordering
of the latter two variables among the other variables in the VAR system did not a¤ect the results reported
here.

                                                    17
erratic and investment declines by a statistically signi cant margin on impact.
     This result is related to the debate on the response of private consumption to government
consumption shocks. Perotti (2004a, 2007), using a VAR framework similar to ours, nds a
positive response of private consumption to government consumption. In contrast, Ramey
(2011a) nds that private consumption declines in response to military expenditure shocks.
While the focus in this debate has been on how to identify shocks to public expenditure,
our results point to an additional potential explanation of these contrasting ndings. Both
approaches have ignored the interaction between scal and monetary policy. Once we control
for monetary policy, we nd that consumption responds positively to government consump-
tion shocks only when the central bank accommodates the scal shock. Further exploration
of    scal-monetary interactions might shed more light on the response of macroeconomic
variables to government expenditure shocks.


3.6     Openness to trade
Next, we divide our sample of 44 countries based on their ratio of trade (imports plus exports)
to GDP. As shorthand, we label an economy as open if this ratio exceeded 60 percent. If
foreign trade is less than 60 percent of GDP, we de ned the country as closed. A list of
open and closed economies by this classi cation is shown in Appendix Table A4. Minor
variations of this threshold did not signi cantly a¤ect our results. Using this criterion, 28
countries are classi ed as open and the remaining 16 are classi ed as closed.
     The cumulative responses, shown in Figure 7, indicate the volume of trade as a proportion
of GDP is a critical determinant of the size of the scal multiplier. For economies with
low trade-GDP ratios, the impact response is 0.6 and the long-run multiplier is 1.1, with
multipliers statistically signi cant from zero at all forecast horizons. For economies with
high trade volumes as a proportion of GDP, the impact response is negative both on impact
and in the long run and never statistically signi cant from zero. The di¤erence between the
two categories is statistically signi cant at forecast horizons of up to ve years.
     This de nition of trade openness conates two main factors that a¤ect the proportion
of trade in a countrys GDP. A country may have a low ratio of trade to GDP because it
has high tari¤s or other barriers to trade, or because it is a large economy with a relatively
large internal market. We nd, however, that both factors a¤ect the magnitude of the scal


                                              18
multiplier independently.
    In de ning openness based on legal restrictions to trade, we divided the sample into peri-
ods where the weighted mean of tari¤s across all products in a country exceeded 3.6 percent
and those where it was lower than this threshold, according to the World Banks World De-
velopment Indicators. The median of this tari¤ in our sample was 3.6 percent. Open and
closed economies in our sample based on this de nition summarized in Appendix Table
A5. When de ning openness to trade based on this criterion, we found a similar di¤erence
between the multiplier in countries open and closed to trade. Results are shown in Appendix
Figure A1.
    We then divided our sample into the ten largest economies (in terms of their total GNP
in U.S. dollars) on the one hand and the remaining countries on the other.14 We nd that
the scal multiplier is larger in large economies relative to small, with a long-run multiplier
of approximately 1 in the former and -0.2 in the latter. Results are shown in Appendix
Figure A2
    As before, this result is consistent with the textbook Mundell-Fleming model. In such
a model, the scal multiplier would be lower in a more open economy because part of the
increase in aggregate demand would be met by a reduction in net exports rather than by an
increase in domestic production.


3.7     Financial fragility
With debt burdens rapidly accumulating during the current global economic turmoil, and
several countries teetering on the verge of default, some countries have opted for scal stim-
ulus while others have chosen to adopt scal austerity measures. It is natural to ask how
the level of sovereign debt a¤ects the impact of government consumption stimulus on GDP.
To this e¤ect, we built a sample of country-episodes where the ratio of the total debt of the
central government exceeded 60 percent of GDP. A list of high-debt episodes is provided
in Appendix Table A6.
    Figure 8 shows the resulting cumulative multiplier during periods of high debt burden.
Our estimates are consistent with the notion that attempts at scal stimulus in highly in-

  14
     Based on this threshold, countries with GNPs greater than or equal to that of Australia were considered
large. The Netherlands was the largest economy classi ed as small.

                                                    19
debted countries may actually be counter-productive. Our estimate for the impact multiplier
is close to zero, and we estimate a long run multiplier of -3. Moreover, we can reject with
99% con dence the hypotheses that the scal multiplier is positive. We are reassured that
this result is not spurious by the fact that this long run multiplier remains negative when
the threshold is set to 60 or 70 percent of GDP, while it becomes positive for debt-to-GDP
ratios of 30 or 40 percent. But experimenting with di¤erent thresholds indicated that the 60
percent threshold was a meaningful cuto¤, above which scal stimulus appears ine¤ective.
   These results are consistent with the idea that debt sustainability is an important factor in
determining the output e¤ect of government purchases. When debt levels are high, increases
in government expenditures may act as a signal that scal tightening will be required in
the near future. Moreover, as recent events in southern Europe and Ireland illustrate, these
adjustments may need to be sudden and large. The anticipation of such adjustment could
have a contractionary e¤ect that would tend to o¤set whatever short-term expansionary
impact government consumption may have. Under these conditions,               scal stimulus may
therefore be counter-productive.


3.8    Government Investment
While our focus so far has been on government consumptiondue in part to limited availabil-
ity of government investment datait is nevertheless interesting to see whether the e¤ects
of government investment di¤er from those of government consumption. To explore this
                                                 I                0      I
question, we estimate (1), this time with Yn;t = gn;t ; gn;t ; yn;t where gn;t is real government
investment, and gn;t is real government consumption and yn;t is GDP. We follow Perotti
(2004b) in ordering government investment before government consumption in the Cholesky
decomposition, although results are not altered if the ordering is reversed. The number of
countries in the sample declines when including government investment, but the results for
government consumption reported in the previous sections hold roughly for this sub-sample
as well. We control in these regressions for government consumption, but follow Perotti
(2004b) in estimating the multiplier to pure government investment shocks, that prevent
endogenous responses of government investment and GDP to government consumption. This
is done by estimating the full system with the three endogenous variables, but setting all
                                    I
values of gn;t = 0 in forecasts of gn;t and yn;t in impulse responses. This is done to ensure that


                                               20
we are not confusing the response of GDP to government investment with that to government
consumption, as the two public spending variables co-move strongly.15
     The resulting cumulative multipliers for high-income countries and developing countries
are presented in Figure 9. Point estimates for the government investment multiplier in high-
income countries are reported in the upper panel. Estimates at all horizons are similar
to the government consumption multipliers of Figure 3. We have no robust evidence that
government investment is more productive in its stimulative e¤ect in high-income countries.
This is consistent with the ndings of Perotti (2004b).
     In developing countries, in contrast, the lower panel of Figure 9 shows the impact mul-
tiplier of government investment is 0:6 and statistically signi cant. We can reject at the 90
percent con dence level the hypothesis that the e¤ect of government investment is no higher
than that of government consumption horizons of up to 10 quarters. It appears that the com-
position of government purchases is an important determinant of the impact of government
spending shocks on output in developing countries.
     When breaking up the sample between predetermined and exible exchange rates, open
and closed economies, and countries with high debt-to-GDP ratios, we nd results for the
pure government investment multiplier that are roughly in line with those for government
consumption, although di¤erences across groups are no longer statistically signi cant, and
multipliers are slightly higher than those for government consumption. See gures A3 and
A4 in the Appendix for the results.


4        Conclusions
This paper is an empirical exploration of one of the central questions in macroeconomic policy
in the past few years: what is the e¤ect of government purchases on economic activity? We
use panel SVAR methods and a novel dataset to explore this question. Our results point
to the fact that the size of scal multipliers critically depends on key characteristics of the

    15
     In principle one might wish to control for public investment in estimates of public consumption multi-
pliers. However, the omission of the latter from earlier regressions does not have a signi cant impact on the
estimate of government consumption multipliers. This is because, in all countries in our sample, government
investment is small relative to government consumption. In addition, results in this section are qualitatively
the same when reporting the multiplier when government consumption is not forced to zero along simulation
paths.

economy under study.
   We have found that the e¤ect of government consumption is very small on impact in
most cases. This suggests that increases in government purchases may be rather slow in
impacting economic activity, which raises questions as to the usefulness of discretionary scal
policy for short-run stabilization purposes. The medium- to long-run e¤ects of increases
in government consumption vary considerably: in economies closed to trade or operating
under xed exchange rates we nd a substantial long-run e¤ect of government consumption
on economic activity. In contrast, in economies open to trade or operating under exible
exchange rates, a scal expansion leads to no signi cant output gains. Further, scal stimulus
may be counterproductive in highly-indebted countries. Indeed, in countries with debt levels
as low as 60 percent of GDP, government consumption shocks may have strong negative
e¤ects on output.
   The composition of government expenditure appears to impact its stimulative e¤ect,
particularly in developing countries. While increases in government consumption decrease
output on impact in this set of countries, increases in government investment cause an
increase in GDP, both on impact and in the long run.
   With the increasing importance of international trade in economic activity, and with
many economies moving towards greater exchange rate exibility (typically in the context of
ination targeting regimes), our results suggest that seeking the Holy Grail of scal stimulus
could be counterproductive, with little bene t in terms of output and potential long-run costs
due to larger stocks of public debt. Moreover, scal stimuli are likely to become weaker, and
potentially yield negative multipliers, in the near future, because of the high debt ratios
observed in countries, particularly in the industrialized world.
   On the other hand, emerging countriesparticularly larger economies with some degree
of fear of oatingwould be well served if they stopped pursuing procyclical scal policies.
Indeed, emerging countries have typically increased government consumption in good times
and reduced it in bad times, thus amplifying the underlying business cyclewhat Kaminsky,
Reinhart, and Végh (2004) have dubbed the when it rains, it pours phenomenon. The
inability to save in good times greatly increases the probability that bad times will turn into
a full-edged scal crisis. Given this less-than-stellar record in scal policy, an a-cyclical
 scal policywhereby government consumption and tax rates do not respond to the business
cyclewould represent a major improvement in macroeconomic policy. While occasional rain

                                              22
may be unavoidable for emerging countries, signi cant downpours would be relegated to the
past.

A      Appendix

A.1     Are innovations to government consumption foreseen?
Following Blanchard and Perotti (2002), our estimation methodology assumes that residuals
from a VAR regression are not anticipated. In a critique of this approach, Ramey (2011a)
shows that scal shocks identi ed through VAR residuals are predicted by private forecasts
in the United States. A similar exercise is di¢cult to conduct in the case of developing
countries because there is little documentation of private sector expectations of scal policy.
But there is reason to believe that scal shocks are harder to foresee in the case of developing
countries. As illustrated in Table 1, government consumption is signi cantly more volatile
in developing countries than in high-income countries.
    We provide suggestive evidence that these shocks were not foreseen. We do so by using
data revisions by a number of central banks, for which (very short) time series of government
consumption data of di¤erent vintages are available. These are shown in Figure A5 for
Bulgaria, Ecuador, and Uruguay. The dotted markers indicate the error in the central banks
preliminary estimate of government consumption in a given quarter. This is calculated
as the di¤erence (in percent) between the      nal published data by the central bank and
the rst published o¢cial estimate (typically the quarter following the data point). The
circle markers are the residuals from the government consumption equation in the VAR (for
developing countries). While the availability of vintage data is limited, the short time-series
available show a very clear correlation between the central banks estimation error and the
VAR residuals. This suggests that VAR residuals are a fairly good measure of unexpected
innovations in government consumption. It is extremely unlikely that the information set of
the private sector prior to shocks to government consumption was better than that of the
central bank after the shock. Further, in developing countries, scal policy is su¢ciently
erratic that even ex-post estimates are subject to signi cant revision in following years. We
 nd this evidence suggestive of the fact that, at least in developing countries, VAR residuals
do capture a signi cant portion of unanticipated shocks to government consumption.
