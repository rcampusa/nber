                                              ABSTRACT

We study the effects of private school competition on public school students’ test scores in the wake
of Florida’s Corporate Tax Credit Scholarship program, now known as the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship
Program, which offered scholarships to eligible low-income students to attend private schools. Specifically,
we examine whether students in schools that were exposed to a more competitive private school landscape
saw greater improvements in their test scores after the introduction of the scholarship program, than
did students in schools that faced less competition. The degree of competition is characterized by
several geocoded variables that capture students’ ease of access to private schools, and the variety
of nearby private school options open to students. We find that greater degrees of competition are
associated with greater improvements in students’ test scores following the introduction of the program;
these findings are robust to the different variables we use to define competition. These findings are
not an artifact of pre-policy trends; the degree of competition from nearby private schools matters
only after the announcement of the new program, which makes nearby private competitors more affordable
for eligible students. We also test for several moderating factors, and find that schools that we would
expect to be most sensitive to competitive pressure see larger improvements in their test scores as
a result of increased competition.

1. Introduction

         School choice options—including both voucher and neo-voucher options like tuition tax

credit funded scholarship programs—have become increasingly prevalent in recent years

(Howell, Peterson, Wolf and Campbell, 2006). One popular argument for school choice policies

is that public schools will improve the education they offer when faced with competition for

students. Because state funds are tied to student enrollment, losing students to private schools

constitutes a financial loss to public schools. If schools face the threat of losing students--and

the state funds attached to those students--to private schools, they should be incentivized to

cultivate customer (i.e., parental) satisfaction by operating more efficiently and improving on the

outcomes valued by students and parents (Friedman, 1962). Alternatively, vouchers may have

unintended negative effects on public schools if they draw away the most involved families from

public schools and the monitoring of those schools diminishes, allowing schools to reduce effort

put into educating students (McMillan, 2004).1

         It is notoriously difficult to gauge the competitive effects of private schools on public

school performance because private school supply and public school performance affect each

other dynamically (Dee, 1998; McEwan, 2000). In cross-section, the relationship between

private school supply and public school performance could plausibly be either upward-biased or

downward-biased. On the one hand, private schools may disproportionately locate in

communities with low-quality public schools. In such a case, the estimated relationship between

private school penetration and public school performance would be downward-biased. On the

other hand, if private schools locate in areas with high valuation of educational quality, then the

presence of private schools could be correlated with unobservable features of public school

1
  Of course, it is also possible that vouchers might attract the students who are the most mismatched to their present
education environment. If so, this changing compositional effect could potentially benefit the students remaining in
the public sector.


                                                                                                                     2
quality and public school student performance, and the estimated relationship between private

schools and public school performance would be upward-biased.

         This paper takes advantage of the introduction of a major new school voucher program –

one of the largest in the United States and the largest in terms of the number of low-income

students served-- to directly study the competitive effects of school vouchers on student

outcomes in public schools. The Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program (FTC; formerly called

the "Corporate Tax Credit Scholarship Program") offers assistance to students eligible for free or

reduced-price lunches at school (that is, those with family incomes below 185 percent of the

federal poverty line) to attend private religious or non-religious schools in the state.2 To qualify

for a voucher, students must have spent the entire prior year in a Florida public school (or be

entering kindergarten or first grade) in addition to being low-income. Vouchers need not cover

all of the costs of attending private schools, and parents are free to send their children to any

private school regardless of the share of tuition and fees covered by the voucher. The voucher,

however, is quite generous relative to the costs of attending religious private schools; the $3,500

voucher size at the program's introduction3 was about 90 percent of elementary-grade tuition and

fees at a typical Florida religious private school.4 And the policy change was very large for the

target population -- the number of scholarships available was larger than half the size of the low-

income population using private schools on the eve of the policy's introduction. For low-income

Floridians, the voucher represented a major demand shock for private schooling. Florida's

experience with this policy is particularly important because similar policies are being
2
  Through 2009-10, participants may keep their voucher if family income rises above 185 percent of the poverty line
so long as family income stays below twice the poverty line.
3
  The size of the voucher in 2009-10 was between $3,950 and $4,100 depending on whether the student is new to the
program or a returning participant. In 2010 the Florida Legislature passed a law that would increase the generosity
of the voucher program, expand the number of students eligible to participate, and increase the income levels at
which eligible participants could continue to receive a voucher.
4
  In contrast, the size of the voucher is less than two-thirds of the typical tuition and fees at a religious high school in
Florida.


                                                                                                                          3
considered at the time of writing in Maryland and New Jersey and recently enacted in Indiana as

of 2010-11, and a bill to establish a similar policy in Chicago was just defeated in the Illinois

Legislature. Clearly, this form of voucher program has the potential to expand considerably over

the coming years in the United States.

       We specifically examine whether students in schools that face a greater threat of losing

students to private schools due to the introduction of tuition tax credit scholarships improve their

test scores more than do students in schools that face less pronounced threats. We use the

introduction of the FTC program as a source of exogenous variation that dramatically increased

the potential demand for non-public school options after 2001, when the policy was announced,

by lowering the effective cost of private school attendance for eligible students. We examine

whether test scores improved more in the wake of the new policy for students attending public

schools with more (or more varied) nearby private options that suddenly became more affordable

for low-income students, than did scores for students attending schools with fewer (or less

varied) potential competitors.

       This is possible because of the considerable variation in potential competition faced by

schools across the state of Florida. Prior to the introduction of the program, some communities

in Florida had a much richer and more diverse set of private school options than did other

communities. We suspect that public schools in these communities may have experienced more

competition at the outset of the program, causing them to respond differently from schools with

fewer potential competitors. Because we are identifying off of a policy change, we do not rely

on cross-sectional variation to estimate the effects of private school competition on public

schools, but rather apply a differences-in-differences modeling strategy. We find evidence that

public schools subject to more competitive pressure from private schools raised their test scores




                                                                                                    4
the most following the introduction of Florida's voucher program.5 Therefore, while the state

caps the number of program participants at a small fraction of the overall student body, the

magnitude of the program nonetheless appears to be large enough to generate substantive public

school responses.

         In addition to employing a stronger identification strategy than most past work, our

analysis also uses the timing of the roll-out of the policy to isolate the effect of competitive

pressure per se from other potential effects that voucher policies may have on public schools. A

simple pre-post comparison of the extent to which private school penetration was associated with

public school performance would typically conflate three distinct aspects of the effects of the

voucher on public schools. In addition to the competitive effect of the voucher that we seek to

identify, there is also a composition effect -- if vouchers change the composition of the public

schools, and if peer effects are important,6 then the voucher effect on public schools would also

include the changes in performance associated with the composition of the school changing.

Furthermore, if vouchers influence the resources available to a school, then the voucher effect

will capture these changes in resources as well.

         We are able to separate the competition effect from the other two effects of vouchers

because of the timing of the voucher roll-out. For a year following the announcement of the

policy, students were applying for vouchers for the following school year, but no students had yet


5
  Indeed, we find evidence that the effects of the voucher program are generalized to the school's overall population.
There is reason to believe that competitive effects would generalize if it is difficult to target additional attention to
groups of students on the basis of categories such as free-or-reduced-price lunch eligible, or if parents rely on overall
indicators of school quality, such as average test scores or state-administered school grades, to judge quality. Both
seem highly plausible; the evidence on voluntary donations to schools (Figlio and Kenny, 2009) shows that Florida
families' contributions to schools are highly related to school grades, especially for schools serving low-income
families.
6
  See Epple and Romano (forthcoming) for a comprehensive review of the peer effects literature. Lavy (2009)
suggests one particular avenue through which composition effects may operate; his study of public school choice in
Israel indicates improvements in behavioral as well as academic outcomes under school choice, including reduction
of violence and disruption in schools.


                                                                                                                       5
left the public school on a voucher. Therefore, any public school changes in this first year of the

program, when public school students were applying for vouchers but before they actually used

them, can be thought of as a pure competition effect of vouchers.7

         We are also able to exploit key aspects of the policy environment to obtain further

evidence of the competitive effects of school vouchers. First, because the voucher is for a fixed

amount regardless of the level of the school, the voucher covers a dramatically larger portion of

the tuition and fees at elementary and middle schools than at high schools. For the set of

voucher participants for whom we can observe information on actual tuition and fees charged

(those residing in roughly the southern half of Florida), out-of-pocket costs for families using

vouchers are typically over three times higher for high school students than for elementary

school students. And indeed, the overwhelming majority of students who have left the public

schools to attend a private school using a voucher in Florida have been elementary and middle

school students (Figlio, Hart and Metzger, 2009). Hence, one would expect larger competitive

effects of vouchers at the lower schooling levels than at the high school level.

         Second, the federal Title I program provides generous additional cash assistance, levied

on a student-by-student basis, as well as substantially increased flexibility as to how to spend it,

to schools with relatively high levels of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Title

I funds are paid to school districts, which in turn allocate resources to schools, and district

policies directing how schools receive those supplemental funds vary dramatically. The


7
  It is possible that the results could be driven by low-income students working harder in the "pure competition" year
to help to attain a place in a private school. However, we find little evidence of differential effects for low-income
versus higher-income students, indicating that our estimates are likely best considered to be generalized performance
effects of the program. We also observe little evidence of strategic entry into the public schools of families seeking
to "game the system" by attending public schools for a single year. Among students observed selecting out of the
public schools to attend a private school using the voucher program, only about five percent had spent just one year
in Florida prior to using the voucher. Given that some of these students may have come from out of state, this is at
most an upper bound of the fraction of students strategically selecting into public schools in the year before students
could leave the public schools using a voucher.


                                                                                                                     6
program's generosity levels were increasing monotonically beginning in 1999-2000, leading

some school districts to provide Title I assistance to schools higher in the income distribution

than before. The overall effect of the funding change between 2001-02 and 2002-03 was to

increase the statewide percentage of schools receiving Title I funds by five percent, with larger

changes in some school districts; in Florida, these changes were largely not due to the No Child

Left Behind Act, which increased Title I funding in 2002-03 in areas that benefitted smaller

fractions of Florida schools than elsewhere.8 Nonetheless, the increases in Title I funding

observed in Florida were consistent with a secular trend toward increasing numbers of schools

eligible for Title I funding. We suspect that the schools that stand to become Title I schools and

experience a dramatic increase in discretionary revenues if they do not lose many of their free or

reduced-price lunch students are the schools that would be the most likely to respond to the

competitive threats embedded within the voucher policy. We find evidence that the schools

facing higher levels of competitive threat or greater financial incentives to retain low-income

students were the schools more likely to respond to the competitive threat of school vouchers.

The fact that we observed generalized improvements in school performance in response to the

competitive threats of school vouchers, even in a state with rapid population growth, provides

strong evidence that voucher competition may have effects elsewhere.



2. Comparison with the existing literature

         A number of researchers have estimated the relationship between private school

penetration and student outcomes -- either test scores, graduation rates, or grade completed --

using effectively cross-sectional variation; examples include Arum (1996); Dee (1998); Hoxby

8
  That said, the appropriations law that codified the increases in Title I funding was signed by President Bush on
January 10, 2002, meaning that Florida schools may have responded not only to expectations of further secular
increases in Title I funding but also to the realized appropriations. The distinction is not material for our purposes.


                                                                                                                          7
(1994); Jepsen (1999); and Sander (1998) in United States settings, and Andersen and Serritzlew

(2005) abroad.9 Most of these studies have found either modestly positive, or null or

inconsistent effects of private school competition on public school students’ educational

outcomes (Belfield and Levin, 2002; McEwan, 2000). These studies use a variety of estimation

techniques to attempt to overcome the simultaneity problem; while some studies rely on OLS

with covariates to adjust for possible omitted variables (Arum, 1996), most use some form of

instrumental variable analysis (Dee, 1998; Jepsen, 1999; Sander, 1998). Some studies use

population-level demographic data as instruments for private school attendance (Couch,

Shughart, and Williams, 1993), but most use some measure of the density of the Catholic

population in a given area (Dee, 1998; Hoxby, 1994; Jepsen, 1999; Sander, 1998) The rationale

is that larger populations of Catholics in a given area increase the likelihood that the Catholic

church will expend resources in that area to support a private Catholic school (Dee, 1998;

Hoxby, 1994; Jepsen, 1999). However, there are reasons to question the validity of religious

concentration as an instrument for private schooling (Altonji, Elder and Taber, 2004), and studies

relying on cross-sectional variation in private school concentration in a community are subject to

the usual omitted variables and reverse causation problems. In addition, Catholic shares might

capture only a small fraction of the private school landscape in large swaths of the country, such

as the south. For instance, in Florida, which runs the scholarship tuition program analyzed in

this paper, 12.08% of private schools operating in 2001 were Catholic. By contrast, 13.44%

were Baptist; 8.58% were evangelical, 8.25% were reported as Christian with no further

identifying information, and 13.93% were non-denominational.

9
 There exists an even larger related literature on the performance effects of the degree of traditional school
competition. Well-known examples in this literature include Cullen, Jacob and Levitt (2005), Hoxby (2000) and
Rothstein (2006) in the United States, and Clark (2009), and Gibbons, Machin and Silva (2008) in England. Hsieh
and Urquiola (2006) study the effects of generalized competition in Chile, and Lavy (2009) examines effects of
public school choice in Israel.


                                                                                                                  8
       A few papers have taken a different tack and identified the effects of voucher programs

directly on student outcomes in the public schools. Greene and Marsh (2009) study the effects of

vouchers in Milwaukee, and find evidence of modest positive effects of private school

competition. However, the fact that in cross-section the degree of competition facing any given

school in Milwaukee is relatively similar and over time could be due to endogenous changes in

competition makes interpretation of evidence from Milwaukee more limited. Chakrabarti (2008)

and Hoxby (2003) make use of school-level differences in a Milwaukee school's percentage

eligible for vouchers, but one might be worried that schools with different levels of student

eligibility may be fundamentally different, and there is no arguably exogenous selection

mechanism. Other papers (e.g., Chakrabarti, 2007; Chiang, 2009; Figlio and Rouse, 2006;

Rouse et al., 2007; and West and Peterson, 2006) estimate the effects of receipt of an "F" grade

in Florida's school accountability system, because repeated receipt of the lowest grade triggered

voucher eligibility for students under the Opportunity Scholarship Program. But while these

papers find evidence that receipt of an "F" grade leads to improved student outcomes, it is

unclear to what extent these findings reflect the competitive effects of school vouchers versus the

performance effects of accountability pressure. Bohlmark and Lindahl (2008) and Sandstrom

and Bergstrom (2005) study the introduction of a voucher program in Sweden, but the principal

available outcomes are grades, rather than objective measures of test performance. In addition,

the Swedish evidence relies on changes in post-voucher private school enrollment for

identification, but expansion of the private sector is likely related to public school performance.

West and Woessmann (2008) make use of cross-country variation to find that countries with

more private schools have higher-performing public schools; they find evidence of a positive

cross-sectional relationship between the private school penetration and public school




                                                                                                      9
performance using historical Catholic shares as an instrument for private schooling. Gallego

(2006) presents similar evidence using a cross-section of Chilean localities in which the

historical stock of Catholic priests in a community serve as an instrument for current voucher

schools.


       The most similar work to ours in the present literature, a working paper by Chan and

McMillan (2009) written simultaneously with our paper, studies the effects of a tuition tax credit

that was phased in for two years in Ontario and then unexpectedly canceled. The authors take

advantage of the fact that some public schools were nearby a larger number of private schools at

the time of the voucher's introduction, an identification strategy that is fundamentally similar in

key respects to our own. They find that once Ontario began offering its tax credit, initially

valued at $700 and set to rise over time, public schools with a larger private school share in their

catchment area improved their students' test-passing rates, but these gains were not sustained

once the credit was ended.


       The Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program setting provides distinct advantages over

studying the Milwaukee voucher program or Florida's Opportunity Scholarship Program. The

voucher program being studied is not linked to an accountability system, so we are not

confounding voucher threats with accountability pressure, as is the case in studies that measure

the effects of "F" receipt under Florida's accountability plan. And unlike studies of the

Milwaukee program, we are able to observe data both before and after the introduction of the

voucher program, and take advantage of the fact that Florida is not a single educational market

like Milwaukee, a relatively small city from a spatial perspective. Our ability to study the

introduction of a voucher program at its outset, combined with our study of a state with a vast

variation in private school penetration on the eve of the program's introduction, offers


                                                                                                   10
considerable opportunities for causal identification of the effects of a school voucher program in

the United States.

       As mentioned above, our identification strategy is similar in nature to that of Chan and

McMillan's (2009) working paper using data from Ontario. Like Chan and McMillan, we find

evidence that the increased competitive pressure associated with school vouchers led to

improvements in public school performance. That said, our paper is distinct from theirs in a

number of key ways. First, we are able to investigate the effects of a voucher aimed at low-

income families, with a level of generosity that approaches the costs of sending a child to a

religious elementary school. The Ontario tuition tax credit began at a level sufficiently small that

it was unlikely to attract low-income families, and so was unlikely to lead to a demand shock for

that population. Our paper looks at the effects of a voucher on the types of schools unlikely to be

affected by the Ontario tax credit. Second, Florida's population is dramatically more disperse

than is Ontario's, as it has more than twenty major population centers as opposed to six,

affording us the ability to exploit a wider variety of cross-market differences in the nature of

private school competition. Third, while in Ontario families already enrolled in private schools

could collect tax credits, in Florida students must have spent a full year in the public schools to

collect a voucher. This fact means that the Florida voucher would work through the attraction of

new private school students rather than the subsidization of existing private school students.

       We are also able to identify the effects of school vouchers for sets of schools that

experience different levels of incentive to respond to changes in competitive pressure. We

consider two specific dimensions – school grade span and district Title I policies—that we

believe moderate the extent to which public schools will experience the voucher program as a

threat. With regard to grade span, we posit that voucher competition is likely to be more intense




                                                                                                      11
for elementary and middle schools, where the voucher covers a much larger fraction of the total

tuition bill, than for high schools. With regard to Title I policies, we use differences in schools’

likelihood of receiving Title I funds based on student body composition and district policies to

determine whether schools more at risk of losing Title I funds if they lose a few low-income

students respond more sharply to the policy than those whose Title I status is not in question.

       Finally, and most importantly, there was a year lag between when the policy was

announced (and students began actively applying for the school voucher) and when students

actually began attending private schools. Therefore, we are uniquely able to identify the pure

competitive effects of private school vouchers, absent the composition and resource effects of

vouchers. Taken together with the new Chan and McMillan (2009) findings, our results provide

strong evidence of the potential effects of school vouchers on the public school system.

school year, provides corporations with tax credits for donations that they make to FTC

organizations. These organizations, in turn, provide scholarships to students who qualify for free

or reduced-price lunch and who either attended a Florida public school for the full school year

before program entry, or who are entering kindergarten or first grade. With the exception of

these early grade private school students, students already attending private schools in Florida

are not eligible for first-time scholarships (though students who enter a private school on a

scholarship are eligible to retain their scholarships in future years, so long as their family income

remains below twice the federal poverty line.)




                                                                                                   12
           We exploit geographic variation in potential private school competition to estimate

differential effects of this program. Because we want to employ an identification strategy that is

not subject to reverse causation bias, we characterize geographic areas by the amount of private

school competition in existence before the program was announced; we have no reason to

believe that there was anticipatory entry by private schools, as the program had not been widely

discussed for long prior to its announcement, and no students could attend private schools using

a voucher in the year following announcement; students could only apply for school vouchers

during that year. Thus, while there was increased entry into the private school market following

the introduction of the program, our results do not identify program effects off of the entry of

these new private schools.

           To illustrate the nature of private schooling in the state of Florida on the eve of the

program's announcement, we examined parent reports of their children’s school attendance in the

5% microdata sample of the 2000 Census IPUMS. As seen in Table 1, private school attendance

was fairly widespread overall; 11.4% of Florida students aged 6-17 attended private schools.

Unsurprisingly, given the resource constraints of low-income students, private school attendance

rates were dramatically lower for this group. Among students in income groups that would

become eligible for the FTC program, only 5.4% attended private schools on the eve of the

voucher.

           One can see from Table 1 that metropolitan areas of Florida had very different levels of

private school penetration, as well as very different degrees to which low-income students

participated in private schooling prior to the introduction of the program.10 The share of low-

income students attending private schools varied widely in different metropolitan areas, ranging

from 1.4% attendance in Punta Gorda to 7.9% attendance in the Melbourne-Titusville-Cocoa-
10
     Metropolitan areas are ordered by school-age population for ease of apples-to-apples comparisons.


                                                                                                         13
Palm Bay area. Similar-sized metropolitan areas had very different levels of private school

penetration; for instance, Ocala and Tallahassee were nearly the same size, but Ocala's low-

income population share in private schooling was nearly twice that of Tallahassee's.

Interestingly, Tallahassee had a larger overall private school attendance share than Ocala, so the

variation across metropolitan areas is even more nuanced. We employ both cross-metropolitan

area and within-metropolitan area variation in private school penetration in this study, because

the concentration of existing private schools is not uniform across a metropolitan area. This

difference in penetration of private schools provides us with some degree of variation in the

extent to which public schools in different areas face competitive pressure from private schools

that could realistically entice away low-income students with FTC scholarships. We present

information on within-metropolitan area differences in private school competition in the next

section.



4. Data and Methods

4.1 Data: Our analysis draws on several sources of data from the state of Florida. The Florida

Department of Education (FDOE) publishes public and private school addresses, including

latitude and longitude measures for the public schools. The FDOE also publishes details on

public schools such as the grades that they receive from the FDOE, the grade ranges that they

serve, and the percent of their students that are subsidized lunch eligible. Identifying schools as

elementary, middle or high school grades is important because we match private school

competitors to public schools based on their grade levels served. In the cases in which the FDOE

did not report the grade ranges served, we deduced whether the school served elementary, middle




                                                                                                   14
or high school grades based on the grades of observed test-takers in the school. The schools

were then classified as elementary, middle, high, K-8, 6-12, or all grades.

        The address information was geocoded using ARCGis software to generate the

competition measures detailed below. Physical addresses were used to geocode private school

locations, yielding valid locations for 85% of private schools. We used latitude and longitude

data to locate the public schools, as this generated valid locations for a higher proportion of

schools than did using physical addresses. The geocoding process generated valid data for 89%

of the public schools, which were then matched to the student data.

       Test scores and demographic characteristics for all students in Florida public schools are

provided through FDOE's Education Data Warehouse. We also have information on the schools

that students attended during the year. Some students attended multiple schools during the school

year. Because we lacked information for the proportion of time students spent in each school, we

randomly assigned children observed in multiple schools to one of the schools in which they

were observed. Our analysis includes test score data from the 1999-2000 school year through the

2006-2007 school year. While we could have also included test score data for the 1998-1999

academic year, the first year of statewide student testing in Florida, we opted to begin our

analysis in 1999-2000 for two main reasons. First, the test scores in 1999-2000 are more

comparable to future years of data because the state calculated a developmental scale score on

the statewide criterion-referenced examination, the Florida Comprehensive Achievement Test

(FCAT). Second, 1999 is the first year in which Florida assigned letter grades to schools as part

of its school accountability program. Restricting our analysis to the post-accountability years

allows us to avoid any contaminating effects from the introduction of the accountability program

in the period prior to the introduction of the FTC scholarship program. As a further check, we




                                                                                                  15
also present additional evidence using a longer panel of older data to evaluate the potential

exogeneity of our measure of private school competition for public schools.

       Students classified as learning disabled were excluded from the analysis. Disabled

students are eligible for a more generous scholarship program, the McKay Scholarship Program,

and the new FTC program should therefore have had no additional effect on schools' efforts to

retain these students by improving their education. Indeed, applicants for vouchers under the

FTC program who were disabled and therefore eligible for a McKay Scholarship were directed

to that program instead. The full dataset includes 9,765,799 student-year observations, observed

over the 1999-2000 to 2006-2007 school years, for a total of 2,787,158 students. Because scores

for students in the same school in the same year are likely to be correlated, we cluster our

standard errors at the school-year level.



4.2 Measures: Our dependent measure is a student's developmental scale test scores on the

Florida Comprehensive Achievement Test, a criterion-referenced test used for school and student

accountability. To ease interpretation, test scores are standardized at the grade level.

       We use four primary measures to estimate the competitive pressure that public schools

face from private competitors. While our measures of competition are all variations on a similar

theme, we believe that it is important to report our results using a variety of competition

measures in order to help to ensure that our results are not due to a fortuitous choice of

competition measure. Our first measure is the crows-flight distance between the physical

addresses of each public school and the nearest private competitor. A private school qualifies as

a competitor to a public school if it serves any of the grades taught in that public school. We call

this the "distance" measure of competition. We find that, as Florida's population is heavily




                                                                                                  16
urban, the overwhelming majority of public schools have a private school within five miles.

Therefore, we restrict our analysis in this paper to schools with at least one private school within

five miles.

          Second, we consider the number of private competitors within a five mile radius of the

public school (“local” private competitors). We call this the "density" measure of competition.

The distance and density measures gauge whether easier access to a private school of any type

increased the competitive pressure on public schools when the new policy lowered the effective

price of private school for eligible students.

          Third, we consider the number of types of local private schools. A type is defined by

religious affiliation; schools self-identify as to their affiliation when reporting to the FDOE. We

identify 10 types of private schools, including non-religious; non-denominational or

multidenominational; Catholic; Protestant; Evangelical; Baptist; Islamic, Jewish; Christian

general (no specific denominational information); and other religious schools. A type is

considered to be represented if at least one school of that type is located within a five mile radius

of the public school. We call this the "diversity" measure of competition.

          In the final specification of the model, we use the counts of different types of schools

within a five mile radius to generate a modified Herfindahl index score for each school. We call

this the "concentration" measure of competition. The Herfindahl index is a measure of market

concentration given by the sum of the squares of the market shares held by each competitor. In

our measure, a "competitor" is defined as a religious (or secular) type r, and the share is given

       Count r
by:                  . Higher values of the Herfindahl index indicate a greater concentration of the
       Count
      R
                 r




share of private schools in the hands of one particular denomination or type of school. Thus, a



                                                                                                       17
Herfindahl index score of 1 indicates a monopoly on the private school market by one

denomination or type of school, while scores closer to 0 represent markets that are well-served

by a variety of denominations. These last two measures capture the variety of options available

to students; public schools in areas with a greater variety of options should feel more competitive

pressure in the wake of the policy change. In order to ease interpretation of our results, we report

the results of regression models in which we measure negative distance and one minus the

Herfindahl measure, so that all four measures' models would generate results in which a positive

coefficient means that more competition is associated with higher levels of student outcomes.

We also multiply the coefficients on the competition variables by 100 in our tables to be able to

distinguish between relatively small differences in effect sizes; descriptions of the effects in the

text convert the coefficients back to their natural metrics.

       The last three measures of competition are based on counts of private schools, and weight

large and small schools equally. We prefer count-based measures of competition because we

believe that it is more plausible for public school educators to know whether there are private

schools nearby than how large or small those private schools are, or how many potential slots

they have for voucher program participants. That said, we have also estimated models in which

we measure the total number of potential spaces available within a five mile radius (based on the

number of seats per grade level observed in the data) of the public school. The results of these

specifications are consistently along the same levels of statistical significance as those reported

in the paper; for instance, the relevant t-statistics from the model specification analogous to that

reported in Table 3 range from 10.6 to 13.4. Out of concern for paper length, we do not include

results of this competition measure in the paper, but the full set of results are available on

request.




                                                                                                      18
       Additional individual-level controls include demographic characteristics such as the sex

and race of the student (Black, Hispanic, Asian, or other race; White is the omitted category),

English language learner status, and free or reduced price lunch eligibility. These characteristics

are all reported by schools to the Florida Education Data Warehouse.

       Until 2000-01, Florida only tested students in a handful of grades; beginning in 2000-01

Florida began to test students in every grade from three through ten. Therefore, we do not

observe prior test scores for all students in our analysis. For this reason, and because we would

lose another pre-policy year of data were we to include them, our primary models do not include

lagged test scores for students, but we have estimated our models including lagged scores. In

general, the results that we present are weaker than the results that occur using the same sample

when we control for lagged test scores. If anything, therefore, we present estimates that are on

the modest side.

       We controlled for some time-varying characteristics of schools that affect the degree of

competitive pressure they may feel. Specifically, we controlled for the grades that schools

received from the FDOE in the prior year; schools with lower FDOE grades may feel particular

pressure to increase their scores to avoid accountability sanctions, independent of the effects of

the FTC policy. Missing dummy variables were included to preserve information for students in

schools for which these data were not reported. We also controlled for the percent of the school’s

student body that was eligible for free and reduced-price lunch. Finally, a series of year dummies

were included to account for time trends in scores.



4.3. Models: We use a series of fixed effects regression models to isolate the effect of

competitive pressures from private schools on public school performance. Our basic model is:




                                                                                                     19
        (1) Yist   s   C s * Pt   X it   S st   T  



where Yist represents the math (or reading) score for student i in school s in year t;  s represents

a fixed effect for school s; C s represents the measures of the competitive pressure faced by

school s; Pt is an indicator for whether year t is post-policy implementation;11 X it is a vector of

student characteristics, including sex, race, English language learner status, and eligibility for

free or reduced price lunch, for student i in year t; S st is a vector of tim-varying school

characteristics; T is a series of year dummies; and  represents an error term. The coefficient on

the competition measures interacted with the post-policy indicator, β, is our parameter of interest.

We estimate models with just the first year of the program -- before any students have left the

public schools but following the program's announcement -- as well as those with multiple post-

implementation years in order to gauge the evolution of the effects of the program over time.

Other models reported later in the program interact our competition measures with variables that

reflect how strongly schools might respond to the policy. In particular, schools might respond to

the policy more when they stand to lose more financial resources were a student to leave the

school or when they believe that students are more likely to leave the school. We take up these

considerations later in the paper.

        We report robust standard errors, clustered at the school-year level, in our regression

results. We have also estimated our models in which we have aggregated all data to the school

level, and find consistent results.

11
  In our first set of models, post-implementation is simply the year during which students are applying for vouchers
but none have left the public sector. We also estimate models with year-by-year post-implementation estimates. In
this case P can be thought of as a vector of post-implementation year variables.


                                                                                                                  20
4.4. Descriptive statistics: Table 2 reports descriptive statistics for the dependent and

independent measures used in the regressions. Most students in Florida had access to at least

some nearby private school options. The average distance from a child’s current public school to

the nearest private school option was 1.42 miles. Figure 1 shows the distribution of distance

between a child’s current public school to the nearest private school that served at least some of

the same grades as the public school for all students, and for eligible students specifically. These

graphs indicate that most students, regardless of program eligibility, attended public schools with

private competitors that were within five miles of the public school, although eligible students

tended to attend schools with a slightly closer nearest competitor than did non-eligible students.

       Moreover, students generally had access to a relatively large number of schools, and a

fairly diverse sampling of types of schools, within five miles of their public schools. Students

attended schools that had an average of 13.97 private competitors within a five mile radius,

representing an average of 5.02 different types of religious (or secular) affiliations (Table 2).

Figures 2 and 3 show the distribution of number of schools within a five mile radius of students’

public schools and the number of types within that radius, respectively. Eligible students tended

to have a greater number of private school competitors within a five mile radius of their public

schools and a greater number of types of denominations among those competitors than did the

population at large. Finally, Figure 4 shows the distribution of Herfindahl index scores. As can

be seen in the graph, a sizeable fraction of public schools face just one type of private

competitor, leading to a Herfindahl index of one. In order to have a higher value of this

concentration measure equate to higher degrees of competition, we operationalize this variable as

one minus the Herfindahl index in our regression models.




                                                                                                    21
       The degree of variation in these figures is somewhat unsurprising since our data draw

from the entire state. However, even within metropolitan areas, a high degree of variation in

competition measures exists. Figures 5 through 8 present box-and-whisker plots of the

distributions of our four competition measures in each of the eight most populous school districts

in Florida. As can be seen, there exist considerable differences both within and between

metropolitan areas in different parts of the state. Therefore, our analyses are driven both by

within-area and between-area differences in the level of potential voucher competition faced by

schools.



5. Results



5.1. Immediate effects of the introduction of the voucher program: There are three main ways in

which the introduction of a school voucher could affect public school performance. Public

schools could react to private school competition by altering their policies, practices, or effort --

the direct competitive effect of school vouchers. In addition, school vouchers could affect public

schools by changing the set of students who attend the school; if students are positively selected

into private schools with the voucher, this could lead to a reduced-ability clientele remaining in

the public schools, or vice versa. Figlio, Hart and Metzger (2009) find that the voucher program

led to negative selection into the private schools, indicating that the ability levels of those

remaining in the public sector are higher than before. In the presence of positive peer effects,

this could mean that part of a positive "competitive" effect of vouchers is the changing of the

composition of the public school student body. A third possibility is that, so long as only a few

students leave a public school with school vouchers, the vouchers could have a positive resource




                                                                                                    22
effect on public schools, as effective per-pupil resources might increase due to the indivisibility

of classroom teachers. On the other hand, especially in Title I schools (which comprise a

majority of public schools in Florida), losing students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches

results in resource reductions that could affect student outcomes as well.

       It is possible to eliminate the composition and resource effects of school vouchers and

concentrate solely on the competition effects of school vouchers by looking only at the first year

of the voucher program -- in the 2001-02 school year, after the program's announcement but

before students could actually leave the public schools on a voucher -- in comparison with prior

years before the program was announced. During this entire academic year, students in the

public schools were applying for private school vouchers but had not yet left for the private

schools. We therefore begin with school fixed effects estimates of the effects of competition on

student performance in the first year of the program, when students were applying for school

vouchers but none had yet left the public schools.

       The results of this first analysis are reported in Table 3, in which the point estimates (with

standard errors clustered at the school-year level) of the key competition variable for the four

alternative models of competition are reported. As can be seen in the table, all four measures of

competition are positively and significantly related to student performance. Every mile the

nearest private school moves closer, public school math performance increases by 0.015 of a

standard deviation (0.014 in reading.) Likewise, a one standard deviation increase in the number

of nearby private schools increases test scores by about 0.02 to 0.03 of a standard deviation in

reading and math; a one standard deviation increase in the variety of nearby private schools

increases scores in both subjects by about 0.02 of a standard deviation. A one standard deviation

increase in the (negative) concentration of private schools nearby is associated with about a 0.01




                                                                                                     23
of a standard deviation increase in reading and math test scores. While these estimated effects

are modest in magnitude, they are very precisely estimated and indicate a positive relationship

between private school competition and student performance in the public schools even before

any students leave the public sector to go to the private sector.12 That is, these results provide a

first piece of evidence that public schools responded to the threat of losing students to the private

schools via the voucher program.

        The third column of Table 3 presents the results of a model in which the dependent

variable is the average of a student's standardized reading and standardized math exam (or the

single exam score in the case of a student taking just one or the other.) We do this for two

reasons: First, in 1999-2000, elementary students took only one test or the other, but not both, in

the same year, so aggregating the two tests into the same dependent variable ensures that we

include all test-taking students in the same model. Second, we combine the two tests so that we

do not need to report two sets of regression results in all subsequent tables. Nonetheless, the

three columns yield nearly identical results.

        It may be that the levels of existing private school competition merely reflect the effects

of being in more densely populated areas that are changing over time. We therefore repeat the

analysis reported in column three, but also control for the log of the number of students attending

public schools within a five mile radius of the public school in question. As can be seen,

controlling for this measure of public school student density leads to a very modest reduction in

the point estimates of the effects of voucher competition, though the overall magnitudes and

statistical significance levels remain basically unchanged. We can conclude that any correlation


12
  We have also estimated these models aggregated to the school-by-year level and continue to see strong positive
and statistically significant estimated effects of private school competition on public school performance. These
results are available on request. We therefore conclude that regardless of whether we estimate student-level models
with clustered standard errors or aggregated models, the fundamental results remain unaltered.


                                                                                                                 24
between public school student density and private school concentration measures is not driving

our estimates of the competitive threats of vouchers. We focus the remainder of the paper on

specifications based on that reported in the third column of Table 3.

       One potential concern is that any apparent competitive effects of private schools on

public school performance picked up in regressions may simply reflect superior performance by

schools that have close competitors, regardless of whether or not scholarships are offered to low-

income students. For instance, perhaps schools of all different types are more likely to open up

in areas with a large concentration of high-income families. This would produce a spurious

positive correlation between public school scores (since high-income children tend to outperform

their low-income peers on standardized tests, on average) and competition (McEwan, 2000).

While the school fixed effect would control for this in a cross-sectional regression, school fixed

effects will not remove spurious correlations between competition measures and longitudinal

score gains, or in trends over time in the performance of public schools in a community.

Therefore, it is useful to test how competition and public school performance levels and

longitudinal trends were related prior to the introduction of the policy.

       One test for whether there were differences in student performance based on the strength

of competition prior to the introduction of the FTC scholarship program involves estimating

models that include a one-year lead of the policy -- in the 2000-01 school year before the policy

was announced. If schools with nearby private schools were improving over time, one would

expect to observe positive coefficients on these policy lead variables. Indeed, as seen in Table 4,

we do observe modest positive coefficients on the lead of the policy variable -- statistically

significant in two of the four models -- suggesting that there may be some evidence that public

schools with more nearby private schools (and a larger number of nearby private school types)




                                                                                                  25
had been improving prior to the voucher program. That said, the coefficients on the lead of the

policy variable are at most one-fifth of the magnitudes of the corresponding coefficients on the

first year of the policy, suggesting that a break from trend has been taking place. Unfortunately,

Florida did not collect a long panel of statewide data prior to the policy introduction that would

allow us to gauge the presence of long-term trends. The results with the lead of the policy

variable indicate that it is also important to see whether the policy had differential estimated

effects on the schools for which we would expect to see larger impacts.

         Because we have only two years of pre-program data, we cannot rule out the possibility

that public schools with a larger amount of private school competition nearby had been on a

different growth trajectory during the period of time prior to the policy's introduction. We can,

however, use a different data source to investigate the potential presence of longer trends in

public school performance. Prior to the policy's introduction, each Florida school district

administered its own nationally-normed standardized test (generally the Stanford Achievement

Test, Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills or the Iowa Test of Basic Skills), and the three most

populous school districts in the state (Broward County, Miami-Dade County, and Palm Beach

County) have provided us with school average reading and math performance on the relevant

standardized tests for the years prior to the policy's introduction.13 Figures 9 through 12 present

graphs showing the relationships between our four private school competition measures and

school-level changes in average national percentile rankings in reading and mathematics from

1996-97, five years before the policy introduction to 2000-01, the year before the policy

introduction. As can be seen in the graphs, there is no apparent relationship between the level of


13
  These three counties yield results that are roughly representative of the rest of the state. Were we to restrict our
Table 4 analysis to just these three counties, the figures in the first column would be 2.218 (with a standard error of
0.680) for distance; 0.216 (with a standard error of 0.040) for density; 0.955 (with a standard error of 0.256) for
diversity; and 4.690 (with a standard error of 3.210) for concentration.


                                                                                                                     26
private school competition present in 2000 (when we measure competition for the purposes of

our analyses) and over-time changes in school-level test performance. The correlations between

the competition measures and changes in test performance in the long difference are -0.086 for

distance, -0.023 for density, +0.014 for diversity, and +0.006 for concentration.

         Moreover, year-by-year comparisons demonstrate that there was no general improvement

trend in the schools with more local private school competitors. Results of school fixed effect

regressions of school-year average test scores in the three school districts on year dummies and

year-specific leads of the competition measures indicate that there is no consistent pattern in the

relationship between 2000 levels of competition measures and the leads of the policy over the

longer time horizon.14 For example, with regard to the diversity measure of competition, the

coefficients of the interaction between competition and dummies for 1997-98, 1998-99 and

1999-2000, compared with 1996-97, are -0.17, -0.17 and -0.18.15 The same three coefficients for

the density measure of competition are +0.02, +0.00 and -0.04, and for the concentration

measure the three coefficients are -3.0, -3.6 and -2.1. For the distance measure of competition

there is a trend over these three years (coefficients of +0.19, -0.09, and -0.17) but they follow no

apparent pattern as compared with 1996-97 or 2000-01 and none are statistically distinct from

one another. Therefore, while we cannot rule out with absolute certainty the possibility that

long-term trends are responsible for our results, the available evidence contradicts that

explanation.

         Out of concern that results may be driven by particular districts that house a large

proportion of the students in the state, we estimate the same analysis excluding, one at a time,

each county in the state. We find consistent evidence that, regardless of which county is

dropped, the signs and general significance levels of the competition interactions are maintained.

That said, the magnitudes of our key findings are notably smaller when we exclude Dade

County, home of Miami and the largest county in the state. When Dade County is excluded, the

magnitude of our estimated effects of voucher competition effects fall by between 10 and 20

percent, though remain statistically significant at effectively the same levels as when Dade

County is included in the analysis. No other county apparently affects our findings at all, as

when we drop any of the other 66 Florida counties, our results remain virtually identical to the

full-state analysis. Therefore, it is difficult to believe that some combination of counties is

driving the general nature of our results, though the results are clearly stronger in the case of

Dade County than in the rest of the state.



5.3. Differential estimated effects by incentives to respond: One would expect that some schools

would have a greater degree of incentive to respond to potential competition associated with

school vouchers aimed at low-income students than would others. We consider two major ways

in which schools may face different incentives to react to competitive pressure. First, we suspect

that elementary and middle schools will have more of an incentive to respond to competitive

pressure than would high schools because the vouchers cover so much more of the share of

private school tuition and fees in the early grades versus in the high school grades. While the

differences in the share covered might not be salient for higher-income families (and therefore

estimation of differences in responsiveness across school levels might not be as relevant in the

case of a universal tuition tax credit like the one studied by Chan and McMillan (2009)) the

difference in out-of-pocket expenses between an elementary or middle school and a high school




                                                                                                    28
might be strongly prohibitive for many low-income families. Public high schools, knowing this,

might not react as strongly to voucher competition as would public elementary and middle

schools. Second, we suspect that public schools who stand to gain or lose the largest amounts of

revenues depending on how many voucher-eligible students they retain would be more

responsive than would those schools less likely to lose large amounts of revenues. We take

advantage of plausibly naturally-occurring variation across the 67 Florida school districts in the

implementation of the federal Title I program in an attempt to gain purchase on this second

question.

       There exists strong evidence to believe that the costs of attending a private school on a

voucher would be more prohibitive in the case of high schools than in the case of elementary and

middle schools, given that the voucher is capped at the same level regardless of the school level.

In the case of the two Scholarship Funding Organizations that serve the southern half of Florida

(Florida P.R.I.D.E. and the Carrie Meek Foundation) we have access to the actual out-of-pocket

costs incurred by families for tuition, fees and books for students who participate in the voucher.

As can be seen in Figure 13, the typical out-of-pocket expense is considerably higher for voucher

participants in high school than it is for voucher participants in elementary and middle school.

While the typical out-of-pocket expense post-voucher for elementary and middle school students

is close to zero, it is around two thousand dollars for a high school student. That this is a

substantial amount of money for the low-income families eligible for school vouchers in Florida

is reinforced by the findings reported in Figure 14. In order to send a child to a high school

using a school voucher, the typical family must spend over one-tenth of its family income per

student, more than twice the share of family income necessary to send a child to an elementary or

middle school using a voucher.




                                                                                                   29
         Table 5 presents the estimated effects of increased private school competition through the

school voucher on combined public school test scores, broken down by elementary and middle

schools versus high schools. As can be seen, in each of the four model specifications, the

estimated effect of voucher competition is sizably and statistically significantly stronger in the

case of elementary and middle schools than in the case of high schools. In all four cases, the

magnitude of the estimated effect in lower school levels is two to three times the estimated

magnitude of the effect in high schools. This provides the first piece of evidence that public high

schools were less responsive to private school competition that came about through the voucher

program than were public elementary and middle schools.

         We next consider whether public schools that face increased financial incentives to

respond to voucher competition do so. As mentioned above, all public schools may experience

resource effects as a consequence of losing students to private schools on the voucher. However,

no schools have as large of an incentive to retain free or reduced-price lunch eligible students as

those who are on the margin of receiving federal Title I aid. These federal resources, which

average more than $500 per pupil, are directed to school districts, which then allocate them to the

elementary and middle schools where low-income students attend.16 Not every public school

with low-income students receives Title I aid; indeed, in 2001-02, 61 percent of elementary

schools and 31 percent of middle schools statewide received Title I aid. Title I aid is allocated

based on where schools rank within the school district; the highest-poverty schools receive Title

I aid while the lower-poverty schools do not, and the poverty threshold that generates Title I

funding differs considerably from district to district. In some school districts, generally very

small, rural districts, all elementary or middle schools are Title I schools, and school districts

16
  In Florida, high schools do not receive Title I funding. The potential loss of Title I funding is therefore another
possible reason for the differences in estimated effects of voucher competition for elementary and middle schools
versus high schools.


                                                                                                                        30
also have discretion to limit Title I funding to elementary schools. In Florida, the overwhelming

majority (92 percent) of Title I schools are considered "Schoolwide" Title I schools, where the

Title I aid is not required to follow individual students per se but can be spent anywhere in the

school (as the school is considered to be sufficiently low-income that all uses of the money

would likely serve low-income students.) The remaining eight percent of Title I schools are

considered "targeted assistance" schools, where the school's allocation for Title I must be spent

on the low-income students themselves.17 In either case, there is a large discrete jump in funding

for a school that comes with being considered a Title I school versus not being a Title I school.

         Title I funding, and the number of schools receiving Title I aid in Florida, began rising

monotonically starting in 1999, and schools that were just below the 2001-02 cutoff for Title I

aid were likely to believe that they stood a good chance of receiving Title I aid in 2002-03.18

The likely expansion of Title I funds, which enjoyed strong bipartisan support in Congress, was

well-known to Florida schools for all or most of the 2001-02 school year, according to

conversations with school officials. While we do not know when exactly schools knew what the

Title I cutoff for the next year in their school district would be, it is reasonable to believe that

schools already receiving Title I funding in 2001-02 were relatively secure in the knowledge that

they would likely continue to receive funding in 2002-03, and the poorest schools not yet

receiving Title I funding in 2001-02 might expect that, should they not lose many low-income

students to private schools via the voucher, they might themselves become Title I schools in the

next year.


17
   This differs from the nation as a whole. Nationally, just over half of all Title I schools were schoolwide Title I
schools in 2001-02.
18
   The reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act on January 8, 2002, and the signing of the
associated appropriations law on January 10, 2002, further increased the level of Title I spending, though less in
Florida than in other states. Nonetheless, this is likely to have reinforced the belief that schools close to the 2001-02
Title I cutoff might qualify for Title I the following year were they to not lose many qualifying students.


                                                                                                                      31
       We envision that, in 2001-02, during which time public school students were applying for

school vouchers, there were five different groups of public elementary and middle schools: (1)

schools in districts where every school of a given level receives Title I funding; (2) schools in

districts where no school in that given level receives Title I funding; (3) schools that received

Title I funding in 2001-02 and, we suspect, expected to continue to receive funding in 2002-03;

(4) schools on the margin of Title I funding in 2001-02 who might have expected to receive

funding in 2002-03 were they to not lose many low-income students; and (5) schools below this

margin who likely expected not to receive funding in 2002-2003. Of the 67 school districts, 30

districts identified all elementary schools as Title I schools, and 15 districts identified all middle

schools as Title I schools in 2001-02 (group 1). All school districts had at least one Title I

elementary school in 2001-02, but in 24 districts no middle schools were Title I schools (group

2). Of schools receiving Title I in 2001-02 (group 3), nearly 96 percent continued to receive

Title I funding in 2002-03, indicating that ex post the presumption that with increased generosity

would come some measure of Title I security appears to be accurate.

       It is not obvious how to draw the dividing line between groups 4 and 5, so we choose to

be agnostic and look instead at how the school districts redrew their Title I allocation thresholds

between 2001-02 and 2002-03. Specifically, we consider a school to be in group 4 if their 2001-

02 student free/reduced-price lunch share is below the 2001-02 threshold for inclusion but above

what would be the district's 2002-03 threshold for inclusion, and we consider a school in group 5

if its 2001-02 free/reduced-price lunch share is below what would be the district's 2002-03

threshold for inclusion. This distinction appears to be discerning: 40 percent of our group 4

schools ultimately received Title I funding in 2002-03, while only 5 percent of group 5 schools

did. In 17 school districts, the threshold for elementary school Title I inclusion was lower in




                                                                                                    32
2002-03 than it was in 2001-02, as compared with one district in which the threshold increased.

In five school districts, the threshold for middle school Title I inclusion was lower in 2002-03

than it was in 2001-02, while it increased in two districts. Hence, while we do not know how

much schools knew about their prospects for receiving Title I aid the next year, this definition at

least allows us to speculate as to which schools might have been on the margin of Title I receipt.

We are particularly interested in the differential effects of voucher competition for group 4, these

schools that we consider to be on the margin.

        We estimate separate effects of voucher competition for three groups -- groups 1 (always-

receivers in district), 2 (never-receivers in district), and 4 (on the margin of Title I receipt) --

relative to groups 3 (almost sure receivers) and 5 (almost sure non-receivers), which we lump

together for now. Table 6 reports the differential estimated effects of voucher competition for

these different groups. The estimated effect of competition for schools in districts where they

would always receive Title I aid tends to be negative, though it is only statistically significantly

different from zero in the case of the concentration measure of competition. The estimated

effects of competition for those schools that never receive Title I follows the same patterns as the

estimated effects for "almost sure Title I" schools and "almost sure not Title I" schools. The

estimated effect of private school competition for schools that we measure to be in group 4, on

the other hand, is always positive and strongly statistically significantly different from the other

groups of schools. This result indicates that public schools that are likely to receive Title I aid in

the next year if they retain their low-income students, but not if they don't, tend to

disproportionately improve in the voucher-threat year.

        Title I assistance is not the only way in which program-eligible students might plausibly

bring resources to a school. Schools on average tend to receive more funding from their districts




                                                                                                       33
the more students they have in the school, and therefore these students -- like all other students --

could generate resources for the school. We therefore repeat the same exercise, but now also

include the 2001-02 percentage eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (interacted with a dummy

variable for post-policy and with that dummy for post-policy times the competition measure, as

is the case with the other interacted variables. This interaction allows us to consider both ways

in which more program-eligible students might bring more revenues to a school. There is no

need to interact the 2001-02 percentage free or reduced-price lunch with the competition

measure, as this interaction is subsumed into the school fixed effect.) The results of this

specification are reported in Table 7. The findings from Table 6 remain basically unchanged,

and that in two of the four specifications there is a positive and significant relationship between

the estimated effects of the degree of competition and the percentage in the school eligible to

receive a school voucher. These results again indicate that the schools on the margin of

becoming Title I eligible -- the schools that would gain considerably were they to become Title I

eligible -- are also the schools that apparently respond the most to the competitive threats of

school vouchers. There is consistent evidence that the schools with the biggest incentives to

improve as a result of the voucher program were the schools that improved.



5.4. Longer-term estimates of the effects of school vouchers: We also investigate whether the

estimated effects of the voucher program persist to later years. After the first year of the

program, in addition to the competitive effects of the program there are also resource and

composition effects as students leave the public schools for private schools under the voucher

program. These results can be seen in Table 8, which presents results of models that include

year-by-year estimates of the effects of the voucher program competition as well as leads of the




                                                                                                    34
policy. Table 8 shows that the estimated effects of the voucher program grow stronger over

time; this could be due to increased knowledge of the program which might contribute to greater

competitive pressure or to composition and resource effects. It is difficult to disentangle the

reasons for this strengthening over time in the estimated effects of the voucher program.



6. Discussion

       Our results indicate that the increased competitive pressure faced by public schools

associated with the introduction of Florida's FTC Scholarship Program led to general

improvements in public school performance. Both greater ease of access to private school

options (measured by the distance and density measures) and the variety of options that students

have in terms of the religious (or secular) affiliations of private schools (measured by the

diversity and concentration index measures) are positively associated with public school

students’ test scores following the introduction of the FTC policy. The gains occur immediately,

before students left the public schools to use a voucher, implying that competitive threats are

responsible for at least some of the estimated effects of the voucher program. The gains appear

to be much more pronounced in the schools most at risk to lose students (elementary and middle

schools, where the price of private school attendance with a voucher is much lower) and in the

schools that are on the margin of Title I funding (with the attendant increases in revenues that

might accrue.)

       That said, our study has several limitations. First, our measures of competition reflect the

state of the private school market in 2001, before private schools had a chance to respond to the

FTC scholarship program. Although that ensures that the competition measure is not

endogenous to post-policy test scores, it does give a less accurate view of the competitive




                                                                                                   35
pressures faced by schools as more time passes following the introduction of the FTC program.

However, since we view this measure of competition as an instrument for the true degree of

competition faced by public schools, these are likely to be conservative estimates of the effects

of competitive pressures on public school students’ test scores.

        Second, our study includes only Florida data. It is possible that the dynamics between

competitive pressures and public students’ test scores are systematically different in Florida than

in the rest of the nation. In particular, over 90 percent of Florida’s students live in the top 20

most populous metropolitan areas represented in Table 1. In states with a greater share of the

population in rural areas, the effects of a voucher program may not exert the same degree of

competitive pressure on public schools. (That said, in sensitivity testing we do find evidence that

rural schools with nearby private alternatives respond similarly to urban and suburban schools

with similar levels of measured competition.) It may also be the case that Florida's diverse range

of private school options may mean that Florida has a larger amount of private school

competition in existence relative to other places. To the extent that this is true, it limits the

study's generalizability. Nonetheless, this study indicates that private school competition,

brought about by the infusion of means-tested scholarships aimed at low-income families, could

have sizeable effects on the performance of traditional public schools.

students enrolled in private schools statewide, with approximately 50,000 coming from
families with incomes below 185 percent of the poverty line.

Notes: Each cell represents the key coefficient estimate (on the interaction between the measure of
pre-policy private school penetration and a post-policy indicator) from a separate regression model.
Coefficients are multiplied by 100 for interpretability. Standard errors that adjust for clustering at the
school-year level are beneath parameter estimates. Estimated effects of a one-standard-deviation
change in the competition variables are presented in square brackets beneath standard errors. The
dependent variable is a student's standardized test score in reading or math (or the average of the
standardized reading+math scores.) Controls include sex, race dummies, subsidized lunch eligibility
dummies, English language learner dummies, year dummies, percent of student body eligible for free
or reduced price lunch and the school's prior year grade from the Florida Department of Education, as
well as school fixed effects. The final column includes the log of the number of public school
students within five miles as an additional control. Data come from 1999-2000 through 2001-02
years only. There are more observations for the average of reading and math scores because in 1999-
2000 elementary-aged students took reading and math examinations in different grades. Coefficients
marked ***, **, * and + are statistically significant at the 0.001, 0.01, 0.05 and 0.10 levels,

pre-policy private school penetration and a post-policy indicator) broken down by elementary/middle
versus high school status. Coefficients are multiplied by 100 for interpretability. Standard errors that
adjust for clustering at the school-year level are beneath parameter estimates. The dependent
variable is a student's standardized test score in reading or math. Controls include sex, race
dummies, subsidized lunch eligibility dummies, English language learner dummies, year dummies,
percent of student body eligible for free or reduced price lunch and the school's prior year grade from
the Florida Department of Education, as well as school fixed effects. All relevant two-way
interactions are included as control variables. Data come from 1999-2000 through 2001-02 years
only. Coefficients marked ***, **, * and + are statistically significant at the 0.001, 0.01, 0.05 and
0.10 levels, respectively. All models have 2,761,350 observations in 7751 school-by-year clusters,
an a R-squared of 0.281.
