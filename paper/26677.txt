The cost of being too patient

                                      ABSTRACT

We study the cost of being too patient on happiness. We find that the relationship between
patience and various measures of subjective well-being is hump-shaped: it exists an optimal
amount of patience that maximizes happiness. Beyond this optimal level, higher levels of
patience have a negative impact on well-being.

Notes: The unit of observation is an individual. The different measures of happiness are defined in the text. The measure of patience comes from Falk et al. (2018). All
regressions include country fixed effects and the following individual controls: a quadratic in age, gender (a female dummy), education (dummies for having high school
and up to some college, college or more ­ the excluded group is individuals with less than high school), marital status (dummies indicating if a person is married or in a
domestic partnership, separated or divorced, single ­ the excluded group is widows), labor market status (dummies for unemployed and out of the labor force ­ the
excluded group is employed individuals), and household income (expressed in log). Coefficients are reported with standard errors clustered at the country level. ***
Significant at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level.

Notes: The unit of observation is an individual. The different measures of happiness are defined in the text.
The measure of patience comes from Falk et al. (2018). All regressions include country fixed effects and the
following individual controls: a quadratic in age, gender (a female dummy), education (dummies for having
high school and up to some college, college or more ­ the excluded group is individuals with less than high
school), marital status (dummies indicating if a person is married or in a domestic partnership, separated or
divorced, single ­ the excluded group is widows), labor market status (dummies for unemployed and out of
the labor force ­ the excluded group is employed individuals), and household income (expressed in log).
Coefficients are reported with standard errors clustered at the country level. *** Significant at the 1 percent
level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level.

Notes: The unit of observation is an individual. The different measures of happiness are defined in the text. The measure of patience comes from Falk et al. (2018). All
regressions include country fixed effects and the following individual controls: a quadratic in age, gender (a female dummy), education (dummies for having high school and
up to some college, college or more ­ the excluded group is individuals with less than high school), marital status (dummies indicating if a person is married or in a domestic
partnership, separated or divorced, single ­ the excluded group is widows), labor market status (dummies for unemployed and out of the labor force ­ the excluded group is
employed individuals), and household income (expressed in log). Coefficients are reported with standard errors clustered at the country level. *** Significant at the 1 percent
level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level.
