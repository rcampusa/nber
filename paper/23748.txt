We uncover political dynamics that reward and reinforce increases in US health spending by
studying the passage of the 2003 Medicare Modernization (MMA). We focus on a provision
added to the MMA, which allowed hospitals to apply for temporary Medicare payment increases.
Hospitals represented by members of Congress who voted ‘Yea’ to the MMA were more likely to
receive payment increases. The payment increases raised local health spending and led to
suggestive increases in health sector employment. Members of Congress representing hospitals
that got a payment increase received large increases in campaign contributions before and after
the program was extended.

        “In the past, decisions on health care delivery were largely professional ones.
        Now the decisions will be largely political.” – John G. Veneman, undersec-
        retary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) in the
        Nixon administration, discussing the effect of the growing role of the federal
        government in the US health care system.1


1    Introduction

In 2018, the United States (US) spent $3.6 trillion on health care, of which more than $1
trillion was funded by the federal government (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
2018). From the 1970s to present, in each successive decade, health spending has grown
more quickly than gross domestic product (GDP) (Kamal and Cox 2018). Both because
of the scale of government spending on health care in the US and evidence that the US
health system is inefficient relative to other countries, the level of health spending and the
growth in health spending over time represent significant policy challenges domestically
(Garber and Skinner 2008). However, until now, most research has focused on studying
the influence of demand and supply side factors—e.g., patient demographics, cost sharing,
provider incentives, the diffusion of new technologies, and provider consolidation—on the
variation and growth in U.S. health spending.2 In this paper, we present some of the first
work to formally explore how congressional politics influence health care spending in the
US. We show that members of Congress receive benefits—increases in health spending, jobs
in their districts, and campaign contributions—in the wake of votes they took that raised
Medicare reimbursement rates for hospitals in their districts. We also illustrate the lobbying
and political dynamics that allow provisions that raise health spending to get added to laws
and persist as policy. As a result, this paper both is informative about factors that influence
health spending in the US and adds to the wider political economy literature assessing the
    1 Quotedin Iglehart (1971) as cited in Starr (1983).

relationship between legislators’ actions, local benefits, and campaign contributions.
   To analyze the influence of politics on health spending, we study events leading up to
and following passage of the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003, a law which
gave government-funded prescription drug coverage to seniors via the introduction of the
Medicare Part D program. The MMA of 2003 was politically fraught and challenging to pass.
It involved a large increase in government spending and required support from Democratic
legislators reticent about supporting an initiative championed by a Republican president
and support from Republican lawmakers who were not naturally in favor of expansions
of government programs. The MMA of 2003 was ultimately approved by Congress in
November 2003 by a five-vote margin in a vote that involved significant political bartering
(Oliver, Lee, and Lipton 2004).
   Whereas most of the literature on the MMA of 2003 has analyzed the impact of the law
on individuals who received Part D drug insurance (for example, see Abaluck and Gruber
(2011), Abaluck and Gruber (2016), Joyce et al. (2009)), we use the law to examine how
the political process necessary to pass sweeping health care legislation impacts long-run
health spending, local employment, lobbying, and campaign contributions. We focus on
the impact of a provision inserted into the MMA of 2003—Section 508—which created
a process through which hospitals could apply to receive an increase in their regulated
Medicare payments. Crucially, the rules governing which hospitals received increases in
their reimbursements from Section 508 were written by the executive branch after the MMA
was passed. This allowed officials to potentially steer funds to specific hospitals and regions
(that would then benefit specific politicians) after seeing how members voted.
   Our analysis proceeds in four stages. First, we present evidence that Medicare hospital
payment increases generated by the Section 508 program were used as a bartering tool to
win political support. We identify, via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the
hospitals that applied for and were granted a Section 508 waiver. We find evidence that

                                              3
hospitals represented by a member of the House of Representatives who voted ‘Yea’ to the
MMA of 2003 were more likely to receive a payment increase than hospitals represented by
a member of the House who voted ‘Nay’ to the law. These empirical findings are consistent
with press reporting about efforts to win votes during the passage of the MMA of 2003 (Lee
2003).
   Second, we show that these Medicare payment increases generated by the Section 508
program materially impacted hospital behavior and led to a large aggregate increase in
health care spending. We identify, via difference-in-difference analysis, that hospitals that
received a payment bump generated by the Section 508 program increased the number of
inpatient Medicare cases they delivered by approximately seven percent and raised their
inpatient Medicare payments by 11 percent. We also find suggestive evidence that hospitals
that received this payment increase - particularly those with the largest monetary gains from
the program - invested in new technology and increased their staffing and payroll. It is
notable that original language in Section 508 in the MMA only allocated $900 million to
fund the program for three years. Nevertheless, the program was repeatedly extended by
Congress, lasted for eight years, and, as we illustrate, resulted in the federal government
spending many multiples more than was initially allocated.
   Third, we show that the Section 508 program brought tangible benefits to members’
districts. This is informative about why the Section 508 program (and programs like it)
are added to laws in the first place. We find that local federal health spending went up
by millions per congressional district and we observe suggestive evidence that there was
the creation of hundreds of new health care jobs in congressional districts with a Section
508-recipient hospital. The impact of the Section 508 program was greatest in the districts
that were the most exposed to the Section 508 program.
   Finally, we show how provisions like the Section 508 program, once signed into law,
become extremely difficult to eliminate. While the payment changes created by the Section

                                             4
508 program were originally written to expire three years after they were introduced,
the hospitals and wider constituencies that benefited from the waivers had considerable
interest in seeing the program extended. Indeed, their shared financial interest in the
continuance of the program was so great that Section 508-recipient hospitals joined together
to form a political action committee (PAC) called the Section 508 Hospital Coalition.3
Using data from the Center for Responsive Politics, we find that the Section 508 Hospital
Coalition spent significant resources lobbying members of Congress to extend the Section
508 program. Using data on campaign contributions from the Database on Ideology, Money
in Politics, and Elections (DIME), we find that members of Congress representing Section
508-recipient hospitals received large increases in campaign contributions after the program
was reauthorized. Likewise, we observe suggestive evidence that there were large increases
in campaign contributions to members representing Section 508-recipient hospitals from
individuals working in the hospital sector immediately before the vote to reauthorize the
Section 508 program and again after the law was passed. We do not find corresponding
increases in campaign contributions from individuals working in sectors that were plausibly
wholly unexposed to changes in hospital Medicare reimbursements - individuals working in
the agriculture sector and the oil and gas industry.
    This paper makes three distinct contributions to the literature. First, we present some of
the first work to formally show a link between the US political process and domestic health
spending. While it is assumed that politics influences health spending, this is largely based
on conjecture, theory, and reporting from journalists. We study a specific setting that allows
for robust identification and provide evidence of how political dynamics and the actions of
Congress influence health spending.
    This analysis provides suggestive evidence of a feedback loop that illustrates why
provisions like the Section 508 program get added to laws and then become exceedingly

hard to eliminate. Our evidence suggests that politicians use Medicare payment increases as
a tool to win votes from members of Congress. It is clear from our analysis that increases in
Medicare payments can lead to large increases in hospital spending and substantive changes
in local labor markets. The benefits of narrow provisions, like the Section 508 program, are
substantive enough that they precipitate the formation of PACs and substantial lobbying
efforts to see them extended. Moreover, members of Congress see an increase in campaign
contributions once these types of programs are extended. This feedback loop may help
explain, in part, why it is so challenging to reduce US health spending in the long run.
Simply put, we observed that legislators were rewarded for votes that raised health spending
in their districts.
    While we focus on a program that impacted approximately 100 hospitals, the dynamics
we observe—health spending generating local benefits and leading to increases in donations
for members of Congress—can inform our understanding of the wider allocation of tens
of billions of dollars in health spending. Indeed, the Medicare program alone spends
approximately $750 billion annually. There are a myriad of other programs similar to
Section 508, which were added to wider pieces of legislation, were rumored to be political,
and which led to billions of dollars in higher Medicare spending via increasing the rates
that hospitals get reimbursed by the government.4 Focusing on the Section 508 program in
particular provides a useful setting that affords clean identification.
    The political dynamics we observe also help explain how seemingly inefficient Medicare
programs remain funded despite widespread concerns about differentially high health
spending in the US.5 Our evidence suggests that providers need to spend relatively little in
   4 For  example, the Frontier State program was introduced as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). It
raised the Medicare reimbursements to hospitals in five states: Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota,
and Wyoming. Ultimately, nearly 40 percent of hospitals have received an adjustment similar to the Section
508 adjustment, which increased their Medicare payment rates (Institute of Medicine 2012).
    5 A classic example is the funding of long-term care hospitals, as noted by Einav, Finkelstein, and Mahoney

(2018). Einav, Finkelstein, and Mahoney (2018) study the efficacy of Medicare funding for long-term care
hospitals (LTCHs). The authors find that LTCHs offer no clinical benefits relative to other providers, but lead


                                                      6
lobbying dollars and on campaign contributions in exchange for exceptionally large increases
in health spending. These results are particularly notable because from 2000 to 2019, the
health care industry (physicians, hospitals, and device and pharmaceutical manufacturers)
spent more on lobbying annually than any other industry and have spent more than double
what other industries have spent during that period (The Center for Responsive Politics
2019a).
    Second, we add to the literature analyzing the link between legislators’ actions and
campaign contributions. A large body of theoretical work has posited that campaign contri-
butions are directly linked to legislators’ actions (e.g., that they facilitate access to politicians,
that they induce legislators to act, or that they influence legislators’ votes).6 However, the
empirical evidence on the relationship between legislators’ actions and campaign contribu-
tions is extremely mixed and null findings are more common in the literature than significant
effects (Ansolabehere, Figueiredo, and Snyder Jr. 2003; Stratmann 2005). In part, this
reflects the challenge of finding institutional settings that allow for causal inference (Powell
2014). We show that directly affected donors (individuals working in the hospital sector)
increased their donations in the quarter leading up to the re-authorization of the Section 508
program and after the program was reauthorized. Likewise, members of the House who had
a 508 hospital in their district received a large increase in overall campaign contributions
after the program was extended.
    Third, while not the primary focus of this analysis, we add to the literature assessing
how hospitals respond to payment increases.7 Because Section 508 waivers appeared to
be politically motivated, the payment increases they generated can be viewed as plausibly
to approximately $30,000 in higher costs per admission. Eliminating the program and reimbursing LTCHs at
the same rate as other post-acute providers could save approximately $5 billion annually. However, despite
numerous attempts, policymakers have not been able to eliminate differentially high payments to LTCHs.
    6 See, for example, (Coate 2004; Grossman and Helpman 1994; Grossman and Helpman 1996; Grossman

and Helpman 2001).
    7 Other papers in this literature include Baicker and Staiger (2005), Dafny (2005), Kaestner and Guardado

(2008), Foo, Lee, and Fong (2017), Duggan (2000), Chang and Jacobson (2011).

exogenous. We use the receipt of a Section 508 waiver to show that hospitals respond to a
Medicare payment increase by increasing their activity. We also find suggestive evidence
that our sample of hospitals (which were mostly non-profits) also responded to the payment
increase by raising their payroll and acquiring more technology.
      This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we provide background information
on the Medicare program and the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. In Section 3, we
describe the Section 508 program, identify recipient hospitals, and quantify the payment
increases they received from receiving a Section 508 waiver. Section 4 describes the impact
of the 508 program on hospital behavior. In Section 5, we analyze how the Section 508
program impacted congressional districts. In Section 6, we explore whether members of the
House were rewarded for reauthorizing the Section 508 program. We conclude in Section 7.


2     Background


2.1    The Medicare Program and the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003

The Medicare program provides health insurance coverage to individuals age 65 and older
and to a subset of individuals with disabilities who are under age 65. Most Medicare
funds are allocated across the US via formula-based payment reimbursement programs for
physicians and hospitals. The majority of hospitals in the US are paid for treating Medicare
patients under the formula-based prospective payment system (PPS). The PPS reimburses
hospitals a fixed payment per inpatient case. Medicare payments vary across hospitals in the
US by a factor of approximately three and are set to approximate hospital input costs for
delivering care (Institute of Medicine 2012).
      On December 8, 2003, President George W. Bush signed the MMA into law, which, for
the first time, provided prescription drug coverage to seniors via the creation of the Medicare
Part D program. The MMA was the largest expansion in the Medicare program’s 38-year

                                                8
history. The law, which was expected to cost approximately $400 billion over 10 years,
was a political priority for the George W. Bush White House who thought the coverage
expansion would bolster the senior vote that he had lost to Al Gore in the 2000 presidential
election (Oliver, Lee, and Lipton 2004). According to Bruce Bartlett, “George W. Bush
strongly supported this effort [to pass Medicare Part D]. Looking ahead to a close re-election
in 2004, he thought a new government giveaway to the elderly would increase his vote share
among this group” (Bartlett 2013).
    The passage of the MMA of 2003 was politically fraught. The bill was introduced in
the US House of Representatives by Speaker Dennis Hastert on June 25, 2003. Early roll
call votes in the House indicated that the bill was unlikely to pass. The key vote that moved
the bill from the House to the Senate (roll call vote 332) passed by a one-vote margin, 216
to 215, and was split along party lines. Democrats voted 9 ‘Yea’ and 195 ‘Nay’ while
Republicans voted 207 ‘Yea’ and 19 ‘Nay.’ This vote, in breach of congressional rules, was
kept open for an abnormally long period during which time Vice President Cheney visited
the House floor, and there was substantial arm-twisting (Oliver, Lee, and Lipton 2004).
Ultimately, passage of the law hinged on keeping Republican members of the House from
voting against the legislation and mustering support from conservative Democrats (Oliver,
Lee, and Lipton 2004). As a result, because the vote was so close, every member’s vote
could be considered a marginal vote. Section 508 was added immediately after this vote.8
We focus on this vote and examine whether there are links between members’ votes and
whether hospitals in the members’ districts received Section 508 waivers.
    After the Senate passed the bill, the final vote on the reconciled legislation in the House
of Representatives (roll call vote 669) was also extremely close. As was the case during
the first House vote, rather than adhering to the standard 15-minute vote period and in
   8 We spoke to individuals working on the staffs of members of Congress during the passage of the MMA,
who indicated that Section 508 waivers were used as sweeteners during roll call vote 332.



                                                   9
contravention of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the vote was kept open for
an extended window during which time Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary
Tommy Thompson visited the House floor and President Bush phoned reluctant members of
Congress (Oliver, Lee, and Lipton 2004). In the end, the law passed by a vote of 220 to 215.
      Consistent with Evans’ 2004 argument that targeted policies can be inserted to garner
votes in the passage of sweeping legislation, the MMA contains a number of provisions,
in addition to Section 508, that provide targeted benefits in an effort to win over particular
legislators (Lee 2003; Abelson 2003). As Christopher Lee wrote in The Washington Post in
2003:


        “The $395 billion Medicare bill passed by the House yesterday, advertised as
        a way to provide a long-awaited prescription drug benefit for seniors, also has
        become a vehicle for scores of narrower provisions tailored to benefit special
        interests. Such measures, dubbed ‘rifle shots’ for their narrowly targeted effects,
        are commonly attached to complex, high-profile legislation in the crunch as a
        way to both build support for the larger bill and to provide an avenue to passage
        for provisions that likely would not succeed on their own.” (Lee 2003)


      Lee (2003) notes a number of specific provisions including a large increase in funding
added to the MMA for physicians in Alaska, the home state of Senator Ted Stevens, the
chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Another provision, championed by
Senator Charles Grassley from Iowa, contained significant funding for trials to determine
whether the Medicare program should fund chiropractic services. Iowa is the home of a
leading chiropractic educational institution (Lee 2003).


2.2    The Medicare Program and Political Logrolling

While the Medicare program is supposed to allocate funding based on local needs and not
politics, the control and influence that Congress has over the program allows members to



                                                10
narrowly focus funds to specific districts and key constituencies. There are a number of ex-
amples of where legislators have used the Medicare program to reward their constituents. For
example, within the 1999 federal budget, Representative Rob Portman successfully lobbied
for an increase in Medicare payments for brachytherapy, a treatment for prostate cancer in
which radioactive seeds are implanted in the prostate. The radioactive seeds subjected to the
funding increase were produced by Indigo Medical, a firm based in Congressman Portman’s
district (Pear 1999). Similarly, the 1999 budget also increased funding for radioactive dye
used to sharpen the precision of imaging studies (Pear 1999). The provision for this funding
increase was inserted by William Roth, the junior senator from Delaware, the state where
the largest manufacturer of this product is headquartered.
   Policymakers and journalists have argued that these types of narrowly directed funds
have been used to curry favor from lawmakers and nudge them to vote for laws that were
successfully passed including the Children’s Health Insurance Program, the Affordable
Care Act (ACA), and the MMA (Vladeck 1999; Aaron and Reischauer 2015; Pear 1999;
Cohn 2010; Abelson 2003). These kinds of logrolling efforts can involve significant sums
of money. For example, a recent article on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s
efforts to repeal the ACA and pass the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 (BCRA)
stated, “Using a combination of hardball politics, personal persuasion and lots of money –
hundreds of billions of dollars were available to pay for more add-ons to the bill in order to
get some votes – the Kentucky Republican scrambled to round up 50 Republicans to support
the motion to proceed to the bill” (Bresnahan 2017).
   Hospital payment rules, in particular, have been used to steer additional funding to
particular hospitals and regions. While payment changes cannot be explicitly political,
officials at CMS can write rules at the direction of legislative leaders that are crafted to steer
funds narrowly to specific hospitals or groups of hospitals. Indeed, a significant portion
of hospitals paid under the Medicare PPS have experienced a payment change. Between

                                               11
1997 and 2012, 16 statutory provisions were introduced that raised hospital reimbursements
for small groups of providers (Government Accountability Office 2013).9 As a result, by
2012, 29.7 percent of hospitals received some form of wage index reclassification that raised
their reimbursement rate above what was originally set by the PPS formula (Government
Accountability Office 2013).
    While some of these changes were merit based, a number of provisions have produced
large changes in hospital payments that are often credited to a particular lawmaker or were
used to direct funds very narrowly.10 For example, “Lugar counties,” authorized by and
named after Indiana Senator Richard Lugar, were introduced in the Omnibus Reconciliation
Act of 1987 and generated 10 percent increases in hospital payments for providers located
in a small number of counties (American Hospital Association 2011). Likewise, within
the 1999 budget, hospitals in districts represented by Representative Tom DeLay, the
House Republican Whip and Representative Dennis Hastert, the Speaker of the House,
were reclassified into other regions, which significantly increased the hospitals’ Medicare
payment rates (Pear 1999). These changes resulted in annual increases in hospital funding of
$380,000 and $750,000, respectively (Pear 1999). More recently, in what became popularly
known as the “Bay State Boondoggle,” John Kerry, then Senator from Massachusetts,
lobbied to prohibit Medicare from paying urban hospitals below the rate paid to the rural
hospital with the highest reimbursement rate in the state (Keane 2013; Jan 2013). Because
the only rural hospital in Massachusetts is located in Nantucket, a wealthy island town,
urban hospitals across the state saw a substantial increase in payments from this change.11
   9 For a detailed description of the statutory provisions that have increased hospital payments, see the US
2013 Government Accountability Offices report to Congress that describes all the policies that have increased
Medicare hospital payments between 1997 and 2012 (Government Accountability Office 2013).
  10 For example, because hospital payments are, to a large extent, based on the metropolitan statistical area

(MSA) where the hospital is located, hospitals located near one another but on other sides of an MSA border
can face substantial differences in payment rates. To address this issue, for example, the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1989 created a process for hospitals to apply to have their wage index changed if the
hospital was located within a short distance of another hospital that was paid at a substantially higher rate.
  11 Ironically, in 2016, CMS discovered a mistake in calculating the wage index for Massachusetts that




                                                     12
      There have also been larger-scale payment changes similar to the Section 508 program
that were inserted into wider legislation and designed to win votes from reluctant legislators.
For example, the ACA created the Frontier States provision, which raised the minimum
wage index of hospitals in Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming.
This payment change was reported to be a vehicle to win support for the Affordable Care
Act from senators in these rural states (Cohn 2010).


3     The Section 508 Program


3.1    Background on the Section 508 Program

The main factor that determines the level of hospitals’ regulated payments is their wage
index. A hospital’s wage index is based on the hospital’s physical location and is a measure
of the local labor costs a hospital faces. The Section 508 program created a process through
which, in the months after the MMA was passed, hospitals could appeal their current wage
index assignment and receive a time-limited change in their wage index that would increase
their PPS payment rate. The provision was open to hospitals that were paid using the
PPS that did not qualify for other changes in their wage index. According to the Federal
Register (2004a), “a qualifying hospital. . . does not qualify for a change in wage index
classification under paragraphs (8) or (10) of section 1886(d) of the Act on the basis of
requirements relating to distance or commuting” (pg. 7341). The legislation did not specify
the specific criteria hospitals would need to meet to qualify. Instead, the law stated that
a qualifying hospital “meets other criteria, such as quality, as the Secretary may specify
by instruction or otherwise.” Ultimately, the specific rules and regulations that determined
accidentally led to higher hospital payments for Nantucket than should have been allowed. When the mistake
was discovered and subsequently corrected, because of the 2012 law that linked statewide urban hospital
payments to the payment rate for Nantucket, updating Nantucket’s hospital payment rate led to cuts in hospital
funding across all of Massachusetts that totaled approximately $160 million (Kuhn and Schencker 2016).



                                                     13
how Section 508 waivers were to be granted were written after the MMA was passed and
members of Congress had cast their votes. The broad language in Section 508 of the MMA
created flexibility for the executive branch to write rules that favored specific hospitals.12
Originally, the law budgeted $900 million to fund the wage index changes from the Section
508 waivers, which were to run from April 1, 2004 to March 31, 2007. However, the
program was extended several times until it finally expired on March 31, 2012 (Government
Accountability Office 2013).
    Approximately two months after the MMA was passed, the first set of rules for judging
Section 508 waiver requests was published in the Federal Register (Federal Register 2004a).
A month later, the rules were updated with more detail and justification (Federal Register
2004b). In practice, the Section 508 program relaxed the criteria for hospitals to get their
wage index changed. Historically, the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board,
the body responsible for assessing hospital wage index appeals, would allow hospitals to
reclassify their wage index to an adjacent region if an urban hospital was within 15 miles of
another hospital that was paid substantially more or a rural hospital was within 35 miles
of a hospital that was paid substantially more (Federal Register 2004a). The Section 508
program allowed hospitals that did not meet those standard criteria to get a wage index
change based on one of eight new criteria (Federal Register 2004a). These new criteria
were quite specific and allowed policymakers to target funds narrowly to specific groups of
hospitals. For example, the program allowed urban hospitals in states with fewer than 10
people per square mile to get a reclassification. Likewise, the program allowed hospitals
to change their assigned wage index to a wage index from a region in another state if the
hospital’s average hourly wages were at least 108 percent of the average hourly wages at
a hospital in the area where the hospital was arguing it should be reclassified.13 While
  12 In2014, we spoke to officials at CMS when the Section 508 program was introduced. They described
how the program allowed them to write ‘rifle shot’ provisions to target funds at specific hospitals.
  13 The Federal Register, Volume 69, Number 30, printed on February 13, 2004 includes a detailed description




                                                    14
the Section 508 program was written with very specific criteria that allowed benefits to be
directed to specific hospitals, other hospitals that were represented by politicians who were
not part of the logrolling process around the MMA could apply and potentially get a waiver.


3.2    Quantifying Medicare Payments and Gains from the Section 508 Program

We submitted a FOIA request to CMS and requested the criteria on which hospitals that
applied for a Section 508 waiver were judged, a definitive list of hospitals that applied for
and received a Section 508 waiver, and a list of hospitals that applied for but were rejected
for a Section 508 reclassification. Within a year of our submission, we received a detailed
reply from CMS with the information we requested including the identities of the 498
hospitals that applied for a waiver and the 120 hospitals that had their applications approved.
      We followed the CMS payment rules presented in the Federal Register to construct
hospital PPS payments for each inpatient case for each hospital in each year from 2001
through 2010.14 Using this formula to calculate hospitals’ Medicare PPS payments allowed
us to create counterfactual payments and identify what hospitals would have been paid with
and without the wage index change generated by the Section 508 program. In Figure 1, we
show Section 508-recipient hospitals’ base Medicare PPS payment rate with and without
the wage index change generated by the program. Because of the immediate payment rules
change, as we illustrate in the figure, the Section 508 program created a sharp and immediate
increase in hospitals’ payments in 2005 that persisted for the next five years. We find that
the mean Section 508-recipient hospital received a 6.90 percent increase in their Medicare
PPS payment rates in 2005.
of the quality criteria hospitals had to meet to receive a Section 508 waiver. Per federal law, the Federal
Register also includes justifications for these changes.
   14 See Appendix A.2 for more details about how we calculated Medicare PPS payments per hospital.

      Figure 1: The Impact of Medicare Payment Increases on Hospitals’ Base PPS
                                   Payment Rates




Notes: This figure shows the annual mean Medicare inpatient PPS payment rates in 2010 dollars for the 88
hospitals in our balanced analytic sample that received a Section 508 waiver. We show the actual PPS payment
rates (red solid line) and the estimated payment rates the hospitals would have received without a 508 waiver
(blue dashed line). To construct the latter, we recalculate payment rates using the wage index for each Section
508 hospital’s pre-reclassification labor market area (CBSA), holding all other payment adjustments constant.
(These wage indexes are from Tables 4A and 4B of the annual IPPS Final Rules published in the Federal
Register.) Because of data limitations, the “actual IPPS payment rate” in 2004 is based on each hospital’s 2005
post-reclassification wage index; the “counterfactual IPPS payment rate” in 2004 is based on each hospital’s
2004 wage index from the 2004 Impact File, which does not incorporate the Section 508 policy.


3.3    Hospital Receipt of Section 508 Waivers and Votes for Medicare Modernization
       Act of 2003

In Table 1, we examine the relationship between the vote on the MMA by each member
of Congress and whether the hospitals in their district received a Section 508 waiver. Data
on members’ votes were obtained from Voteview, and data on whether hospitals received
a 508 waiver came from our FOIA request (details on our data sources are included in
Appendix A.1). Note that this table examines 118 Section 508-recipient hospitals because
two hospitals with a Section 508 waiver were represented by members of Congress who
did not vote in roll call vote 332. Among the universe of hospitals paid using the PPS in
2005, 3.0 percent received a Section 508 waiver. Among the universe of hospitals eligible


                                                     16
to receive a waiver (e.g. those that did not already have a wage index reassignment), 5.0
percent received a Section 508 waiver. Of hospitals that applied for a waiver (498 hospitals),
24.1 percent (120) had their application approved.
    In Columns (1) and (2) in Table 1, we find that, among all hospitals in our sample eligible
to receive a Section 508 waiver, hospitals represented by a member of Congress who voted
‘Yea’ to roll call vote 332 on the MMA were more likely to receive a waiver than hospitals
represented by a member of Congress who voted ‘Nay’ (6.0 percent versus 4.2 percent; p <
0.10). Among hospitals that applied for a waiver, hospitals represented by a member who
voted ‘Yea’ to the MMA were 1.4 times more likely to have their applications approved
than hospitals represented by a member who voted ‘Nay’ (27.6 percent/19.9 percent; p <
0.05).15
    The political calculus and electoral risks associated with voting in favor of the legislation
varied substantially by party with Republicans choosing between angering fiscal conserva-
tives in their base and opposing a president from their own party, while Democrats who
may have liked the policy were loath to provide legislative support that could help re-elect
the Republican president. Therefore, we also split the analysis by the political party of the
congressional representative in each hospital district. In Columns (4) and (5) in Table 1, we
find that among hospitals that were eligible to receive a waiver, hospitals represented by a
Republican member of Congress who voted ‘Yea’ to the MMA were nearly seven times
more likely to receive a Section 508 waiver than those represented by a Republican member
of Congress who voted ‘Nay’ (= 5.6 percent/0.8 percent; p < 0.01). Among hospitals that
applied for a Section 508 waiver, those represented by a Republican member of Congress
who voted ‘Yea’ were four times more likely (= 26.3 percent / 6.7 percent; p < 0.01) to
receive a waiver than those represented by a Republican member of Congress who voted
  15 Note  that two hospitals that received a Section 508 waiver were excluded from this analysis because the
members representing those hospitals abstained from voting in roll call vote 332. We lose three additional
hospitals that applied for a waiver because their members also abstained from voting.

     quantities and 2005 actual and counterfactual payment rates. In comparing the fraction of hospitals that received a Section 508 waiver and the size of PPS payment gains, we
     include all hospitals in our data except those who were represented by a member of Congress who abstained from voting. This excludes 2 of the 120 hospitals that received a
     Section 508 waiver and 104 of 3,982 hospitals who are in our data in 2005. † Calculated with our full sample of hospitals. ‡ Calculated with our balanced analytic sample of

‘Nay’. Likewise, hospitals represented by a Democratic member of Congress who voted
‘Yea’ were also significantly more likely to receive a waiver than hospitals represented by a
Democratic member who voted ‘Nay’ (p < 0.10). Note that in Columns (4) through (9), we
rely on a sample of 117 Section 508-recipient hospitals because one recipient hospital was
represented by a member of Congress that was not registered as a Democrat or a Republican.
    While the average gain in IPPS payments for hospitals that received a Section 508
waiver were $426.70 off of a mean PPS base payment rate of $6,203.97 in 2005, there
was significant heterogeneity in the size of the PPS payment gains. According to the
MMA, the Secretary of HHS had influence over the size of the gains hospitals could obtain
from a Section 508 waiver. Within the rules for the MMA, the Federal Register (2004a)
stated, “Under this [Section 508] process, a qualifying hospital may appeal the wage index
classification otherwise applicable to the hospital and apply for reclassification to another
area of the State in which the hospital is located (or, at the discretion of the Secretary, to an
area within a contiguous State)” (pg. 7341). Therefore, the Secretary of HHS was able to
decide whether hospitals that received a Section 508 waiver could be reclassified to areas in
other states with higher wage indexes.
    In Table 1, we also examine whether there were larger PPS payment gains among Section
508-recipient hospitals represented by members of Congress who voted ‘Yea’ relative to
‘Nay.’ In Columns (1) and (2), we show that hospitals represented by a member of Congress
who voted ‘Yea’ received larger gains in base IPPS payment rates than those represented
by a member who voted ‘Nay’ ($421.89 versus $400.61; p < 0.63). These differences are
statistically significant when we analyze the votes by party. The 62 Section 508-recipient
hospitals represented by Republican members who voted ‘Yea’ gained an average of $285.63
more than the lone Section 508-recipient hospital represented by a Republican member who
voted ‘Nay’ (p < 0.01). Likewise, we also find that hospitals represented by Democratic
members of Congress who voted ‘Yea’ to the MMA received $73.35 more from the program

                                               19
than hospitals represented by Democratic members of Congress who voted ‘Nay’ (p < 0.05).


4     Section 508 Waivers and Hospital Behavior


4.1    Estimating the Impact of the Section 508 Medicare Payment Increases

In this section, we examine the impact of the Medicare payment increase generated by
the Section 508 program on hospital activity, hospital spending, and hospital investments.
We use difference-in-difference regression to identify the outcomes for the hospitals that
received a Section 508 waiver before and after they received their April 1, 2004 onward
payment increase relative to the outcomes at various groups of control hospitals. Our
difference-in-difference specification takes the form:


                 Outcomeh,t = βt Section_508_Recipienth · τt + ϑh + τt + εh,t             (1)


where we measure outcomes Outcomeh,t , such as inpatient Medicare discharges, at hospital
h in year t. We interact our treatment indicator (Section_508_Recipienth ) with a vector of
year fixed effects τt . We also include a vector of year fixed effects τt and hospital fixed
effects ϑh , which capture the main effects of each interaction. Following Cameron, Gelbach,
and Miller (2008), we report wild-bootstrapped standard errors (although our results are
robust to clustering our standard errors around hospitals). We present our estimates of
Equation (1) graphically and in tables.
      Our FOIA request revealed that 498 hospitals applied for a Section 508 waiver. Of those
hospitals that applied for a waiver, 378 had their applications rejected and 120 hospitals
had their applications approved. Among the 120 hospitals that had their waiver applications
approved, we lose 17 hospitals from our analysis because they were not registered with the
American Hospital Association (AHA) in at least one year. A further 15 hospitals dropped


                                              20
out during our sample period because they either were involved in a merger, closed during
our period of analysis, or ceased being listed in the CMS Impact Files (which identify how
hospitals are paid). This leaves 88 hospitals in our treated sample that remained registered
with the AHA, and were reimbursed by the Medicare program from 2001 through 2010.
While we rely on a balanced panel of hospitals in our main analysis, we also illustrate that
our results are robust when we rely on an unbalanced panel of hospitals.16
    In any difference-in-difference analysis, the identifying assumption is that the control
group represents what would have occurred at the treated group absent any intervention (in
our setting, the intervention is the payment increase generated by the Section 508 program).
Because the payment increases generated by the Section 508 program were not a function
of random assignment, there is no “perfect” control group. The main control group we use
in this analysis includes the 284 hospitals in our balanced sample that applied for a Section
508 waiver, but had their application rejected. As we illustrate in Appendix Table A.1, these
hospitals have similar characteristics to treated hospitals, but are less likely to be represented
in Congress by a member of Congress who voted ‘Yea’ to the MMA of 2003 (p < 0.10).17
In addition, we estimate Equation (1) using three alternative control groups: 1) hospitals
that were eligible to apply for the Section 508 program, but did not submit an application; 2)
hospitals that were ineligible for the Section 508 program; and 3) all hospitals that did not
receive a Section 508 waiver. We also use propensity score matching to construct a control
group drawn from hospitals that were eligible for a Section 508 waiver but did not receive
  16 There are 20 hospitals in our treatment group and 115 hospitals in our “applied but rejected” control group
that have missing or zero outcomes in one year or another. We dummy out these missing values and zeros.
Our results are also robust to excluding these observations from our analysis.
  17 In Appendix Table A.1, we compare the characteristics of Section 508-recipient hospitals, hospitals that

applied for a waiver and were rejected, those that were eligible but did not apply, ineligible hospitals, and all
hospitals registered with the AHA from 2001 to 2010 that were paid using the PPS. Section 508-recipient
hospitals were slightly larger than the average AHA hospital, more likely to be a non-profit, teaching hospital,
and less likely to be located in a rural area. Hospitals that unsuccessfully applied for a Section 508 waiver
were larger than Section 508-recipient hospitals, had more Medicaid discharges, and were less likely to be

one.
    We also illustrate how our treatment effects vary as a function of hospitals’ potential gains
from and exposure to the Section 508 program. As we document in Appendix Table A.2,
there was significant heterogeneity in payment increases generated by the Section 508
program. Ultimately, hospitals’ potential gains from and hence exposure to the Section
508 program were a function of both the number of Medicare patients they treated and the
payment increases they received via the receipt of a waiver. To capture this heterogeneity,
we created a measure of hospitals’ Section 508 treatment exposure, measured in dollars,
which we estimate as the product of a hospital’s pre-treatment (2003) Medicare inpatient
patient volume multiplied by a treated hospital’s change in Medicare reimbursement rates
generated by the Section 508 program for those procedures.18 This exposure measure
captures hospitals’ predicted revenue gains from the Section 508 program ignoring any
expansion of hospital activity induced by the Section 508 program. As we illustrate in
Appendix Table A.2, the median Section 508 recipient hospital had a potential exposure
(predicted revenue gains) of $1.52 million from the 508 program. The hospitals in the 10th
and 90th percentiles had potential exposure from the program of $0.16 million and $5.90
million, respectively.
    To test the impact of the increase in Medicare payments on hospital activity and health
care spending, we utilize data from the Medicare Provider Cost Report Public Use Files
maintained and accessible via the Healthcare Provider Cost Reporting Information System
  18 In practice, we calculated Section 508-recipient hospitals’ treatment exposure as follows. First, for each
Section 508 hospital, we calculated actual and counterfactual inpatient PPS payment rates in 2005 (the first full
fiscal year in which the Section 508 program was active). The actual rate includes the wage index boost from
the Section 508 program, while the counterfactual rate uses the wage index from each Section 508-recipient
hospital’s pre-reclassification labor market area. Second, we estimated inpatient PPS payments without the
Section 508 policy by applying the counterfactual rate from 2005 to inpatient case counts and DRG payment
weights from 2003 (the year before Section 508 took effect, so as to exclude any supply effects of the payment
rate change). We call this Revenue0 . To estimate inpatient PPS payments with the Section 508 policy, we
repeated this step using the actual payment rates from 2005. We call the results Revenue508 . Finally, we
identify hospitals’ exposure to the Section 508 program as Exposure508 = Revenue508 − Revenue0 .

(HCRIS).19 We analyze how the Medicare payment increases generated by the Section
508 program impacted hospitals’ outputs including their inpatient Medicare discharges,
inpatient Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) payments, and total revenue.20 We
also measure how the receipt of a Section 508 waiver impacted hospitals’ inputs for care
including their acquisition of technology, payroll, and staffing. We measure the amount
of technology per hospital by following the approach of Acemoglu and Finkelstein (2008)
using data from the AHA. The AHA data includes binary indicators for whether a hospital
has various technologies, such as computed-tomography (CT) scanners, electron beam
computed tomography, or proton beam therapy. We sum the number of these technologies
present at each hospital to arrive at a count of technologies per hospital per year. We also
measure hospital staffing counts and payroll using data from the AHA.


4.2    Section 508 Waivers, Inpatient Discharges, and Medicare Inpatient Spending

Within our sample, as we illustrate in Appendix Table A.1, 88 percent of Section 508-
recipient hospitals are non-profit facilities. Newhouse (1970) has argued that private,
non-profit hospitals maximize output and prestige. If hospitals maximize output, then an
increase in Medicare payment rates should also generate movement along the supply curve
and an increase in the number of Medicare patients treated at Section 508-recipient hospitals,
assuming Medicare reimbursements are greater than hospital per case marginal costs.
      Consistent with these predictions, while there was a national reduction in the share of
hospital services performed in an inpatient setting in the 2000s, the event study on the left of
Panel A of Figure 2 shows that inpatient quantities went down less at Section 508-recipient
hospitals than they did in control hospitals (McDermott, Elixhauser, and Sun 2017).
  19 We accessed cleaned Cost Report data files from the RAND Corporation. For more information, see
https://www.hospitaldatasets.org/about.
  20 We inflation-adjust our spending measure into 2010 dollars using the seasonally-adjusted Consumer Price

Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U).

Notes: These panels present estimates of Equation (1) where we regress hospital outcomes on a vector of hospital fixed
effects, year dummies, and interactions between the Section 508-recipient hospital indicator and year dummies. 2003 is
our omitted year. 90% confidence intervals are based on wild-bootstrapped standard errors clustered around hospitals.
Control hospitals include those that applied for the Section 508 waiver but were rejected. The rightmost figures plot the
coefficient of the 2010 interaction term from Equation (1) as we vary the definition of the treatment group. Moving left
to right in each figure, each specification involves a treated group composed of hospitals that received increasingly large
gains in total IPPS payments (based on quantities in 2003 and actual and counterfactual payment rates in 2005) due to
the Section 508 program. Medicare inpatient admissions and PPS payments are from the RAND Medicare Cost Reports
(HCRIS) data.


Estimates of Equation (1) presented in Column (1) of Table 2 show that the number of
inpatient discharges were 313.94 higher in treated hospitals by 2010 than what occurred at
hospitals that applied for a Section 508 waiver, but had their applications rejected (p < 0.01).
The mean number of discharges in our treated group in the base year (2003) was 4,420.34,
implying a difference in inpatient discharges between treated and control hospitals of
approximately 3.3 percent in 2005 and 7.1 percent in 2010. Notably, we do not observe any

                                                           24
meaningful or significant differences in pre-trends between treated and control hospitals
prior to the introduction of the Section 508 program.
   For each outcome, we also show how the scale of the 2010 treatment effects vary
as a function of hospitals’ exposure to the Section 508 program. To do so, we alter the
composition of our treated group and illustrate the treatment effects from the Section
508 program when we focus on the treatment groups composed of hospitals that received
increasingly large predicted revenue gains from the Section 508 program. We refer to these
as our “dose response” estimates and they appear on the right side of each panel. In the dose
response estimates on the right of Panel A of Figure 2, each point represents an estimate of
Equation (1) with inpatient admissions as the dependent variable. Moving left to right, the
treated group in each of the point estimates is composed of hospitals that had increasingly
large exposure to the Section 508 program. The point estimate closest to the Y-axis shows
the 2010 treatment effects when all Section 508-recipient hospitals are included in the
treatment group (All). The next point estimate is the treatment effect including the top 90
percent of hospitals (e.g. those that had exposure in the 10th percentile and upwards). The
next point includes the top 80 percent of hospitals (e.g. those that had exposure in the 20th
percentile and upwards), and so forth. The control group remains the same across all our
estimates.
   The dose response estimates on the right of Panel A of Figure 2 illustrate that the magni-
tude of the effect of the Section 508 program on inpatient volume in 2010 is increasing as
hospitals’ exposure to the program increases (although these differences are not statistically
significant). The dose response estimates illustrate that the treatment effect size goes up
by 73 percent when we focus on the 30 percent of hospitals with greatest exposure to the
Section 508 program and more than triples when we focus on the 10 percent of hospitals
with the highest potential exposure.
   The Section 508 program also led to large increases in inpatient Medicare spending. As

                                             25
we illustrate in Panel B of Figure 2 and Column (2) of Table 2, in 2005, the first year the
Section 508 payment increases were in effect for the full calendar year, inpatient Medicare
spending at treated hospitals increased by $4.28 million off of mean spending at treated
hospitals of $48.86 (p < 0.01) in 2003 (the year before the payment increases took effect).
Treated and control hospitals also had nearly identical pre-trends in the period before the
Section 508 payments were introduced. As we illustrate in Panel A of Appendix Figure A.1,
this result is robust to measuring the impact of the program on hospitals’ total Medicare
spending (inpatient plus outpatient spending).
    The scale of hospitals’ increases in Medicare spending generated by the Section 508
program varied considerably across hospitals (see the dose response estimates on the right
side of Panel B of Figure 2). For the 50 percent of hospitals with the largest exposure to
the Section 508 program, the payment increases raised inpatient Medicare spending by
$8.95 million in 2010. For the ten percent of hospitals most exposed to the Section 508
program, the payment increases raised inpatient Medicare spending by $14.86 million in
2010. This treatment effect is nearly three times larger than the treatment effect we observe
from estimates relying on the full sample of treated hospitals (though this difference is not
statistically significant).
    Collectively, from 2005 to 2010, the Section 508 program raised inpatient Medicare
spending at treated hospitals by approximately $25 million per hospital.21 Across the 88
treated hospitals in our analysis, this resulted in more than $2.1 billion in additional inpatient
Medicare spending from 2005 to 2010.22 This amount is notable because the original
legislative language in Section 508 of the MMA only authorized $900 million in spending
on the program that was to occur between April 1, 2004 and April 1, 2007.


  21 This   number is obtained by summing the 2005 to 2010 interaction terms.
  22 We obtain this by multiplying 88 (the number of treated hospitals) by the $24.87 million in added spending

per treated hospital.

      The Medicare payment increases generated by the Section 508 program also created
large spillover effects and raised total hospital revenue at the hospitals most exposed to the
Section 508 program (see Panel B of Appendix Figure A.1). According to data from the
Medicare Cost Reports, mean hospital revenue in 2010 was approximately $208 million
(across all hospitals in our balanced sample). While we do not observe precisely estimated
treatment effects on total revenue across the universe of treated hospitals, when we focus on
the 50 percent of hospitals with the highest exposure to the program (Panel C of Appendix
Figure A.1), we observe that the program led to a $33 million increase in total revenue in
2010 (p < 0.11). When we focus on the 20 percent of hospitals with the most exposure to
the Section 508 program (Panel D of Appendix Figure A.1), we observe a $102 million
increase in hospital revenue (p < 0.05).


4.3    Section 508 Waivers and Hospital Inputs

The increase in Medicare reimbursements, hospital activity, and hospital revenue should also
have precipitated an increase in hospital inputs. The AHA estimates that labor and benefits
account for approximately 60 percent of hospital costs (American Hospital Association
2016). As a result, it is likely that the increase in hospital activity and revenue generated
by the Section 508 program should lead to a proportional increase in hospital payroll and
staffing.
      However, some hospitals stood to gain very little from the Section 508 program (see
Appendix Table A.2). Indeed, ignoring a supply response, we estimate that hospitals in the
10th percentile of exposure to the program would only gain $160 thousand in Medicare
inpatient revenue, hospitals in the 25th percentile would gain $510 thousand, and hospitals
in the 50th percentile of exposure would gain $1.52 million. It is unlikely that a hospital that
received a marginal increase in revenue of $160 thousand would meaningfully alter their

Control hospitals include those that applied for the Section 508 waiver but were rejected. The rightmost figures plot the
coefficient of the 2010 interaction term from Equation (1) as we vary the definition of the treatment group. Moving left
to right in each figure, each specification involves a treated group composed of hospitals that received increasingly large
gains in total IPPS payments (based on quantities in 2003 and actual and counterfactual payment rates in 2005) due to
the Section 508 program. Payroll expenses, full-time personnel, and technology counts are derived from the American
Hospital Association’s Annual Survey data.

staffing. By contrast, hospitals that received tens of millions of dollars in gains would be
more likely to increase their staffing and staff pay.
   Consistent with these predictions, as results in Panel A of Figure 3 illustrate, there is a
notable increase in hospital payroll that is concentrated among the Section 508 recipient
hospitals that were the most exposed to the program. While there is not a precisely estimated
increase in payroll across the universe of Section 508-recipient hospitals, among the half
of hospitals most exposed to the program, there is a $22.9 million increase in payroll in
2010 (p < 0.1). As we illustrated in Panel B of Figure A.1, the total revenue gains from the
Section 508 program in this cohort were approximately $33 million, so the gains in payroll
as a share of revenue gains (70 percent) approximate the AHA’s estimates of the share of
hospital costs that are driven by labor. Likewise, as results in Panel B of Figure 3 illustrate,
there is also a suggestive increase in total, full-time staff at the hospitals most exposed to the
Section 508 program, although the point estimates are not precisely estimated.
   At non-profit hospitals that cannot distribute profits to shareholders, as Newhouse
(1970) predicts, an increase in Medicare payments could also result in an increase in
hospitals’ adoption of new technology. To test this hypothesis, we measure hospital’s
use of technology annually following the approach of Acemoglu and Finkelstein (2008),
which counts technologies per hospital. Panel C of Figure 3 presents trends in the hospital
technology count generated from estimates of Equation (1). Consistent with predictions
from Newhouse (1970), there is suggestive evidence that the introduction of the Section 508
program led hospitals to adopt more technology. Treated and untreated hospitals had nearly
identical pre-trends before the passage of the MMA of 2003. After treatment hospitals
received the payment increase generated by the Section 508 program, there was an increase
in the count of technology among the most treated hospitals. These changes are generally not
precisely estimated at conventional levels across the universe of treated hospitals. However,
as we illustrate in the dose response estimates on the right of Panel C of Figure 3, these

                                               30
effects become precisely estimated (p < 0.10) when the treated group is restricted to the
80 percent of Section 508-recipient hospitals with the largest exposure to the Section 508
program. These results imply that in the 80 percent of hospitals with the largest exposure to
the Section 508 program, hospitals added approximately three new technologies by 2010.


4.4    Section 508 Waivers and Hospital Behavior - Robustness

We conducted a large number of robustness tests, some of which we describe here. First, as
we illustrate in Appendix Figure A.2, our main results remain robust when we rely on an
unbalanced panel of treated hospitals. Second, in lieu of using hospitals that applied for a
Section 508 waiver, but had their applications rejected as our control group, we show the
robustness of our results to using three alternative control groups. In Appendix Figure A.3,
we show event studies derived from estimates of Equation (1) and dose response graphs for
the 2010 Section 508 treatment effects when we construct a control group that is composed
of hospitals that were eligible to apply for the Section 508 program but did not submit
an application. In Appendix Figure A.4, we show event study graphs and dose response
estimates for the 2010 treatment effects when the control group is composed of hospitals
ineligible for the Section 508 program because they already received a wage index increase.
In Appendix Figure A.5, we construct a control group composed of the universe of hospitals
paid via the inpatient PPS that did not receive a Section 508 waiver. Our main results are
qualitatively unchanged when we use these three alternative control groups. Finally, we
show in Appendix Figure A.6 that our treatment effects remain similarly scaled and precisely
estimated when we use propensity score matching to construct our control group from the
universe of hospitals eligible for a Section 508 waiver that did not receive one.23
  23 We use a probit model to construct propensity scores that match Section 508-recipient hospitals to their 10
nearest neighbors. We estimate our probit to predict Section 508 receipt based on 2001-2003 mean Medicare
discharges, Medicaid discharges, for-profit status, teaching hospital status, the bed count, a rural indicator, and
the 2001-2003 (pre-treatment) mean value of the dependent variables (inpatient Medicare spending, Medicare

5     Section 508 Waivers and Congressional District-Level Outcomes


5.1    Estimating the Gains to Congressional Districts

A large body of work has found that members of Congress devote substantial time and
effort to steering benefits (e.g. jobs and federal dollars) to their district (Mayhew 1974;
Weingast 1979; Shepsle and Weingast 1982; Weingast, Shepsle, and Johnsen 1981; Levitt
and Snyder Jr. 1997). In this section, we focus on testing whether the Section 508 program
led to increases in Medicare inpatient spending and new jobs in congressional districts with
one or more hospitals that received a Section 508 waiver.
      To estimate the effect of the Section 508 program on congressional districts, we again
rely on a difference-in-difference estimator that takes the form:


            Outcomed,t = βt CD_With_Section_508_Hospitald · τt + ϑd + τt + εd,t            (2)


and analyze changes in outcomes Outcomed,t in each district d by year t. We interact our
treatment indicator, CD_With_Section_508_Hospitald , which denotes whether a congres-
sional district has one or more Section 508-recipient hospitals, with a vector of year fixed
effects τt . We also include a vector of year fixed effects τt and congressional district fixed
effects ϑd . We identify a district as treated if it included one or more Section 508-recipient
hospitals that are in the data from 2001 to 2010. We again report wild-bootstrapped standard
errors (although our results are robust to clustering around congressional districts).
      We focus on three dependent variables. First, we use Medicare Cost Reports data to
aggregate Medicare inpatient spending across every hospital annually in each congres-
sional district (including hospitals that did not receive a Section 508 waiver) in order to
admissions, the technology count, payroll and full-time personnel).




                                                    32
get an annual measure of Medicare inpatient spending per district.24 This allows us to
analyze whether there was an aggregate increase in health spending per district, rather than
substitution in health spending across hospitals. Second, we use AHA data to aggregate
hospital-level full-time staff counts across all hospitals per congressional district to generate
an aggregate, annual measure of hospital jobs per district.25 Third, using AHA data, we
aggregate hospital payroll across all hospitals in each congressional district to get an annual
measure of congressional district-level, aggregate hospital payroll. There are two distinct
advantages to using AHA data to generate measures of hospital staffing and payroll. First,
they allow us to aggregate precisely to the congressional district-level because we we can
utilize the address of each hospital (rather than, for example, aggregating county-level
data).26 Second, many employment databases censor county-level hospital data because
small values would be revealing of individual firms.
    We compare outcomes in treated districts (e.g. those with one or more hospitals that
received a Section 508 waiver) with outcomes in four sets of control districts: 1) districts
with one or more hospitals that applied for a Section 508 waiver but had their application
rejected; 2) districts with one or more hospitals that were eligible for the Section 508
program, but did not apply; 3) districts with one or more hospitals that were ineligible
for the Section 508 program; 4) and districts without any hospitals that were awarded a
Section 508 waiver, but had one or more hospitals paid via the PPS. We also use propensity
score matching to construct a control group of congressional districts without a Section
  24 The   Cost Reports categorize hospitals as “general short-term”, “general long-term”, “cancer”, “psych”,
“rehab”, “religious nonmedical”, “children’s”, “alcohol & drug”, and “other” in each year. Some hospitals are
categorized differently year-to-year. We restrict the data to hospitals that are marked as “general short-term” in
half or more of the period 2001-2010.
   25 We restrict the AHA data to “general medical and surgical” facilities, which excludes surgical, psychiatric,

long-term care, and other types of hospitals.
   26 In practice, we identify each hospital’s congressional district based on its ZIP code as reported in the

Medicare Cost Reports (in the case of Medicare inpatient spending) or the AHA Survey (in the case of
payroll and full-time staffing). We use ZIP-to-congressional district crosswalks from the Missouri Census
Data Center’s Geocorr application (http://mcdc.missouri.edu/applications/geocorr.html). If a
ZIP intersects with multiple districts, we use the district with the largest share of the ZIP’s population.

508-recipient hospital.27
      As we did in the hospital-level analysis, we also describe how our treatment effects
vary as a function of congressional districts’ exposure to the Section 508 program. This
is particularly important in our congressional-district-level analysis because there was so
much heterogeneity in exposure to the program across districts.
      To measure each congressional district’s exposure, we take our estimates of treated
hospitals’ predicted revenue gains from the Section 508 program, as described in Section 4.1,
and sum these across hospitals in each district. As a result, our measure of a district’s
treatment exposure captures the potential dollars each district could receive from the Section
508 program, ignoring any supply responses. There were 42 congressional districts with at
least one Section 508 recipient hospital. Among treated districts, as we note in Appendix
Table A.2, the minimum predicted one-year increase in Medicare inpatient spending was
$80,000, the 50th percentile was $3.09 million, and the maximum was $38.19 million. The
median treated congressional district had a single Section 508 recipient hospital. There
were 17 districts (40 percent) that had more than one Section 508 hospital. The predicted
gains in districts with multiple Section 508 hospitals - median gains of $6.23 million - were
substantially larger than the gains in districts with only one Section 508 recipient hospital.


5.2    The Section 508 Program and Congressional District-Level Hospital Spending

Figure 4 presents event-study estimates of Equation (2) and illustrates that there was a large
increase in aggregate Medicare inpatient spending in congressional districts with one or
more hospitals that received a Section 508 waiver. The point estimates presented in Column
(1) in Table 3 show that the Section 508 program led to a $8.03 million increase in Medicare
inpatient spending per treated congressional district in 2005 (p < 0.05). By 2010, treated
districts were receiving $11.51 million more (p < 0.1) annually than districts with one or
  27 We   treated congressional districts with both treated and control hospitals exclusively as treated districts.

                                                        34
more hospitals that applied to the 508 program but had their application rejected. To give
a sense of the magnitude of the effect of the Section 508 program, Medicare spending in
treated districts was $308 million in 2003. So, the 2005 average treatment effect implies that
the Section 508 program led to an increase in Medicare inpatient spending in congressional
districts of approximately 3 percent in the first year post-implementation and approximately
4 percent by 2010. Notably, there is no meaningful difference in Medicare inpatient spending
between treated and control congressional districts prior to the introduction of the Section
508 program.
    The gains from the Section 508 program were concentrated in a small group of congres-
sional districts. For example, as we illustrate in the dose response estimates presented on
the right of Panel A of Figure 4, the 30 percent of congressional districts (12 districts) with
the largest predicted revenue increases saw an increase in Medicare inpatient spending of
$25 million in 2010. All but three of these districts had two or more Section 508 recipient
hospitals. Likewise, the ten percent of congressional districts with the largest predicted
exposure to the Section 508 program had a $40 million increase in Medicare inpatient
spending in 2010.
    As we illustrate in Panels A and B of Appendix Figure A.7, we also observe large,
precisely estimated increases in total hospital revenue among the 20 percent of congressional
districts that were the most exposed to the Section 508 program. Among that group, total
revenue increased by approximately $266 million in 2010. In the ten percent of treated
congressional districts with the highest exposure to the Section 508 program, total revenues
increased by over $281 million. For reference, across congressional districts, the mean total
hospital revenue per district was $1.6 billion in 2010.28



  28 We present event study estimates for the 20 percent of congressional districts with the highest exposure to
the Section 508 program in Panel B of Appendix Figure A.7.

inpatient PPS payments are from the RAND Medicare Cost Reports (HCRIS) data. Payroll expenses and full-time
personnel are derived from the American Hospital Association’s Annual Survey.

5.3    The Section 508 Program and Congressional District-Level Hospital Employ-
       ment

We also observe suggestive evidence that hospital employment and payroll increased in
treated congressional districts. In the event study included in Panel B of Figure 4, we present
estimates of Equation (2) and focus on testing the impact of the Section 508 program on the
count of employees working at hospitals in each congressional district. Our results show
that the Section 508 program raised hospital employment in treated congressional districts.
As we illustrate in Column (2) of Table 3, across the universe of treated districts, by 2010,
hospital employment increased by 444.65 (p < 0.12) off of a mean count of total hospital
jobs in treated districts of 8,400.24 in 2003.
      The gains in employment appear to be driven by the large changes experienced in the
most treated districts. As our dose response estimates in Panel B of Figure 4 illustrate, the
10 percent of congressional districts with the largest exposure to the Section 508 program
gained more than five times as many jobs in the hospital sector in 2010 as we observed when
we estimated our treatment effects across the universe of treated districts.
      Likewise, as we illustrate in Panel C of Figure 4, beginning in 2005, the aggregate
hospital payroll in treated and control districts began to diverge. As we illustrate in Column
(3) of Table 3, which presents estimates of Equation (2), by 2010, aggregate hospital payroll
was $22.22 million higher in treated districts (p < 0.3) off of a mean payroll among treated
districts in 2003 of $537.34 million. We also observe that the scale of our treatment effects is
increasing as districts’ exposure to the Section 508 program increases. For example, among
the 20 percent of treated districts with the highest exposure to the Section 508 program,
payroll increased by approximately $124 million (p < 0.05; Panel C of Figure 4). This
represents 47 percent of the total hospital revenue gain from the program among the same
20 percent of treated districts (Panel A of Appendix Figure A.7).

5.4    Section 508 Waivers and Congressional District-Level Outcomes - Robustness

Our main results presented in Figure 4 rely on a control group of congressional districts with
one or more hospitals that applied for a Section 508 waiver, but had their application rejected.
Below, we show that our main results - that the most treated third of congressional districts
saw substantial increases in Medicare spending and suggestive evidence of employment
increases - are robust across alternative control groups. In Appendix Figure A.8, we present
an event study graph and our dose response estimates for our main outcomes when we rely
on a control group composed of congressional districts that have one or more hospitals that
were eligible for the Section 508 program, but did not apply. In Appendix Figure A.9, we
repeat this exercise, but rely on a control group composed of congressional districts with
one or more hospitals that were ineligible for the 508 program. In Appendix Figure A.10,
we construct a control group of congressional districts that do not include any Section
508-recipient hospitals. Again, we find that our results remain qualitatively unchanged using
these alternative control groups. Finally, in Appendix Figure A.11, we construct a control
group drawn from districts without a Section 508-recipient hospital using propensity score
matching.29


6     Section 508 Waivers and Political Donations


6.1    Background, Data, and Estimation

The Medicare payment increases created by the Section 508 program were written to expire
on March 31, 2007, three years after they were introduced. Were the Section 508 program
to have expired, it would have cost hospitals millions in annual revenue. In this section, we
    29 Weconstruct propensity scores of each district’s probability of being treated (e.g. having a Section
508-recipient hospital) using probit. Our probit estimator includes the number of hospitals per district, the
share of non-profit hospitals per district, the share of teaching hospitals per district, and the 2001-2003
(pre-treatment) average of the district-level dependent variables (Medicare inpatient spending, payroll and
full-time personnel).

explore lobbying efforts to extend the Section 508 program, describe the votes in the House
for the re-authorization of the program, and test whether the members of the House who had
a Section 508-recipient hospital in their district received larger campaign donations after the
Section 508 program was reauthorized.
    This analysis is directly related to the wider political science literature that has examined
whether members of Congress receive benefits when they use distributive policies to steer
funds to their district. As Levitt and Snyder Jr. (1997) note, it is widely accepted by
academics, the media, and politicians that members of Congress are rewarded for bringing
additional federal funding to their districts. However, few studies have established a causal
link between distributive policies championed by members of Congress and changes in
fundraising. From an identification perspective, establishing a causal link between donations
and distributive policies is challenging because donations could both lead members to push
for specific policies that benefit donors and come as a reward for past actions.30 However,
the Section 508 program offers a unique opportunity to test the link between campaign
contributions and targeted distributive policies because we can look at donations before and
after the re-authorization of the program, which, as we illustrate, was salient to politicians
and many of their constituents.
    Lee (2003) and Rocca and Gordon (2013) have argued the extent to which a particular
distributive policy will yield electoral gains and increases in campaign contributions is a
  30 Two studies have used instrumental variable (IV) analysis to get around endogeneity issues and have found

a causal link between federal funding and donations, and federal funding and votes. Rocca and Gordon (2013)
analyze whether representatives who allocate more defense-related earmarks receive more donations from
political action committees (PACs) representing defense manufacturers. The authors instrument for defense
industry earmarks using the total number of earmarks a representative makes, and they find that every $10,000
in defense earmarks raises PAC campaign contributions by $3.00. It is debatable whether instrumenting for
defense earmarks using total earmarks (including defense earmarks) satisfies the exclusion restriction. Levitt
and Snyder Jr. (1997) analyze whether increasing federal funding for a district raises vote margins for the
incumbent. The authors instrument for federal funding in the district using federal spending outside the district
but inside the state and find that a $100 increase in per-capita federal spending (approximately $50 million per
district) leads to a two percent gain in the popular vote for incumbents. We add to this literature by analyzing
the impact of the Section 508 program on campaign contributions.



                                                      40
function of the extent to which legislators can claim credit for the benefits (e.g. whether
a legislator’s efforts are salient to voters). While formula-based distributive policies are
often opaque to constituents (such as the initial passage of the Section 508 program),
extending the Section 508 program was remarkably important and easily observable to
hospitals that previously received a Section 508 payment increase. For example, a 2007
Modern Healthcare article noted that "selected hospitals and systems stand to lose millions
of dollars under a provision of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 that is set to expire
in September [2007]" (Lubell 2007). The author continued, "Executives for hospitals and
systems say that losing that extra Medicare reimbursement under Section 508 would be
devastating. Layoffs and cutbacks would likely occur at St. Luke’s Cornwall Hospital, said
Allan Atzrott, president and CEO of the 282-bed hospital, which has campuses in Cornwall
and Newburgh, N.Y.". There is also evidence that politicians were aware of the Section 508
program and that they viewed supporting it as politically advantageous.31
    In general, the academic literature is divided about the extent to which donations serve
as ex ante inducements to sway votes or ex post rewards for bringing home local benefits.
Some literature suggests that interested parties may donate in advance of legislation in an
effort to persuade legislators to shift their votes (Grossman and Helpman 1994, Grossman
and Helpman 1996, Chamon and Kaplan 2013). By contrast, interest groups, such as
political action committees, both sway legislators and seek to mobilize the public to reward
legislators for their actions (Stratmann 2005, Fox and Rothenberg 2011). Rocca and Gordon
(2013) have found, for example, that donations tend to be rewards for previous votes. Going
forward, we test whether members of the House representing hospitals that received a
  31 For example, as the 508 program was coming up for a re-authorization vote in 2007, Senator Charles
Schumer’s office issued a press release that stated, “In light of todays [sic] announcement that Senate leaders
will pursue an extension of Section 508 of the Medicare Modernization Act, US Senator Charles E. Schumer,
a member of the Senate Finance Committee, pledged today to work to include all New York Section 508
hospitals. . . ” (Office of Senator Charles Schumer 2006). In the remainder of the statement, the senator’s office
reiterated his commitment to increasing funding for New York hospitals.

re-authorization of the program.


6.2    Section 508-Recipient Hospitals and Political Lobbying

According to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, over the last 20 years, the US
health care industry spent more annually in absolute dollars on lobbying than was spent
by virtually any other industry (for more details on this data set, see Appendix A.1). In
2006, for example, cumulatively, hospitals and nursing homes, pharmaceutical and device
manufacturers, and health professionals spent over $338 million on lobbying activities. By
contrast, that same year, the oil and gas industry spent approximately $75 million, the real
estate industry spent approximately $82 million, and the auto industry spent approximately
$59 million (The Center for Responsive Politics 2019a). In particular, the American Hospital
Association spent approximately $18 million in 2006 lobbying on behalf of hospitals’
interests (The Center for Responsive Politics 2019b).
      In 2005, two years before the Section 508 program was slated to expire, hospitals that
received Section 508 waivers came together to form the Section 508 Hospital Coalition PAC.
The stated goal of the PAC was to lobby on behalf of Section 508-recipient hospitals. We
obtained the amount the Section 508 Hospital Coalition spent lobbying members of Congress
each year from 2005 through 2012 (see Appendix Figure A.12). In 2005, 2006, and 2007,
the period before the Section 508 program was reauthorized, the coalition cumulatively spent
approximately $829 thousand lobbying members of Congress (The Center for Responsive
Politics 2019c). The American Hospital Association spent approximately $54 million on
lobbying throughout that same period (although the AHA funding included lobbying for
the extension of the Section 508 program and lobbying on behalf of the interests of non-
Section 508-recipient hospitals) (The Center for Responsive Politics 2019b). Rocca and



                                             42
Gordon (2013) note that although individual voters may not observe and reward members of
Congress for contributing to distributive policies that benefit their district, interest groups,
such as the Section 508 Hospital Coalition, can sharpen the incentives for members of
Congress to act.


6.3    Estimating the Impact of the Section 508 Re-authorization On Campaign Con-
       tributions

After a short extension, on September 31, 2007, the Section 508 program expired and
payment increases to hospitals were eliminated. In the intervening months, there was an
intense lobbying effort to extend the program. On December 29, 2007, the President signed
S.2499 - the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007. This law included a
long-term extension of the Section 508 program and also restored the Section 508 payment
increases retrospectively for October, November, and December.
      The law passed out of the House of Representatives via a 411 to 3 margin (roll call vote
1184). Forty of the 42 members of the House with a Section 508-recipient hospital in their
district voted for the long-term extension of the Section 508 program. Two members of
the House with Section 508-recipient hospitals in their districts abstained from voting for
the re-authorization; those members had among the smallest gains from the Section 508
program.32
      To analyze whether members of the House with a hospital in their district received an
increase in campaign contributions in the run up to and in the wake of the vote to reauthorize
the Section 508 program, we estimate:


              Donationsc,t = βt Candidate_With_Section_508c · τt + ϑc + τt + εc,t                     (3)
  32 The members who abstained from voting for the Section 508 extension represented districts that gained
$96.8 thousand and $797.9 thousand respectively from the program. The mean gain across all recipients was
$5.54 million.


                                                   43
where we observe campaign contributions Donationsc,t from donors to a candidate for the
House of Representatives c in each quarter t, all measured in 2010 dollars. We include a
vector of quarter fixed effects τt and a vector of candidate fixed effects ϑc . We interact a
vector of year dummies with our treatment indicator Candidate_With_Section_508c which
takes a value of "1" when a candidate has a Section 508-recipient hospital in her district. We
focus on the votes taken during roll call vote 1184. Our omitted category is the first quarter
of 2007 (the quarter before the Section 508 program was slated to expire).
    We obtain data on campaign contributions from the DIME database, which synthesizes
data from the Federal Elections Commission (see Appendix A.1 for more information on
the data source). We analyze the campaign contributions to members of the House from
all donors, individual donors, and donors working in the hospital industry. We are able
to identify donors’ industry of employment by looking at the contributor categorization
code in the DIME data and analyzing the self-reported "employer" or "organization" field
in the DIME data and tagging a donor as working in the hospital industry if words such as
"hospital" are included in their employer/organization field.
    We limit our analysis to candidates for office from 2001 to 2010 that were serving as
members of the House in 2003 when the Section 508 program was initially authorized and
were serving again in 2007 when the Section 508 program was reauthorized (later we show
our results are robust to not including the 2003 restriction). We observe candidates even
if they did not win and remain as members of the House between 2003 and 2007.33 We
calculate wild-bootstrapped standard errors (although our results are robust to clustering
  33 There  is no statistically significant difference between the rates members of the House with and without a
Section 508-recipient hospital were reelected to office. Likewise, among those voted out of office, there is no
statistically significant difference in the rates that they run again as a function of whether or not they have a
Section 508-recipient hospital in their district. Finally, there is no statistically significant difference in whether
a member of the House decides to no longer seek reelection as a function of whether or not a member had
a Section 508-recipient hospital in her district. Our results are robust to limiting our analysis to candidates
who were in the House or ran for office each electoral cycle or including candidates who decided not to seek
reelection. When a candidate is not in the data for a given year, we dummy out their missing observation.



                                                         44
around candidates).
   As was the case in previous sections, there is no ‘perfect’ control group, so we show our
main results are robust across different control groups. Our main control group is composed
of candidates who were in office in 2003 (when Section 508 was initially authorized), had
a hospital in their district that unsuccessfully applied for a Section 508 waiver, and were
in office in 2007 when the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 was
passed. We also compare our treated group to several alternative control groups including: 1)
candidates for the House who were sitting members in 2003 and 2007 with hospitals in their
district that were paid using the PPS program, but no Section 508 hospitals; 2) candidates
for the House who were sitting members in 2003 and 2007 with one or more hospitals that
were eligible for the Section 508 program but did not apply; and 3) candidates for the House
who were sitting members in 2003 and 2007 with one or more hospitals in their district that
were ineligible for the Section 508 program. We also show our results are robust to limiting
our analysis to candidates who were in office in 2007. Finally, we construct a control group
of candidates using propensity score matching. As we illustrate, our treated and control
groups have virtually identical trends in campaign contributions from 2001 to 2007.
   As we did in previous analysis, we also describe how our treatment effects vary as a
function of congressional districts’ exposure to the Section 508 program. In this setting, our
dose response estimates allow us to test whether members of Congress representing more
heavily treated districts received larger increases in campaign contributions. To measure
each congressional district’s exposure, again we take our estimates of treated hospitals’
predicted revenue gains from the Section 508 program, as described in Section 4.1, and
sum these across hospitals in each district. As a result, our measure of a district’s treatment
exposure captures the potential dollars each district could receive from the Section 508
program, ignoring any supply responses.

Notes: This table presents the total campaign contributions received by the average member of the House of
Representatives each year from 2001 to 2010. Column (1) measures campaign contributions from all donors,
column (2) from individual donors, column (3) from individual donors in the same state as the member and
column (4) to (6) from individual donors in same state broken down by industry.



From 2001 to 2010, as we illustrate in Table 4, an average member of the House of
Representatives raised approximately $1.54 million per two-year election cycle. Campaigns
tend to bring in substantially larger campaign contributions as in the immediate run-up to an
election (e.g. in years with an election). In general, the majority of a candidate’s campaign
contributions come from committees, groups, or political action committees and not from
individual donors. Indeed, across our sample, only 42 percent of campaign contributions
come from individual donors. Approximately 71 percent of contributions from individuals
come from individual donors living in the same state as the candidate to whom they are
donating. Individual donors that report working for a hospital accounted for approximately

                                                      46
1.05 percent of the contributions from individuals from 2001 to 2010.
   We observe that total contributions to members of the House representing Section 508-
recipient hospitals increased after the program was extended. The event study in Figure 5
shows estimates of Equation (3) where the dependent variable is the total campaign contri-
butions to members of the House from all donors. The solid red line shows contributions to
candidates and members of the House with one or more Section 508 hospitals in their dis-
tricts; the hashed blue line shows contributions to members of the House and candidates with
a hospital that applied, but had their application rejected. As results in Figure 5 illustrate,
contributions to members of the House with a Section 508-recipient hospital in their districts
looked nearly identical to contributions to members without a Section 508-recipient hospital
throughout the period before the Section 508 program was reauthorized on December 19,
2007. However, during the year after the program was extended, campaign contributions
increased markedly for members with a Section 508 hospital in their districts. The point
estimates imply that in the third quarter of 2008 (the quarter leading up to the congressional
election), across all members of the House with a Section 508 recipient hospital in their
district, total campaign contributions increased by $190.56 thousand off a mean of $227
thousand in that same quarter that year (p < 0.05). We present full results in Appendix
Table A.4.
   One concern might be that more powerful members of the House were more likely to
have hospitals in their district granted Section 508 waivers and more powerful members
receive larger campaign contributions. However, it is notable that from 2001 to 2010, the
lone meaningful difference in contributions between our treated group and control group
occurs after the Section 508 program was reauthorized. In general, if one believed our results
simply captured powerful politicians having the ability to raise more contributions, one
would expect more powerful members of the House to receive larger campaign contributions
throughout our sample period from 2001 to 2010 and not exclusively after the Section 508

                                              47
program was reauthorized.

     Figure 5: The Impact of the Re-Authorization of the Section 508 Program on
                Campaign Contributions from All Donors Nationwide




Notes: These figures present estimates of Equation (3) where we regress campaign contributions (in constant 2010
dollars) from all donors nationwide on a vector of candidate fixed effects, quarter dummies, and interactions between the
treated candidate indicator and quarter dummies. Control candidates are those with one or more hospitals in their district
that applied for a Section 508 waiver but were rejected. 2007-Q1 is our omitted time period. 90% confidence intervals
are based on wild-bootstrapped standard errors clustered around candidates. The rightmost figure plots the coefficient of
the 2008-Q3 interaction term from Equation (3) as we vary the definition of the treatment group. Moving left to right,
each specification involves a treated group composed of candidates from congressional districts with increasingly large
gains in total IPPS payments (based on quantities in 2003 and actual and counterfactual payment rates in 2005) due to
the Section 508 program.



    Recall that approximately a third of treated congressional districts saw outsized gains
from the Section 508 program. The dose response estimates on the right side of Figure 5
show suggestive evidence that members representing these most heavily treated districts saw
the largest increases in campaign contributions in the third quarter of 2008. Among the half
of congressional districts most exposed to the program, campaign contributions increased
by $353 thousand in the third quarter of 2008 (p < 0.05). Likewise, among the 20 percent
of districts with the most exposure to the program, donations increased by $801 thousand
that same quarter (p < 0.05). However, the differences in contributions across groups are
not statistically significant. We show the dose response estimates for each quarter in 2007
and 2008 in Appendix Figure A.13.
    Our results are robust to restricting our analysis to contributions from different subsets
of donors. In Panel A of Appendix Figure A.14, we show results when we restrict our


                                                           48
analysis to contributions from donors from the same state as the member to whom they
donated. In Panel B, we limit our analysis to contributions from individual donors. In Panel
C, we focus on contributions from individual donors from the same state as the candidate
to whom they are donating. In Panel D, we focus on contributions excluding those from
individual donors (e.g. we focus on campaign contributions from organizations and political
action committees).


6.5    Section 508 Re-Authorization And Campaign Contributions by Industry Group

To illustrate that the donation increases we observe are a function of the Section 508 program,
we analyze changes in campaign contributions from individuals plausibly impacted and
unaffected by changes in hospitals’ Medicare reimbursements. In Figure 6, we estimate
Equation (3) and focus on campaign contributions from individual donors living in the same
state as the member of the House of Representatives to whom they contributed, broken down
by the industry of the donors. We focus on individuals likely to be directly impacted by the
Section 508 program - individuals working in the hospital sector - and individuals working
in two industries that should not be impacted by changes in hospital payments - the crop
production and basic processing industry and the oil and gas industry.
      In Panel A, we focus on contributions from individuals working in the hospital industry.
As the event study graph in Panel A illustrates, we observe suggestive evidence that members
of the House with a Section 508 in their district saw an increase in campaign contributions
from individuals working in the hospital industry in the fourth quarter of 2007 (the quarter
when the vote occurred to reauthorize the Section 508 program) (p < 0.12) and in the third
quarter of 2008 (when there were elections after the program was reauthorized) (p < 0.13).
On the right of Panel A, we present dose response estimates for the point estimates in the

         Panel A: Individual Donors in the Same State from the Hospital Sector




  Panel B: Individual Donors in the Same State from the Crop Production & Basic

        Panel C: Individual Donors in the Same State from the Oil & Gas Sector




Notes: These panels present estimates of Equation (3) where we regress campaign contributions (in constant 2010
dollars) to candidates from individuals in the same state on a vector of candidate fixed effects, quarter dummies, and
interactions between the treated candidate indicator and quarter dummies. Control candidates are those that have one
or more hospitals in their district that applied for a Section 508 waiver but were rejected. 2007-Q1 is our omitted time
period. 90% confidence intervals are based on wild-bootstrapped standard errors clustered around candidates. The
rightmost figures plot the coefficients of the 2007-Q4 and 2008-Q3 interaction terms from Equation (3) as we vary
the definition of the treatment group. Moving left to right in each figure, each specification involves a treated group
composed of candidates from congressional districts with increasingly large gains in total IPPS payments (based on
quantities in 2003 and actual and counterfactual payment rates in 2005) due to the Section 508 program. The 2007-Q4
and 2008-Q3 coefficients are reported above and below the error bars, respectively.

fourth quarter of 2007 (included in black) and the third quarter of 2008 (included in red).
During both periods, the treatment effects were larger and were statistically significant in
districts more exposed to the Section 508 program.
      We observe markedly different effects when we analyze campaign contributions to
members of the House from individuals working in industries that were largely unaffected
by the Section 508 program. In Panels B and C, we focus on contributions from individuals
in the same state as the member to whom they donated who were working in the crop
production industry (Panel B) and the oil and gas industry (Panel C).34 We do not observe
that members of the House with Section 508-recipient hospitals in their districts received
increases in donations from individuals in these unaffected industries. Likewise, we do
not observe any meaningful difference in our treatment effects among these two unrelated
groups that is correlated with the exposure of each congressional district to the Section 508
program.


6.6    Robustness of Our Campaign Contribution Analysis to Different Sample Restric-
       tions and the Use of Alternative Control Groups

In our main analysis, we limited our sample to candidates for the House who were in office
in 2003 (when the Section 508 program was introduced) and in 2007 (when the program
was reauthorized). In Panel A of Appendix Figure A.15, we show estimates of Equation (3)
where we relax that assumption and only require that an individual was a sitting member
of the House when the Section 508 program was reauthorized in December 2007. As we
illustrate, this does not qualitatively change our results. We also illustrate our results are
robust across several alternative control groups. In Panel B of Appendix Figure A.15, we
  34 We  chose these two industries because individuals in each sector gave at similar levels as individuals
working in the hospital industry. Likewise, these were two industries that do not have meaningful engagement
with the hospital sector and would not benefit from increased hospital output, increased health sector salaries,
or increased employment in the hospital sector.

show an event study graph for estimates of Equation (3) and our dose response estimates
for 2008 Q3 when we construct a control group composed of candidates for the House who
were in office in 2003 and 2007, had hospitals in their district that were paid using the PPS
program, but had no Section 508-recipient hospitals. In Panel C of Appendix Figure A.15,
we construct a control group composed of candidates for the House that were in office in
2003 and 2007 and had one or more hospitals in their district that were eligible for the
Section 508 program but did not apply. In Panel D of Appendix Figure A.15, we construct
a control group composed of candidates for the House who were in office in 2003 and
2007 and had one or more hospitals in their district that were ineligible for the Section 508
program. Finally, we construct a control group of candidates matched using propensity
scores and present results in Panel E of Appendix Figure A.15.35 Across these alternative
control groups, we observe that our main result - that members of the House with a Section
508-recipient hospital in their district received an increase in campaign contributions after
the program was reauthorized - remains qualitatively unchanged.


7     Conclusion

In the long term, improving the productivity of spending on the Medicare program represents
one of the most significant policy priorities in the US. Until now, most academic research
on health care spending has focused on the influence of demand and supply side factors
on the variation and growth in domestic health spending. In this paper, we present, to our
knowledge, some of the first work that assesses empirically how political dynamics in the
US influence health care spending. We show that policies that raised hospitals’ Medicare
reimbursements were used to win members’ votes on controversial legislation and that
    35 We construct our control group using propensity score matching where we use a probit model to estimate
a candidate’s probability of having a hospital in her district that received a Section 508 waiver. In our probit,
we control for the party of the candidate, the winning vote share in the 2001/2002 House election, the number
of hospitals per district, the share of non-profit hospitals per district and the share of teaching hospitals per
district.

                                                      52
politicians received larger campaign contributions when they voted on the extension of these
higher payments. In short, we show that legislators were rewarded for votes that raised
health spending and we illustrate the political dynamics that make reducing health spending
difficult.
    Legislators struggled to pass the Medicare program in 1965 and, in the ensuing decades,
there have been numerous political fights over altering and expanding the program (Marmor
2000). The pressure members of Congress face to be re-elected makes it challenging for
Congress to pass large pieces of sweeping legislation (Mayhew 1974). Evans (2004) argues
that logrolling is imperative to pass sweeping legislation in Congress. Nowhere was the
role of logrolling more visible than in efforts to pass the MMA of 2003 (Lee 2003). We
study how one distributive policy added to the MMA of 2003 – the Section 508 program –
affected hospital behavior and health spending and influenced campaign contributions.
    We show that hospitals represented by a member of Congress who voted ‘Yea’ to the
MMA were more likely to receive a Section 508 waiver. Section 508 waivers increased
hospitals’ Medicare reimbursement rates substantially. In turn, we observe that hospitals
that received a waiver increased their activity. This, together with their payment increase,
led hospitals that received a Section 508 waiver to dramatically increase their Medicare
inpatient spending in the six years after the program was introduced. Hospitals that received
these payment increases invested in new technology and increased their payroll. We also
show that congressional districts with Section 508-recipient hospitals had large increases in
health spending and an increase in hospital employment.
    The Section 508 program was written to expire three years after it was introduced.
However, we show that hospitals spent millions lobbying to have the Section 508 program
extended. The bill to extend the Section 508 payments was passed by a substantial margin
in the House of Representatives and members with a Section 508-recipient hospital in their
districts were more likely to vote for the extension of the program. In the run-up to the

                                             53
vote to reauthorize the Section 508 program, members of Congress representing a district
with a Section 508-recipient hospital received an increase in campaign contributions from
individuals working in the hospital sector in their state. After the program was extended,
members of Congress with a Section 508-recipient hospital in their district received large
increases in campaign contributions from all donors, including those outside the health
sector. The gains from the Section 508 program and the subsequent increases in campaign
contributions were concentrated in the congressional districts that were the most exposed to
the Section 508 program.
   The extension of the Section 508 program highlights one explanation for how inefficient
and/or cost increasing programs continue to be readily funded by Medicare. We observe
that the total dollars spent lobbying for the extension of the Section 508 program and the
added campaign contributions to members after the program was extended was in the tens of
millions of dollars. By contrast, we estimate that the extension of the Section 508 program
raised inpatient Medicare spending by more than $2.1 billion. This is consistent with work
by Ansolabehere, Figueiredo, and Snyder Jr. (2003) questioning why there is not more
money in politics.
   The critical finding from this work is that there is a close link between electoral politics
and the Medicare program. While we focus on a narrow program that was inserted into
the MMA to illustrate the relationship between politics and health spending, the type of
provision we analyzed in this paper is present in virtually every piece of major health care
legislation. For example, the Government Accountability Office identified 16 statutory
provisions passed between 1997 and 2012 that modified Medicare payment policies and
increased payments to specific subsets of hospitals (Government Accountability Office
2013). Moreover, while we focus this analysis on the impact of politics on spending in the
Medicare program, lawmakers vote on provisions that impact private insurance markets, the
pricing of pharmaceuticals, and the regulation of medical devices. As a result, there is scope

                                             54
for politics to have a large impact on US health spending in aggregate. Going forward, we
hope this paper motivates future work in this area, including testing how lobbying dollars
influence health care spending, examining which stakeholders benefit from health care
spending growth, and considering how political dynamics impact the variation and growth
in US health spending.

Appendix A       Description of Data and Data Cleaning


A.1   Datasets and Sources

American Hospital Association Annual Survey: We obtained data on hospital staffing,
payroll, technology adoption, and other hospital characteristics from the American Hospital
Association (AHA) annual survey. The AHA has surveyed hospitals annually since 1946.
More information on the AHA survey data can be viewed at: http://www.ahadataviewer.
com/book-cd-products/AHA-Survey/.

American Hospital Directory Data: We use data on hospitals’ Medicare activity that
we obtained from the American Hospital Directory (AHD). The AHD is a for-profit data
vendor that sells cleaned Medicare claims data derived from the Medicare Provider Analysis
and Review limited access database. This includes claims records for 100% of Medicare
fee-for-service inpatient claims. Details on the AHD data can be found at www.ahd.com.

Center for Responsive Politics Data: We identified the Section 508 Coalition via data
on congressional lobbying presented by the Center for Responsive Politics https://www.
opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000056560&year=2009.

CMS Inpatient PPS Impact Files: We accessed historical Impact Files from the Cen-
ters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). These files list the parameters affect-
ing each hospital’s inpatient PPS payments for each fiscal year (e.g., hospital wage in-
dices). We use these files to calculate Medicare inpatient PPS operating and capital
payments as described in Appendix A.2. The files and more information are avail-
able at: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/
AcuteInpatientPPS/Historical-Impact-Files-for-FY-1994-through-Present.

Database on Ideology, Money in Politics, and Elections (DIME): We accessed data on
campaign contributions from the DIME database. The database was constructed by Adam

                                            2
Bonica. More information on the data is available at https://data.stanford.edu/dime.
Their information on campaign contributions was collected from the Federal Election
Commission. To calculate campaign contributions to a candidate, we remove transactions
identified by FEC transaction type codes as loan repayments (codes starting with 16, 20
and 22), refunds (codes starting with 17 and 23), expenditures against the candidate (24A,
24N), contributions from the candidate themselves (15C), and other miscellaneous codes. In
addition to direct contributions to candidates’ campaigns, we include “independent expendi-
ture[s] advocating election of [the] candidate” (code 24E), in-kind contributions (codes 15Z
and 24Z), and communication/electioneering expenses (codes 24F and 29). A full list of FEC
transaction type codes is available at https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/
transaction-type-code-descriptions/.

Federal Register: We extracted data on Medicare labor market area (i.e., CBSA) wage
indexes from the annual Hospital Inpatient Prospective System (IPPS) Final Rules published
in the Federal Register. These wage indexes are typically listed in Tables 4A and 4B of the
final rule for each fiscal year. We used these to estimate what each Section 508 hospital’s
wage index (and thus IPPS payment rate) would have been without its labor market
reclassification under Section 508. The Federal Register files are available at: https://www.
cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/
IPPS-Regulations-and-Notices. The wage index tables for 2007-2010 are also avail-
able at: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/
AcuteInpatientPPS/Acute-Inpatient-Files-for-Download.

Freedom of Information Act Request: We filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
request to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to obtain a list of hospitals that
applied for a Section 508 waiver, a list of applications that had their applications approved,
and the criteria on which hospitals’ applications were judged. Our FOIA request was filed


                                              3
on December 1, 2014. We received a reply on March 3, 2015.

RAND Hospital Data: We accessed data on hospitals’ total revenue, Medicare prospective
payment system (PPS) payments, and Medicare inpatient discharges from the RAND
Corporation, which sells cleaned Medicare Cost Reports (HCRIS) data. We use federal
fiscal year-level year data with error corrections by RAND. More information on the data is
available at: https://www.hospitaldatasets.org.

Voteview Database: We accessed data on the votes by members of Congress for the
Medicare Modernization Act from the Voteview database. The database includes roll call
votes for every vote taken by Congress and can be accessed at voteview.com. The database
is hosted and maintained by UCLA’s Department of Political Science.


A.2   Calculating Medicare Inpatient PPS Payment Rates

To calculate payments, we followed payment rules outlined each year in the Federal Register.
We began by calculating the inpatient PPS operating payments and capital payments, which
were adjusted using the hospital operating wage index, labor and non-labor shares, operating
cost-of-living adjustment, disproportionate share payments, indirect medical education
payments, geographic adjustment factors, and capital cost-of-living adjustments. We then
used diagnosis related group (DRG) weights to calculate the standard payment amount for
each inpatient case exclusive of outlier payments. Outlier payments are additional payments
made to hospitals if specific cases involve atypically long stays in the hospital.


A.3   Identifying the Industry of a Donor

For identifying the industry of employment of the donor/contributor, we primarily use the
contributor categorization code in the DIME database. Details on categorization can be
found at https://www.opensecrets.org/downloads/crp/CRP_Categories.txt. We

                                              4
supplement this categorization by looking for specific words in the contributors’ employer
and organization field. For example, we categorized contributors to the hospital industry by
looking for words "hospital", "healthcare system", "health system" and "medical center" in

    Notes: All statistics (except MMA votes) are calculated using 2004 AHA Annual Hospital Survey data. We exclude Critical Access Hospitals, hospitals that are not registered with
    the AHA for all of 2001 to 2010, and hospitals that are not in our sample for all of 2001 to 2010. Asterisks indicate that the group’s mean is statistically significantly different from
    the 508 hospitals’ mean based on a t-test (***p<0.01, **p<0.05, *p<0.1). We do not conduct t-tests for the "All AHA Hospitals" group.

    Note: Gains are in constant 2010 dollars. Gains in IPPS payment rates are calculated for 2005. Gains in total IPPS payments are calculated by applying actual and counterfactual payment rates
    from 2005 to Medicare inpatient quantities from 2003. Hospital-level gains are based on our analytic sample of 88 Section 508 hospitals. Congressional district-level gains are based on the
    same sample of Section 508 hospitals, aggregated to the district level.

congressional district fixed effects, year dummies, and interactions between the treated congressional district indicator and
year dummies. 2003 is our omitted year. Control congressional districts are those with no Section 508-recipient hospitals.
90% confidence intervals are based on wild-bootstrapped standard errors clustered around congressional districts. The
rightmost figures plot the coefficient of the 2010 interaction term from Equation (2) as we vary the definition of the
treatment group. Moving left to right in each figure, each specification involves a treated group composed of congressional
districts with increasingly large gains in total IPPS payments (based on quantities in 2003 and actual and counterfactual
payment rates in 2005) due to the Section 508 program. Medicare inpatient PPS payments are derived from the RAND
Medicare Cost Reports (HCRIS) data. Payroll expenses and full-time personnel are derived from the American Hospital
Association’s Annual Survey data.

Notes: These figures present estimates of Equation (2) where we regress congressional district outcomes on a vector of
congressional district fixed effects, year dummies, and interactions between the treated congressional district indicator
and year dummies. 2003 is our omitted year. Control congressional districts are the 10 nearest neighbors according
to the probit model of propensity score matching. 90% confidence intervals are based on wild-bootstrapped standard
errors clustered around congressional districts. The rightmost figures plot the coefficient of the 2010 interaction term

Notes: These figures plot the coefficient of the interactions between the treated candidate indicator and quarter dummies
for all quarters in years 2007 and 2008 from Equation (3) as we vary the definition of the treatment group. Moving left
to right in each figure, each specification involves a treated group composed of candidates from congressional districts
with increasingly large gains in total IPPS payments in 2005 (based on quantities in 2003 and actual and counterfactual
payment rates in 2005) due to the Section 508 program. Control candidates are those with one or more hospitals in their
district that applied for a Section 508 waiver but were rejected. 2007-Q1 is our omitted time period. 90% confidence
intervals are based on wild-bootstrapped standard errors clustered around candidates. Campaign contributions are in
thousands of constant 2010 dollars.
