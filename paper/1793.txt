            A Reformulation of the Economic Theory of Fertility



                                  ABSTPAC

      When parents are altruistic toward children, the choices of fertility and

consumption come from the maximization of a dynastic utility function. The

maximization conditions imply first, an arbitrage condition for consumption

across generations, and second, the equation of the benefit from an extra

child to the net cost of rearing that child. These conditions Imply that

fertility in open economies depends positively on the world Interest rate, on

the degree of altruism, and on the growth of child-survival probabilities;

and negatively on the rate of technical progress and the growth rate of

social security. The growth of consumption across generations depends on

changes in the net cost of rearing children, but not on interest rates or

tirne preference. Even when we Include life-cycle elements, we conclude that

the   growth of aggregate consumption per capita depends in the long run on the

growth of consumption across generations. Thereby we show that real interest

rates and growth rates of consumption per capita would be unrelated in the

long run.

1.   IntroductIon

     The economic approach to fertility has emphasized the effects of parents'

income and the cost of rearing children. The most important determinants of

cost have been employment opportunities of children, the value of parents'

time spent on child care, monetary and psychological costs of avoiding births

through abstinence and birth—control methods, and the interaction between the

"quality" and quantity of children.

     With the exception of work by Richard Easterlin (19'73) and a few others

(e.g., Becker [1981. Chapter 7]), studies that use an economic approach have

neglected the analytical links between decisions by different generations of

the same family. Moreover, despite Maithus's famous precedent, fertility has

not been integrated with the determination of wage rates, interest rates,

capital accumulation, and other macro variables (exceptions include Razin and

Ben Zion [1975] and WillIs (1985]).

     This paper and a sequel develop an economic analysis of both linkages in

fertility across generations and of the interaction between fertility and

various macro variables (see Rarro and Becker [1985] for an earlier version).

In the present paper, wage rates and interest rates are parameters to each

family and toopen economies;-the sequel considers the determination of

interest rates, wage rates, population growth, and capital accumulation In

closed economies.

     Our model is based on the assumption that parents are altruistic toward

children——hence, the utility of parents depends on the utility of each child

as well as on the consumption of parents. By relating the utility of

children to their own consumption and to the utility of their children, we
                                                                            2



derive a dynastic utility function that depends on the consumption and number

of descendants In all generations. We venture to use the word

 'reformulation" In the title because of our emphasis on dynastic utility

functions and the number of descendants In all generations. The reformulated

approach provides a new way of looking at the determination of fertility.

    Section 2 sets out a model of altruism toward children, and derives the

budget constraint and utility function of a dynastic family. The first-order

conditions to maximize utility imply that fertility in any generation depends

positively on interest rates and the degree of altruism, and negatively on

the rate of growth in the consumption of descendants. Consumption of a

descendant is positively related to the difference between the cost of

rearing a descendant and the value of his lifetime earnings.

    Section 3 considers the effects of child mortality, subsidies to (or

taxes on) children, and social security and other transfer payments to

adults. Among other things, we show that the demand for surviving children

rises during the transition to low child mortality. However, this demand

returns to its prior level once mortalIty stabIlIzes at a lOW level.

    Section 4 considers fertility and population growth in economies linked

to an international capital market but not an International labor market.

Among other results, we show that fertility is reduced by declines in

International interest rates, and by increases In an economy's rate of

technological progress. This analysis of fertility in open economies may

contribute to the explanation of low fertility in Western countries during

the past couple of decades.

    Section 5 extends the analysis to include full life—cycle variations In

consumption, earnings, and utility. We show that fertility depends on the
                                                                             3



expenditure on the subsistence and human capital of children, but not on

expenditures that simply raise the consumption of children. We show also for

demographic steady states, that aggregate consumption does not depend on

interest rates, time preference or other determinants of life-cycle

variations in consumption.



2. A Model of Fertility and Population Change

    We assume that each person lives for two generations, childhood and

adulthood. By assuming only one period of adulthood we omit life-cycle

considerations. However, we show in section 5 how to combine a life-cycle

analysis with the intergenerational forces that we stress in sections 2—4.

For simplicity, we pretend that each adult has children without "marriage."

We believe that production of children through marriage of men and women

would not affect the essence of the analysis. We also bypass issues related

to the spacing of children by assuming that parents have all of their

children at the beginning of adulthood.

    Economic analyses of fertility have assumed that the utility of parents

depends on the number and 'quality' of children, usually without any

specification of how or why children affect utility. Although agnosticism

about preferences is common among economists, a more powerful analysis of

fertility and population change can be obtained by building on recent

discussions of altruism toward children.

    The importance of altruism within families began to be recognized

systematically by economists during the 1970s (two early studies are Barro

[1974] and Becker [1974]). Obviously many parents are altruistic toward

their children in the   sense   that the utility of parents depends positively
                                                                                           4



 on the utility of children. This paper relies heavily on the assumption of

 altruism toward children to generate a dynamic analysis of population change.

     If the utility of a parent were an additively-separable function of own

 consumption, denoted c0, and the utility of each child, then



                                                      n
                       (1)      =
                                    v(c0)                 *(U11. n0),
                                                  1=1



where U0 Is parental utility, v is a standard utility function (with v' >                  0,
v'' <   0),   U11 is the utility of the ith child, and n0 Is the number of

children. Since reactions by parents to differences among their children are

not Important for the Issues discussed In this paper,1 we simplify by

assuming that siblings are identical; hence the function                    =    is the same

for all children. If this function is Increasing and concave in the utility

of each child, U1 •,   then the parent's utility is maximized when all children
attain the same level of utility,
                                      U1
                                              =           . for   all i and j.   Then parent's

utility can be written as



                        (2)    U0 =               +
                                      v(c0)           n0*(U1,     n0).



    With the further assumption that the function * is proportional to U1, so

that #(U1, n0) =   U1a(n0), parent's utility would be given by




'See the discussions In Becker (1981, Chapter 6), Sheshlnski and Weiss
(1982), and Behrrnan, et al. (1982).
                                                                                    5


                                (3)     U0 =   v(c0)   a(n0)n0U1.



       The term a(n0) measures the degree of altruism toward each child, and

converts the utility of children Into that of parents. We assume that, for

given utility per child U1, parental utility Is Increasing and concave in the

number of children n0.            This property, together with equation (3), requires

the altruism function to satisfy the conditions,



               (4)     a(n0) ÷ n0a'(n0) > 0 and 2a'(n0) +       n0a'(n0)   <   0,


where we neglect integer restrictions on the number of children.

    We assume that the parameters of a parents utility function are the same

for all generations of a dynastic family. Therefore, the utility of each

child, U1, depends as in equation (3) on own consumption, c1, and on the

number, n1, and utility, Uj,, of own children. If the presentation is

simplified by neglecting utility during childhood (see section 5), then ;je

have   after    substituting for U In equation (3)



                 (5)     U0 =           ÷
                                v(c0)       a(n0)n0v(c1)   a(n0)a(n1)n0n1U2.



Note that U2 is the utility of each grandchild, and n0n1 is the number of

grandchildren.

    Utility functions like that in equation (3) have been criticized for

neglecting altruism toward grandchildren (md perhaps great—grandchildren,

etc.). Equation (5) shows that this criticism Is invalid because,
                                                                                 6



Indirectly, grandparents are altruistic toward grandchildren. A sore subtle

claim is that the indirect altruism toward grandchildren must be weaker than

the direct altruism toward children. Even this criticism does not

necessarily hold, because the utility function in equation (5) does not

require the altruism toward grandchildren to be less than that toward

children. This property holds only if a(n1) < 1.

      The utility of great-grandchildren would appear In the utility function

If      in equation (5) were replaced by terms that depend on c2,
                                                                    n2 and U3.
By continuing to substitute later consumption and fertility, we arrive at a

dynastic utility function that depends on the consumption and number of

children of all descendants of the same family line. This dynastic utility

function can be expressed as




                           (6)       U0 =         A1N1v(c1),
                                            i=0

descendant in the ith generation, as given by

                                               a(n).



     Is the number of children per adult in generation J, N. is the number of

descendants In the ith generation, as given by
                                                                                               7

               (8)      N = 1,      N. =           a.,       I =   1, 2,....
                         0
                                           j=0



and c. is the consumption per adult in generation i.

    At a point where a parent has one child, a =               1, we can say that a parent
is 'selfish' If the marginal utility of his own consumption exceeds the

marginal utility that he derives from his child's consumption. This

definition implies a(1) < 1 for selfish parents. Since the utility of a

dynastic family with stationary consumption per person (c1 =                   c) and a
stationary number of descendants (N. = 1) would be bounded only i aCi) < 1,

we assume that parents are "selfish.'

    The analysis simplifies greatly if the degree of altruism toward

children has a constant elasticity with respect to the number of

children——that is,



                            (9)       .-i(n. ) =

specifically, A. =   '(N.).       We use this simplification for the subsequent

analysis. Then the condition 0 < a(l) < 1 requires 0 <                   < 1. and the

condition that parental utility is increasing and concave In the number of

children for given utility per child (as ensured by the inequalities in

expression (4)) corresponds to 0           < 1.      By substituting the altruism

function from equation (9) into the expression for dynastic utility in

equation (t3), we get

          Suppose that we change the number of descendants in generation i,

while holding fixed the total consumption,           C = N.e.,for        generation i, as

well as the number and consumption per person in other generations
                                                                                  (N and c
for j         1). Then the change In (J0 measures the benefit or loss from having

more people in generation i to consume a given aggregate quantity of goods.

Since the production of children is costly, an increase in N1 in this manner

must raise (J0 near a utility-maximizing position (if children are being

produced). Otherwise, people would do better with fewer children.                  The

fertility literature on the value of parents' time, we sometimes assume that

     is proportional to the parent's wage rate, w1. We assume also that debt

can be left to children——that is, bequests                               can be negative as well as

positive.

child—rearing costs, /3. The chosen path of consumption per adult, C0, c1,

each generation. However, we neglect integer restrictions on N1. Ponzi
games, in hlch the debt grows forever as fast as or faster than the interest
rate, would be ruled out if the present value (as of period 0) of debt

     Equation (13) is the usual arbitrage condition for shifting consumption

     Equation (14) says that the marginal benefit of an additional child (or

the marginal cost. The right side of the equation is the net lifetime cost

 subtract from the cost of rearing a child In generation i-i, valued in goods

of generation i (.1(l + r1)). The left side of equation (14) is

essentially the effect on utility from adding an additional adult descendant

 in generation 1, N1, while holding fixed •the total consumption C. of that

generation.8 As discussed earlier, this marginal utility must be positive

near an optimal position, which ImplIes 1          -   0(c.)      > 0 (see expression

 (ii)).

    Equation (14) Indicates that children would be a financial burden to

altruistic parents: the cost of rearing an additional child would exceed his

lifetime earnings. Otherwise, altruistic parents would maximize utility by

having as many children as were biologically feasible. Caldwell (1982), among

others, argues that parents in less—developed countries want as many children

as possible because children are profitable in the sense that their earnings

as child laborers exceed the cost of rearing them.               Altruistic parents would

want as many children as possible even when child labor was not profitable,

if the lifetime    earnings   of children exceeded the cost of rearing the

marginal child.

    With the definition, a(c.)        v'(c1)c1/v(c.), equation (14) can be

 The left side would be proportional to c. If a(c,) were constant. Otherwise,

we assume that o(c,) either falls or increases slowly enough with c. so that

 the left side is increasing in c1. Then equation (16) implies that c1 is a

positive function of the net cost of producing another descendant In

geheration I.         It follows that consumption per person, c1, grows across

generations only if the net cost of creating descendants also grows. Hence.

descendants have the same consumption if they are equally costly to produce.

In contrast, the usual models of optimal consumption over time imply that

consumption grows (or falls) over time if the interest rate exceeds (or is

less than) the rate of time preference. In our analysis, the rate of growth

between generations of consumption per person is essentially Independent of

the level of Interest rates, and also does not depend on the rate of altruism

or time preference, as summarized by the parameter a.

      The main effects from changes in the level of interest rates or In the

degree of altruism show up on fertility, n.. We can rewrite equation (13) to

solve out for the fertility rate:



                                                         l/€

Equation (16) pegs the intertemporal—substitution term, v(c.1)/v(c.), for
I =   1,   2          because c. in each future generation depends only on the net

cost of producing descendants. For example, if the cost were the same for

all generations, the intertemporal-substjtutjon term would be unity. Since

substitution in consumption is pegged, the fertility rate, n. for i = 1, 2.

       rises with increases in the. interest rate, r.

altruism, a. flote that these responses satisfy the arbitrage condition for

shifting consumption across generations, even though the time path of

consumption per person does not change. For this given behavior of

consumption per person, higher values of interest rates or of the rate of

1tru1sm motivate a family to have descendants later rather than sooner—-that

is, fertility rates rise.

       Richard Easterlin, a pioneer In analyzing the effects of

intergenerational relations on fertility, has argued (1973) that fertility

depends negatively on the wealth of parents compared to own wealth because

growing up in a wealthy family shifts preferences toward own consumption at

the expense of children. Put differently, fertility Is said to be positively

related to the growth In wealth from the previous to the present generation.

Fertility in our model also depends on the rate of growth between

generations, but it depends negatively on the growth between own consumption

and consumption per capita of the next      generation.   Moreover, in our model,

preferences are invariant with wealth and have the same form for each

generation.

       Another important property of the model concerns the effect of changes in

we3lth,       which we can represent by shifts in the initial assets k0. Equation

(16) implies that consumption per person in each future generation, c. for

       1, 2         depends only on the net cost of descendants, .i(1 +    r.)   -


w..     If a shift In wealth leaves unchanged the cost of raising children,

         and the wage rate of descendants, w1, then there is no effect on future

consumption per person, c..       In this case it also follows from equation (17)

that    future fertility, n. for i = 1, 2         does not change with a shift in
                                                                                               15


wealth. With future consumption per capita and future fertility unchanged,

the dynastic budget equation (15) implies that either initial consumption,

c0.
      or   fertility, n0, must change. Using equation (17) for I = 0, we can see

that an increase (or decrease) In c0 must be accompanied by an increase (or

decrease) in no. That is, wealthier persons consume more and also have

larger families.

      The results imply that an increase in say inherited wealth would increase

only the scale of a dynastic family. The number of descendants,                          and

aggregate consumption, C1, in each future generation would increase by the

same proportion as the increase in initial fertility, n0. We can see this

result directly by recalling that N. =
                                            n0n1
                                                   .. .        for   I = 1, 2,

Substitution for each fertility rate from equation (17) leads to



                                        I
      (18)     N. =    [v'(c.)/v'(c0)]. R (1   +

                                                           ,           i   =   1,   2,
                                       j=1



An increase in wealth raises c0 and thereby lowers the marginal utility of

wealth, v'(c0). Since all future values of c. are unchanged, equation (18)

shows that all future values of       rise by the same proportion.

      Future capital per person, k. for i = 1, 2               would not change with a

shift In wealth because future consumption per person, c., and fertility, fl1

are unchanged. This result follows from the budget conditions in equation

(12) and from the dynastic budget constraint in equation (15). Consequently.

bequests to each descendant of the dynastic head are unaffected by a change

In dynastic wealth.
    Stated differently, wealth completely regresses to the mean between

parents and each child because wealthier parents would spend all of their

additional resources on their own consumption and on raising larger families

A positive relation between wealth and fertility may help to explain the

significant regression toward the mean in the wealth of parents and each

child in the United States and other countries (see Becker and Tomes. 1986,

Table 2). Although our analysis goes too far by implying complete regressi::

to the mean over one generation, we show below that this extreme result no

longer holds if the cost of having children, p.,         depends     on the number of

children.

    Dynastic utility in equation (6) is a time—separable function of the

number of descendants and consumption in each generation, and does not depen

explicitly on the fertility of any generation. Demand functions derived frc-

time-separable utility functions depend only the marginal utility of wealth

and the prices of variables with the same date. Consequently, if we hold

constant the narginal utility of wealth, the number of descendants and

consumption in any generation would not be affected by price changes in oth':

generations. For example, an increase in the net cost of producing

descendants for generation j alone would not change the number of descendan:..

In later generations, i >     j. Fertility would      rise sufficiently between th

jth and (j   - l)st   generations to maintain the number of descendants in all

later generations.

    To illustrate these results, consider a tax on raising children in

generation j,   which   raises p.   but   does not change p.   for   i *   j.   Furthermor
to abstract from wealth effects (which we have already discussed), assume
                                                                                   17



compensating increase in initial assets, k0, that leaves the marginal utility

of wealth, v'(c0), unchanged. Equation (16) Indicates that Cj1 rises, but

all other c1 do not change. Equation (17) indIcates that fertility in

generation j falls (chiidren are now more costly to produce), while fertilty

in j       1 rIses. Moreover, equation (18) implies that the Increase in

fertility in generation j       1 exactly offsets the fall in generation j.

Hence, the nuiaber of descexdan after the (j --         l)st   generation Is not

affected by the tax In geiat1on j.

       Similarly, a decreasc n wages for one generation, compensated to hold

constant the marginal utIlity of wealth, reduces fertility in the previous

generation and raises fertility in the same generation by equal percentages.

Again, the number of descendants in later generations does not change. As it

were, the fertility rates of adjacent generations are perfect substitutes in

the production of descendants: any change In the net cost of producing

descendants in one generation causes enough substitution from the fertility

in   the   succeeding generation to leave unchanged the number of descendants in

subsequent     generations.

     Consider now a permanent increase In the cost of children that raises the

net cost of children, 1(l -r11) -                  by the same proportion for each
                                         w11   ,



generation I > j.      re we again hold constant the marginal utility of wealth,

v'(c0), equation (16) implies that consumption per person rises In generation

j    1 and in each subsequent generation. Further, if we now assume as an

pprox1matIon that the elasticity of utility Is the constant a, then the

increases in Cj1. c.2, . .     . are   equiproportional. The arbitrage condition

for consumption over time in equation (13) simplifIes In this case to
                                                                                                         18

Therefore, the equiproportional Increases in c1 for i =                        j        1        imply

that fertility in generation i falls (because cj/c.1 declines), while

fertility In all other generations is unchanged. Consequently, given

interest rates, even a permanent (compensated) tax on children reduces

fertility only In the generation where the tax is first enacted. However,

the effect on Incentives is permanent because the utility function of an

altruistic, dynastic family depends on the number of descendants, rather than

on fertility itself, and the decline In fertility in one generation alone

reduces the number of descendants In all later generations.

          The permanent increase in                 for   I >   j means also that consumption per
person, c1 for I >              j, is permanently higher. Since is higher while n1                       Is

unchanged (for i >              j), the right side of equation (12) indicates a larger
level of expenditure per person in each period. This greater expenditure is

financed by higher levels of capital and bequests per person, k. for I >

          The assumption that the cost of rearing each.child Is independent of the

number of children Is crucial to our conclusion first, that wealth completely

regresses to the mean over one generation, and second, that a permanent tax

on children reduces fertility only in the initial generation. The

qualitative properties survive natural modifications of this specification,

but adjustments to disturbances can now take several generations.

costs Increase or decrease with n, depending on the sign of b''(n). Forces

that favor b' '    >0   are a rise In the shadow price of parents' time as the

amount of child—care Increases, and an Increase In the physical burden of

bearing children as the number of children Increases. On the other hand,

can be negative over some range because of economies of scale In raising

children, and because the opportunity cost of preventing births would '1l

when the number of children rose. We assume that the first set of fr:es

eventually dominates, so that b'' > 0 applies in the range of our analysis.

    This modification to t cost of rearing children does not affect the

arbitrage condition for shifi,' consumption across generations, as given

equation (13). However, the other set of first—order conditions changes

that shown in equation (14) to



                                                         —       —                  —

 the far right arises because an Increase In n11, and hence In N1, means that

    would fall for a given value of N11. This new term is negative if the

 marginal cost of raising children In generation i, b'(n1), exceeds the

 average cost, b(n)/n1, for then a decrease in n lowers the average cost of

 raising children In generation 1.

    Even with a rising or falling marginal cost of rearing children, equation

 (21) implies that the steady-state value of c depends on the steady-state

value of a, and on the values of b'(l +   r)   and w. Equation (13), in turn,

Implies that the steady-state fertility rate still depends only on the

interest rate and the rate of altruism, a.

    When the marginal cost of children is constant, we have shown that

transitions between steady states take only one generation. Steady states

remain stable even when marginal costs are increasing (see Section 2 of the

appendix), but transitions now take several generations.

    As an example of the dynamic effects that arise, consider an Increase in

initial assets, k0. When the marginal cost of children was assumed to be

constant, we found that an increase in k0 increased c0 and n0, but did not

change future values of c1 and n..   If marginal costs are rising (b'' > Q),

an increase in n raises b'(n0), which increases c1 (by equation (21)). An

increase in c1 raises n1 (by equation (13)), which increases c2, and so on.

In this way, the increase in wealth would be spread over increases in

consumption per person and fertility In several generations. However, the

effects on consumption per person and fertility become smaller over time as

the steady state Is approached. Although consumption per person and assets

per person still regress to the mean from parents to children, the process Is

now a gradual one across generations, rather than being completed in a single

generation.
                                                                           21


III. Economic Growth, Child Mortality and Social Security

    Return now to the simpler case where the cost per child     Is Independent

of the number n1. Then a temporary change in the cost of children in one

generation induces an oscillation In fertility over that generation and the

subsequent one, whereas a permanent change In cost starting In a particular

generation alters fertility only in that generation. A permanent fall In

fertility would require a continuous rise in the cost of children. Assume,

for example, that the interest rate is the constant r, while wages, the cost

of rearing children, and hence the net cost of descendants are each rising at

a constant rate—-due say to steady economic growth. Then, If the elasticity

of utility is the constant a, equation (16) ImplIes that the consumption of

descendants, c1, would rise at the same rate as the net cost of descendants.

A higher rate of growth In consumption per person would reduce fertility

permanently, given the values of a and r (see equation (19)).

    The decline in fertility observed since the mid—l9th century in most

Western countries has sometimes been xp1ained by rapid economic growth that

continues to raise the cost of children through raising the value of parents

time (see, for example, Becker, 1981, Chapter 11). This explanation has not

been based on a formal model that links fertility to economic growth, and our

model does not have this Implication. As we have seen, a steady rate of

economic growth that induced a steady growth in the net cost of descendants

would permanently lower fertility, but would not generate a persistent fall

in fertility. A persistent fall requires either that interest rates fall

steadily, or that economic growth continues to accelerate, or that the net

cost of descendants accelerates for other reasons.
    The secular decline in fertility has also been explained by the secular

decline in child mortality that continued to reduce the number of births

required to produce a target number of surviving children. Our analysis also

has novel implications about the effects of declines in child mortality on

birth rates and the demand for surviving children.

    To simplify the presentation, we assume that wage rates and interest

rates are constant over time. Also, parents Ignore the uncertainty about

child deaths, and respond only to changes in the fraction, p, of offsprings

that survive childhood. If °b Is the number of births, then the expected

number of survivors is



                                (22)            =




Let 3 be the cost of rearing a child to adulthood, and 3 the cost of a

child that dies prior to becoming an adult. Since the latter cost includes

any psychic losses from child mortality,            could exceed .    The expected

cost of b births is [p + (1     -
                                    m1b             Equation (22) implies that the

ratio of this expected cost to the expected number of survivors n--which

corresponds to our previous cost per (surviving) child——is



                         (23)   /3 =
                                       /3   +
                                                /3mU
                                                       -
                                                           p)/p.


As before, parents choose own consumption, the expected number of surviving

children, and beque3ts to surviving children, subject to a budget constraint

that depends on /3.
                                                                             23


    A permanent decline in the level of child mortality--that is, a rise in

p——that starts in the jth generation would lower the cost of raising

surviving children, /3. for I >   J.   Our prior analysis implies that the demand

for surviving children per adult (n1) rises in the .jth generation, but would

not be affected In later generations.1°       Although the demand for surviving

children increases in generation j, birth rates may fall because the higher

probability of survival, p, reduces the number of births, b' needed to

produce a given number of survivors (see equation (22)). Birth rates

definitely fall in later generations because the demand for surviving

children in these generations would not be affected by the Increase in p.

    The demand for surviving children per adult would increase for more than

one generation if the probability of surviving childhood continued to rise,

because then the cost of rearing surviving children would continue to fall

over time. However, the rate of increase in the survival probability must

slow down once this probability approaches unity, as it has in the West

during the past forty years. As the rate of increase slows, the rate of

decline in the cost of producIng survivors also slows and eventually more or

less ceases. Thereafter, the cumulative increase in child survival

probability would not affect the demand for surviving children, but would

reduce birth rates by the same percentage as the Increase in survival

probability.




101f the marginal cost of a child increases with the number of children
(b'  > 0 In expression (20)), future values of n for I >     j
                                                            would rise in
response to a permanent decline in nortallty rates starting in generation j.
But eventually, the demand for surviving children would return to its
previous value.
                                                                                 24


        Our analysis of altruistic dynastic families explains why the transition

 to regimes of low child mortality nay have only temporary effects on

 population growth, and why changes in birth rates often lag behind changes In

 child mortality. The analysis implies a rise in population growth during the

 early phases of the transition, but eventually population growth would return

 to that prevailing prior to the transition. Correspondingly, the declines in

birth rates accelerate, until the percentage decline from prior levels equals

the percentage increase in the probability of surviving to adulthood.

       The secular decline, in fertility has also been explained partly by the

growth in social security and other transfer payments to the elderly. Public

transfers to old persons would reduce the demand for children If support from

children had been helping to protect parents against 111 health, low

earnings, and other conditions of old age. Our model of altruistic families

implies that growing transfer payments to the elderly would reduce the demand

for children, even when children do not support elderly parents.

       The model is not set up to incorporate social security precisely because

we have only one period of adulthood, and cannot Introduce payments to old

(retired) adults that are financed on a pay—as—you-go basis by taxes on young

(working) adults. However, similar results obtain If we imagine

(unrealistically) that transfers to adults are financed by levies on

children.

       Let s be the transfer received by the representative adult in generation

I, and           be the tax paid during generation i by each child (or by parents

on behalf of their children), Then the governmentts budget constraint is

s N =
 I I
         r t+i      ,   which implies
                                                                                                   25



                                    (24)         r11 = s1/n.


For given values of fertility, the benefits from social security and the

taxes to finance them have exactly offsetting effects on the dynastic wealth

of the representative family. Therefore, a change In the scale of the social

security program would not affect intergenerational patterns of consumption

if fertility were unchanged. Parents would use their social security

benefits to pay their ch1ldrens taxes; in a more general context, parents

would raise their bequests sufficiently to enable their children to pay these

taxes without cutting back on their consumption (see Barro, 1974).

    However, this so-called "Ricardlan Equivalence Theorem" must be modified

when parents choose the number of children. An extra child in generation I

would pay the tax, r.

becomes an adult. Thus, the social security program imposes the net tax per

program (an increase in s) would raise the net cost of a child and would have

 the same substitution effects as an Increase in the cost of raising a child.

      Therefore, our previous analysis of changes in the costs of children

applies to changes in social security. For example, a permanent increase in

the level of social security benefits starting in generation ,j is analogous

to a permanent increase in p1                at    this date. Holding fixed the marginal

utility of wealth, v'(c0), we found that fertility n declines, fertility in

later generations, n1 for I >                j,    does not change, and the number of

descendants, N. for I >              j,   falls by the same percentage in each future

generation.     Therefore, a permanent increase in social security benefits

tends to reduce fertility (temporarily) even when children do not support

their parents.12

     We also found before that a permanent increase In child-rearing costs in

generation j would raise consumption and wealth per person in future

eneratjons, c. and 1<. for i >                j.    In the same way, the negative effect of

higher social security benefIts on the number of descendants would be

associated with an Increase in "capital intensity." This finding contradicts

the usual argument, as in Feldstein (1974), that social security lowers

capital Intensity. That argument treats fertility as exogenous and neglects

the interplay between consumption and intergenerational transfers.

     Our model implies that the dramatic growth in transfer payments to the

elderly during the past 50 years reduced fertility rates. However, it also

implies that fertility would return to its prior value once the growth in

these transfers slowed appreciably. Therefore, in the long run, a larger

social security program would not affect fertility rates, but would lower

population levels and raise consumption and wealth per person.



4. Open Economies and Western Fertility

    Our formulation can be used to analyze the determinants of fertility In

an open economy, defined as an economy connected to an international capital

market with a single real interest rate. Wages are determined In each

economy separately because labor Is assumed to be immobile across national

boundaries. Wage rates (per unit of human capital) would differ between

economies with the same interest rate If production functions differed, if

returns to scale were Increasing or decreasing, or If wages were taxed at

different rates.

    If the elasticity of the utility function is the constant a, then

equation (19) Implies




              (26) n =
                              {ai(i

    The first term on the right—hand side of equation (27) indicates that

population grows more rapidly In economies where parents are more altruistic

(as), and where the degree of altruism is less responsive to the number of

children (i)        The second term shows that population growth is more rapid

when the world real Interest rate is higher. Moreover, the responses In

population growth exceed variations in Interest rates because .'              < 1.    For

small values of €, even small fluctuations in world Interest rates would

Induce sizable fluctuations In population growth rates. The term on the far

right indicates that population grows more rapidly in open economies where

consumption per person grows more slowly. Open economies would differ more

In populatIon growth than iR consumption growth because (i -                0J)/   > 1 in

each economy (see expression (11)).

    The growth In consumption per person between generations equals the

growth in the net cost of descendants (see equation (28)]. The latter Is

negatively related to growth in the probability of child survival, and Is

positively related to growth In social security benefits or in other taxes on

children. Faster technical progress also raises the growth of consumption

per person, at least If the cost of raising children, ,33, tends to grow along

with wage rates. Therefore, population growth should be lower in open
economies that have more rapid technological progress, more rapid increases

in social security benefits, and slower declines in child mortality.

    These Implications of our analysis seem relevant to the low fertility in

Western countries since the late l960s. World interest rates were low until

the l980s-—for example, interest rates on short-term U.S. government

securities averaged 1.8% per year from 1948 to 1980 after adjusting for

anticipated Inflation (see Barro, 1986 Ch. 7). Economic growth was

rapid—-specifically, the annual rate of growth in per capita real GDP

averaged 3.7% per year from 1950 to 1980 in 9 IndustrIalized countries that

include the United States (Barro, 1986 Ch. 11). Child mortality in the West

was already quite low by 1950 and did not Improve much further. Social

security payments and other transfers to adults expanded dramatically during

the past thirty years. For example, per capita real social security payments

in the United States and Great Britain grew by 7 1/2 and 5 percent per year,

respectively, from 1950 to 1982 (see Hemming, 1984, and U.S. Department of

Commerce, 1965, 1984). All of these forces tended to hold down   population
growth.

    These considerations also suggest that Western fertility will rise during

the next decade if the high real interest rates of the 1980s continue Into

the 1990s, If the growth in social security and other transfer payments slows

appreciably--as eventually It must-—and if the slowdown in economic growth

that began In the early 1970s continues. Moreover, fertility could respond

sharply even to small changes in Interest rates, in the growth rate of

transfer payments, and In rates of economic growth, because changes in these

variables are magnified Into larger changes in fertility.

5. Life-Cycle and Aggregate Consumption

    To simplify the presentation, we have assumed that childhood and

adulthood are the only periods of life, and that childhood provides no

utility. However, we can readily incorporate a full life cycle into the

model. We use this extended model to compare the determinants of consumption

over the life cycle with the determinants between generations, and also to

show how aggregate consumption relates to life—cycle and generational

Consumption.

    We continue to neglect uncertainty about age of death, but now assume

that everyone lives for    years. A parent is assumed to have all his

children when he is h years old, where the value of h determines the length

of a generation. We assume additive preferences over the life cycle, where

v(c..) is the utility at age j     of       each descendant in generation i from the

consumption, c1. These current period utilities over the life cycle are

discounted by the constant tine-preference factor. 5. Therefore, the utility

generated by the lifetime consumption of someone in generation i is

where A. is the weight attached to the utils of generation i. e now note

explicitly that A. incorporates both time preference and the degree of

altruism toward children. As before, the degree of altruism toward each

child vries inversely with the number of children. Specifically, we again

assume a function of the form a(n.). Then the weight A in equation (30)

is




                      (31)      A. =   (a8h)(N)€            =




Note that the parameter a (which corresponds to the parameter a in our

previous model) equals 5h__that is. it includes both altruism (a) and time

preference (5h)

expression for the head's utility,

where v. is given in equation (29). Note that lifecycle utilities, v(C1)

in equation (29). are discounted only by time preference (6), while

generational utilities, v. in equation (32), are discounted also by the

degree of altruism toward descendants (that is, by a1(N.)l =

discount future utility. However, even if people did not discount the futur'

rational individuals might prefer their children's consumption to their own,

or vice versa. The latter condition holds in biological models of gene

maximization when a parent only has some genes in common with each offspring.

        If parents are selfish" (a <                 1),    dynastic utility would be bounded in a

altruism toward descendants——typically assume preference for the present

Equation (35) is the usual arbitrage relation for life cycles——specifically,

it involves the Interest rate, r, and the time—preference factor, 5. Since

the right-hand side of equation (35) Is Independent of the generation, I, the

ratio of marginal utilities of consumption over the life cycle is the same

for all generations.

      Equation (36), which is the arbitrage relation across generations, is

essentially the same as equation (13). Since the right-hand side of equation

(36) is independent of age, j, we find that the ratio of marginal utilities

of consumption between generations Is the same for all ages.

      We can solve the arbitrage relations for the rates of growth of

consumption between ages and generations if we again assume that the

elasticity of utility with respect to consumption is the constant :

        The rate of growth in consumption per descendant across generations is

the same at all ages, and equals the rate of growth between these generations

in the net cost of children. Given the rate of growth of these net costs,

the growth of consumption per descendant does not depend on time preference

(43),    the degree of selfishness (a), or the interest rate (r). In contrast,
equation (38) shows that the rate of growth of consumption over the life

cycle does not depend on the cost of children, but does depend in the usual

way on the interest rate and time preference. Therefore, even when parents

are not 'selfish" (say a =                   1),       the rates of growth in consumption over the

life cycle and between generations are equal only by accident. Once again we

find that models with infinitely lived individuals who do not reproduce have

very different implications from models with reproducing generations.

where recall that a =                         Fertility                is positively related to the extent of

altruism (a), to the tine—preference factor (5), and to the interest rate

(r). Consumption per descendant does not depend on interest rates and tine

preference essentially because fertility does. When interest rates increase.

a dynastic family accumulates capital in the form of additional descendants

rather than additional capital per descendant.

     Fertility also depends negatively on the growth between generations in

 the net cost of producing children. Net costs equal the difference between

 the fixed costs of children ((l-r)i3) and the present value of their lifetime

 earnings (i),   both measured in units of goods in the same generation. Notice

 that the relevant measure of cost does not depend separately on the part of

 earnings that children receive prior to leaving home or prior to reaching

 their majority. Given parental altruism, the children's earnings as adults

also matter. The "fixed' costs of raising children include the expenditures

necessary to produce the lifetime earnings of children: not only the cost of

giving birth, but also expenditures on subsistence and on investments in the

human capital of children. Expenditures on children's consumption that

simply raise the utility of children are not part of the net costs of having

children and hence do not affect the demand for children.   rn particular,

expenditures on the consumption of children who live at home would not affect

the cost of children relevant to analyses of the demand for children.    Yet

empirical studies of the cost of children typically include all (net)

expenditures on children up to a particular age, such as age eighteen,

without any discussion of whether these estimates are relevant to the study

of fertility.

    Our analysis has important implications for the behavior of aggregate

consumption. Per capita consumption is a weighted average of the consumption

of persons at different ages, where the weights are the fraction of persons

at each age, The rate of growth in per capita consumption between two time

periods is

the change in a variable between one time period and the next (for a given

    The first term on the right-hand side of equation (43) depends on the

change over time in the age distribution of the population. This term woulc

be zero in a demographic steady state, where                 9jt =    0 for all j. Moreover,

basic theorem of demography states that a closed population with constant

birth and death rates would eventually approach a demographic steady state

(see, for example, Coale. et al. , 1983).

    The second tern on the right—hand side of equation (43) depends on the

rate of growth of consumption between generations. Equation (41) indicates

that the growth in consumption equals the growth in the cost of children.

the rate of growth of net costs is the constant g, then in a demographic

steady state equation (43) becomes

The rate of growth of per capita consumption is then                  independent   of time
                                                                             38



preference, the degree of altruism, and the interest rate, and depends only

on the rate of growth of the cost of children.

    Many have recognized that changes over time in per capita consumption are

independent of life-cycle changes in consumption when the age distribution is

constant (see Deaton, 1985, for a recent discussion). Some studies justify

the use of life-cycle models to interpret the data on aggregate consumption

by assuming that the representative person can be modeled as if he lives

forever. This procedure is sometimes rationalized by the assumption that

parents are altruistic toward children (see, e.g., Summers, 1981, p. 537).

    Altruism does justify the assumption that heads of dynastic families

effectively have infinite lives. However, when fertility is endogenous,

models with effectively infinite lives that result from parental altruism

have implications for consumption that differ substantially from those of

models with infinite lives of representative persons. In our model,

steady—state consumption per descendant is independent of time preference and

interest   rates because fertility fully absorbs the effects of these
variables.    As a result, changes over time in per capita consumption in

demographic steady states do not depend on interest rates and time

preference, even though each dynastic family effectively lives forever.

    Consider once again an open economy that initially has a steady level of

fertility and a constant rate of growth of consumption between generations.

Assume also that the age distribution is stable initially. A rise in the

world interest rate would Increase fertility (by equation (26)), which would

induce a transition to a new stable age distribution with a younger

population. The rate of growth of per capita consumption might change during
                                                                             39



the transition to the younger population, but would be the same in the new

steady state as in the initial state (as long as the rate of growth of the

net cost of producing descendants were unaffected by the rise in the world

interest rate). Perhaps this conclusion can explain what has been a puzzling

finding; namely, that long term growth rates of per capita consumption in the

United States apparently have not been affected by changes in long term real

interest rates (see



Summary and Conclusions

    This paper develops the implications of altruism toward children, where

utility of parents depends on their own consumption and the utility of each

of their children. Altruism toward children implies that the welfare of all

generations of a family are llnke through a dynastic utility function that

depends on the consumption and number of descendants in all generations. The

head of a dynastic family acts as if he maximizes dynastic utility subject to

a dynastic budget constraint, which involves the wealth inherited by the

head, interest rates, the cost of rearing children in all generations, and

the earnings of all descendants.

    Utility maximization Implies first, an arbitrage condition for

consumption over time, and second, the equation of the marginal benefit of an

additional child to the net cost of producing that child. This net cost

equals the expenses for child rearing less the present value of the child's

wages. We show that the optimization conditions relate the level of

consumption per person to the net cost of creating that person. Then the

arbitrage condition for consumption over time ends up implying a response of
                                                                              40



 fertility-—but not of the growth of consumption per person——to variations in

 interest rates and the degree of altruism.

        We show that the number of descendants in each generation depends on the

 net cost of producing those descendants. Thus fertility——which determines

 the change in the number of descendants from one generation to the

next—-depends on changes in these net costs. For example, a permanent tax on

 children lowers fertility in the generation that first faces the tax, and

permanently lowers the number of descendants in all subsequent generations.

But fertility in later generations is unchanged. We use this result to show

that a permanent reduction in the mortality rate initially raises population

growth, but has no long-run effect on this growth. Similarly, we find that

an expansion of social security has a temporary negative effect on population

growth.

       We also consider representative dynastic families in open economies that

aL'e   linked   to an international capital market with a single interest rate.

Fertility in open economies depends positively on the world interest rate, on

the degree of altruism, and on the growth of child-survival probabilities.

Fertility depends negatively on technological progress, and on the growth

rate of transfer payments. We conjecture that this analysis is relevant for

explaining fertility in     Western   countries during recent decades.

       We incorporate life-cycle elements by allowing for consumption at various

ages. Life—cycle consumption is discounted by time preference, whereas a

child's consumption is discounted by time perference and the degree of

altruism. We now get the standard result that the pattern of consumption

over the life cycle depends on the interest rate and on time preference.
Nevertheless, we still find that the growth rate of consumption between

generations depends on the growth rate of the net cost of creating

descendants, and not on the interest rate, time preference, or the degree of

altruism. At least in the long run, the growth of consumption between

generations will dictate the changes in consumption per person for the entire

economy. Therefore, we can explain the puzzling finding from long-teri

aggregate data that real interest rates and the growth rate of per capita

consumption are unrelated.

    Thus far, our analysis neglects uncertainty, marriage, the spacing of

births, and capital-market constraints over life cycles or across

generations. Nevertheless, even the simplified model of altruism toward

children and the behavior of dynastic families appears to us to capture

important aspects of the dynamic behavior of fertility and consumption. If

so, a new approach would be warranted to the analysis of trends and long—term

fluctuations in consumption, fertility, and population growth.

where the terms In the right column and bottom row are derivatives of the

budget constraint with respect to c1 and N1, respectively. By substituting

the first-order conditions (A.2) and (A.3) and simplifying, the condition for

a positive determinant is equivalent to                 (1 —   €)VVh/(V?)2           < 0.     If v(c) =

  c0, this condition reduces to . ÷ a < 1.
