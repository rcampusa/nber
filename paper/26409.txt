Electoral Competition with Fake News

                                         ABSTRACT

Misinformation pervades political competition. We introduce opportunities for political
candidates and their media supporters to spread fake news about the policy environment and
perhaps about parties' positions into a familiar model of electoral competition. In the baseline
model with full information, the parties' positions converge to those that maximize aggregate
welfare. When parties can broadcast fake news to audiences that disproportionately include their
partisans, policy divergence and suboptimal outcomes can result. We study a sequence of models
that impose progressively tighter constraints on false reporting and characterize situations that
lead to divergence and a polarized electorate.

1    Introduction
      Misinformation on the part of the public makes for bad lawmaking on the part of the
      government.
                                                               Keohane (2010)

    Do Facts Matter?, Hochschild and Einstein (2015) ask in the title of their monograph on the role
of misinformation in American politics that opens with the above quote. Do unwise policies result
when politicians and the media spread false information and the citizenry accepts it unquestioningly
before deciding how to vote? The authors use case studies to argue that "people'
                                                                               s willingness to
use mistaken factual claims in their voting and public engagement is ... dangerous to a democratic
polity." (2015, p.14)
    Here we address a similar question with game-theoretic tools. We take the well-known proba-
bilistic voting model of Lindbeck and Weibull (1987) as our baseline environment. In this setting,
there are two political parties that di¤er in exogenous ways and a population of voters with het-
erogenous partisanships. The parties compete by staking positions on a "pliable" policy issue
that voters consider along with their idiosyncratic assessments of the parties'fundamentals. In a
setting with accurately informed voters, the election delivers pliable policies that maximize aggre-
gate welfare. But what if voters are ill informed and parties can compete by making false claims
about the policy environment and the positions supported by themselves and their rivals? Under
what circumstances will the potential for spreading "fake news"distort the parties'positions away
from those that are socially desirable? Will the parties make competing claims that polarize the
electorate or will they broadcast similar announcements? We ask these questions in a sequence
of models with increasingly tight constraints on the scope for false reporting. First, we give the
parties free rein to make claims both about a parameter that a¤ects the desirability of alternative
policies (i.e., the "state of the world") and about their and their rival'
                                                                         s positions on the matter.
The parties reach di¤erent audiences and have a greater chance of being heard by their own parti-
sans. Next, we restrict the parties to announce their own position accurately, while still allowing
false claims about the state of the world and about the rival'
                                                             s intentions. Finally, we suppose that
voters know both parties'positions, but still may be misled about the attractiveness of alternative
policy options. In each case, we ask whether the parties converge or diverge in their positions and
announcements and whether the fake news distorts the ultimate policy outcome.
    While misinformation has long been a tool in political competition, recent trends have height-
ened concern about the spread of misleading or "fake" news. Social media and other internet
outlets enable politicians and their allies to reach ever-larger, targeted audiences. Guess et al.
(2018) estimate that one in four Americans visited a fake news website in the six weeks before the
2016 U.S. presidential election-- where fake news is de...ned as the most extreme form of misleading
information inasmuch as its content is intentionally and veri...ably false. Allcott and Gentzkow
(2017) document the increasing role that social media play as a source of political information and
argue that "people who get news from Facebook (or other social media) are less likely to receive


                                                 1
evidence about the true state of the world that would counter an ideologically aligned but false
story" (p.221). Moreover, these authors and Silverman and Singer-Vine (2016) report survey ev-
idence that many voters have di¢ culty distinguishing real and fake news and that many believe
the false claims they encounter. Guess et al. (2018) provide evidence of selective exposure to fake
news sources: Republican voters were more likely to receive news from pro-Trump sources than
Democratic voters. This characteristic of the information technology features prominently in our
modeling of the parties'strategic use of fake news.
    We contribute to a small literature on the role of imperfect information in electoral competition.
An early contribution by Baron (1994) features informed and uninformed voters, with the latter
responding mechanically to campaign spending ...nanced by interest groups. Glaeser et al. (2005)
explain "extremism" in policy positions in a model in which individuals vote only if the expected
bene...t exceeds an idiosyncratic voting cost and potential voters are more likely to learn the position
of their a¢ liated party than the position of the nona¢ liated party. In this paper, we study formally
the strategic use of misinformation in political competition.


2      A Model of Electoral Competition with Fake News
Two political parties, L and R; vie for electoral support. The parties di¤er in some exogenously-
given ways that appeal di¤erently to the heterogeneous voters. Voters also care about a "pliable"
policy that will be contested in the election. The parties use their positions and broadcasts on this
issue instrumentally to woo voters. Individuals may have access to disparate information and hold
di¤erent beliefs about the intentions of the two parties with regard to the pliable policy and about
the state of the policy environment.
    Speci...cally, consider a voter i who believes that party L would carry out the pliable policy mL
                                                                                                    i ,
that party R would carry out the pliable policy mR
                                                 i , and that the state of the world is characterized
by the parameter              i,   a scalar that impacts her assessment of the alternative policy choices. This
individual votes for party L if and only if

                                                 u mL
                                                    i ;   i    u mR
                                                                  i ;   i      i;


where        i   reects her relative preference for party R based on the fundamental di¤erences between
the parties. In the unit mass of voters, the preference parameter                      i   is drawn from a well-behaved
cumulative distribution function, F ( ).
    The utility function u (m; ) is increasing in , concave in m, twice continuously di¤erentiable,
and supermodular. Moreover, the value of m that maximizes u (m; ) is ...nite for all                      in the feasible
range,           ;   . It follows that the value of m that maximizes u (m; ) is increasing in                and lies in
the bounded range [m; m], where m                      arg maxm u (m; ) and m              arg maxm m;    . We assume
that     i   2       ;   ,   mL
                              i   2 [m; m] and   mR
                                                  i   2 [m; m] for all i; i.e., voters believe that      falls within the
feasible range and that each party'
                                  s position corresponds to one that is optimal for some feasible
state. We also assume that for any feasible combination of                    i,    mL        R
                                                                                     i , and mi , there exist values of


                                                                2
 i   in the support of F ( ) such that i prefers R and values of          i   such that i prefers L.
                                                                      I
     Voters access news from disparate sources. A fraction                    of the populace receives accurate
                                                                              I
information. These voters know the true value of ; which is                       2   ;   , and the true positions
and intentions of the parties, mL and mR . The remaining voters form their impressions based on
reports from biased sources. These sources may include partisan media outlets or announcements
(e.g., "tweets") made directly by the politicians themselves. The sources assert the state of the
policy environment and possibly the positions of one or both of the parties. These assertions might
bear no relationship to the truth. We refer to such misinformation broadly as "fake news."
     Voters choose their news source non-strategically, but their listening habits reect their ide-
ological proclivities. In particular, a voter who prefers party R on ideological grounds and who
does not have access to reliable information is more likely to follow a media source that is partial
to party R than is another voter who fundamentally prefers party L. Letting                        ( ) denote the
probability that a voter with    i   =    who accesses fake news hears the reports of a source that is
aligned with party R, we assume          0(
                                       ) > 0. The uninformed voters take what they hear at face
value; if their partisan information source reports, for example, that = ~, then they use this
value in assessing the (perceived) policy positions. Such unquestioning acceptance of biased news
is an extreme assumption, but the studies we cited in the introduction provide evidence that fake
news has powerful e¤ects on followers'beliefs and the extreme assumption allows us to capture this
reality in a simple way.
     It is straightforward to construct examples that ...t our framework based on recent policy con-
troversies. For example, the policy m might represent the number of immigrants that are admitted
into a country, while      a¤ects (inversely) the social and economic cost of absorbing immigrants.
Then um > 0 applies if the optimal number of immigrants increases as the cost of absorption falls
(see appendix). News outlets might exaggerate the cost of immigration in one direction or the
other, while perhaps also misrepresenting the parties' positions on the matter. Or the policy m
might represent the size of a tari¤ on imports, while            represents (inversely) the induced foreign
price. The optimal tari¤ rate is greater when exporters "pay for the tari¤"; i.e., when the induced
foreign price is low. In this case, the media might exaggerate the pass-through of tari¤s to domestic
prices and possibly the parties'openness to trade.

2.1     The Parties'Objectives and Actions
Each party seeks to maximize its share of the aggregate vote. Party J (or its partisan media outlet)
                                                        J                                              J
reports the state of the policy environment as              , with free rein to announce any                2   ;  :
                                                                                                      e           e
The party also reports its own position to be        mJJ       and that of its rival to be         mJ J ,   where J
denotes the party that is not J . The parties might feel constrained in these latter announcements,
either because voters have ready access to accurate information of this sort or because the parties
perceive a reputational cost from misrepresenting their positions. In order to understand how
such constraints a¤ect the prospects for divergent positions and suboptimal policies, we proceed
to analyze three cases with increasingly tighter reporting constraints. First, we allow party J to


                                                    3
                                                                        e
claim any position mJJ 2 [m; m] as its own and any mJ J 2 [m; m] as its rival'
                                                                             s intention. Next, we
suppose that each party must report its own position accurately, but can misrepresent that of its
rival. Finally, we constrain all reports of policy positions to be truthful.
       In each case, we can compute the parties' vote shares as a function of the announcements.
The votes for party L comprise those among the fully-informed that prefer mL to mR with the
                          I
knowledge that        =       , those among the uninformed voters that obtain their news from sources
                                                                                                                              L
favoring party L and that prefer mLL to mLR under the (possibly mistaken) belief that                                    =        ,
and those among the uninformed voters that obtain their news from sources favoring party R and
                                                           R
prefer mRL to mRR under the belief that                =       . Summing these components, we have

                          sL =      I
                                        F u mL ; I     u mR ; I                                                              (1)

L-leaning source and decide to vote for party L in view of their induced belief that mL = mLL ,
                          L                                                                         I

with probability      ( ), obtain their news from an R-leaning source and decide nonetheless to vote

for party L after being told that mL = mRL , mR = mRR and                               =       .

2.2      The Full-Information Benchmark
As a benchmark, we review the outcome of electoral competition with complete and accurate
information; see, for example, Lindbeck and Weibull (1987). The full-information benchmark is
                                                               I
captured in our model by the special case with                     = 1. In this case, the policy mJ that maximizes
             e                                     I
sJ given    mJ     is mI = arg maxm u m;               ; therefore, the positions converge to the policy that
maximizes the representative voter'
                                  s welfare given the true state of the world.

2.3      Reports about the Policy Environment
In what follows, we will always assume that the parties or their media representatives report about
the state of the policy environment in the ...nal stage of the political game. The incentives to report
about      at this stage are common to the settings with and without fake news about policy positions.
   1
    Note that sL is deterministic in this setting with a continuum of voters. As is well known, it would be straight-
forward to add a valence shock re   ecting the uncertain popularity of each party at a moment in time in order to
make sL random and thus leave the parties with a real electoral contest.



                                                               4
We consider these incentives now.
    To this end, suppose that the parties have staked the positions mL and mR , and that the
                                                                                      e
audience for the broadcasts by party J believe these positions to be mJJ and mJ J for J = L; R.
Given these beliefs, the announcement about            by party J can only a¤ect voting by those that
                                                                                          J
follow the J -leaning source. Party J maximizes its vote share by claiming that      =        , where

                             J                                   e
                                 = arg max u mJJ ;        u mJ J ;    , J = L; R.

    Evidently, each party issues extreme pronouncements on the state of the world. If the audience
for party J '
            s broadcasts believes that party J will invoke a policy greater than will its rival, the
party wants its listeners to believe that high values of m are maximally bene...cial to their utility.
If the audience believes the opposite to be true about the ordering of the party's positions, then it
wants its listeners to believe that low values of m are best.
    In the following sections, we consider the equilibrium choices of policies in settings with in-
creasingly tighter constraints on reporting. We assume throughout that the parties ...rst choose
their positions (either simultaneously or sequentially) in an initial stage of electoral competition
and later broadcast their claims about the policy environment and positions.


3     Unconstrained Reporting of Policy Positions
In this section, we suppose that parties (or their media allies) can report whatever they like about
their own position and that of their rival to the audiences for their respective broadcasts. Those
                                                                                                  R
that hear the news reported by party R will vote based on a comparison of u mRR ;                       and
u   mRL ; R   . Clearly, this comparison is independent of the position actually taken by party L and
the news broadcast by that party. Similarly, those that receive their news from party L compare
          L                  L
u mLL ;         to u mLR ;       , which is independent of the position and announcements of party R.
Evidently, the outcome is the same whether the parties stake their positions simultaneously or
sequentially.
    When broadcasting its news, party J seeks to make itself look maximally appealing to those that
hear its claims, while also trying to make its rival look maximally repugnant. With this objective
in mind, party J faces a choice between two extreme alternatives. It might announce its own policy
position to be the one most preferred when the state of the world is as high as possible while
claiming that the rival intends a policy at the opposite end of the spectrum, or it might announce
its own policy position to be that most preferred when the state of the world is as low as possible
while claiming that its rival supports the policy at the upper end of the spectrum. Among these


                                                      5
alternatives, it chooses the one that creates the greatest gap in audience perceptions. Note that
both parties face the same incentives in this regard: if u m;                  u m;      > u (m; ) u (m; ), then
each maximizes the perception gap by claiming the highest possible value of                        along with its own
alleged support for the policy that goes along with that state and the intentions of the rival to enact
the lowest credible policy level; otherwise they each choose the opposite extreme announcements.
Thus
                             (
       J            e                 ; m; m   for u m;         u m;      > u (m; )     u (m; )
           ; mJJ ; mJ J =                                                                           ; for J = L; R.
                                 ( ; m; m) for u m;             u m;      < u (m; )     u (m; )

     What positions do the parties adopt in the initial stage(s) of the electoral game? In the current
setting, these choices a¤ect only the behavior of knowledgeable voters. Party L chooses mL to
                                                                               I               I
maximize its appeal among these voters, i.e., to maximize u mL ;                      u mR ;       . It has a dominant
strategy to choose mI . Party R perceives the same dominant strategy. In short, both parties
converge on the pliable policy that is socially optimal, much as in the setting with complete and
accurate information.
     We summarize in

Proposition 1 Suppose that the parties choose their actual positions simultaneously or sequentially
and that each party is subsequently unconstrained in its reports about the state of the world, its own
policy position, and that of its rival. Then the policy positions converge to those that maximize utility
given the actual state of the world (mL = mR = mI ) and the announcements converge to whichever
                                                                  L                     R
extreme o¤ ers the greatest perception gap; either                    ; mLL ; mLR =         ; mRR ; mRL =          ; m; m

or         ; mLL ; mLR   =           ; mRR ; mRL   = ( ; m; m).


4      Accurate Reporting of Own Positions
Now suppose that the parties feel compelled to report accurately about their own intentions, but
take leeway in misrepresenting the position of their rivals. As we have observed in Section 2.3, the
                                                                                                               ~
parties should expect that reports about the state of the world will be extreme. If mJ J < mJ ,
                                                            ~
party J will announce that              = , whereas if mJ J > mJ , it will announce that            = . Anticipating
such an announcement, party J no longer wishes to choose the utility-maximizing policy position,
mI . On the one hand, such a position would capture the greatest number of votes among the
knowledgeable voters, who recognize its optimality. On the other hand, such a position would not
appeal to those who are (mis)led to believe that                  is extreme. When choosing its position, each
party trades o¤ the marginal appeal to knowledgeable voters against the marginal attraction to the
audience for its fake news.
     In order to conserve on space and focus on the roles of the probability function                              ( ), we
henceforth assume that               is drawn from a uniform distribution on support [         min ; max ].   With this
assumption, the outcome in this section is the same no matter whether the platforms are chosen
simultaneously or sequentially.

                                                            6
     To identify the equilibrium choices by the parties, we must ...rst consider what false report each
will subsequently make about the other's position. Suppose party J has adopted a position of mJ .
If mJ is close to m, party J makes itself maximally attractive to its audience by reporting                                      =
         e
and   mJ J   = m. Alternatively, if mJ is close to m the party makes itself maximally attractive by
                                e
reporting      =       and mJ J = m. In general, there is an intermediate value of m, say m
                                                                                          ^ , such that
                                                         J                      e
if mJ > m
        ^ , party J prefers to announce                      =       and mJ J = m to the alternative of announcing
 J                 e
     =   and mJ J = m; whereas if mJ < m
                                       ^ , the opposite is true. It follows that m
                                                                                 ^ is de...ned by

                                      u m;
                                        ^            u m;        = u (m;
                                                                      ^ )             u (m; ) .

     Notice that the fake news reported by the two parties might converge or diverge. If both parties
have adopted positions on the same side of m
                                           ^ , both will issue the same biased report about the
policy environment and a similar (false) report about their rival'
                                                                 s stance. Alternatively, if the two
parties adopt positions on opposite sides of m
                                             ^ , then the parties will issue opposite extreme reports
about the state of the world and correspondingly opposite reports about their rival'
                                                                                   s intentions.
     We turn now to the choice of policy positions by the two parties. A party'
                                                                              s choice of position
a¤ects voting by informed voters and by those that receive their information from its aligned
media outlets. Therefore, each party has a dominant strategy that is independent of the policy
choice of its rival and of the anticipated reports from media sources aligned with that rival. The
dominant strategy maximizes aggregate votes among the two groups that are a¤ected; for party L,
mL = arg maxm V L (m), where
                                                         8 R

Notice that the vote counts depend on whether m                          m
                                                                         ^ or m            m
                                                                                           ^ , because the subsequent reports
by the a¢ liated media hinge on this distinction.
     The policy choice for party J lies strictly between m and m, because the votes among the
misinformed change negligibly when, for example, mJ is increased slightly from m; inasmuch as
um (m; ) = 0. Meanwhile, such a small increase in mJ above m would gain party J a non-negligible
share of votes among the fully informed. By a similar argument, mJ < m for J = L; R. Also, it
is never optimal for party J to choose mJ = m
                                            ^ . For such a position to be optimal, it would have
to be the case that a small increase in mJ from m
                                                ^ loses vote in view of the subsequent reports of
 J                                                                                                                           J
     = , while a small decrease in mJ from m
                                           ^ also loses vote with a subsequent report of                                         = .
But, from (8) and (9), we see, for example, that                         limm&m  J                             J

the supermodularity of u (m; ) implies that um m;                               > um (m; ). Thus, the former cannot be
negative when the latter is positive. It follows that                      mJ           ^ ) or mJ 2 (m;

     Now suppose that the probability function ( ) is symmetric, in the sense that ( ) = 1                                     (    )
for all ; that is, the fraction of voters who favor party R by an amount                                   that receive their news
from an R-leaning source is the same as the fraction of voters who favor L by that same amount
that obtain their news from an L-leaning source. Then, the parties face a similar trade-o¤ between
appealing to their audience and appealing to knowledgeable voters. That is, the mL that maximizes
V L (m) in (8) is the same as the mR that maximizes V R (m) in (9). In this symmetric case, the
policy positions converge, albeit not to the policy mI that maximizes aggregate welfare.
     But suppose instead that               ( ) 6= 1            (     ) for all      2 [    min ; max ].   In such circumstances,
there can be no equilibrium with policy convergence. Convergence would require the existence of
a policy position, m              L (m
                   ~ , such that Vm         R (m
                                     ~ ) = Vm  ~ ) = 0. But suppose, for example, that m

Then, using (8) and (9), this would further require

which is not possible when            ( ) 6= 1           (   ) for all    2[      min ; max ].   An analogous argument applies
when m
     ~ <m
        ^ . So, the parties'positions must diverge in these (asymmetric) circumstances.
     We have thus established the following (see the appendix for more formal details).

Proposition 2 Suppose that F ( ) is uniform, that the parties choose their actual positions simul-
taneously or sequentially, and that each party is subsequently unconstrained in its reports about the
state of the world and the position of its rival, but must report its own position accurately. Then
the policy positions converge (mL = mR ) if                         ( )=1           (      ) for all     and diverge (mL 6= mR )
if    ( ) 6= 1         (       ) for all     . The announcements about the state of the world and the ri-
val party's policy position converge if min mL ; mR                            ^ or max mL ; mR
                                                                              >m                              <m
                                                                                                               ^ and diverge if
max    mL ; mR        >m
                       ^ > min        mL ; mR        .

     When will the parties stake positions on opposite sides of m
                                                                ^ , so that their extreme fake-news
reports polarize the electorate? To address this question, we consider further the relationship
between vote share and policy position.
     Anticipating the subsequent reporting, party L chooses its policy position mL , to maximize
its vote share sL mL ; mR , which is a function of the policy positions of both parties. Party R
chooses mR to minimize party L'
                              s vote share. It follows from the expression for sL in (1), the
de...nitions of V L (mL ) and V R mR in (8) and (9), and the properties of the uniform distribution,
F( )=(            min ) = ( max           min ),   that sL mL ; mR satis...es

vote-maximizing strategy is independent of the choice by its rival.
       The optimal strategy for each party clearly depends on the fraction of knowledgeable voters.

When            is very small, for example, u m;                plays little role in a party'choice of policy. Instead,
the parties cater to their respective audiences by supporting policies close to m or close to m,
according to whether u (m; )                 u (m; ) is larger or smaller than u m;                       u m;       . In this case,
both parties choose nearly the same position, both on the same side of m
                                                                       ^ . Consequently, they both
broadcast the same false news reports.2
                                               I
       At the other extreme, when                  is close to one, the parties both cater mostly to the informed
                                                                                                                              J
voters. In this case, both stake positions close to mI . If mI > m
                                                                 ^ , then each party J reports                                    =
           e                                                              J                 e
and     mJ J     = m, whereas if      mI     < m
                                               ^ , each reports               =   and    mJ J    = m. Again, the fake news
reports coincide and misinformed voters hold similar (incorrect) views, despite their disparately
biased sources.
                                                                                                          I
       Although the parties' positions must fall on the same side of m
                                                                     ^ when                                   is close to zero and
           I
when            is close to one, this need not be the case when the fraction of informed voters takes on an
intermediate value. We illustrate an example of this in Figure 1. The ...gure depicts a case where
u (m; ) = m m2 =2 , with                2 [1; 2]. We take         ( ) = e = (e + 5), which implies               ( )<1        (       )
for all        in the relevant range.
   The ...gure shows V L (m) in the left panel and V R (m) in the right panel, for the case of I = 0:4
            p
and I =       3 + 2 =2 t 1:87 (see the appendix for details). The dominant electoral strategy for
                                                                                                                        L
party L is mL t 1:3 < m
                      ^ , while that for party R is mR t 1:9 > m
                                                               ^ . Then L reports                                           = 1 and
                                         R
mLR      = 2, whereas R reports              = 2 and   mRL      = 1. In this example, the fact that              ( )<1        (       )
implies that party R puts relatively more weight on the policy preferences of the informed voters
                                                                      I              I
compared to party L. For an intermediate value of                         such as        = 0:4, party L prefers to announce
a policy below m
               ^ and thus well below                mI ,   because its electoral strategy relies heavily on fake news.

       In the limit, when       ! 0, the policy positions converge.


                                                                  9
Meanwhile, party R that is less likely to reach uninformed voters relies on a strategy that caters to
knowledgeable voters and chooses a position close to (but more extreme than) mI t 1:87.
     In the example, the reporting of fake news creates a polarized electorate; those that obtain their
news from party R come to believe that                             =          = 2, while those that obtain their news from party
L believe instead that                    =    = 1.


5      Complete Information about Policy Positions
In this section, we focus on a setting in which false reporting is con...ned to claims about the state
of the policy environment. In this case, if the parties set their positions simultaneously, there does
not exist any equilibrium in pure strategies; see the appendix for details. Inasmuch as the mixed-
strategy equilibria are di¢ cult to characterize, we limit our attention to the game in which parties
move sequentially, with the incumbent party choosing its policy position before the challenger does
so. After the positions are chosen and become common knowledge, the parties simultaneously
                                                                                                                                           I
report their fake news about the state of the world, . Knowledgeable voters compare u mL ;
               I
to u mR ;              . Uninformed voters that access their news from a source partisan to party J compare
u   mL ; J     to u mR ;             J
                                          , for J = L; R.
     We begin, as usual, with the ...nal stage of the game. Given the chosen positions, mL and mR ,
the parties issue reports about the state of the world. Each party wishes to render itself maximally
                                                                                                                                 J
attractive to its audience. By arguments that are familiar by now, party J reports                                                   =     if
          e                J                        e
mJ   >   mJ    and             =     if   mJ   <   mJ ,   for J = L; R.
     Now consider the choice of position by party L, the challenger in this case. As before, the
party trades o¤ the appeal to knowledgeable voters of a policy close to mI versus the appeal to the
misinformed voters of a policy closer to one of the extremes. The challenger might choose a policy
                                                                                          L                R

   To characterize the equilibrium outcomes, we observe ...rst that the challenger party L always
can invoke a strategy of matching the policy position of the incumbent, which then ensures the
party a fraction F (0) of the votes. Clearly, no equilibrium outcome can give the challenger, party
L; less than this share of the vote; i.e., sL (m)                                      F (0). It follows that party R can do no better
than the fraction 1          F (0) of the votes. If R can ...nd a position that induces L to match, this
option must be an equilibrium strategy for the incumbent.
   We now argue that policy convergence never is an equilibrium outcome when                                              (0) < 1=2; i.e.,
when an uninformed voter that is indi¤erent between the parties on ideological grounds is more
likely to tune in to the broadcasts of the challenger than to those of the incumbent. To this end,
we conjecture the existence of an equilibrium with mR = mL = m
                                                             ~ , and then show that, with
 (0) < 1=2, party L can pro...tably deviate to win more than the share F (0) of the votes.
   If party L deviates from matching mR and instead sets mL = mR + ", " > 0, it will induce
                       R                                                                                L

which implies that at least one of these deviations increases the vote share for party L. We have
thus established

Proposition 3 Suppose that the parties choose their positions sequentially and these positions
become known to all voters. Later, the parties simultaneously report the state of the world. If
 (0) < 1=2, the equilibrium policies diverge mL 6= mR and there is polarization of fake news; if

mJ > mJ ,          =   and            = , for J = L; R. In the equilibrium, sL > F (0).


                                                                                  11
             Figure 2: Complete Information about Policy Positions: Policy Convergence


    Intuitively, when    (0) < 1=2, the challenger can capitalize on the advantage it has in reaching
the uninformed swing voters with fake news. Rather than mimic the proposal of the incumbent,
it deviates in whichever direction yields the greater aggregate vote gain among the swing voters,
once they have been induced by the fake news to believe one extreme or other about the state of
the world.
    In contrast, when       (0) > 1=2, it is the incumbent that reaches a majority of the misin-
formed swing voters. Then the incumbent might be able to choose a position that leaves the
challenger with no better option than to match. In Figure 2, we illustrate such an outcome.
In this example, u (m; ) = m             m2 =2     for    2 [1; 2] and      ( ) = e = (e + 0:5). The solid
curve in the ...gure depicts            +(                  L       m; mR
                                  min        max     min ) sabove           , while the dashed curve depicts
       +(                L       m; mR                         mR    = 1:5. As the ...gure shows, mL = mR
 min        max   min ) sbelow           , both drawn for
represents the best response of party L to mR = 1:5. Therefore, mR = 1:5 is an equilibrium action
for party R and the result is policy convergence, albeit not at the optimal policy, mI ' 1:87.


6      Conclusions
We have introduced strategic misinformation into an otherwise standard model of electoral com-
petition. As a benchmark, our model predicts policy convergence and welfare maximization when
voters are fully informed. More generally, we assume that some voters have access to accurate
information while others rely on biased sources to learn about the policy environment and perhaps
the parties'policy positions. Among these uninformed voters, those that are partisan to some party
are more likely to gain their information from a source that serves the interests of that party. We
...nd circumstances in which fake news has real e¤ects: the spread of such news may cause parties'
policy positions to diverge and both may depart from the policy levels that are socially desirable.
Such outcomes are most likely when each party or its media representative feels compelled to re-
port accurately about its own position; then the parties face a trade-o¤ in choosing their position
between appealing to those who are well informed about the state of the world and those that will

                                                         12
be misled to believe that the state is extreme in one direction or the other.
   Our analysis is highly stylized and represents only a simple ...rst step. Most importantly, the
voters in our model are passive; they do not choose their information sources to achieve any
particular objectives and they accept uncritically whatever it is that they hear. Further progress
could perhaps be made by introducing some behavioral motives for voters' listening and reading
habits and by allowing for some (limited) sophistication in their interpretation of the news. A more
active role for the media would also be desirable, be they motivated by pro...ts, partisanship, or
career concerns. The salience of misinformation in modern day politics and our demonstration that
fake news can matter for policy outcomes makes this a ripe topic for further research.

     In this appendix, we provide further details supporting the arguments made in the main text.

     Appendix for Section 2

     Recall that the utility function u (m; ) is increasing in , concave in m, twice continuously
di¤erentiable, and supermodular. The latter implies um (m; ) > 0. In Section 2 of the paper we
mention an example in which m is the number of immigrants and                                 is inversely related to the cost of
absorbing immigrants. The details of the example are as follows. Output is produced according to
a constant-returns-to scale-technology, f (n; m) = (n + m )1= ;                               2 (0; 1), where n is the number
of domestic workers, normalized so that n = 1. Assuming that immigrants are paid a competitive
wage, they generate surplus income for domestic residents of b (m) = f (1; m)                                    fm (1; m) m. The
function b (m) is increasing and concave. Let c (m) = be the cost of absorbing m immigrants,
where c ( ) is increasing and convex and                    is a cost shifter. Then u (m; )                      b (m)          c (m) = ,
with u (m; ) > 0 and um (m; ) > 0. That is, u ( ) is supermodular. The optimal number of
immigrants, mI , satis...es:
                                                        um mI ;         I
                                                                            = 0:
                                                                                              I
It follows that the optimal number of immigrants is increasing in                                 .

     Appendix for Section 4

     In Section 4 of the paper, we discuss the case in which parties feel compelled to report accurately
about their own intentions, but are free to misrepresent the position of their rivals. We elaborate
on this case in this section of the appendix, assuming that F ( ) = (                                       min ) = ( max         min )   is
a uniform distribution on support [                 min ; max ].   As before, we assume that the support is broad
enough that positive fractions of voters favor each party no matter what are the beliefs about the
pliable policy environment and the parties'positions. In this case, equation (1) in the main text
can be re-written as

                     L       I
(   max    min ) s       =   u mL ; I    u mR ; I          min                                                                         (5)
                                 (Z                                                           Z u(mRL ; R )                             )
                                     u(mL ; L ) u(mLR ; L )                                                    u(mR ;   R
                                                                                                                            )
                               I
                         + 1                                [1                     ( )] d +                                     ( )d           :
                                          min                                                         min



From equation (2) in the main text, which describes the optimal announcement of the policy
environment, we have for this case
                                                (                            e
                                      J                 for mJ > mJ J
                                          =                                 e      , J = L; R.
                                                       for mJ < mJ J



                                                                   15
                                                                                                                                                         L
At the second stage, when the positions mJ are given, party L wishes to maximize u mL ;
          L                                                                                R                 R
u mLR ;           while R wishes to minimize u mRL ;                                             u mR ;          . Therefore, the best response
                                                        J                      e
for party J is to choose either                             =       and     mJ J   = m, which is optimal if

                                               u mJ ;                 u m;         > u mJ ;              u (m; ) ,

          J                            e
or else       =       and mJ J = m, which is optimal if the inequality runs in the opposite direction.
Supermodularity of u (m; ) implies that u m;                                                u (m; ) is increasing in m. In addition,

                              u mJ ;                        u m;            > u mJ ;            u (m; ) for mJ = m;

                              u mJ ;                        u m;            < u mJ ;            u (m; ) for mJ = m:

that party J has a dominant strategy in the second stage of the game. This ...nding is summarized

    Now consider the ...rst stage of the game. Party L seeks to maximize sL while party R seeks to
minimize it. It follows from (7) that the best party L can do is to choose an mL that maximizes
V L (m). This solution does not depend on mR . Similarly, party R chooses an mR to maximizes
V R (m) and the solution does not depend on mL . It follows that each party has a dominant strategy
in the ...rst stage of the game and the same values for mJ , J = L; R, are equilibrium values in the
simultaneous-move game and the sequential-move games. We have proven

Lemma 2 With truthful reporting of own positions, each party has a dominant strategy, mJ , J =
L; R, mL = arg maxm2[m;m] V L (m) and mR = arg maxm2[m;m] V R (m), where V L (m) is given in
(8) and V R (m) is given in (9).

    Next, note that the optimal strategy mJ , J = L; R, satis...es m < mJ < m, because the slope of
V J (m) is positive at m and negative at m. Also, mJ = m
                                                       ^ is not an optimal strategy. For mL = m
                                                                                              ^
to be an optimal strategy the following inequalities would have to be satis...ed:

                                                 dV L (m)                       dV L (m)
                                              lim                    0          lim      :
                                             m%m
                                               ^   dm                       m&m
                                                                              ^   dm

Using (8), these inequalities hold if and only if

                                                    um (m; )         0     um m;             ;

which violates the supermodularity of u (m; ). A similar argument establishes that mR = m
                                                                                        ^ is
not an optimal strategy for party R. It follows that mJ is interior and either mJ 2 (m; m
                                                                                        ^ ) or
mJ 2 (m;
      ^ m) for J = L; R.
    Furthermore, if the probability function                     ( ) is symmetric, in the sense that               ( )=1          (     )
for all     2[                            L (m)             R (m)
                 min ; max ],    then V             and V            are maximized at the same value of m (i.e., the peak
on either side of m
                  ^ is attained for the same value of m by both parties). In such circumstances,
mL = mR and there is policy convergence. We next show that if                                           ( ) 6= 1        (    ) for all
  2[      min ; max ],   then there can be no equilibrium with policy convergence. Namely,                             mL   6= mR . To
prove this, ...rst suppose that mL = mR = m
                                          ~, m

                                                     ^ ). Then, it must be that

                                             dV L (m)                dV R (m)
                                                                 =                               =0.

Using (8) and (9), this would imply

which is not possible when                   ( ) 6= 1    (   ) for all   2[   min ; max ].    A similar argument establishes

equilibrium policies do not converge, i.e.,                  mL   6=   mR .   In contrast, if       ( ) = 1       (     ) for all

and m
    ^ . Note that, as                   approaches 1, the value of mJ that maximizes V J (m) approaches mI . It
follows that when the fraction of informed voters is large, mJ falls on the same side of m
                                                                                         ^ as does
mI . That is, if if mI > m

                                       ^ and if mI < m
                                                     ^ , then mJ < m

also issue the same false report about the policy environment (either                               or ) and the same false
report about the rival'

     Next note that, as                 approaches zero, the value of mJ that maximizes V J (m) approaches
                                         (
                            J                m for u (m; )        u (m; ) > u m;              u m;

Evidently, in this case too, both parties adopt policies on the same side of m
                                                                             ^ and they broadcast
the same reports about the policy environment and about the rival party's position. It follows

equilibrium occurs, the parties issue opposite extreme reports about the policy environment and
opposite extreme reports about the policy position of the rival party; i.e., the reports polarize the
electorate. This type of equilibrium is illustrated by the following example.

     Example

     Suppose      = 1 and               = 2. Let the utility function be given by

                                                                          1 2
                                                        u (m; ) = m         m :

These imply m = 1 and m = 2. In addition,

Now assume that                   = 0:4,              =         3 + 2 =2 ' 1:87, and                       ( ) takes the form

In this case, the optimal strategy of L is mL ' 1:3 < m

parties chooses policies on the opposite side of m
                                                 ^ . The di¤erent incentives for the two parties are
generated by the probability function                    ( ). It satis...es

and therefore        ( )<1                  (   ) for all . Thus, a voter with a given leaning                       toward party R is
less likely to hear news from a source biased toward party R than is a voter of comparable leaning
    toward party L likely to hear news from a source biased toward party L.

    Appendix for Section 5

    In Section 5 of the paper, we discuss the case in which the media cannot misrepresent the
policy positions adopted by the parties in the ...rst stage of the game. We also assume that F ( ) =
(     min ) = ( max             min )   is a uniform distribution on support [                     min ; max ].   As before, we assume
that the support is broad enough so that a strictly positive fractions of voters favors each party no
matter what are the beliefs about the pliable policy environment and the parties'positions. In this
case, (5) can be expressed as

                      L         I
(   max        min ) s    =         u mL ; I    u mR ; I                     min                                                           (10)

                                                                    for mJ < mJ

Again, party L seeks to maximize sL while party R seeks to minimize it.

   Simultaneous Moves

   We ...rst consider the game in which the parties move simultaneously in the ...rst stage. First,
we show that there exists no pure-strategy equilibrium with policy convergence. The argument
                                                  ~ 2 [m; m] such that mL = mR = m
proceeds as follows. Suppose that there exists an m                              ~ is an
equilibrium in the simultaneous-move game of the ...rst stage. Then (10) implies sL = sL
                                                                                       0 , where
                                                                                      (Z                               Z                        )
                                                                                            0                              0
                                     L                I                          I
              (   max         min ) s0   =                min     + 1                               [1   ( )] d +                 ( )d              :        (12)
                                                                                            min                            min



Now consider a deviation by party L to mL = m
                                            ~ + ", " > 0 but small. If m
                                                                       ~ is the equilibrium
strategy for party L it has to be the case that sL
                                                 0 is larger or equal to the vote share party L would
obtain under this deviation. Using (10)-(12), this implies
              (Z                                          Z                      )

ill-informed and              (0) 6= 1=2, there exists no equilibrium with policy convergence.
   We next examine the conditions for a pure strategy equilibrium with divergent policies. Without

Since L maximizes sL , its choice of policy must satisfy

Also, since R minimizes sL , its choice of policy must satisfy

        I
            um mR ;       I

Moreover, since each party can mimic the policy of its rival, the resulting vote share sL cannot be
larger than nor smaller than the share that obtains when mL = mR . Using (13), this implies
                 (Z                                          Z                   )

The last three equations comprise an overdetermined system that would need to be satis...ed by the
two variables, mL and mR , such that satisfy mL > mR . Generically, no such solution exists. We
therefore conclude:

Lemma 4 Let the policy choices mJ , J = L; R, be known to all voters, let the fraction of informed
                                         I
voters be smaller than one, i.e.,            < 1, and let        (0) 6= 1=2. Then, if both parties move simul-
taneously in the ...rst stage of the game, there exists (generically) no equilibrium in pure strategies
.

We have not been able to derive interesting insights about the properties of mixed-strategy equilibria
for this game.

     Sequential Moves

     We now consider the game in which an incumbent, say party R, moves before the challenger
when choosing its position in the initial stage of the game. To characterize the best response
for the challenger, party L, observe that it follows from (10)-(11) that party L obtains the share
sL      L
 above m ; m
            R of the votes if it chooses mL > mR and the share sL      L
                                                                below m ; m

The largest vote share that party L can secure in response to mR is

Under these conditions, the equilibrium strategy of party R is

                                      mR = arg min sL
                                                    max m

                                                     m2[m;m]


In this sequential game, the existence of an equilibrium in pure strategies is assured.
     Next, note that party L always has the option to choose mL = mR , in which case its vote share
would be sL
          0 , de...ned in (12). For this reason, the equilibrium vote share satis...es s
                                                                                         L                    sL
                                                                                                               0 and if
there exists an mR such that sL

                                   R = sL ; this mR must be an equilibrium play for party R.

       We now show that there exists no equilibrium with policy convergence when                                                       < 1 and

mR = m
     ~ 2 (m; m) and mL = m

Using (14) and (15), these inequalities imply

Summing the two inequalities yields

                                                          I

The supermodularity of u (m; ) implies um m;
                                          ~                                           > um (m;
                                                                                            ~ ). Therefore, this last inequality must
                                        I
be violated whenever                        < 1 and                                                             ~ = m nor

m                                         ~ = m. Then only a deviation to mL = m + " is
~ = m is an equilibrium. For suppose that m
possible, in which case only (18) has to be satis...ed, which becomes

                               I                I                      I
                       0           um m;                + 1                    [1         (0)] um m;     + (0) um (m; ) :

                           I
But since um m;                        > 0, um m;             > 0 and um (m; ) = 0, this inequality is violated. A similar
argument establishes that m
                          ~ =                            violates (19). We have proven

Lemma 5 Suppose the parties play sequentially in the ...rst stage of the game and that their choices
mJ , J = L; R, become known to all voters. Let the fraction of informed voters be smaller than one,
         I
i.e.,        < 1, and let              (0) < 1=2. Then, there does not exist an equilibrium with policy convergence;
i.e.    mR   6=   mL   under these circumstances.

       We now provide an example that has                                       ( ) > 1           (     ) for all   2 [   min ; max ],   so that
  (0) > 1=2, in which there exists an equilibrium with                                       mL   =   mR .

       Example

       Suppose         = 1 and              = 2. Let the utility function be given by

                                                                                            1 2
                                                                  u (m; ) = m                 m :
                                                                                            2



                                                                                     24
These imply m = 1 and m = 2. Moreover,

                                                                          1
                                                  u (m; ) =                 ; u (m; ) = 0;
                                                                          2
                                                                                        3
                                                  u m;                  = 1; u m; = :
                                                                                        4

                                                      p
Now assume that             = 0:4,           =            3 + 2 =2 ' 1:87 and that the probability function takes the
form
                                                                                 e
                                                                       ( )=            :
                                                                               e + 0:5
This probability function implies                 ( )>1                    (    ) for all       and therefore              (0) > 1=2. Using these
properties and values, we obtain

is the best response of party L              to mR = 1:5. That is, the example has                                  an equilibrium with policy
convergence.
