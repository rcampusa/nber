       DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF BIRTHWEIGUT-SPECIFIC NEONATAL MORTALITY

                                  ABSTRACT


      This paper explores the determinants of birthweight-specific neonatal

mortality rates across States in the U.S. in 1980. We are able to explore the

interactions between the determinants and birthweight because of the new data

available through the National Infant Mortality Surveillance (NIMS). The NIMS

links birth and death certificates for each state, resulting in a data base

with race—specific neonatal mortality rates by birthweight, and other

characteristics. Using a reduced-form model, we find abortion and neonatal

intensive care availability to be the most important determinants of overall

neonatal mortality. For whites, the two factors are of approximately equal

importance in determining neonatal mortality. For blacks, abortion avail-

ability has twice the impact of neonatal inensive care. Moreover, our results

suggest that neonatal mortality rates could be lowered by policies that reduce

the inequality in these health resources across states.

           Despite a rapid decline in the neonatal nortality rate between 1964 and
1985 • l   large cross—sectional differences in the rate persist. The nost
notable of these is the excess death rate of black babies. The black neonatal
nortality rate wes twice as large as the white rate both in 1964 and 1984.
t*reover. the U.S. neonatal nortality rate remains relatively higher than

those of a number of other developed countries even when the U.S. rate is
limited to whites [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (USL**tS)
1986].
           Because of the importance of the topic, the authors have devoted
considerable research effort in eomdning the causes of neonatal nortality.2
Using a multivariate approach, we found that b1ic program measures,3
abortion, and neonatal intensive care are all inportant predictors of white
and black birth outccnis. In adltion, trends in these variables account for
a substantial fraction of the decline in race—specific neonatal lmDrtality
since 1964.
           In our previous research we were unable to explore potential inter-
action effects between the determinants of neonatal nrtauity arid b1rtlieight
because we lacked data on birtFight-specif Ic nortality rates. The current

           Between 1964 and 1985, the rate fell by approximately 61 percent (4.4
percent     per year coirpounded annually)   from   17.9   deaths   per thousand live births
in the former year to 7.0 deaths per thousand live births in the latter year.

These refined estimates shed additional light on the causes of the rapid
decline in neonatal nrtality since 1964. It is particularly important to
gain a better understanding of the determinants of birt1-ight-specif Ic
neonatal mrtality rates since changes In these rates açear to have accounted
for a large percentage of the overall decline in neonatal iartai.ity sInce 1964
(Institute of dicIne 1985; 4JStI4HS 1986: Corman, Joyce, and Grossman 1987;
Office of    Technology   Assest 1988).
      We are able to explore interactions with birtFight because of the new
data available through the National Infant rtality Surveillance (NI). As
part of the Nfl project, each of the fifty states of the United States and
the District of Columbia linked birth and death certificates for the year
1980. This project is the first national linkage of birth and death records
in the U.S. since 1960. The end result is a state data base with race—
specific neonatal irtal ity rates by birtb.eight, ither $ age •           and   other
characteristics.
                                 II. Analytical Framerk
      We estimate equations that are generated from the economic nde1
contained in Corman and Grossman (1985);         Corman, Joyce and Grossman (1987):

and Joyce    (1987a, 1987b). It is    assumed that the parents' utility function
depends on their ai consumption, the number of           births,   and the survival
probability of   each   birth.    Maximization   of   the parents' utility function

subject to production and resource constraints generates a demand function for
survival in which the survival probability or its complement, the neonatal
i'ortality rate, is related to input prices, efficiency, income, and tastes.

                                            2
      In previous research     e,i1oyed a structural equations nodel, erpa-
sizing the roles of six basic health inputs: prenatal medical care, neonatal
intensive care, maternal nutrition, maternal cigarette snoking. artion, and
contraceptive services. The equations have meaningful Interpretations th at
the family level and at a higher level of aggregation such as the county or
the state. The nodal consists of structural production functions, input
demand functions, and reduced form outc equations. The structural nor—
tality rate production function relates th.ts outccm to the fraction of lc—
ight births in the state, the basic health inputs except for maternal
cigarette snoking, and the biological eix3ttnent. The structural l-birth-
lght production function relates the fraction of light births to maternal
cigarette snw.*ing. all health inputs In the nortality equation except for
neonatal intensive care use • and the biological endent.4.5
      Associated with each of the inputs is a demand function that relates the
use of that input to a vector of price and availability measures, socio-
economic characteristics that reflect conmand over resources and tastes, and
the biological endmnt. Suhetituting the input demand functions into the
birth'eight production function yields outcome equations in which the fraction
of light births or the neonatal nortality rate depends upon a vector of
exogenous variables. Hence the outc equations and the input demand
functions constitute the reduced form of the ndei. It is the reduced form

       Neonatal intensive care is excluded from the birttight production
function because decisions to use neonatal intensive care services are usually
made after birth.
      Cigarette snoking is assumed to affect neonatal nortality only through
its impact on low birUn.eight to satisfy rank and order conditions for
identifying the sodel. Numerous studies sunoarized by the USDHHS (1980> support
this restriction.
                                      3
outcon equations which      estimate below. Since the reduced form outcone
equations contain only exogenous variables on their right-hand sides, they can
be estimated by ordinary least squares.6
      Fran a practical standpoint the difference between the structural
equations and the reduced form is that the former relates birth outcomes to
utilization of the health inputs whereas the latter relates birth outcais to
the availability of the lnits.        reduced form is the ust helpful approach
to understanding public policies related to birth a.itcces for several
reasons. First, the public sector can only control the availability of
progran; the public sector canit force utilization of any of the progran.
Second, increasing the availability (or decreasing the price) of one health
input may affect the utilization of other inputs, if they are substitutes or
conplements. For exanle, increased availability of contraceptive services
may reduce the level of uinted pregnancies, resulting in mrs health inputs
being utilized when a pregnancy does occur. In this exanple, contraceptive
services and prenatal care u1d be considered complerents, since an increase
in the availability of     results in increased use of the other. The health
inputs may also be substitutes. For exanle, the increased availability of
contraceptive services could reduce the use of abortion services. Only the
reduced form allows for both the direct effects of the increased availability
of an input on utilization of that input plus the indirect effects of in-
creased availability through increased utilization of complements and de—
creased utilization of substitutes.
      The reduced form mdel previously estimated wes of the form:

production. We are                 able to nodify the above franework to account for the
interaction effects between certain important determinants of neonatal
anrtality and birtIlght. Fbr example, neonatal intensive care units are
aimed primarily at low bir1iight babies and sbould have larger effects on
death rates of light babies than on death rates of normal weight babies.
      The ist direct vy to take account of these interactions is to employ
neonatal nirtalify rates classified by birt ight as the dependent variables
in the estimation of the reduced form imjdels. Allowing for two birtelght
classes: light or low weight (less than 2 , 500 gra) and normal weight (2 , 500
gran or nre), let d1 be the neonatal death rate of light infants in the jth
state, let d2 be the neonatal death rate of normal weight infants in the jth
state, and let b be the fraction of light births. P,s an identity, the non—
birtleight—specif ic neonatal nortality rate in the                            state is:

In these equations, the a coefficients reflect the effects of the availability
of health inits and socioeconomic variables on neonatal nrtality rates of
light infants, and the r coefficients reflect the effects of these variables
on normal weight babies. To ccq,lete the nodel, we can also specify a
birtla'eight reduced form equation as:
                                                                    (5).
Estimation of the above three equations allow us to decompose the total impact
on neonatal nrtallty of a given determinant into effects operating through
low birta.eight and through birtight—specif Ic neonatal mrtauity. This
system underscores the utility of a data base that contains risk-specific as
opposed to non-risk—specific death rates.
                          III. &pirical Implementation
A. Ita and Measurement of Birth Outcomes
      Neonatal nrtalify rates by race (white and black), birthweight (less
than 2,500 grame, 2,500 gran or mere) and by state for the year 1980 are
taken from the National Infant .brtality Surveillance (NIt's). The state- and
race—specific fraction of low-weight (less than 2,500 grame) live births in
1980 comes from the National     Center for Health Statistics (NCHS} Natality




         In the case of abortion services, suppose thata rises by one unit. Then
the   effect of an increase in a on the observed   neonatal mertality rate is:
        (ôd/6m) = (d1 — d2)1 +      + (l—b)t1.
The first term on the right hand side is the effect of of prenatal care on
neonatal mertality through low birthwei.ght. The second two terms equal a
weighted average of the effects of prenatal care on the mertality rates of low-
weight and normal-weight infants. This weighted average represents the birth-
weight—specific effect.

Tape.         NIt' was prepared by the Centers for Disease Control (CtX) under
an interagency agreement between CDC and the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Developint (see Hogue et al. 1967). Under the NTh project
each    of the fifty states of the U.S. and the District of Columbia linked birth
and death certificates for the 1980 birth cobert. These linkages pertain to
births by mother s state of residence in 1980 regardless of the state in th1ch
the subsequent infant death occurred or the infant s state of residence at
death. Neonatal deaths and death rates pertain to singleton births only.
          aggregated births and neonatal deaths into t weight categories:
less than 2 • 500 grams and 2 • 500 grams and over. Thus • in this research the
neonatal mortality rate of light or i-weight infants pertains to infants
weighing less than 2 • 500 grams at birth, and the neonatal mortality rate of
normal-weight infants pertains to infants weighing 2,500 grams or more at
birth. Preliminary research suggested that the basic results were not
sensitive to an alternative definition of l birtiwight of less than 2,000
grams. This research also suggested that little was gained when the light
category was divided into very l weight (less than 1,500 grams) and mDder-
ately lcw weight (1.500—2,499 grams).9
         Separate regressions are fitted for white and black birth outcc*Tes
because the black neonatal mortality rate (not bir1h.ight-specif IC) Is twice


      A fuller description of both the dependent and Independent variables is
available from the autbors upn request.
       The above findings may be due to the aggregate nature of the data set and
the limited number of observations in it. The NIMS project represented the first
step in the deveiopnent of a national micro data base containing linked birth
and death certificates, bet it did not result in such a data base. Provided it

infant mortality.

as high as the white rate, and the black fraction of light births is twice as
high as the white fraction. By fitting race—specific regressions, multi-
collinearity is reduced, and the coefficients of the explanatory variables are
allowed to vary between races.
      The white regressions are estimated for the fifty states and the
District of Columbia or for 51 observatIons. Some states have a aJi number
of blacks, and the black nortality rates in these states are unreliable
because they are based on very few births. Therefore, we include only states
with a population of at least 20,000 blacks in 1980 and with at least 600
black births in that year in the black regressions. There are 39 observations
in these regressions.10 To further attenuate the role of random elements in
the determination of birth outccs for both races, we estimate weighted
regressions, 'èere the set of weights is the square root of the race-specific
number of live singleton births. The weights are birthweight-specific in the
neonatal nortality weight equations but not In the iow—birteight equa-
tions.
B. Maasurement of Explanatory Variables

          The fraction of light births ranges between zero and one, and the
birth.eight-specific death rate, when divided by one thousand, also possesses
this property. Maddala (1983) shows that the weighted estimation procedure
described in the text Is the appropriate one to employ In fitting linear
probability functions with aggregate data. Thus, we do not sacrifice statis-
tical appropriateness by the choice of a linear functional form.
      We choose the linear form because It facilitates a decomposition of the
total impact on neonatal nortality of a given determinant into effects operating
through low birteight and through birtls'ieight-specif Ic neonatal norta.lity (see
note 7).

erever possible. race-specific variables are enloyed in the regressions.
Such variables are denoted with an asterisk. The key inxit availability
measures in the reduced form pertain to abortion, neonatal 1nteisive care, and
five pobLtc programe aimed at poor en. All of these measures are expected
to have negative regression coefficients.
     Abortion availability is given by the number of abortion providers in
1980 per thousand men aged 15 through 44 in that year. 12 Neonatal intensive
care availability is measured by the sum of the number of hospitals with Level
II, Level III, or Levels El and III neonatal intensive care units in 1979 per
thousand         aged 15 through 44 in 1980.
      The extent of the Special Supplntal Food Program for Wmn, Infants,
and Children (WIC program) is given by the number of WIC projects in 1980 per
thousand n aged 15 through 44 with family inct less than 200 percent of
the poverty level in 1980. The availability of maternal and infant care (MIC)
projects is given by the fraction of counties served by such projects in 1980.
This variable s obtained frcan a survey of MIC projects taken by Richard
Frank, tvid Salkever, Donna Strobino, and Emily DeCoster of the Johns Hopkins
University School of Public Health as part of an ongoing research project on
the impacts of financing maternity care for the poor and uninsured. 13
      The availability of projects funded by the Bureau of Health Care
Delivery and Assistance (BHCDP.) is the number of projects funded by BIECDA and

          Iina Strobino, who has done a number of extremely important studies of
the MIC program (Strobino 1982; Strobino et al. 1986). urged us to use this
measure because enrollment in MIC is subject to significant restrictions.

designated connunity health centers or migrant health centers in 1982 per
thousand nn aged 15 through 44 with family income less than 200 percent of
the povery level in 1980. Organized family planning clinic availability is
given by the number of organized family planning clinics in 1980 per thousand
poor        aged 15 through 44. Medicaid coverage of prenatal care for first-
tiie pregnancies in 1980 is reflected by a dichøtcaus variable that equals
one If a state covered at least me first—time pregnancies of financially
eligible men in that year. It serves as a general proxy for the eligibility
of pregnant lc-income ruen for Medicaid coverage of prenatal care services
and for the generosity of Medicaid benefits14.
        The fraction of Tfl aged 15 through 44 who had at least a high school
education in 1980 is a proxy for nvther s efficiency in preventing undesired
pregnancies, in producing healthy offspring, and other aspects of efficiency
in household production. 11 schooling variable also may senie as a proxy for
the parents' preferences for healthy offspring. In addition, the schooling
variable is negatively related to poverty (the fraction of en aged 15
through 44 with family income less than 200 percent of the poverty level in
1980). 'fl poverty measure could not be included in the regressions due to
u&ilticoillnearity. 15 bether schooling represents efficiency, tastes, absence
of poverty, or all three factors, poor birth outcomes should be negatively
related to it.



        Attenpts to introduce additional Medicaid variables were unsuccessful
       14

due to niulticollinearity and the limited number of observations in our data.
      For the same reason we could riot pursue a ndel in which the fraction of
poor men is interacted with the public program measures.

      AI reduced form regressors discussed so far measure the same basic
determinants as these used by Corman and Oroseman (1985). The last ti
variables--the percentage of the population residing in urban areas in 1980
and population per uare mile in 1980--were not previously used. They are
used here because our data pertain to states rather than to large urban
counties. The signs of the regression coefficients of these t variables are
left as open issues. We note, hewever, that they may reflect such forces as
overcrc3.ed housing, transportation facilities, poverty, and air pollution.
Both measures were taken fron the 1980 Census of Population.
      Residents of sc states may receive medical care services in neighbor-
ing states in which these services are sore available. This problem is
particularly relevant to the District of Columbia (Washington, IX) and the
bordering states of Maryland and Virginia. To deal with the above problem,
abortion availability and neonatal intensive care availability in the District
of Columbia and contiguous states were adjusted based on the distribution of
women aged 15 through 44 in the IX A.
                            IV. rirical Results
      Estimates of reduced form birth outcome equations are presented belcw.
The reader is cautioned that by using states as the units of observation, we
have a limited number of degrees of freedom. The small sample size also
causes substantial imilticollinearity. These phenomena make it difficult to
uncover statistically significant relationships. Excessive emphasis on
statistical significance at the expense of the signs and magnitudes of key




                                      11
effects can be misleading in a state data base. 16    In our discussion of   the
results, we stress the sign and magnitude of a particular effect rather than
its significance. We are, hever, cautious, about highlighting regression
coefficients .4-ose t—ratioe are smaller than one in absolute value.
      Arelated problem is that the state may not be the appropriate unit of
observation for estimating the inacts on birth outccms of some of the inputs
stressed in this research. This is because there is substantial intercounty
variation in the availability and use of these inputs within a given state.
In the case of neonatal intensive care, the state may be the eore relevant
market area, since many states have regional referral netrks for ill
neonates.17 Unfortunately, for the other inputs, state—level data may mask a
considerable ant,unt of intercounty variation.
      Tables 2, 3 • and 4 contain reduced form regressions for i birthieight,
the neonatal eortality of low-weight infants, and the neonatal eortality rate
of normal-weight infants, respectively. Panel A of each table pertains to
whites • while   Panel B pertains to blacks. Four regressions are shcfrn in each
panel. The first limits the set of explanatory variables to abortion provi-
ders and neonatal intensive care hospitals. The second adds the five public
program availability measures to the set of regressors.      third regression
includes the fraction of men aged 15 through 44 with at least a high school
education, while the fourth adds population density and the percentage of the


           Some investigators deal with this problem by viewing a data base such as
ours as the universe rather than as a sanVie becauses it covers the entire
population of the U.S. in a single year.
       Fbr the above reason, we measured neonatal intensive care availability
      17

and use at the state level in previous research, even though the data on birth
outcomes pertained to counties (Corrnan and Grossman 1985; Corman, Joyce, and
Grssman 1987; Joyce 1987a, 1987b; Joyce, Corman, and Grossman 1988).
                                          12
population residing in urban areas.
        Four regressions are presented due to the probleii of multicollinearity
and a limited nuaber of degrees of freedaii. Our previous research serves as a
guide to the order in which regressors are entered. Since we found abortion
and neonatal intensive care to be the nst important determinants of neonatal
nrta1ity, these measures are included f u-st. We did not consider urbaniza-
tion and population density in our vrk with county data; hence, these t
variables are c*nitted until the final regression. Because schooling is highly
correlated with a nuner of the availability variables, regressions are shown
with and without this variable.
        The mat novel aspect of the results in Tables 2, 3, and 4 is the light
that they shed on the role of neonatal intensive care availability in birth
outcces. A priori, we expect the availability of this input to be mat
iji,rtant in the case of the neonatal nortality rate of l-ight infants.
This expectation is realized in the case of whites. According to the four
regressions in Panel A of Table 3, an increase in the availability of neonatal
intensive care lrs the neonatal nortality rate of white lc-weight infants.
The regression coefficients of this variable are statistically significant at
the 5   percent level on a one-tailed test except in regression (3W—2), where
the coefficient is significant at the 10 percent level. On the other hand,
when the fraction of lcw—weight births or the neonatal nortality rate of
normal-weight Infants is the dependent variable, the neonatal intensive care
coefficients are positive in six of eight cases and have t-ratios smaller than
one except in regression (4—W4).
        Neonatal intensive care effects are less clearcut for blacks. The
neonatal nortality rate of black 1-weight infants falls as availability

                                        13
rises except in the last regression in Panel B of Table 3. Each negative
regresaict coefficient, hever, has a t—rati.o smaller than one in absolute
value. The availability effects for the neonatal nrtality rate of black
normal-weight infants mirror the corresponding white effects. But the
fraction of black lc*.'—weight births is inversely related to neonatal intensive
care availability, and the four regression coefficients In Panel B of Table 2
are significant at the 5 percent level. In the reduced form low—birtFeight
equation the coefficient of neonatal intensive care availability reflects
substitution or complenntary relationships between neonatal Intensive care
use and other inputs. Thus, one interpretation of the result just discussed
is that neonatal intensive care use and inputs that determine birtlight are
complements: a reduction in the price an increase in the availability) of
neonatal intensive care raises the use of these inputs. Pnother interpreta-
tion is that neonatal Intensive care availability serves as a general proxy
f or the availability of medical care inputs that contribute to favorable birth
outcomes In the case of blacks.
      In addition to neonatal intensive care availability, the number of
abortion providers reflects the availability of a general health Input used by
all segments of the population as opposed to a public program measure used
only by the poor. For whites, the number of abortion providers has negative
and significant coefficients in the rrrtality equation for low-weight births.
Presumably, this finding reflects complementarity between abortion avail-
ability and neonatal Intensive care use. In the normal—weight imrtalIty
regressions, a negative effect is observed when schooling is omitted from the




                                       14
set of explanatory variables but not when it is included.     Abortion avail-
ability has no impact on the incidence of 1CM   blrtight.    For blacks, all
twelve abortion provider coefficients are negative in Tables 2, 3, and 4. In
general the birtii..eight and nonnal—weight sortality effects are nore sig-
nificant than the low—weight nortality effects, but even the latter have
absolute t-ratios greater than one in ree of four cases.
       With regard to the public program measures, the availability of BHCDt4
projects can be dismissed as a determinant of the outcomes at issue in this
research since its regression coefficient alys is positive both for whites
and blacks. 19 The coefficients of the four other program measures are
negative in a majority of cases for each race. Specifically, for whites, six
of the nine WIC and MIC effects are negative, five of the nine family planning
effects are negative, and all nine Medicaid effects are negative. For blacks,
the corresponding figures are six of nine in the cases of MIC, family plann—
ing, and Medicaid, and all nine in the case of WIC. There are far fewer
statistically sigulficant effects or effects with absolute t-ratios greater
than one for the five public program measures than for the set consisting of
the tw general availability measures (neonatal intensive care and abor-
        20
Uon)
    The final three variables in the reduced form are female schooling,

             In general an increase in abortion availability lrs the cost of
fertility control. This reduces the optimal number of births and raises the
optimal survival probability by increasing the anount of rsources allocated to
each birth (Corman and Grossman 1985).
       19
      One interpretation of the above result is that BHCDA projects service all
segments of the poverty population as opposed to men of childbearing age.
     20 In estimates not shown we regressed the health outcomes on the public
program measures alone. These results did not change the above conclusion.

urbanization, and population density. In the full 1ow-birthieight equation
for each race [(3—W4) and (3-B4fl, the schooling coefficient has the correct
negative sign and is statistically significant. The schooling coefficients
also are negative and significant in the white normal-weight nrtauity
regressions. An increase in the percentage of the population residing in
urban areas raises the race—specific fraction of light births bot lowers the
white low—weight nrtality rate. Finally, nre densely populated states have
higher black low-weight rtality rates and higher white normal-weight
crtality rates.
                                V. Discussion
      To gauge the ir.agnithdes of the estimated relationships, we computed the
impact of a one standard deviation increase in a given determinant on birth-
we1ht -specif Ic neonatal nrtaiity rates and an the fraction of light births.
•flse ccinp.tat.ions are made only for the ts' st iirortant determinants:
neonatal intensive care availability and abortion availability. They employ
an aye: age of the four regression coefficients of a given determinant obtained
for each of the three health outcojis and are perfornd only if this average
is negative.
      For whites, a one standard deviation increase In neonatal intensive care
.rzailability lowers the nxrtality rate of low-weight Infants by 3.4 deaths per
thousand live births or by 4 percent relative to a an of 89.9 deaths per
thousand live births. This translates into a reduction In the overall white
neonatal 1nrta1ity rate (not birteIght-specific) of .2 deaths per thousand
live births, which ajiy,unts to a reduction of 3 percent relative to a nan of




                                      16
6.3 deaths per thousand live births. 21 For blacks, a one standard deviation
increase in the neonatal intensive care nasure lrs the eortallty rate of
low-weight infants by 1.2 deaths per thousand live births or by 1 percent
based c*i a nan of 88.9 deaths per thousand live births. At the aan tine,
the fraction of light births falls by .002 •   which   equals 2 percent of the nean
black fraction of light births of .113.22 This inplies a decline In the black
overall neonatal eortallty rate (nean 12.6 deaths per thousand live births)
of of .3 deaths per thousand live births or 3 percent.
      For whites, a e standard deviation expansion in abortion availabilIty
reduces the jrtalIty rate of low-weight infants by 3.2 deaths per thousand
live births. Simultaneously, the imrtalIty rate of white norma1-i.eIght
infants • which has a nean of 2.0 deaths per thousand live births, falls by
less than .1 deaths per thousand live births. The decline in the overall
n,rtality rate of .2 deaths per thousand live births is the &an as in the
case of a one standard deviation increase in neonatal intensive care. For



     21 Based   on note 7, let x be a given determinant, b be the race-specific
fraction of light births, d (i =     1,2) be the race—and birt1ight—speCIfiC
eortality rate, and d be the overall race-specific eorta].ity rate.      Then

          (öd/6x) =   (d1—d2)(öb/ôx) + b(6d1/öx) + (1—b)(5d2/&X).
For whites, neonatal intensive care availability has no liact on b or d2. en
a determinant alters tc or eore outcons, (EdIöx) is evaluated at the nean
values of d1, d2, and b.


    221f the Incidence of low birtiA'eight is expressed as a percent. the
absolute decline is .2 percentage points based on a nean of 11.3 percent.
Obviously, this also anunts to a 2 percent decline in the number of low-weight
births.
                                        17
blacks, the abortion availability effect amounts to a decline in the low-
u ight mortality rate of 3.0 deaths per thousand live births or of 3 percent,
a decline in the normal-%ight mortality rate (mean 2.8 deaths per thousand
live births) of .2 deaths per thousand live births or of 7 percent, and a
decline in the overall mortality rate of .7 deaths per thousand 3. lye births or
of 6 percent. This is more than twice as large as the decline associated with
a one standard deviation increase in neonatal intensive care.
      The coefficients of variation of the t general availability measures
are substantial: 40 percent In the case of neonatal intensive care and 54
percent in the case of abortion. Therefore our results suggest that neonatal
mortality rates could be lowered by policies that reduce the inequality in
these health resources across states. CXir results also suggest that white
low-weight Infants benefit more frc*n the availability of neonatal intensive
care hpitals than black lcw-cight infants. This may be because blacks
encounter substantial financial barriers in attempting to use these hospitals.
The larger effect of abortion for blacks relative to whites is consistent with
the wider use of abortion as opposed to conventional contraceptive methods by
blacks than by whites (for example, Steen, Rindfuss, and Bean 1988).
