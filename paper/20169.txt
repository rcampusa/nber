                                              ABSTRACT

We review the existing literature about the effects of the Medicaid program. We first describe the program’s
structure and how it has changed over time. We then discuss findings on coverage, crowd out, take-up
and health. Finally, we look at effects of the program on non-health outcomes such as welfare use
and labor supply, marriage and fertility, and savings.

Medicaid is the public health insurance program for eligible low-income individuals and families

in the United States. The program has grown considerably since it was created in 1965. Medicaid

and the related Children’s Health Insurance Program were projected to cover over 60 million

people, almost one-fifth of the population, in fiscal year 2010 at a cost of $427 billion. These

numbers will surely rise as a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the health insurance

reform law passed in 2010, which among other changes allows states to expand Medicaid

eligibility for adults to 138 percent of the federal poverty guideline.

        Medicaid is jointly funded by the federal and state governments and is administered by

states. States must follow certain federal mandates but also traditionally have had considerable

leeway to determine eligibility and services. This creates cross-state variation that helps

researchers identify the program’s effects on people’s behavior. Indeed, states are not even

required to have a Medicaid program. Twenty-six states began offering Medicaid within the first

year it was created, and 23 others plus the District of Columbia joined over the next few years.

The holdout was Arizona, which created a Medicaid program only in 1982 (Gruber, 2003).

        There are large differences across states in per-capita Medicaid expenditures.

Expenditures per Medicaid beneficiary in fiscal year 2007 were $8450 in New York and $3168

in California, compared with an overall average of $5163 (Gilmer and Kronick, 2011). These

differences partly arise from the considerable discretion states have to set reimbursement levels

to health care providers and to set eligibility rules. They also arise from differences in patterns of

procedure use, outcomes and the underlying characteristics of populations, such as the

percentages elderly and disabled (e.g., Fisher et al., 2003a, 2003b). The partisan make-up of the

state legislature appears to affect state eligibility rules for children, with states with more

Democrats in the legislature having more generous eligibility rules; political party of the



                                                   1
governor and partisan control of the legislature are not significantly related to program

generosity, however (Baughman and Milyo, 2008).

       This chapter provides an overview of the economics of Medicaid. After explaining how

the program is structured, we briefly discuss the economics of health insurance and then delve

into two key issues: take-up and crowd-out. The chapter then turns to the evidence on the effects

of Medicaid on health and other behaviors. We conclude with some thoughts on the future of

Medicaid and important areas for future research.



Program Structure

To be eligible for Medicaid, a person must meet resource and categorical restrictions. The

resource restrictions include having income below a specified low threshold that varies with

family size and composition. States determine the income thresholds, subject to minimums and

maximums set by the federal government. Some states also impose a limit on assets, although

few states consider assets when determining children’s eligibility (Department of Health and

Human Services, 2010). Prior to the implementation of the ACA, the categorical restrictions in

most states limited eligibility to people who belong to one of several demographic groups:

children, parents of dependent children, pregnant women, the blind and disabled and the elderly.

There is also a “medically needy” program for people who would otherwise be eligible but

whose incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid unless their medical expenses are subtracted

from their income. During the 2000s, a few states extended coverage to low-income, non-

disabled non-elderly childless adults and/or parents.

        The ACA encourages states to expand eligibility for Medicaid. Federal funding has been

made available to states that expand eligibility to people with incomes below 138 percent of the



                                                 2
federal poverty level. This extends coverage to non-disabled, childless adults of working age

with relatively low incomes, a group that previously had a very low rate of Medicaid eligibility.

If all states choose to participate the ACA-related Medicaid expansions, up to 16 million

additional people will become eligible for Medicaid by 2014. However, as of December 2013, 14

states were planning to participate in 2014, two at a later date and 23 had no plans to participate

in the expansions, thus continuing the federalist nature of the current system (Kaiser Family

Foundation, 2013).

        Historically, Medicaid eligibility was limited to people receiving cash welfare benefits

through the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or Supplemental Security Income

(SSI) programs.1 Welfare reform and other legislative changes during the 1980s and 1990s

eroded the link between Medicaid and cash welfare programs. As Figure 1 shows, these changes

led to a doubling in the percentage of the population covered by Medicaid at some point in a

given year.

        Medicaid eligibility was expanded dramatically for children and pregnant women

beginning in the mid-1980s. The early phase of the expansions required states to cover several

groups of poor pregnant women that did not meet the family structure requirements of the AFDC

program. In the later phases of the expansion, states were first allowed to cover additional groups

of low- and middle-income pregnant women and young children and then required to do so. For

example, states were required to cover pregnant women and children under age 6 in families with

incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty line by April 1990, and by July 1991 they were

required to begin phasing in coverage for all children under age 19 in families with incomes up


1
  AFDC (reconfigured as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) as part of the 1996 welfare reform law)
provided monthly benefits to low-income families with minor children. SSI is a program administered by the Social
Security Administration that pays monthly benefits to disabled, blind, and elderly (65 and older) individuals with
low incomes and assets.

                                                        3
to 100 percent of the poverty line.2 States also were given the option to extend coverage to

pregnant women and children under age 6 in families with incomes up to 185 percent of the

poverty line. States can extend coverage even further at their own expense.

           As a result of the expansions, the fraction of all children aged 0-15 eligible for Medicaid

increased from around 13 percent in 1983 to almost 31 percent in 1996. However, the fraction

actually enrolled in Medicaid only increased from 13 percent to about 23 percent (Gruber, 2003).

There are several potential reasons for such low take-up, as explored below. Another result of the

expansions is that over one-third—and in some recent years over two-fifths—of births in the

U.S. are covered by Medicaid each year.

           There was considerable variation in the timing and extent of the expansions across states.

For example, in July 1991, 29 states exceeded the required threshold of 133 percent of the

poverty line for pregnant women and young children; six of those had expanded coverage just in

the previous six months. Eligibility increases tended to be larger in the South, where states

traditionally had very low income limits for AFDC eligibility, than in the Northeast and West,

where AFDC programs tended to be relatively generous even before the expansions. In the mid-

1990s, a number of states received waivers from the traditional AFDC program that gave them

even more latitude to expand Medicaid eligibility. Finally, the formal delinking of cash welfare

for families with children from Medicaid eligibility that came with federal welfare reform

devolved even more flexibility to the states in determining eligibility.

           The State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP, later shortened to CHIP) was

created in 1997 to provide public health insurance to children in families with incomes too high

to be eligible for Medicaid but typically too low to afford private health insurance. States were

allowed to provide coverage to uninsured children in families with incomes up to 200 percent of
2
    See Gruber (2003) for details on the expansions.

                                                       4
the poverty line or 50 percentage points above their threshold for traditional Medicaid. This led

to considerable cross-state variation in program generosity. States also differ in the degree of

cost-sharing and the types of services covered and in whether expansions were implemented

through the state’s traditional Medicaid program or not. When the program was reauthorized in

2009, the minimum eligibility threshold was set at 200 percent of the poverty line. Together,

Medicaid and CHIP covered one-third of all children in the U.S. in 2009 (Kaiser Family

Foundation, 2010a). As discussed below, crowd-out from private insurance is a major concern

with regard to Medicaid and CHIP.

        Partly as a result of the expansions, women of child-bearing age and children comprised

about 70 percent of Medicaid recipients in 2009. However, the elderly and the disabled

accounted for the majority of program expenditures, largely because of the high cost of long-

term care. Medicaid covers a large share of the low income elderly and disabled. Nearly 8.8

million Medicare beneficiaries have incomes low enough to qualify for Medicaid. These people

are called “dual eligibles.” Medicaid covers these participants’ Medicare premiums and cost-

sharing and services not covered by Medicare, such as long-term care. In 32 states and DC, SSI

beneficiaries are automatically eligible for Medicaid. In another seven states, SSI beneficiaries

are eligible for Medicaid but must file a separate application. The remaining states have rules for

Medicaid eligibility that differ from the eligibility rules for SSI.

        Another important component of Medicaid eligibility involves citizenship or legal

residency.3 Before welfare reform, most documented legal residents were eligible for safety net

programs like Medicaid on the same terms as U.S. citizens. Unauthorized immigrants were

typically ineligible for all benefits except emergency Medicaid. Emergency Medicaid includes


3
 Bitler and Hoynes (2013) survey immigrant eligibility for Medicaid and SCHIP as well as other safety net
programs.

                                                        5
coverage for emergency medical conditions that can last for a limited period and can include

pregnancy and limited post-partum care. The passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work

Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant

Responsibility Act in 1996 rescinded many benefits for documented (legal) immigrants. At the

same time, responsibility for deciding eligibility for various immigrant groups shifted

considerably to the states. Many states have chosen to cover both permanent residents and

qualified alien immigrants as well as those permanently residing under color of law (e.g., New

York). Federal law has since changed, allowing more groups of non-citizens to be covered.

Medicaid participation declined among immigrants relative to U.S. natives after welfare reform

(Watson 2010).

        A number of states have obtained what are termed section 1115 research and

demonstration waivers that allow them to explore other ways of broadening coverage as well as

to explore effects of other changes to Medicaid rules. For example, in addition to expanding

eligibility, states can explore using different rules in different parts of the state, giving different

benefits to different groups, restricting access to different providers or mandating use of

managed care and changing reimbursements. However, states cannot alter some aspects of the

program, such as services for pregnant women and children. States also can get family planning

waivers to expand provision of family planning services to populations not otherwise eligible for

Medicaid or SCHIP (e.g., Kearney and Levine, 2009). These experiments or pilots must not

reduce access or quality of care, and they must be budget neutral. This is the authority under

which Arizona first implemented a Medicaid program, which was in place from 1982 to 2006.

This is also the same demonstration program through which the state of Massachusetts

implemented parts of its health care reform.



                                                    6
Costs, Reimbursement and Managed Care

Medicaid accounts for about one-sixth of all health care spending, making it a large item in

federal and state budgets. Indeed, Medicaid represents the largest transfer of funds from the

federal government to the states. The federal government shares from a minimum of 50 percent

to a maximum of 83 percent of Medicaid costs with states. The matching rates—called the

“Federal Medical Assistance Percentage,” or FMAP—were temporarily increased during 2008-

2011 because of the economic downturn.

         States have engaged in a variety of creative tactics to increase federal funding and reduce

their own financial contribution to their Medicaid program. These tactics involve taxes on health

care providers; intergovernmental transfers (IGTs) from publicly-owned providers to state or

local governments; upper payment limits (UPLs), in which providers receive payments in excess

of costs and then make IGTs back to the state; and disproportionate-share hospital (DSH)

payments, which are federal funds given to states to allocate to hospitals that serve

disproportionate numbers of low-income patients (the ACA reduces DHS payments, under the

rationale that places that expand Medicaid to adults under 138 percent of the poverty level will

need less reimbursement for uncompensated care for the uninsured).4 A study offers this

example: a state receives $10 million revenue from a hospital via a tax (or via an IGT if it is a

public hospital). The state then makes a $12 million DSH payment to the hospital. If the state has

a 50 percent FMAP, the state gets $6 million in federal matching funds. In the end, the hospital

has netted $2 million, the state has netted $4 million and the federal government has paid $6

million, only one-third of which actually went to the hospital (Coughlin, Ku and Kim, 2000).

4
 Practically, this provides additional financial incentive for states to adopt the Medicaid expansion. States that do
not adopt the expansion not only forgo almost 100 percent federal funding, but do so in the context of reduced DHS
payments.

                                                          7
The fact that states have considerable discretion over their Medicaid program creates room for

such shenanigans to occur. In response, the federal government has imposed restrictions aimed at

ending such tactics and has cut the size of the DSH program (and will do so more as ACA is

implemented). This is important since research indicates that DSH funding is associated with

reduced mortality if states are not able to expropriate it (Baicker and Staiger, 2005).

        In an effort to control Medicaid program costs, states impose caps on how much they will

reimburse health care providers. These caps vary greatly across states. Medicaid reimbursement

levels fell in inflation-adjusted terms over 2003-2008, and Medicaid reimbursement levels were

only 72 percent of Medicare reimbursement levels in 2008 (Zuckerman, Williams and Stockley,

2009). Low reimbursement levels have made some health care providers unwilling to treat

patients covered by Medicaid. Twenty-eight percent of physicians surveyed in 2008 reported

their practices were not accepting any new Medicaid patients (Boukus, Cassil and O’Malley,

2009). Medicaid reimbursement levels appear to affect participants’ access to doctors (Shen and

Zuckerman, 2005) and to dentists (Buchmueller, Orzol and Shore-Sheppard, 2013).

        Many states also have turned to managed care programs as a way to control costs.5

Medicaid managed care programs either pay a fixed monthly fee to a managed care provider

(called “capitated” plans because costs are made on a per patient basis) or combine a fixed fee to

a primary care provider with fee-for-service payments to other providers (called “primary care

case management”). About 70 percent of Medicaid recipients receive some or all of their

Medicaid-covered services through managed care (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2010a). There is

considerable variation across states. In some states, the vast majority of Medicaid recipients are

enrolled in managed care while two states (Alaska and Wyoming) do not have a Medicaid


5
 Another reason cited for implementing managed care is that it enables enrollees to improve their health outcomes
by being part of a health care system that encourages preventive care and improves access to primary care.

                                                        8
managed care program at all. Mandatory managed care requires one of two kinds of waivers,

either the 1115 research and demonstration waivers described above or a section 1915(b)

freedom of choice waiver.6 As early as September 1995, 42 states and the District of Columbia

had implemented 1915(b) waivers (Rowland and Hanson, 1996).

        Findings are mixed about the extent to which mandates to move Medicaid recipients to

managed care plans reduce expenditures (Duggan, 2004; Duggan and Hayford, 2013; Herring

and Adams, 2011) and about the extent to which the move to managed care has affected

utilization (Howell et al., 2004; Baker and Afendulis, 2005; Bindman et al., 2005; Currie and

Fahr, 2005; Kaestner et al., 2005). Until recently, most Medicaid managed care was provided to

women and children. Some studies project big cost savings from shifting the aged and disabled

Medicaid populations to managed care, although research on the cost savings regarding the

disabled is mixed (e.g., Lo Sasso and Freund, 2000; Coughlin, Long and Graves, 2008/2009;

Burns, 2009). We discuss impacts on health below.

        Long-term care accounts for over one-third of total Medicaid spending. Medicaid covers

institutional services in residential facilities, including room and board, at Medicaid-certified

nursing homes, which provide skilled nursing care, rehabilitation and long term care and

predominately serve the aged and younger individuals with physical disabilities, and at other

institutions that serve individuals with mental retardation and developmental disabilities. Since

1983, Medicaid has provided some long-term care via home and community-based services in

some states through what are termed home and community-based service waivers.

        Finally, Medicaid subsidizes hospitals that serve a large share of low-income patients

(e.g., the uninsured or those with Medicaid) under the DSH program. Funds are allocated to


6
 Introduced in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, section 1915(b) waivers allow states to implement
mandatory managed care for a subset of the state or a subset of the state’s Medicaid beneficiaries.

states, which then distribute them to qualifying hospitals. The 2010 health insurance reform law

will reduce DSH payments during 2014-2020.



Overview of the Economics of Health Insurance

Like markets for other forms of insurance, the market for health insurance involves two classic

asymmetric information problems: adverse selection and moral hazard. Adverse selection arises

when people who expect to have higher-than-average health care costs are more likely to seek

health insurance. This is a problem if insurers cannot charge higher prices to policyholders who

are likely to have higher claims. Moral hazard arises when having health insurance changes

people’s choices in ways that increase health care costs. For example, people with insurance

might visit the doctor for minor ailments because they know the insurer bears part of the cost of

the visits.

        Because Medicaid must cover all individuals and families that meet the eligibility

requirements, the program experiences adverse selection. The population eligible for Medicaid is

also likely to be adversely selected—in worse health than others—given the positive relationship

between health and income in the U.S. This is part of why Medicaid is publicly funded: the

people it covers would not be able to pay the premiums of actuarially-fair private insurance

plans, insurance that charged them fees that covered their expected claims. Medicaid therefore

subsidizes—typically at a 100 percent rate—their health insurance. The subsidy is designed to

ensure that certain groups have health care coverage and therefore access to health care. This

may be socially optimal since some health care involves positive externalities, benefits to people

besides the recipients themselves. These positive externalities are thought to be particularly large

for children and pregnant women, the groups that were the focus of the Medicaid expansions



                                                 10
during the 1980s and 1990s. Research on Wisconsin’s Medicaid program that included

premiums and copays for relatively high-income participants suggests that participation and

health care visits are very responsive to such costs (Dague, 2013).

       In theory, the fact that Medicaid makes health care essentially free for participants should

create moral hazard as well. However, not all providers accept Medicaid patients, and seeking

health care requires spending time and effort in addition to (usually) money. These factors may

limit the extent to which Medicaid patients consume “too much” health care. It is also not clear

that Medicaid patients receive the same quality of care as privately-insured patients. This is

another asymmetric information problem—health care providers are better informed than

patients in general, and perhaps even more so than Medicaid patients. Medicaid patients then will

receive the optimal quantity and quality of care only if providers are concerned about providing

it, either because of professional ethics or because of regulations or other forces.

       It is difficult to assess whether Medicaid participants receive the same quality of health

care as other patients. Medical care is a credence good—its quality often cannot be measured

either before or after it is received. Even if research shows differences in medical care or health

outcomes between Medicaid participants and other people, the source of those differences may

be unclear. There are likely to be differences between Medicaid participants and other people

that researchers cannot observe that would result in differences in medical care and health

outcomes regardless of the quality of care. Studies on the effects of Medicaid therefore tend to

focus on relatively simple outcomes that would respond quickly to the availability of health

insurance, such as the likelihood that a young child made a well-child visit in the last year or that




                                                 11
a pregnant woman received prenatal care during the first trimester, rather than on more complex

health outcomes.7

         How Medicaid structures its payments to providers may affect participants’ medical care

and health outcomes. Providers who are paid a flat fee per Medicaid patient—the capitated

managed care model—may not be willing to take on relatively unhealthy patients, or perhaps any

Medicaid patients at all if payments are too low. However, capitated models should create

incentives for cost-effective preventative care, conditional on a provider being willing to take on

a patient. Medicaid managed care programs based on a fee-for-service model, in contrast, may

create incentives for providers to supply services that are relatively profitable even if they are not

cost-effective. Research shows that financial incentives tend to affect providers in the ways

predicted by economic theory (e.g., Adams, Bronstein and Florence, 2003; Quast, Sappington

and Shenkman, 2008). Interestingly, Garthwaite (2012) shows that the introduction of SCHIP led

to both a decrease in hours spend by pediatricians on patient care and an increase in the share of

physicians participating in the program.

         An additional consideration is that states have flexibility to set provider reimbursement

levels. Levels are almost always set lower than Medicare or private reimbursement levels, and

this is often cited as a reason for providers to stop accepting Medicaid patients. Yet the evidence

is not as damning as one might expect. Cunningham and May (2006) report that 85 percent of

physicians were serving Medicaid patients in 2004-2005. Zuckerman et al. (2004) report that in

2001, 54 percent of all physicians and 67 percent of specialists were accepting most or all new

Medicaid patients.




7
 A further challenge we discuss below is that health itself likely does not respond right away to the availability of
health insurance.

                                                          12
       Medicaid also has the power to affect prices for prescriptions. Since a large number of

people obtain pharmaceutical coverage from Medicaid, this suggests the program can influence

prices. Medicaid uses the average private sector price to decide what it will pay, which gives

drug makers an incentive to increase private prices if Medicaid will be a large purchaser

(Duggan and Scott-Morton, 2006). The federal structure of the Medicaid program may reduce its

power to influence prices for other aspects of health care, however, since states differ in their

reimbursement rates to providers and coverage of some services.

       Economic theory also predicts that targeted programs like Medicaid affect participants’

behavior along other dimensions. People may change their behavior in order to qualify for the

program. For example, families may work less in order to keep their income below the program

threshold, women may opt not to marry, and the elderly may spend down their assets in order to

be eligible for Medicaid. The empirical evidence on these theories is discussed below.

       Government transfer programs like Medicaid affect the general population, not just

participants and providers. Transfer programs are funded via taxes, which distort people’s

behavior. However, targeted programs like Medicaid cost less than universal programs that cover

the entire population. There is an efficiency tradeoff—targeted programs may create more

behavioral distortions since people change their behavior to be eligible, but they require less tax

revenue than a universal program would and hence create fewer tax-related distortions. An

additional inefficiency with regard to Medicaid involves crowd out, displacement from private

insurance to public insurance.




                                                 13
Crowd-out

Individuals and families may opt not to have private health insurance if they are eligible for

Medicaid or may drop existing private insurance if they become eligible for public insurance.

This is termed “crowd-out” in the economics literature.8 People covered by Medicaid typically

have far lower out of pocket health care costs than people with private health insurance since

Medicaid is highly subsidized. From a broader perspective, however, crowd-out does not

necessarily confer any savings; it transfers costs from certain individuals and families (and

possibly their employers) to taxpayers without necessarily improving health. Indeed, if Medicaid

recipients receive worse medical care, crowd out may be a public health concern as well as a

fiscal problem. On the other hand, to the extent that the transfers are welfare enhancing for low-

income families by freeing up funds otherwise used for health insurance and societal preferences

put more weight on income to the bottom of the distribution than on income accruing higher up,

crowd-out could be welfare enhancing.

        Findings on the extent of crowd-out are mixed. In the first and seminal paper in this

literature, Cutler and Gruber (1996) estimate that the crowd-out rate was almost 50 percent

during 1987-1992: For every two people who took up Medicaid as a result of the expansions, one

person dropped or did not take up private coverage. In a now standard approach, this paper used

survey data on income and demographics for a national sample of children and state rules

concerning eligibility to simulate state eligibility rates. This approach avoids endogeneity

problems associated with modeling take up of private or public insurance as a function of

family’s own Medicaid eligibility. If a researcher simply regressed outcomes on own eligibility

(as imputed by the researcher), a host of issues could arise. First, there could be measurement


8
 Crowd-out also can occur if employers do not provide employer-sponsored health insurance because a large
proportion of their employees have other options, such as Medicaid.

                                                      14
error because none of the survey data sets typically used to assess these questions contains all of

the information needed to determine eligibility and there is reporting error in existing survey

measures.9 Secondly, there is the concern than even though a researcher controls for observable

factors that determine eligibility, there might still be unobserved factors that are associated with

both take-up and health. Finally, there are concerns with reverse causality: Families with sick

children may have lower income and qualify for Medicaid because of the illness.

         Subsequent research reports a wide range of estimates of the extent of crowd-out. Studies

report crowd-out rates ranging from 0 to 60 percent (e.g., Dubay and Kenney, 1996; Blumberg,

Dubay and Norton, 2000; Shore-Sheppard, 2000; Lo Sasso and Buchmueller, 2004; Ham and

Shore-Sheppard, 2005; Gruber and Simon, 2008; Shore-Sheppard, 2008). Estimates differ

because of different data sets, different control variables and different time periods; research that

examines the sensitivity of crowd-out estimates to data, specifications and time periods seems

warranted; recent work by Shore-Sheppard (2008) is an important step towards understanding

the role of specification and time-period differences.10

         Crowd-out can occur among employers, who subsidize most of the private health

insurance in the U.S., as well as among families. Research looking at firm- as well as family-

level decisions finds that expanded Medicaid did not affect whether employers offer insurance to

workers but may have changed the probability that firms offer family coverage (Shore-Sheppard,

Buchmueller and Jensen 2000).

         The issue of crowd-out extends beyond Medicaid and CHIP. The 2010 Affordable Care

Act was scheduled to expand Medicaid coverage to all non-elderly people with incomes up to

9
  The instrumental variable strategy Cutler and Gruber (1996) and subsequent research uses cannot solve the
measurement error problem if instrumenting for a binary variable.
10
   Recent work using administrative data from Wisconsin by Dague et al. (2012) suggests crowd out between 4 and
18 percent for children and parents. Shore-Sheppard’s preferred estimates suggest little crowd-out and indicate that
the lack of inclusion of age-specific trends drives this difference from Cutler and Gruber’s findings.

                                                         15
133 percent of the poverty line, require people to have health insurance or pay a fine and set up

state-run health exchanges. The Supreme Court ruled that this expansion of Medicaid is optional,

and only 28 states have announced plans to expand Medicaid in this fashion. It will be interesting

to see how many newly-eligible people drop private coverage for Medicaid in expansion states

and how many employers stop making health insurance available to their employees and their

families as more options open up via the Medicaid expansion and the exchanges.



Take-up

Take-up is the extent to which people who are eligible for a program actually enroll in the

program and receive program benefits. As with many other public assistance programs, take-up

of Medicaid is incomplete. Using an updated version of the method in Currie and Gruber (1996a,

1996b) and Gruber and Yelowitz (2000), Gruber (2003) reports that, take-up was quite high for

children aged 0-15 during the early 1980s but fell as the program expanded. This is not

surprising since the expansions extended eligibility to those with higher incomes and better

access to private insurance.

         There are several potential reasons for incomplete take-up of Medicaid. First, not all

eligible people may be aware that they are eligible.11 In fact, Sonier, Boudreaux and Blewett

(2013) project that a large share of the increase in participation in Medicaid under the ACA will

come from this already eligible population (a so-called “welcome-mat” effect), based on findings

that the Massachusetts Health Reform led to a large increase in Medicaid enrollment among

those previously eligible. Those who are aware of their potential eligibility for Medicaid may


11
  For example, Aizer and Currie (2004) find that among immigrant women, greater use of public prenatal care by
women of the same background (ethnicity and race) is associated with more own use but that much of this
association goes away once they control for the hospital of delivery, casting some doubt on whether it is driven by
information sharing.

                                                         16
face barriers to enrolling in the program. Beyond paperwork hurdles, participating in a means-

tested program may involve stigma (Moffitt, 1983). Immigrant families may also be concerned

about whether applying for Medicaid will trigger removal of any unauthorized family members

or harm their ability to naturalize or sponsor relatives to immigrate. Heightened federal

immigration enforcement appears to have “chilled” Medicaid participation among children in

immigrant families, even when the children are U.S. citizens (Watson, 2010).

       Another possible reason for low take-up is perceived low quality of Medicaid. The fact

that some health care providers do not accept Medicaid because of low reimbursement rates

further reduces people’s incentive to enroll in the program. In addition, eligible individuals and

families have relatively little incentive to apply for Medicaid until they need medical care.

       However, medical care providers, especially hospitals, have an incentive to enroll eligible

patients who do not have private health insurance to ensure that they get paid. Some eligible

people therefore get enrolled in Medicaid at the time care is rendered. As noted by Aizer (2003),

this means that the population enrolled in Medicaid tends to be less healthy than the population

eligible for Medicaid. This can lead to biased estimates of the effect of Medicaid on health unless

studies correct for the fact that individuals are more likely to be enrolled in Medicaid if they have

needed medical care.

               Researchers have taken advantage of the expansions to inform estimates of take-

up. For example, Ham, Ozbeklik and Shore Sheppard (2011) find average effects of the

expansions on take-up that differ somewhat across demographic groups. Estimates range from

0.41 for whites to 0.62 for non-whites, and also vary in other predictable ways, with higher rates

for more disadvantaged groups.




                                                 17
       Take-up appears to affect estimates of the effect of the Medicaid expansions. Card and

Shore-Sheppard (2004) take advantage of law changes that required states to make low-income

children born after a particular date or of a particular age eligible for Medicaid. Using a

regression discontinuity approach that compared children on either side of these age cutoffs, they

find evidence of smaller effects of the Medicaid expansions on children’s coverage than Currie

and Gruber (1996a) and Cutler and Gruber (1996). They attribute the difference to very low take-

up rates among the newly eligible.



Effects on Health

Lack of health insurance is likely to increase mortality and morbidity since the uninsured are less

able to afford medical care, on average. However, it is difficult to determine the true effect of

health insurance on people’s health because of adverse selection. Most economics studies use

quasi-experimental techniques to reduce the bias created by adverse selection in estimates of

program effects. These studies rely on cross-state variation in policies or changes in policies

within states—so-called “natural experiments” or quasi-experiments—to identify the effects of

health insurance. Only a few studies use true experiments in which some individuals were

randomly assigned health insurance coverage while others were not. Research on the effects of

Medicaid on health relies on cross-state or within-state variation since to date only the Oregon

Health Insurance Experiment randomized control trial has been run to evaluate the effects of

Medicaid.

       Studies on the effects of Medicaid on health face several challenges. One challenge is

creating the correct counterfactual and comparison group: would Medicaid participants have no

insurance or private insurance if they were not covered by Medicaid? The true answer is likely



                                                 18
some of each, which implies that Medicaid may benefit some groups—people who would

otherwise have no insurance—more than others—people who are crowded out of private

coverage. Studies that report null effects of Medicaid therefore may be capturing offsetting

effects on different groups.

        Data limitations are another challenge. Studies often use data sets that lack information

on individuals’ insurance coverage, which makes it impossible to estimate the structural effect of

Medicaid coverage on health outcomes. Alternatively, data sets with good measures of health

outcomes, health care coverage and health care utilization often lack good measures of income,

which are necessary to impute eligibility for Medicaid. Research that uses instruments for

simulated eligibility—the approach pioneered by Cutler and Gruber (1996) for studying the

effect of the Medicaid expansions on health insurance coverage—identifies only the local

average treatment effect, or the effect of Medicaid among individuals made eligible by the

expansions, not the effect of extending Medicaid eligibility to a random person or even the

average effect of eligibility. Studies frequently report reduced-form effects that give the

relationship between a measure of Medicaid eligibility—not actual Medicaid participation—and

health. Although their results are indirect evidence on Medicaid’s effects, reduced-form studies

avoid the selection bias that can plague some structural studies. Controlling for selection into

Medicaid requires being able to identify at least one exogenous factor that affects individuals’

decision whether to take-up Medicaid coverage. Few data sets or research strategies meet that

challenge. Thus, both reduced-form and the more structural studies have limitations. In practice,

there are few structural papers in this literature.

        Finally, studies that rely on cross-state differences or within-state changes in Medicaid

policy implicitly assume that these differences or changes are exogenous. This may not be the



                                                      19
case (e.g., Baughman and Milyo, 2008). Although states may be unlikely to change Medicaid

eligibility based on health outcomes, they can and do change Medicaid eligibility rules as

economic conditions change, and those changes in economic conditions do affect health

outcomes. Studies therefore face difficulty isolating the impact of changes in Medicaid on health

outcomes.



Health Outcomes among Children

Research indicates that being eligible for Medicaid increases children’s access to medical care.

For example, the eligibility expansions that occurred between 1984 and 1992 decreased the

probability that a child went without a doctor’s visit during the last year by one-half and

increased the probability that a child visited a doctor’s office in the last two weeks by two-thirds

(Currie and Gruber, 1996a). Increases in Medicaid eligibility resulted in more hospitalizations of

children as well, particularly for conditions for which hospitalization could not be avoided by

obtaining appropriate primary care (Currie and Gruber, 1996a; Dafny and Gruber, 2005).

However, Medicaid may reduce child hospitalizations for ambulatory-care-sensitive conditions,

which tend to be avoidable with appropriate primary care (Kaestner, Joyce and Racine, 2001;

Aizer, 2003, 2007; Dafny and Gruber, 2005). This suggests that Medicaid may increase use of

preventative care.

       Medicaid eligibility may improve children’s health as well. The Medicaid expansions are

associated with reductions in child mortality (Currie and Gruber, 1996a; Meyer and Wherry,

2012). However, there is less evidence of a positive impact on morbidity. One study concludes

that Medicaid’s impact on health outcomes may occur only over time by putting children on a

better health trajectory as they age (Currie, Decker and Lin, 2008).



                                                 20
       Looking at the rollout of Medicaid during the late 1960s and early 1970s, Almond,

Decker and Simon (2012a) find that Medicaid availability is associated with an increase in non-

white fertility. In a second paper, Almond, Decker and Simon (2012b) find that Medicaid

increased hospital use among children in families with little education and for unmarried

mothers. Medicaid availability does not appear to have affected maternal mortality or early

childhood mortality, however. Using a slightly different strategy and leveraging the relative

increase in the share of the population who became covered with the introduction of Medicaid,

Goodman-Bacon (2013) finds that the program’s introduction is associated with reductions in

child and infant mortality among non-whites.

       Studies have reached mixed conclusions about the effect of Medicaid managed care

versus traditional fee-for-service care on infant and children’s health. It is important for research

that examines voluntary managed care plans to control for potential selection of healthier people

into such plans, which would bias results towards finding pro-health effects. Research therefore

tends to focus on mandatory managed care plans. Managed care is associated with less

emergency room usage and more outpatient and specialist visits (Baker and Afendulis, 2005;

Garrett, Davidoff and Yemane, 2003), which suggests increased preventative care. Troublingly,

managed care is associated with higher incidence of low birth weight, prematurity and neonatal

death in a California study, perhaps because it lowered the likelihood a mother received prenatal

care during the first trimester of the pregnancy (Aizer, Currie and Moretti, 2007). Other research,

however, finds that managed care did not adversely affect infant health outcomes in some other

states (e.g., Conover, Rankin and Sloan, 2010; Levinson and Ullman, 1998).




                                                 21
Health Outcomes among Infants and Pregnant Women

There is a sizable literature on the effect of Medicaid on health outcomes related to pregnancy

and birth since pregnant women and infants were a target of the eligibility expansions of the late

1980s and early 1990s. Findings are mixed. Several national-level studies find that Medicaid

eligibility improved prenatal care and some birth outcomes (e.g., Currie and Gruber, 1996b;

Dubay et al., 2001) while others find little effect (e.g., Dave et al., 2010/2011). Studies of

specific states also find little effect of Medicaid on prenatal care and birth outcomes (e.g.,

Epstein and Newhouse, 1998; Piper, Ray and Griffin, 1990). The results may be mixed because

of differences in study methodology and study populations. For example, it appears to matter

whether studies examine potential eligibility for Medicaid versus actual Medicaid enrollment.

Whether Medicaid is compared to no insurance or to private insurance also seems to affect

results. Medicaid eligibility appears to reduce the quantity and intensity of care during childbirth

compared to private insurance but improve it relative to no insurance (Currie and Gruber, 2001).

More recent variation driven by welfare reform-induced declines in cash welfare participation

may have reduced use of prenatal care, offsetting some of the expansion effects (Currie and

Grogger, 2002).

       The literature is more conclusive that Medicaid managed care does not improve prenatal

care. On balance, studies suggest that managed care delays the start of prenatal care (e.g., Aizer,

Currie and Moretti, 2007; Kaestner, Dubay and Kenney, 2005). However, managed care may

reduce smoking rates among pregnant women and repeat C-section rates (Howell et al., 2004).

       Medicaid’s effect, if any, on birth outcomes has the potential to matter well beyond

infancy. Increases in Medicaid and CHIP eligibility are associated with increases in test scores




                                                 22
later in childhood, probably by improving health status at birth (Levine and Schanzenbach,

2009).



Health Outcomes among Non-elderly Adults

Other than pregnant women, there is little research on the effects of Medicaid on non-elderly

adults’ health outcomes.12 This is not surprising since non-elderly adults are eligible for

Medicaid only if they meet the resource and categorical restrictions, which has largely limited

the eligible population to very low-income parents (often mothers) of dependent children and the

blind or disabled. The late 1980s and early 1990s expansions increased cancer-screening rates

among mothers and reduced the fraction of parents who reported they needed to see a doctor but

did not because of cost (e.g., Busch and Duchovny, 2005). Research also indicates that Medicaid

increases access to care for mothers relative to not having any insurance but not relative to

private insurance (e.g., Long, Coughlin and King, 2005). One early study that examined effects

of cutbacks in Medicaid (known as MediCal in California) in the early 1980s, when a number of

medically indigent adults lost their benefits, found evidence of worse health outcomes (Lurie et

al., 1984). States that extended eligibility to low-income, non-disabled childless adults during the

2000s saw a decrease in mortality and an improvement in self-reported health relative to

neighboring states that did not expand eligibility (Sommers, Baicker and Epstein, 2012).

         There is a larger literature on the effects of Medicaid managed care on adults’ health

outcomes. This literature has focused on the likelihood of using an emergency room or of seeing

a health care provider in the last year. Some of this research does not distinguish between


12
  Dague et al. (2013b) study the expansion of a state public insurance program to childless adults who had high
rates of chronic illness but were otherwise much like the population to be covered by the ACA-related Medicaid
expansions. They find that expanded eligibility led to increases in outpatient care and emergency room use but a
decrease in preventable hospitalizations.

                                                        23
Medicaid recipients who voluntarily enrolled in managed care versus those who had no choice as

part of their Medicaid coverage. That makes it difficult to evaluate the results given the

possibility of selection bias, as discussed earlier. On balance, research suggests that managed

care may reduce the likelihood of visiting an emergency room visits and may increase the

likelihood of having seen a health care provider in the last year (Hurley, Freund and Paul, 1993;

Rowland et al., 1995; Garrett and Zuckerman, 2005). There are few rigorous studies of the effect

of Medicaid managed care on adult health outcomes other than those related to provider access.

       An exciting recent study examines the effects of becoming eligible to participate in

Medicaid via a lottery (Finkelstein and Baicker, 2011, Finkelstein et al., 2012, Baicker, Taubman

et al., 2013, Taubman et al., 2014). In 2008, Oregon used a lottery to randomly offer Medicaid to

a subset of a population of childless adults aged 19-64. The lottery was implemented in a way

that allowed researchers to examine the health effects of Medicaid participation among a more

randomly selected group of adults who had access to Medicaid (won the lottery) and did not have

access (lost the lottery) than usual studies of program participants and non-participants. Data was

collected from other sources to add to the administrative data. The findings are striking: Winning

the “Medicaid lottery” is associated with a large increase in health care utilization (including

emergency rooms) and to some extent with an improvement in self-rated health and mental

health and increased rates of diabetes detection and management but not with an improvement in

measured physical health outcomes.



Health Outcomes among Elderly Adults

Research consistently indicates that “dual eligible” elderly have worse health status and greater

health service usage than elderly people who participate only in Medicare (Pezzin and Kasper,



                                                 24
2002). However, Medicaid eligibility and enrollment is likely endogenous with respect to health

outcomes since the poor tend to have worse health. The fact that Medicaid has far more

extensive coverage of long-term care than Medicare likely makes endogeneity bias worse for

studies of the elderly than for studies of children and non-elderly, non-disabled adults. Because

there have been relatively few changes in Medicaid eligibility for the elderly, researchers have

had little opportunity to take advantage of natural experiments that would help identify the health

effects of Medicaid among the elderly. However, there have been changes in Medicaid rules

regarding long-term care that researchers have exploited. Results suggest that Medicaid policies

have little effect on whether the elderly enter a nursing home instead of receiving care at home

(e.g., Norton and Kumar, 2000; Grabowski and Gruber, 2007).



Effects on Other Behaviors

Welfare Participation and Labor Supply

        Before the welfare reforms of the late 1990s, participation in the main cash welfare

program—Aid to Families with Dependent Children—conferred automatic eligibility for

Medicaid. For families with young children, the health care coverage associated with Medicaid

might quite realistically have created a substantial incentive to participate in welfare. It is a

challenge to separate the effects of Medicaid from those of AFDC since most individuals

participated in both. Early studies in this literature, such as Blank (1989) and Winkler (1991),

found little effect of Medicaid on welfare participation.13 Moffitt and Wolfe (1992) use

longitudinal data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation and model the value

associated with Medicaid with a family-specific proxy for health care expenditures. They find

13
  See Currie and Madrian (1999) for a more general discussion of the difficulties of looking at effects of health
insurance on labor market outcomes. For a more thorough discussion of the older literature on Medicaid, see Moffitt
(1992).

                                                        25
large and significant effects of Medicaid on welfare participation, with the effects concentrated

among those with high expected health care expenditures.

       As with the question of insurance coverage and crowd-out, the more recent literature uses

variation in Medicaid eligibility parameters associated with the expansions of the late 1980s and

early 1990s to examine effects on welfare participation. Yelowitz (1995) takes advantage of the

fact that these expansions decoupled eligibility for Medicaid from eligibility for AFDC for

families with children, creating a notch in families’ budget constraints for families with no other

access to health insurance coverage. Using data from the Current Population Survey, Yelowitz

finds that the expansions, as parameterized by the difference in the percent of the poverty level at

which eligibility for AFDC and Medicaid differed, led to a large and significant increase in

AFDC participation. Ham and Shore-Sheppard (1995) look at the same question, with a more

flexible specification that allows the thresholds for Medicaid and AFDC to have their own

effects and that incorporates more institutional features to calculate AFDC eligibility calculation.

They find no impact of the expansions on AFDC receipt and are able to reject the specification

used by Yelowitz (1995). Results from the Oregon “Medicaid lottery” indicate that Medicaid

participation increases receipt of food stamps but had little impact on receipt of other

government benefits (Baicker et al., 2013).

       Studies have also used the expansions to examine effects on labor supply. Yelowitz

(1995) finds that the expansions of the late 1980s and early 1990s led to an increase in labor

supply while Ham and Shore-Sheppard (2005) find that no effect on labor supply. Dave et al.

(2013) find a negative effect of the expansions on employment among women who recently gave

birth. After Tennessee disenrolled a large number of childless adults from its public health

insurance program in 2005, employment and job search increased among childless adults in the



                                                 26
state relative to other Southern states (Garthwaite, Gross and Notowidigdo, 2013). Results from

the Oregon “Medicaid lottery,” in contrast, do not indicate a significant effect of Medicaid

participation on employment or earnings (Baicker et al, 2013; Finkelstein et al., 2013). Meyer

and Rosenbaum (2001) look at the combined effects of a host of social programs (such as AFDC,

Medicaid and welfare reform waivers) and the tax system (the Earned Income Tax Credit on the

labor supply of single mothers, incorporating various incentive effects. They find that Medicaid

had little impact on labor supply while the tax system had the largest impact.

       Several studies use at the staggered introduction of Medicaid across states over time in

the late 1960s and early 1970s to look at the effect of Medicaid on AFDC participation and labor

supply. Decker and Selck (2012) find that the introduction of Medicaid explained about 10% of

the increase in AFDC caseloads. Using individual data, they find the increase occurred because

of an increase in take-up, not because of an increase in eligibility or a decline in labor force

participation. Strumpf (2011) also finds no effects on labor supply.

       Another mechanism through which Medicaid can affect labor supply is job lock. Job lock

posits that access to employer-provided health insurance induces employees to stay at employers

they otherwise would have left. Hamersma and Kim (2009) look at the effect of Medicaid

expansions of parental coverage and find that expanded eligibility reduces job lock among

unmarried women, with few other effects.



Marriage and Fertility

Medicaid also may affect marriage and fertility behavior. Until the expansions, Medicaid was

tightly linked to participation in cash welfare programs, the largest of which—Aid to Families

with Dependent Children, or AFDC—was largely restricted to single mothers. Economic theory



                                                 27
therefore predicts that AFDC and Medicaid reduced the incentive to marry and increased the

incentive to have children. Research on the introduction of Medicaid during the late 1960s and

early 1970s finds evidence of the predicted positive effect on single motherhood (Decker, 2000).

The 1980s and 1990s Medicaid expansions, in contrast, decoupled Medicaid from AFDC and

therefore increased Medicaid eligibility for two-parent families. This had a positive effect on

marriage rates (Yelowitz, 1998). The expansions also may have increased birth rates because

they reduced the cost of health care for pregnant women and children, but recent research finds

there was little effect on fertility (DeLeire, Lopoo and Simon, 2011; Zavodny and Bitler, 2010),

while some older work finds some impacts (e.g., Joyce and Kaestner, 1996).

       Medicaid also can affect via fertility through its coverage of family planning services,

including contraceptives and abortion. Expanding women’s eligibility for family planning

services reduces births by increasing contraceptive use (Kearney and Levine, 2009). States can

opt to cover abortion in Medicaid at their own expense. Such coverage is positively associated

with abortion rates and negatively associated with birth rates (Zavodny and Bitler, 2010).



Savings

Medicaid may affect people’s savings behavior. There are several reasons to expect Medicaid to

reduce how much money people save. First, like any insurance program, Medicaid reduces the

need for precautionary savings to cover uncertain health care expenses. Second, Medicaid

imposes asset tests for eligibility. Until the mid 1980s, there was an asset cap of $1000 for

AFDC eligibility, which also conferred Medicaid eligibility. While that cap has been dropped,

Medicaid continues to impose asset limits for dual eligibles. This gives elderly and disabled

people with low incomes an incentive to not exceed those limits. However, Medicaid may boost



                                                28
savings among some recipients by freeing up money that they otherwise would spend on health

insurance and health care.

       One difficulty with estimating the effect of Medicaid on savings is that Medicaid

eligibility is endogenous with respect to savings, particularly when asset limits are in effect.

Gruber and Yelowitz (1999) therefore use an identification strategy similar to Currie and Gruber

(1996a, 1996b) to simulate Medicaid eligibility in order to examine its relationship with savings

during the late 1980s and early 1990s. They conclude that Medicaid eligibility substantially

reduced families’ level of assets and the likelihood that a family had any assets at all. Gittleman

(2011) reports that some of Gruber and Yelowitz’s results are sensitive to the choice of cohort

and empirical model. Gross and Notowidigdo (2011) find that the Medicaid expansions were

associated with a decrease in personal bankruptcies but had no effect on business bankruptcies.

Using data from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, Finkelstein et al. (2012) find that one

year of access to Medicaid for low-income adults without children lead to a statistically

significant decline in the presence of medical debt and both medical and overall collections, but

no significant effect on overall bankruptcy or a summary measure of overall access to credit.

       The adverse effect on savings is likely to be concentrated in the middle of the income and

wealth distributions. People with very low incomes and wealth typically do not have enough

assets to be concerned about Medicaid’s asset limit. If faced with an adverse health event, their

assets are likely to quickly fall below Medicaid’s limit. People with very high incomes or wealth

are unlikely to ever qualify for Medicaid coverage and are likely to have private health

insurance. Consistent with this, Maynard and Qiu (2009) find evidence that Medicaid has a

strong negative effect on savings for households in middle of the wealth or income distributions.




                                                 29
       Medicaid may have particularly large effects on savings among the elderly because it has

considerably more extensive coverage of long-term care than Medicare. However, research

suggests that these effects are fairly small. For example, Gardner and Gilleskie (2006) report that

doubling the asset limit for nursing home coverage would increase the percentage of elderly with

positive assets by about 1 percentage point and would increase average assets by less than 10

percent.

       Medicaid’s coverage of long-term care may affect the market for long-term care

insurance as well. Long-term care insurance is implicitly a form of savings. Very few people buy

long-term care insurance, partly because such insurance tends to be expensive and not

actuarially-fairly priced. The existence of Medicaid and the implicit tax it levies on private long-

term care insurance further reduces the incentive to purchase such insurance. Brown and

Finkelstein (2011) provide an overview of research in this area. They conclude that Medicaid

does reduce the market for long-term care insurance. As with savings, however, the effect

appears to be relatively small.



Conclusion

What the future holds for Medicaid depends heavily on politics and the macroeconomy. In the

wake of the 2007-2009 recession, high unemployment boosted the number of people eligible for

Medicaid at the same time as tax revenues shrank. Fiscal woes motivated a number of

Republican governors and members of Congress to press for changes to the 2010 ACA that

would allow states to drop Medicaid enrollees without forfeiting federal funds. Several states

have moved toward making cuts that do not put federal funds at risk. A few governors have even

threatened that their states might stop participating in the program altogether.



                                                 30
       The joint federal-state structure of Medicaid gives rise to striking differences across

states. The federal government provides more generous matching funds to poorer states, but

states still must bear a share of Medicaid costs. Poorer states therefore tend to have less generous

Medicaid programs: lower provider reimbursement rates, coverage of fewer health care services

and lower eligibility thresholds. This results in considerable differences in access to care across

states and limits the ability of the federal government to help states deal with the effects of

regional business cycles on Medicaid spending.

       The existing federal-state structure of Medicaid does have some advantages. It allows for

experimentation across states. Such experimentation can reveal cost-effective programs that

other states then adopt. In addition, researchers have long relied on variation across states to

examine the effects of Medicaid and other public policies.

       We conclude by highlighting some important avenues for future research. Assessing the

effects of ACA-related expansions on health, labor market outcomes and other behaviors among

previously underserved groups (non-disabled, childless adults working age with relatively low

incomes) is clearly a critical research area. Here, variation will come from several sources. First,

there will be cross-state variation in Medicaid eligibility generosity for childless adults (and

some for parents as well) since not all states are participating in the expansions (and even among

the expanders, the timing is not uniform). Secondly, regardless of whether they have expanded

Medicaid or not, states are now required to use a new version of countable income for

determining eligibility—modified AGI—and to use a consistent income disregard (5 percent).

This movement to a considerably more uniform system creates cross-state variation that

researchers can couple with over-time variation in how and when states implement the

expansions and make other changes to their Medicaid systems.



                                                 31
         Another critical need is for more randomized control trials that examine the effects of

Medicaid on health and other outcomes. The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment offers an

excellent model of how to design such studies. More such experiments in other areas are needed

and their results are likely to be of great interest to researchers and policymakers alike.

         Another hole in the literature is systematic reviews of existing studies of Medicaid,

particularly those that evaluate managed care. A large literature examines the consequences of

the shift to managed care from fee-for-service on providers’ decision-making and Medicaid

participants’ health outcomes. This literature indicates that reimbursement structure affects

providers’ decision-making but is mixed on whether the shift to managed care has improved

health outcomes. In addition, more research on the cost effectiveness of managed care is needed.

One study concludes that managed care actually increases government spending, not lowers it,

and does so without improving health outcomes (Duggan 2004). This is an important and

disturbing possibility given that states continue to look to managed care to reduce Medicaid

costs.
