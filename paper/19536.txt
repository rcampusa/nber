The Potential use of In-home Scanner Technology for Budget Surveys
Andrew Leicester
NBER Working Paper No. 19536

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper considers the potential role of in-home scanners as a method of data collection for national
budget surveys such as the Consumer Expenditure Survey. A detailed comparison is made between
scanner data and diary-based budget survey data for food at home in the UK. Levels of recorded spending
are lower in scanner data for all commodities, but patterns of spending are similar. A large part of
the difference is explained by households in the scanner survey failing to record any food spending
in a given week. The gaps are widened once demographic differences between the surveys are controlled
for. There is clear evidence that short-term diaries do not accurately capture household food spending
patterns given infrequency of purchase for some commodity groups. Conditional on store choice, demographics
play little role in explaining food spending patterns in scanner data. This suggests that attempts to
impute detailed spending patterns from aggregate store-level spending would be difficult.

      1. Introduction
In-home scanner expenditure data are collected via a barcode reader installed in the
home.1 Information about purchases is collected when participants scan the barcodes of
any items brought home. Matched with information on prices, stores and the
characteristics of participants, such data offer in principle a detailed, complete record of
purchasing behaviour. Scanner data have long been used for marketing studies, and
increasingly in the economics literature to explore questions relating to consumer,
retailer and manufacturer behaviour (recent examples include Griffith et al, 2009; Broda
et al, 2009 and Aguiar and Hurst, 2007). For researchers, the appeal of scanner data lies
both in the detailed purchase information and in the fact that the data are typically
longitudinal (see Parker et al (2013) for a discussion of the virtues of longitudinal data
for research purposes). Panel expenditure datasets are comparatively rare. National
budget surveys are usually cross-section, and measures of spending in panel data (such
as the UK Household Longitudinal Study) tend to be limited and highly aggregated. Panel
data offer the chance to explore changes in purchasing behaviour in response to shocks
or policy interventions. For example, Harding et al (2012) use scanner data to explore the
impact of changes in cigarette taxes on prices and consumption. There is also growing
interest amongst policy makers in what can be learned from scanner data. The UK
Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs carried out a study of ethical
shopping decisions in conjunction with a commercial scanner data collector (DEFRA,
2011). Scanners are also starting to feature in non-commercial surveys: the US
Department of Agriculture is planning to use scanners, alongside other data collection
methods, to record detailed food purchase behaviour as part of the Food Acquisition and
Purchase Survey (FoodAPS).2

The main aims of this paper are to consider what role scanner data could play for
collecting household expenditure information as part of budget surveys such as the US
Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) or the UK Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF).3 A

  Distinct from ‘storescan’ data collected from items passing through tills. A previous NBER volume, Feenstra

price indices. There are clearly complementarities between store-level and consumer-level scanner data.

  The discussion here represents a condensed version of Leicester (2012) which provides further detail and
analysis in a number of areas.

limited role is validation. Comparisons of budget survey data to aggregate data have led
to increasing concern about the quality of survey expenditure data. However, there has
been little scope to make micro-level comparisons since few surveys (besides the budget
survey itself) collect detailed spending information. Scanner data offer such a possibility.
They also record household expenditures over long periods of time, which allows us to
explore how the time-limited nature of budget surveys (the UK LCF records spending
over just two weeks) affects the spending patterns which are observed.4

A more involved role for scanner data in budget surveys might be as part of the data
collection process itself (Mathiowetz et al, 2011). This could involve scanners being used
in place of or alongside current survey methods such as paper diaries and recall
questions. The key question for statistical agencies is to understand the modal effect of
using scanners on the data which is obtained. Comparative studies between scanner and
other expenditure data offer some insights here, but fully disentangling modal effects
from other differences between surveys (such as demographic and sampling differences)
is likely to require experimental methods. Scanner data could also be used for imputation.
As a way to reduce respondent burden, some commentators (e.g. Tucker, 2011) have
suggested asking only limited questions about aggregate category-level expenditure in
budget surveys. Information from other sources such as scanner data could then be used
to break these down into detailed spending patterns using imputation methods.

This paper focuses on how statistical agencies might make use of established scanner
surveys collected by market research companies. An alternative would be for statistical
agencies to establish and maintain their own scanner data. Whilst costly, this would offer
a number of advantages. It would override concerns about outsourcing part of the data
collection process to commercial organisations. It would allow controlled
experimentation to explore modal effects. It would ensure that the information on
demographics and the statistical properties of the data were of sufficiently high quality to
be useful for national statistics and research purposes. We offer some thoughts on the
scope for establishing a separate scanner survey in the conclusions.

The rest of the paper is organised as followed. Section 2 describes the datasets which
underlie most of our analysis: the UK LCF and scanner data from Kantar Worldpanel.
Section 3 briefly surveys the existing literature comparing scanner data to other data. In
Section 4, we compare food expenditures reported in scanner data, budget survey data
and national accounts data. We assess the impact of using budget shares taken directly
from the budget survey and scanner data as basket weights in calculating food price
indices, in place of current weights derived from aggregate expenditure data. We also
explore how expenditure patterns vary with the duration for which we observe
household spending. Section 5 explores the prospects for using detailed spending
patterns from scanner data to impute budget shares for households when all we observe
are total expenditures. Section 6 offers some overall thoughts and conclusions.

 This has important implications for attempts to use short-run spending information to make inferences about
the distribution of living standards (for example Attanasio et al, 2006; Brewer et al, 2006)



                                                     2
     2. Data
2.1 Living Costs and Food Survey
The Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) is the main UK source of household budget
information. Collected by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), it is an annual cross-
section of around 6,000 households. The survey has been renamed twice, each time
undergoing some structural changes (though the coverage and main methods of the data
have remained essentially unchanged). Until 2001 it was the Family Expenditure Survey
(FES). It then merged with a second, related, survey recording nutritional intake at the
household level and became known as the Expenditure and Food Survey (EFS). It was
then renamed the LCF in 2008. We use LCF throughout to refer to this data. Sampling is
carried out via stratified random sampling, with strata based on region, socio-economic
status and car ownership. Northern Ireland is over-sampled but survey weights are
provided to ensure the weighted sample is nationally representative. The response rate
in 2010 was 50%; this has declined substantially in recent years.

The data are made up of two main parts. The first is a two-week diary issued to all
household members aged 16 and over. Children aged 7 to 15 receive a simplified diary.5
Participants record all their expenditures over the period, attaching till receipts where
possible to reduce the extent to which handwritten records of spending have to be
maintained. A £10 incentive (£5 for children) is paid for successful completion of the
diary. Household members are also interviewed to obtain detailed demographic and
income information, as well as data on large irregular purchases (such as furniture and
holidays) and regular expenses like household energy and housing payments. Data from
the diary and the questionnaire are coded into a large number of separate spending items
for each household, all of which are reported on a per-week basis. Details of methods and
the main findings are collated each year into an ONS publication Family Spending.6

2.2 Kantar Worldpanel
Kantar are a market research company who operate a number of surveys of consumer
behaviour, including Worldpanel which is collected in a number of countries. In Britain,
one use of Worldpanel data is to estimate market shares of the major supermarkets.7 A
large, representative sample of households is active in the data at any one time. Until
2006, the average sample size was around 15,000; since then it has risen to around
25,000. Participants are recruited from a range of address sources using quota sampling,
though Northern Ireland is excluded. Household weights are derived which ensure that
the weighted sample (over a particular period of observation) of active households is
representative based on household size, housewife age, social class and region.

Households can participate for as long as they wish, and receive points redeemable for
consumer goods as an incentive to do so. Participating households are issued with a
barcode reader which is installed in the home, and are asked to record the purchases of
all barcoded products brought home. Our data contain information on ‘fast-moving
consumer goods’ – essentially food and grocery products, including things like cleaning

since in principle children’s purchases should also be captured in scanner data.

products and personal care items. Alcohol (purchased off-licence) is included but tobacco
is not. Leicester (2012) estimates that the set of products contained in the Worldpanel
data make up something like 18% of all non-housing expenditure.8



Purchases from all retailers, not just supermarkets, are in principle recorded, as are
online grocery purchases. The data are at the transaction level – typically up to a million
separate transactions are recorded in a week of data. Detailed information on the
characteristics of the products purchased is recorded, including the macro-nutritional
composition of food items. Until 2006, all households were asked to report non-barcoded
food and grocery purchases using a booklet of generic barcodes. Details of the product
characteristics for these items (such as weight, country of origin, flavour and so on) were
also entered manually via the scanner device. This increases responder burden, and so
from 2006, some households were no longer required to report these items and were
issued with a simpler scanner unit. Information on the price paid is obtained from till
receipts which are mailed in to Kantar who match the price to the purchase record.
Where no receipts are available, prices are taken from centralised databases of store- and
product-specific prices, or otherwise imputed. The data also record any promotional deal
attached to a purchase. Information on the store visited is recorded by the participants.

Household demographic characteristics are recorded in a baseline telephone interview,
and then updated every nine months or so. The set of demographic questions is typically
much less comprehensive than those recorded in the LCF, and an interview is held only
with the ‘main shopper’ in each household rather than with each household member
separately. All household members should, though, report their expenditures.

2.3 Mapping Kantar expenditure data to LCF data
The Kantar data are reported at the barcode level. There are more than 568,000
individual products. The LCF records household-level expenditures in a large number of
fairly disaggregated expenditure codes. Making comparisons requires us to match
individual products from the Kantar data into equivalent LCF expenditure codes. We use
detailed information on the sorts of products which make up each expenditure code
supplied with the LCF documentation, and the detailed product characteristics in the
Kantar data, to make this match as accurately as possible, though inevitably there is some
judgement in this process. Having created this mapping, we then further aggregate
expenditures into commodity groups to match those defined in the UK Consumer Prices
Index (CPI). This definition matches the level at which disaggregated expenditure
information is available from the National Accounts, making comparisons to aggregate
data more straightforward. Our analysis covers only food and drink purchases.

In principle, of course, when making comparisons across datasets, we could look at much
more disaggregate commodity groups. The LCF includes 73 distinct food and drink codes,
so this would be the most disaggregate comparison possible. 9 Finer disaggregation may
be useful to understand exactly where differences between scanner and other datasets
arise and what might be driving that. However, as discussed in Leicester and Oldfield
(2009), the more disaggregate the comparison the less confident we can be about the
mapping between Kantar and LCF expenditures. The problems are particularly acute

8
    His analysis suggests that just over one-third of all spending would be amenable to in-home scanning.
9
    Statistical agencies would, of course, have access to even more disaggregate budget survey data.

where it is not clear in the Kantar product information whether meats, fish, fruits and
vegetables are ‘fresh’ (largely meaning unadulterated, so including e.g. plain frozen fish
fillets) or ‘processed’ (largely meaning they are pre-prepared or flavoured in some way).
Fresh and processed products have distinct LCF codes but fall into the same CPI groups,
such that at the CPI level of aggregation there is more certainty that we are comparing
like-with-like (spending on ‘fish’ or ‘meat’, say).


    3. Previous research
This paper adds to a small but growing literature exploring data quality issues for
scanner data. A number of previous studies have compared scanner data to budget
survey data. Any regularities which emerge from these comparisons would be strongly
suggestive of survey mode effects from the use of scanners. However, definitive
statements about modal effects would require experimental evidence which held, as far
as possible, other factors constant. Such evidence does not appear to exist at the moment.
A valuable contribution from statistical agencies collecting their own scanner survey data
would be the ability to carry out controlled experimental analysis.

The strongest common finding is that average expenditure levels are markedly lower in
scanner data than in budget survey data. Duly et al (2003) compare AC Nielsen Homescan
data to CE Diary Survey data from 2000. Overall, scanner expenditures were about two-
thirds of the budget survey level. Alcohol and tobacco expenditures were about half the
budget survey level in the scanner data. Using British data from Kantar Worldpanel and
the Living Costs and Food Survey, Leicester and Oldfield (2009) find that, in 2005, weekly
total food expenditures in scanner data were about 20% below those in budget surveys
on average. Using comparisons of nutritional intake, Griffith and O’Connell (2009) find
that the number of calories reported in British scanner data were around 23 – 52% lower
than in budget survey data depending on the household type studied. They find strong
evidence, as do we below, that a large part of this gap is driven by weeks in which no food
at all is purchased in scanner data, though it does not account for all of the difference.

Previous studies have not found common results on the extent to which this ‘under-
reporting’ in scanner data is consistent across product categories. Using US data from
2002-2005, Zhen et al (2009) find scanner expenditures of 50% below CE levels for a
number of commodity groups, particularly categories where non-barcoded items are
common such as meat, fruit, vegetables and fish. For groups where almost all items are
barcoded, such as confectionery and processed fruits, they find essentially no differences
in expenditure. In contrast, Leicester and Oldfield (2009) find little evidence in British
data of significant differences across groups, with the exception of alcohol. One likely
reason for the difference is that in the US data, only 20% of households were required to
record non-barcoded items whereas all households in the British data were asked to do
so. Leicester and Oldfield (2009) can explore this directly, since from 2006 only some
households were asked to report non-barcoded purchases. They find this has a
substantial effect. Households reporting their non-barcoded purchases recorded 24%
less expenditure on fruit than found in budget surveys; those not reporting them
recorded 44% less spending.

There is also disagreement on the extent to which demographic differences between
samples help account for the lower expenditures in scanner data. Zhen et al (2009) use a


                                             5
regression model to strip out observable demographic differences between datasets and
argue that, in combination with the non-barcoded items issue, they largely accounts for
the spending differences. Leicester and Oldfield (2009) conclude that demographic
differences accentuate the gaps between datasets. They estimate a ‘propensity weight’ for
each household in the Worldpanel data which reflects how similar its observed
demographics are to those of LCF households. Using this weight, they find that the
average gap between total spending in the two datasets rises from 20% to 25%. These
contrasting findings probably result in part from differences across countries in the
relative sample compositions between scanner and budget survey data. For example, in
the US, scanner households appear to have fewer members on average than those in the
budget survey (Huffman and Jensen, 2004) whilst the reverse is true in Britain (Leicester
and Oldfield, 2009). The contrast may also reflect differences in the set of observable
demographics common to scanner and budget survey datasets. The demographic
information available in scanner data is often much less comprehensive than that found
in budget surveys. Kantar Worldpanel, for example, did not routinely collect information
on household incomes until 2008, and even then only a banded measure of gross total
income is collected from a single question asked of the main shopper. By contrast the LCF
contains detailed questions on unbanded incomes by source for each household member.
Similarly, information in the Worldpanel on education and employment status are not
consistently collected for each adult household member, and common variables like
tenure are also not always reported.

A particular problem noted by Leicester and Oldfield (2009) was poor reporting of
demographic transitions over time in the Kantar data. For example, using data from 2002
to 2005, they find that amongst a sample of households headed by someone employed
and aged 50 or over, just 2.9% were observed to be unemployed a year later. This
compared to 11.4% of a similar sample constructed from the British Household Panel
Survey (BHPS), the main panel data set in the UK. There does not appear to be similar
evidence from any study of other scanner panels which would shed light on whether this
issue was common to scanner data in general or particular to the Kantar Worldpanel.

The main lessons from these findings seem to be that scanner data record less spending
than budget surveys, but differences in methods across scanner datasets lead to different
conclusions about the extent to which this is driven by observable factors rather than
being a modal effect of scanner data per se. Thus any statistical agency (or indeed
researcher) planning to use scanner data ought to be aware in detail of the methods that
underlie its collection and what that might mean for the data which are collected. There
would appear to be a strong case for collaboration between statistical agencies,
researchers and data collectors to understand better these issues. Without experimental
methods, the next best approach to tease out modal effects may be to try and make
comparisons of scanner and budget survey data across countries which follow, as closely
as possible, identical methodologies to see which findings are robust.

Aside from comparisons to budget survey data, some papers have attempted to explore
reporting issues in scanner data more directly. Einav et al (2008) perform a detailed
matching exercise of shopping trips at a particular store, comparing purchases reported
in Homescan data to what should be the same shopping trips in loyalty card records. They
find that 20% or so of trips recorded in Homescan were not found in the retailer data, and
that around half the trips that were reported in the retailer data were not observed in



                                            6
Homescan. On matched trips, the scanner data reported on average 10-15% fewer items,
mostly small consumables which may be consumed before entering the home. The
authors found significant problems in reporting prices in scanner data. The price
reported in the Homescan record failed to match the loyalty card recorded price about
half the time. However this appears to be a particular problem with the way in which
prices are imputed into Homescan data based on centralised records of chain-week level
prices. This means store- or consumer-specific prices are missed in Homescan. In British
Worldpanel data, prices are taken from till receipts and are rarely imputed.10 Einav et al
(2008) recommend that a similar approach be adopted for Homescan.

With in-home scanners, there may concern about people taking some time to adapt to the
technology before they report reliable data. Leicester and Oldfield (2009) find that
reported expenditures were highest in the first few weeks of participation. After about 6
months, households spent about 5% less than in their first week on average. This might
be evidence of survey ‘fatigue’, with households being less assiduous about reporting all
their spending after the initial novelty wears off. It might also be evidence of a settling-in
process in which households make small errors early on (multiple recording, say) which
inflate expenditures relative to their true values. It could also be a genuine behavioural
reaction to participation. For statistical agencies thinking about scanner data for budget
surveys, the interesting comparison is with the current survey approach. Ahmed et al
(2006) find that in the Canadian Food Expenditure Survey, spending drops by 9%
between the first and second week on average.

A further issue relates to quota sampling methods used in scanner data (Tucker, 2011;
Zhen et al, 2009; USDA, 2009; Harris, 2005) rather than random probability or stratified
sampling used in budget surveys. Westat (2011b) and Perloff and Denbaly (2007) are
both critical of commercial scanner data collectors for releasing little information on
sampling methods, response rates, attrition rates and so on, and suggest caution in
relying on existing scanner data for these reasons.

A final point relates to unobservable differences in the characteristics of households who
participate in scanner data and budget surveys. If significant, such differences could have
important repercussions for spending records and researchers. Lusk and Brooks (2011)
find that households in two large US scanner samples, Homescan and IRI, appear to be
more price responsive than the population at large, even conditional on observable
characteristics. They offer two possible explanations. Firstly, participating in scanner data
may make households more aware of their purchasing behaviour and thus more price
sensitive. Secondly, those who agree to participate in scanner data may be a self-selected
sample of more price conscious households. Of course, these findings do not tell us
whether the participation and self-selection effects are greater in scanner data than in
budget surveys, which would be an interesting extension. A fascinating study would be to
estimate demand models using budget survey data and scanner data aggregated to the
same level to see whether they give similar results.




10
  Where receipts are not sent in, imputation methods may be used. Since national supermarket chains in the
UK all use national pricing, this imputation should still capture chain-level deals and promotions, though
individual discounts from coupons or loyalty cards would be missed.



                                                     7
        4. Comparing scanner and other expenditure data
Surveys of household expenditure are prone to error. Participants could deliberately or
accidentally mis-report their purchases, or change their usual shopping behaviour as a
result of participation. Data validation is therefore vital. Without any clear way to obtain a
‘gold standard’ benchmark of actual expenditures against which to compare surveys, the
most promising approach to validation is to compare data sources against one another to
see whether they provide different impressions of spending levels, patterns and trends.

In this section, we make two distinct sets of comparisons. Firstly, we compare survey data
from Kantar Worldpanel and the LCF to aggregate data from the ONS National Accounts.
Secondly, we make micro-level comparisons between the two surveys. In each case, we
explore not just total spending but also expenditure patterns. Differences in total
spending will matter for issues like living standards and inequality where spending is
used as a measure of well-being. But in some cases it is the pattern of spending that
matters – for example, in deriving expenditure weights for price indices or estimating
demand models. Comparisons of both are therefore important.

4.1 Comparison to national expenditure aggregates

Several recent papers explore the quality of budget survey data by comparing them to
aggregate expenditure data. Examples in the US include Triplett (1997), Slesnick (2001),
Attanasio et al (2006), and in the UK include Tanner (1999), Blow et al (2004), Attanasio
et al (2006) and O’Dea and Crossley (2010). Key findings from these studies are:

        •    Spending reported in the US CE makes up about 70% of aggregate levels. In the
             UK LCF, the figure is around 80%. Both have worsened over time. The decline in
             UK coverage is particularly noticeable from the early 1990s.
        •    Similar trends occur for food at home. In the US, coverage fell from more than
             75% in the 1980s to around 65% by the early 2000s. In the UK, coverage fell
             from more than 95% in the 1970s to less than 90% by the early 2000s.

We focus on food at home and off-licence alcohol expenditures in the UK National
Accounts (NA) and compare them to spending reported in the LCF and, for the first time,
Kantar Worldpanel data.11 We are not aware of other papers which have made similar
comparisons of scanner data to national spending figures in this way. Our interest is not
just in how much of total aggregate expenditure is reported in the surveys, but also in
whether trends over time are similar. There are a number of reasons why we would
expect food spending to be higher in NA data than survey data. NA figures include
expenditures by people living in non-housing accommodation (student halls, old age
homes, army barracks and so on) and spending by tourists in the UK which are not
included in the surveys. NA figures are also based on UK-wide expenditures (including
Northern Ireland). Since the Kantar data covers only Great Britain (excluding Northern
Ireland), for consistency across surveys we also look at LCF data for Great Britain.

To make the comparisons, we need to aggregate the LCF and Kantar survey data to
national totals. The LCF reports weekly household-level expenditure by commodity group
and provides sampling weights for each household which gross up the data to national

figures. Thus we convert weekly expenditure figures to annual figures (multiplying by
52) and use the weights to generate national annual expenditures. In the Kantar data,
sampling weights are provided for each household covering different periods of time (e.g.
4 weeks, 52 weeks). Households who fail to report expenditures consistently over that
period are assigned a zero weight, with the weights of other households adjusted such
that the figures gross up to national totals. We calculate total aggregated expenditures by
commodity over a series of 4-week periods using the appropriate weights. These are then
further aggregated into annual totals by adding up the thirteen 4-week periods that
generate a 52-week ‘year’ which closely (though not perfectly) covers a single calendar
year.12 We convert aggregated figures to weekly averages.

Figure 4.1 shows average total weekly food and drink expenditure in the NA and the
survey datasets between 2002 and 2009, the period for which full-year comparisons can
be made. Figure 4.2 reports year-on-year growth rates.

Levels of spending in the LCF are about 79 to 81% of those in NA data.13 Those in the
Kantar data are about 51 to 53% of NA values. Looking at growth rates, there is much
more volatility in the LCF. Aggregate spending on food and drink grew by around 8%
between 2005 and 2006, a spike not seen in other data. The NA and Kantar figures
suggest a sharp slowdown in spending in 2009, but this is not reflected in the LCF data.
There is no evidence that the Kantar data perform worse than the LCF when compared to
NA data. Indeed, the larger sample size in the Kantar data mitigates the volatility in
growth rates observed in the LCF. Such volatility cautions against making year-on-year
inferences about changes in living standards from consumption changes in the LCF.

Table 4.1 disaggregates total food expenditures in the surveys and NA into groups based
on CPI commodity definitions. Figures are shown for 2002 and 2009, the start and end of
our comparison period. Food items are better reported than either alcohol or non-
alcoholic beverages in both survey datasets. The relative under-reporting of drinks
compared to food is striking.14 Interestingly, the LCF data appear if anything relatively
worse at recording non-alcoholic drinks than alcoholic drinks whilst the reverse is true in
the Kantar data. Within food, spending on bread and fish appears to be particularly well
captured in survey data. There appears to be some issue in how sugar and confectionery
products are reported as well as ‘other food’. Given what appear to be high relative
reports of survey expenditure on other food and low reports of sugar and confectionery,
it could be some coding issue where items that are included in the NA definition of
confectionery are included in the LCF definition of other food. It is not clear what drives
this, and we cannot drill down into the NA figures in more detail. In principle, the LCF
expenditure codes should map directly on to the NA commodity codes since both use the


13
   This is not simply because of geography – the absence of Northern Ireland from the survey data is not nearly
enough to account for the lower spending. In 2009, for example, we find LCF expenditures are 81% of those
reported in the NA; adding Northern Ireland back in raises this to just 83%.
14
   By 2009 only 54% of soft drink expenditure in the NA was captured in the LCF, compared to 75% of wine
expenditure and 61% of beer expenditure. Much attention has been paid to the relative under-recording of
alcohol in surveys but these results show the same is also true of soft drinks.



                                                                  10
COICOP (Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose) categorisation method.
Since we map the Kantar products onto LCF codes, these too should then translate
directly into comparable NA commodities.

Comparing across the LCF and Kantar datasets, those commodities which are relatively
well reported in one also tend to be relatively well reported in the other. The most
notable differences come in alcohol where reported Kantar spending is relatively lower
than reported LCF spending. Within alcohol there are differences too: for example, the
LCF does comparatively badly at recording spirits purchases, capturing just 44% of NA
expenditure (compared to 61% for beer and 75% for wine). In the Kantar data, it is beer
that is least well recorded (29% of NA spending). This could be due to the way the data is
collected. In the LCF, each household member has an individual diary to fill out. In the
Kantar data, whilst in principle each household member should record items brought
home, in practice it may be that main shopping trips are well-reported whilst those
carried out by secondary shoppers are less well captured. If main shoppers are mostly
female and men buy more beer, this might explain this finding.

Comparing results for 2002 and 2009 tells us where survey expenditure measures have
grown more or less quickly than those in the NA. A noticeable shift occurs for oils and
fats, where spending growth was much faster in the both surveys than the NA. This is
driven by a sharp fall of around 15% in spending between 2008 and 2009 in the NA, with
much smaller declines in the surveys. There is also a relative decline in both surveys for
fruit spending. Again, this is driven mostly by a single year: fruit spending grew by more
than 16% in 2005 in the NA data, but only by around 7% in the two surveys. Detailed
figures for spending ratios and growth rates in each year for each commodity are
available on request, but broadly the conclusion from earlier that (a) spending growth is
more volatile in the LCF than either the NA or Kantar data sources and that (b) there is no
clear ‘winner’ between the LCF and Kantar as to which tracks growth rates observed in
the NA holds across commodities as well.

4.2 Comparing scanner and budget survey expenditure data
We now make detailed comparisons between the survey measures of spending from
Kantar and the LCF. This analysis is useful not only as a way to compare, contrast and
validate the different expenditure surveys but also to inform us about how useful existing
scanner data might be for imputing detailed expenditures into budget survey data (see
Section 5). If we find that expenditure patterns are very different in the Worldpanel and
LCF, we might be less confident about using scanner data to try and predict detailed
expenditures in the survey data given high-level information on total outlays.

When making cross-dataset comparisons, it is important to bear in mind that they are
collected in very different ways. The LCF is recorded over two weeks based on diaries
kept by each household member. Respondents are contacted at least once during the two
week period to check for any problems filling in the diary, and a thorough check is made
of the diaries at the end of the period to ensure they have been properly completed
(Ayres et al, 2010). In the Kantar data, each household can participate for as long as they
wish. They are contacted every nine months or so to check that demographic information
is up to date, but in general attempts to ensure good compliance are limited. Thus if we
want to compare average spending levels and patterns in the LCF to those in the Kantar
data, the crucial issue is what sample of households we select from the Kantar data, over
what period of time we choose to observe them and how we deal with seeming periods of
non-compliance. Leicester and Oldfield (2009), for example, look at average weekly
expenditures in the Kantar data amongst households who report spending in at least four
separate weeks (not necessarily consecutive) in a given year. They include only those
weeks in which some spending is observed. On this basis, they find that average total food
and drink expenditures were about 25% lower in the Kantar data than in the LCF data in
2005, once observable demographic differences in the samples were taken into account.15
Sample selection
Our main comparisons between LCF and Kantar data cover calendar year 2009.16 In the
LCF, we exclude all households in Northern Ireland to ensure the geographical coverage
of the two datasets is comparable. This gives a sample size of 5,220 households.

15
   They find a smaller gap of around 16% when comparing the first two full weeks of expenditure for
households newly signed up to the Kantar data (again excluding cases where either week includes zero
expenditure). This could reflect the ‘fatigue’ issue mentioned above which sees recorded spending drop off
slightly with the length of participation.
16
   As in the comparison to National Accounts aggregates above, we use a 52-week Kantar period which does
                                                           th                       th
not quite overlap with the calendar year, running from 29 December 2008 until 27 December 2009.



                                                    13
In the Kantar data, a total of 26,655 separate households are observed making at least
one purchase in 2009. We look first at households who, according to the dates at which
they signed up to and dropped out of the survey, were active during the whole period.
This gives a ‘non-dropout’ sample of 21,093 households (79.1% of the full sample). As an
additional selection, we also condition on households who have no reporting gap (period
during which no food and drink expenditures at all are recorded) exceeding 6 weeks.17
While this threshold is somewhat arbitrary, the intention is to try and exclude households
who do not appear to be fully compliant over the whole year. Shorter periods of non-
reporting might be reconciled as holiday periods, for example, but it seems somewhat
unlikely that many households would legitimately purchase no food items for that long.
 This ‘regular reporter’ sample includes 15,781 households. Leicester (2012) shows that
households excluded by this sample selection are significantly more likely to be in
London, be headed by someone aged under 40 or over 60, be headed by a female, to have
larger numbers of adults or children, and to have missing demographic information
either on income, employment status or the number of cars. Households who are not
required to report non-barcoded items are significantly more likely to be part of the
‘regular reporter’ sample, which suggests that the reduced respondent burden may
encourage households to report spending consistently. Income and employment status
have no independent effects on the likelihood of selection into this sample. The fact that
our preferred ‘regular reporter’ sample is clearly a non-random set of all Kantar
households should be borne in mind when comparing raw expenditures. Later in this
section, we condition on observable demographics across the datasets to see how far they
can explain spending differences.18
Comparisons of average expenditure and budget shares
Table 4.2 shows average expenditures per week, by CPI commodity, from the LCF and
Kantar data during 2009. To strip out the effects of household composition, expenditures
are equivalised using the before housing costs modified OECD equivalence scale.19 We
look at a number of different Kantar samples. First, we take the ‘no dropout’ sample and
pick a random consecutive two week period (matching the LCF diary period) over which
to observe expenditures. This approach assumes that weeks in which households record
no food spending are accurate reflections of true purchasing behaviour. We then make
the additional selection described above and drop households with long reporting gaps.
Within this sample, we look at average weekly spending when we choose observation
periods of different length.20 Finally, for each Kantar household in this sample, we select
the longest consecutive set of weeks containing any recorded expenditure at all. This in
effect assumes that all weeks in which zero spending is recorded are inaccurate. The
mean duration of observation in this sample is 25.1 weeks.




17
   We do not consider whether or not households buy non-food items during this period.
18
   In the Kantar data, we observe household spending over a full year period. We have demographic data once
a year for each household that are updated roughly each November. For the 2009 sample, then, the
demographics refer to November 2008 values.
19
   See Appendix A of Jin et al (2011) for details of equivalence scales.

   Results over 2 and 52 weeks are shown; figures for periods of 4, 12 and 26 weeks essentially show the same

Average household weekly equivalised food and drink expenditures in 2009 were £55.46
in the LCF. Expenditures in the Kantar data were lower for all samples. For the ‘no
dropout’ sample observed over two weeks, expenditures were £35.03, almost 37% below
the LCF figure. Excluding those with long gaps in reporting, average spending rises to
£39.52 (29% below the LCF figure) when households are observed over a random two
weeks or £39.56 observed over the full 52 weeks. It is striking how little difference there
is in average expenditures when households are observed for a full year rather than a
single two week period, though the standard deviation of expenditures falls markedly. We
return to this issue shortly. Finally, once we ignore zero spending weeks altogether,
average spending rises to £44.56, a gap of just under 20% compared to LCF levels.

These figures make clear that the treatment of weeks in which zero expenditure is
reported is hugely important. Around half of the gap between Kantar and LCF
expenditures is eliminated once we strip these weeks out. The greater propensity for zero
spending weeks in the Kantar data than the LCF is striking and should be a priority for
further analysis. It could reflect households who have effectively attrited but not formally
dropped out. However, many households have reporting behaviour which is not
consistent with this – for example, they report nothing for a few weeks then start
scanning again. Understanding what drives this in scanner data would be useful.

Table 4.3 shows Kantar expenditures relative to LCF expenditures for various sample
definitions, and Table 4.4 shows the expenditures in terms of budget shares. Even if
average expenditures are lower in the scanner data, if the extent of ‘under-reporting’ is
quite consistent such that the patterns of expenditure are similar, this acts as a useful
validation (of both data sources) and gives us more confidence in trying to use scanner
data as a means to impute detailed budget shares from aggregate expenditure data.

From Table 4.3, several features emerge. The average proportion of LCF expenditures
reported in the Kantar data rises for all commodities as we remove the impact of zero
spending weeks. Once again, observing households for 2 weeks or 52 weeks makes little
difference to the average proportion. Using the ‘longest uninterrupted’ measure of Kantar
spending (rightmost column of Table 4.3), relative to LCF spending, Kantar expenditure
levels match up most closely for non-alcoholic beverages and least closely for alcohol.
Food spending is somewhere between. There are differences across disaggregate
commodities: for example, the Kantar data picks up about 75% as much spending on
average for fish, fruit and other foods than the LCF, but about 90% of the expenditure on
oils and fats, and coffee and tea. Differences across alcohol types are particularly clear.

Expressed as shares of the total food and drink budget, Table 4.4 makes it clear that the
particular sample selected from the Kantar data makes very little difference to the
pattern of expenditure observed. Comparing LCF budget shares to those from the
uninterrupted Kantar sample also reveals relatively small differences. For any single
commodity, the largest difference in budget share is for wine, which makes up on average
5.4% of food and drink spending in the Kantar data but 6.9% of spending in the LCF. In
the opposite direction, bread and cereals make up 16.1% of total Kantar food and drink
spending compared to 15.3% of LCF spending.

shows average equivalised weekly expenditures in the Kantar data (based on the
uninterrupted sample definition) as a proportion of LCF values each year between 2002

and 2009. There is a small increase over time. In 2002, Kantar households reported
78.5% as much spending as LCF households on average. This rose to 80.3% by 2009.

Source: Author’s calculations from Kantar Worldpanel and LCF data. Note: Kantar figures relate to
“longest uninterrupted” period of Kantar reporting amongst households that are active across the
full calendar year and have no single reporting gap in excess of 6 weeks.


More noticeable is what appears to be a step increase between 2006 and 2007 for
beverages, from about 84% to 90%, and a longer term upward trend for alcohol
beginning in 2006 (though stalling somewhat in 2009). This may be related to the
introduction of a new scanner technology for some Kantar households in 2006, who were
no longer required to scan non-barcoded items. If this made compliance costs lower it
may have increased reporting of barcoded items – likely to cover almost all spending on
alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks – at the cost of reducing reporting of some other
categories of spending.21 More detailed analysis lends some support to this: between
2005 and 2009, for example, weekly average spending on meat in the Kantar data fell
from 82.5% to 80.2% of the LCF average; for dairy products (including cheese) from
85.0% to 83.1%; for fruit from 77.1% to 74.3% and vegetables from 83.7% to 81.6%.
Table 4.5 uses the 2009 data and makes a direct comparison between households who
report non-barcoded products and those who do not. We focus on the longest
uninterrupted spending period. Households who do not record non-barcoded items
spend on average £1.65 per week more than those who do, a statistically significant
difference. The largest effects are for beer (28% higher spending), soft drinks (22%),
other food (14%) and wine (13%). Spending is lower in only two categories: fruit (22%
lower) and vegetables (3%). This leads to quite different expenditure patterns across the
groups. We explore below the extent to which these differences might also be attributed
to demographic differences between the groups as well as the technology they use.




21
  This hypothesis does not really explain what appears to be quite a sustained improvement in alcohol
reporting, at least between 2005 and 2008, however.

One way to illustrate the economic significance – or otherwise – of differences in spending patterns across
data sources is to ask what food inflation rates would have looked like had CPI weights for different food
groups been drawn directly from the LCF or Kantar surveys, rather than based (as now) on the National
Accounts aggregates. Figure 4.4 shows the 2009 food budget shares based on Kantar data (using the
longest uninterrupted sample for all households), LCF data and from the CPI expenditure weights.22 Note
we look only at food (a higher level CPI aggregate) and exclude drinks. The differences between LCF and
Kantar data are small: the Kantar basket more heavily weights bread, dairy, fats and confectionery whilst
the LCF basket more heavily weights fruit, fish and other food. There are larger differences between the
weights based on survey data and those from the CPI basket. Weights for bread, meat, fairy, fats and other
food are lower in the CPI than either of the survey baskets, whilst weights for confectionery and fruit are
higher. The much lower spending on other food in the CPI accords with the much higher expenditure on
other foods observed in the surveys than the National Accounts aggregates in Section 4.1 above.

Figure 4.5 shows the different inflation rates for food that result from applying survey- and year-specific
commodity weights. The left-hand panel gives the results as index numbers between January 2002 and
December 2009; the right-hand panel as annual inflation rates starting in January 2003.23 Overall, the
effect of re-weighting the food CPI using LCF and Kantar-specific commodity weights is small. Over the
whole period, the food CPI rose by 29.6% whereas an index based on LCF weights rose by 28.1% and one
based on Kantar weights rose by 28.6%. The average annual food inflation rate between 2003 and 2009
was 3.8% based on CPI weights, and 3.7% based on weights from both surveys. The largest absolute gap
for any single month between the CPI-weighted inflation rate and the LCF-weighted rate was 0.5%. The
largest gap comparing CPI-weighted and Kantar-weighted inflation rates was 0.7%. The largest gap
comparing LCF-weighted and Kantar-weighted inflation rates was just 0.3%.




22
   Note that CPI weights are based on National Accounts expenditure aggregates which are in turn based on slightly out-dated
expenditure data from the LCF. For example, 2010 weights in the CPI are heavily influenced by LCF data from 2008 and 2009. Our
estimates based on LCF and Kantar data use contemporaneous data, e.g. the 2009 weights are based on 2009 data.
23
   Figures were calculated by calculating within-year price indices for each food sub-group based at 100 in January and using the
different weights to calculate a within-year food index. These indices are then ‘chained’ to give a series over the whole time period.
See Section 2.5 of Office for National Statistics (2010b) for more on chaining.

Distributions of spending and budget shares
The comparisons so far have focused on average spending levels and budget shares. However, looking at
their distribution across households is informative. It helps to understand what might be driving
differences in the averages. Further, even if (as we saw above) changing the period over which we observe
Kantar households makes little difference to the average budget share or spending level, it may still affect
the distribution. For issues like poverty and inequality it is the distribution which matters. Figure 4.6
shows a density plot of the distribution of average equivalised weekly food and drink spending in 2009 for
the LCF, and ‘regular reporter’ Kantar households observed over 2 weeks, 52 weeks and for the longest
uninterrupted number of weeks.

The distribution for LCF households is relatively smooth over the range of spending shown. However,
when we observe Kantar households for just two weeks, there is a bulge in the distribution at zero,
reflecting the high prevalence of zero expenditure weeks. Observed over longer periods, the distribution
of expenditures in the Kantar data become more smoothly distributed though clearly skewed somewhat
more towards lower expenditures than the LCF figures. There are notably far fewer high-spending
households in the Kantar data than the LCF.

Even more interesting is the impact of observation period on commodity-level budget shares. One
problem with observing expenditure over a short horizon like two weeks is that households may purchase
and consume some goods relatively infrequently. To take a stylised example: imagine that all households
shop once a week and consume one can of beer per week. Beer is only sold in 4-packs which sell for £5.
Households therefore spend £5 on beer once every four weeks, and average weekly beer consumption is
£1.25. If we took a random two week period, we would observe half of households buying beer
(consuming £2.50 per week) and half of households buying no beer (consuming £0 per week). The
average value of consumption across all households would be right, but the distribution would be wrong.
Given the wide availability of freezer and refrigerator space and the ability to store some food and drink
items (like canned goods) for a long time, there is also scope for households to engage in stockpiling:
buying goods when they are cheap (perhaps on a temporary special offer) for consumption over a long
period. The longer the horizon over which we can observe spending patterns, therefore, the more accurate
a record of true consumption that data is likely to represent.

Leicester (2012) takes the regular reporter Kantar sample and shows that, observed over a full year,
almost all households are observed to purchase from all CPI commodity groups whereas observed over
two weeks, large numbers report zero expenditure. The exception is alcohol – over a year, around 39% of
households do not buy spirits, 32% do not buy beer and 16% do not buy wine. However, over just two
weeks the proportions not observed to buy are 89%, 84% and 71% respectively. For researchers
interested in estimating price responsiveness or demand models, the ability to observe spending over an
extended period is a key advantage of scanner data, since it drastically reduces the problem of how to deal
with zero expenditure values.

Aside from the impact on the likelihood of observing zero expenditure, increasing the duration over which
spending is recorded substantially reduces the variance in the distribution of household-level budget
shares of each commodity. Figure 4.7 illustrates this for four different commodities (clockwise from top
left, for bread, meat, vegetables and fish; figures for other goods available on request). This is crucial for
some applications. For example, past research in the UK has used data from the two-week LCF to estimate
household-specific expenditure patterns from which household-level inflation rates have been estimated
(Leicester et al, 2008; Levell and Oldfield, 2011). If at least some of the variation in household budget
shares is driven by the short period of observation, then these studies would overstate the variation in
household-specific inflation rates across different types of household groups.

The impact of demographics
Are differences in expenditures across scanner and budget survey data driven by demographic effects?
Recall that we select a particular non-random sample of households from the scanner data – those who do
not drop out of the sample in a given year and have no long gap in their reported expenditures. If the
households in this sample have characteristics which would typically make them low spenders on food at
home (for example, being poorer) then this could account for the spending gap between the datasets.

Appendix A compares the observable characteristics of the LCF and Kantar (‘regular reporter’) samples in
2009.24 There are relatively few demographics common to both datasets. To the extent that we can strip
out the effects of these common demographics, there may well be a large set of unobserved demographics,
or variables observed in one dataset but not the other, which affect expenditures but on which we cannot
condition. To summarise the key differences, we find that:




24
  In these results and for the rest of this section, we exclude a small number of households from the Kantar sample who report
missing information on the number of cars they own or the employment status of the household head, and households in either
survey who report equivalised average weekly spending on food and drink (over 2 weeks in the LCF sample, and over the longest
uninterrupted reporting period in the Kantar sample) of less than £5.

                                                                             23
       •    Kantar households tend to have lower income. Amongst those with non-missing incomes, only
            12.5% (3.7%) of Kantar households have gross annual household income in excess of £50,000
            (£70,000) compared to 20.8% (9.9%) of LCF households.
       •    Kantar households are much more likely to own a home computer: 89.5% of the Kantar sample
            do so compared to 75.6% of the LCF sample. This probably reflects the fact that many Kantar
            households also participate in online surveys run by Kantar, and many use PCs to upload their
            expenditure records to Kantar from the scanner units.
       •    Only 12.9% of Kantar households do not own a car, compared to 21.6% in the LCF.
       •    The regional composition of the two datasets is similar. In the Kantar sample the South East and
            East of England are more heavily represented. Scotland appears to be slightly less represented.
       •    Kantar households are noticeably more middle aged: only 2.7% of the Kantar sample is headed by
            someone aged 80 or over compared to 7.1% of the LCF sample. Less than 1% of Kantar
            households are headed by someone aged 24 or under compared to 3.0% of the LCF sample.
       •    56% of Kantar households are headed by a female, compared to 25% of the LCF sample.
       •    Kantar households are much more likely to be headed by someone who is not working (11.3%
            compared to 8.6% in the LCF) or part-time employed (15.8% working less than 30 hours,
            compared to just 6.1% in the LCF).
       •    Kantar households are much more likely to contain three or more adult members. This accords
            with information received from discussions with Kantar that they over-sample multiple adult
            households because of difficulties in obtaining purchase information from secondary shoppers.
       •    Kantar households have about the same number of young (pre-school aged) children as LCF
            households on average, but slightly more older children.

Ex ante it is not clear what these demographic differences imply for expenditures. Kantar households are
poorer, on average, and less likely to be headed by a full-time employee which might mean we would
expect them to spend less than LCF households. But along other dimensions they are better off: for
example, being more likely to have cars and computers, and more likely to be middle aged (where lifecycle
expenditures peak). Thus an empirical study is needed. We first pool observations from the LCF and
Kantar samples in 2009. We take average total food and drink weekly spending figures over two weeks
from the LCF and from the longest uninterrupted spending period from the Kantar sample.25 We regress
the log of expenditure on a dummy variable which takes the value 1 for households from the Kantar
sample, to give the raw average proportional difference between the surveys. We then add a vector of
common demographic controls from the surveys to strip out observable demographic effects and see what
happens to the coefficient on the Kantar dummy. Table 4.6 reports the key results, including separate
results for households who do and do not report random weight items in the Kantar survey.

     As we now control for demographics, including household composition, here we use unequivalised expenditure figures.

                                                                  24
Source: Author’s calculations based on 2009 LCF and Kantar Worldpanel data. Notes: Expenditure figures are
unequivalised. Households with missing information on number of cars or employment status are dropped, as are
those spending less than £5 (equivalised) per week on average in either survey. Demographic controls are household
gross annual income group, number of cars, region, age group of household head, sex of household head, employment
status of household head, number of adult males, number of adult females, numbers of children in age groups 0-4, 5-
10 and 11-17 and numbers of people aged 65 or over. *** = p<0.01; ** = p<0.05; * = p<0.1. Standard errors are robust.

Across all households, the raw gap between the LCF and Kantar surveys is just over 9% - this is markedly
less than the 20% seen earlier in this section, but our analysis here is based on a different (unequvalised)
measure of spending and drops households with very low average food spending of less than £5 per week.
Those who are asked to report random weight purchases spend 12% less than LCF households whilst
those who are not asked to do so have a raw spending difference of less than 5%. As above, this suggests
that reducing respondent burden increases expenditures in scanner data.

Adjusting for demographic differences between the surveys, however, gives very different results. The
coefficient on the Kantar dummy across all households almost doubles, suggesting a conditional
expenditure gap of more than 18%. This is consistent with Leicester and Oldfield (2009) who found the
gap between Kantar and LCF spending in 2005 rose from 20% to 25% once observable demographics
were taken into account. They also concluded that controlling for demographics made little difference to
overall spending patterns, suggesting that the effects are similar for each commodity group. From our
results, it is notable that once we adjust for demographics, there is no difference at all in the Kantar
dummy amongst the groups asked or not asked to report random weight items. This suggests that much of
the seeming improvement in reported spending is attributable to demographics.

To investigate the impact of demographics further, we repeat the above analysis, but now interact
common observable demographics across the surveys with a Kantar dummy. The coefficients on these
interactions tell us which household groups report relatively higher spending in the Kantar data than the
LCF.26 Table 4.7 shows the main significant interaction terms. The base group is households in the South
East of England, with incomes between £10,000 and £20,000 per year, with one car and a home computer,
where the head is a male aged 45-49 and full-time employed, where there is one adult male and female
but no children or anyone aged over 65. For this group, average spending is 9% lower per week in the
Kantar data than the LCF. The coefficients in Table 4.7 show the additional difference in the Kantar/LCF
gap for other demographic groups; significantly positive figures suggest that households who differ from
the base group only in terms of that characteristic report relatively higher expenditures in the Kantar
data. Demographic variables which had no significant effects on the interaction terms are not shown.27

A striking finding is that lower income households report relatively higher spending in the Kantar data
whilst higher income households report relatively lower spending. If we take LCF spending levels as ‘true’
(though in general we should be wary of doing so) this result is consistent with poorer households fully
reporting their spending in the scanner data, and richer households being more prone to under-reporting.
This might reflect the higher opportunity costs of time faced by high income participants. It could also
simply reflect poorer households buying less overall and thus requiring less time and effort to scan their

26
   This follows the approach of Zhen et al (2009), equation 1, and Leicester and Oldfield (2009), Table 9. Zhen et al note that in
their results, “[the] coefficient on the Homescan indicator variable (H) provides a measure of the average difference in reported
expenditures between Homescan and CES for the reference group. Interestingly, this coefficient is not statistically significant for
any of the five [commodities]. These results suggest that much of the differences in mean expenditures [between Homescan and
CES] are correlated with the observed household characteristics.” (p.479). However this interpretation is not quite right – as they
say, the insignificant Homescan dummy tells us that there is no difference between CES and Homescan for the reference group (in
their study, households under 25 with income under $5,000 of ‘other race’ living in the North East in 2002 and so on). To compare
Homescan and CES for other groups requires a test of the joint significance of the Homescan coefficient and the interaction
between Homescan and the other group dummy variable.

might also expect to be related to the opportunity costs of time.28

Source: Author’s calculations based on 2009 LCF and Kantar Worldpanel data. Notes: Left-hand side variable is the log
of total weekly household average food and drink expenditure (unequivalised). Other variables controlled for are
region, numbers of children aged 5-10 and 11-17, head of household employment status, numbers of cars and
presence of a PC in the household. *** = p<0.01; ** = p<0.05; * = p<0.1. Households with missing information on
number of cars or employment status are dropped, as are those spending less than £5 (equivalised) per week on
average in either survey.


Household composition also matters. Households with young children report relatively lower
expenditures than those without – again, this seems plausibly related to time constraints. The coefficients
on the interaction terms for older children are negative but insignificant. The number of adults also affects
relative Kantar expenditures, though in different ways according to gender. For example, having three or
more male adults in the household is associated with much lower relative reported spending but there is
no similar effect for three or more female adults. In general, we would tend to expect that households with
multiple shoppers would report relatively low spending in the scanner data compared to the LCF to the
extent that spending is better reported by the main shopper than other adults; however the evidence for
this based on these figures is quite weak.29

Age effects are interesting: there is some (albeit not particularly significant) evidence that relative
spending is higher for households headed by younger people and lower for those headed by older people.
This might be interpreted as a modal effect – for example, older households may find using the scanner

28
   Recall too that these estimates are based on the subset of Kantar households who report for the whole year without large
spending gaps. If time costs are important then richer or full-time employed households might be less likely to be part of this
sample – though as we saw earlier (and detailed in Appendix A) there is no significant effect of income or employment status on
being part of this selected sample.
29
   Leicester and Oldfield (2009) perform a similar exercise using 2005 data from Kantar and the LCF; they find no evidence of
household composition effects on relative expenditures. Unlike our estimates, they find that unemployed households report
relatively more spending, but this may proxy for income which was not observed in their estimates.

                                                               26
technology more difficult than younger households. However, it is worth noting two things that go against
this conclusion. First, these results are based on the sample of Kantar households who report spending
consistently – presumably households who cannot use the technology will not be included. Second, the
regression also includes a variable for the number of people aged 65 or over in the household (which is
the UK retirement age for males). Discussion with Kantar suggests that they believe older households to
be relatively more diligent recorders of their spending, perhaps because they have more time.

A brief comparison to the results of a similar exercise in Zhen et al (2009) is worthwhile. They compare
AC Nielsen and CE commodity-level expenditures, regressing spending on demographic variables
interacted with a Nielsen dummy. They find a number of demographic effects on relative expenditures
which are different to the findings here: for instance, they find no significant effect of the number of
children, a negative impact of households with female heads, significant regional effects and generally
positive effects for older ages. Other findings are more comparable: for example, lower relative spending
for high income households and no clear employment status effects. What this suggests is a point raised in
Section 3: findings from one particular comparison of scanner and other datasets do not necessarily
translate across countries or surveys. If there were clear ‘modal’ effects of scanner technology we might
expect the results to be quite similar across countries; instead, it seems that the particular features of each
dataset might be most crucial in driving findings in different countries. Of course, the comparison we
make here is not identical to that made in Zhen et al (2009) in terms of the covariates for which we can
control or the selection of households, for example. One area for future work might be to explore cross
country comparisons of scanner and budget survey data using, as far as possible, identical methods.
Regularities which emerge from this exercise might be more credibly assigned to modal effects.
The relationship between total food expenditures and expenditure patterns
The results so far in this section have indicated that, on average, food spending levels in scanner data are
lower than those in budget survey data, but that spending patterns are very similar, certainly once we
strip out alcohol purchases. There may be two explanations for this. First, the Kantar and LCF surveys
could be sampling similar types of households but those in the scanner data are under-recording their
spending on each broad commodity group at roughly the same rate on average. Alternatively, the Kantar
data could be sampling lower-spending households on average, but food spending patterns vary relatively
little with total food expenditures.

To explore this latter possibility, on approach is to estimate Engel curves for each food group in the two
datasets. Engel curves relate the share of total food expenditure devoted to each food commodity to the
log of total food spending. For the purposes of how scanner data may be useful for statistical agencies, as
discussed earlier (and detailed in Section 5), one option may be to use detailed expenditures from scanner
data to impute spending patterns into budget survey data if all we knew were total spending – which is
precisely this Engel relationship. Therefore a key issue is whether or not the Kantar and LCF surveys give
a similar impression as to how food expenditures break down as the total food budget increases. If so, we
might be more confident in make this kind of imputation. If not, it may shed more light on where
particular problems in measuring expenditures arise.

This exercise is carried out in Leicester (2012) – see in particular Appendix C. He imposes no particular
restriction on the shape of the Engel curves, but finds them to be approximately linear for most food
groups. Most importantly, he concludes that the relationship between food expenditures and commodity-
level budget shares is very similar across datasets. The slopes of the Engel curves – where they have any
slope at all – are the same. Necessities within the food budget (goods with downward sloping Engel
curves) are bread and dairy products. Luxuries (with upward sloping curves) are meat, fish and fruit. For
fats, vegetables, confectionery, other food and beverages, the Engel curves are broadly flat. Perhaps the
biggest divergence in the Engel relationship between datasets is for other food, which shows some

evidence of being a luxury in the LCF but where the budget share is essentially flat in total spending in the
Kantar data. However there are certainly no clear cases where one dataset suggests a commodity to be a
luxury and the other dataset a necessity. These findings are quite reassuring that the scanner and budget
survey datasets tell similar stories about how spending patterns change with total food outlays.


     5. Using detailed scanner data to predict budget shares
        from aggregate spending
Our analysis so far has focused on how scanner data compare to spending information from aggregate
data and other expenditure surveys. These sorts of comparisons are useful as a source of validation for
budget survey data and to inform statistical agencies of possible issues in using scanner methods as part
of the data collection process.

We now assess the potential for using scanner data to impute detailed expenditures given only knowledge
of total spending. A redesigned CE could decide to reduce respondent burden by asking people only about
their total expenditures (or total category-level expenditures such as food spending), and then use
detailed expenditure records to estimate how this breaks down. These records could come from a subset
of households who agree to provide a more detailed account of their expenditures (whether using
scanners, till receipts, diaries or whatever), or from external datasets like commercial scanner data. This
section aims to provide evidence on how successful such an approach might be. We use scanner data to
predict household-level budget shares for each commodity as a function of total expenditure and
observable demographics. How well these predictions compare to actual budget shares gives a sense of
how well observable demographics predict expenditure patterns, and thus how successful such an
imputation approach might be. One advantage of using scanner data for this exercise is that we have
detailed information on where people shop. This is useful as spending patterns appear to vary by store, so
performing this exercise separately for different store types may improve the results.

We take an agnostic view on how the information on total expenditures is obtained. One approach would
be a series of questions which first ask about how much households typically spend in total over a given
period and then how this breaks down into broad commodity aggregates like food, clothing, leisure and so
on. Further questions could be asked about the proportion of food spending in different store types, such
as supermarkets, corner shops and specialist food stores. Another approach would be to use individual
bank records and credit card statements to get total store-specific expenditures. This becomes more
feasible as cash spending, which cannot be attributed to a particular store, declines in importance.30

We base our analysis on the ‘regular reporter’ sample in the 2009 Kantar data (see Section 4.2), restricting
attention to households who record random weight purchases. We exclude fourteen households from this
sample who have missing demographic information on cars or employment status to give a sample size of
9,494 households. We focus attention on food and non-alcoholic beverages, and use the CPI commodity
categories which have formed the basis of our analysis so far to define the patterns of expenditure we
wish to impute. This gives 11 categories in total.

We look at expenditures in eight different types of store. UK food retailing is dominated by the ‘big four’
supermarkets – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury and Morrisons (together accounting for almost 80% of




30
  Figures from the UK Payments Council (2010, 2011), for example, suggest that about 68% of retail purchases by value were on
credit and debit cards in the second quarter of 2011, compared to about 61% in 2008.

                                                              28
expenditure in our data) – and we look at each of these stores separately.31 Other supermarket chains are
grouped according to quality segment: discount supermarkets (Aldi, Lidl, Netto, Cash and Carry stores),
quality supermarkets (Waitrose, Marks & Spencer) and other supermarkets (Co-op, Somerfield, Iceland,
other chains). Remaining stores are then grouped together into a single category for local and high street
expenditures – largely shopping in specialist food retailers (butcher shops, delicatessens and so on) and
corner shops. These account for a low share of spending, suggesting there is little to be gained from
disaggregating them still further. Table 5.1 shows the eight store types considered and their market
shares by expenditure. Figure 5.1 shows how total food and drink expenditure breaks down for each store
across the 11 commodities we consider.32

There are some differences in expenditure patterns across stores. Notably, in discount supermarkets, soft
drinks and confectionery account for a larger share of spending than across all stores, whilst dairy and
meat products account for smaller shares. In quality supermarkets, fruit, vegetables, meat and fish
account for a larger share and dairy, confectionery and soft drinks account for lower shares. The most

   Spending in the big four supermarkets includes spending in all formats of stores (e.g. Tesco Extra, Tesco Express). Online
expenditures are allocated to the appropriate store.

   These estimates are based on the full 2009 Kantar sample, rather than the selected ‘good reporter’ sample.

                                                                                                             29
striking differences are in local stores – for example, across all stores confectionery accounts for about
6.5% of expenditure but in local stores the share is 16.7%. This probably reflects the different sorts of
shopping done in local stores which are more associated with top-up and impulse purchases.

If households systematically under-report different types of expenditure in scanner data, imputed budget
shares would be biased. A useful check would be to compare expenditure patterns at the store level
obtained from store data to those seen in the in-home scanner data. The former would presumably be
complete, accurate records of store-specific sales patterns. We do not have access to such data and are not
aware of any comparisons having been made of this nature. It would, though, be a useful line of inquiry for
statistical agencies thinking of using in-home scanner data.

Using the Kantar sample, we calculate total annual household-level spending during 2009 across each of
the store types defined above, broken down by the 11 CPI food and drink commodities. This gives us
household-store specific budget shares. Weighting these by the share of each household’s spending in
each store type gives the household’s overall observed budget share for each commodity. We then use
seemingly-unrelated OLS regression methods to estimate a system of equations for store-specific budget
shares for each commodity:
                                                  ln
where        is the budget share of household i in store j for commodity k,                 is the total spend of household
i in store j, and is a vector of observable demographic household characteristics.33 The system is run
separately for each store type, allowing for store-specific Engel curves and for demographic effects to vary
across store types. From the equation we predict the expected budget share        . To ensure the predicted
budget shares add up to 1, we estimate the results for 10 of the 11 commodities, excluding ‘other food’, for
which the predicted budget share is estimated as a residual. These predicted shares are then weighted
into an overall predicted household-specific budget share for each commodity using the household-store
specific expenditure weights.

Detailed regression results for each store type are available on request. As a summary of the predictive
power of these regressions, Table 5.2 reports the R2 estimates by store and commodity (the number of
observations varies because the equations are estimated only for households with positive expenditures
in each store during the year). The key conclusion is that observable characteristics, including total store
expenditures, have little predictive power for store-specific commodity budget shares. This implies that
there is a large amount of unobserved heterogeneity in within-store spending patterns. Of course, our
estimates here are somewhat constrained by the limited set of demographic variables available in the
Kantar data, though our covariates include most of the usual explanatory variables such as age, household
composition and income that would feature in demand models.




33
  The model includes gross household income, region, household composition (numbers of adult males, females, children in
different age groups and people aged 65+), the age band and sex of the household head, the employment status of the household
head, the number of cars and whether or not there is a home computer. Because we use annual expenditures we do not include any
seasonal controls. We experimented with various specifications, including adding a squared term on total expenditure to allow
store-specific Engel curves to be non-linear, but found this not to be important. We also experimented with including the share of
total food spending by household i in store j as a right-hand side covariate, the idea being to capture variations in budget shares
amongst households who rely on a particular store type for most of their shopping against those who use the store more as a top
up or secondary store. We found this had little additional explanatory power for the model but led to a substantial rise in the
number of predicted budget shares which were negative. Similarly, conditioning the regression estimates on households who spent
more than some minimum amount in each store type made the predicted number of negative budget shares much larger,
presumably because the model did not perform well out of sample for those with low total store expenditures.

 Appendix B shows the distribution of actual and predicted household-level budget shares resulting from
 this modelling exercise. Broadly, this approach captures the average shares quite well but not the
 distribution: the modelled shares lie over a much narrower range than is observed in the data.

 One way in which we might be able to capture some of this unobserved heterogeneity is to use the
 variance of the error terms from the model to predict a (mean-zero) vector of random ‘noise’ for each
 store-specific budget share which is then added to the predicted share. We could also use more
 sophisticated imputation and econometric methods to predict the budget shares. For example, a particular
 problem with the OLS approach is that households do not buy from each commodity group at each store
 type they visit. This is particularly problematic once we condition on store type: for example, more than
 half of households who ever use local stores buy no meat, fish, fats or hot beverages at all, even over a
 year. Even within the big four supermarkets, more than 30% of shoppers never buy from the hot beverage
 category, more than 25% buy no fish and more than 20% no fats. This problem might suggest running a
 system of Tobit equations for each store to help better model the zero shares. This would also mean
 predicted shares could not be negative: in our estimates, around 16% of households are predicted to have
 at least one negative budget share (these households are dropped from the results in Appendix B).
 However, the main intention of this exercise is to assess the extent to which observable covariates are able
 to explain variation in within-store spending patterns, for which these simple OLS estimates provide
 initial evidence. If this approach were taken further by statistical agencies then more attention should be
 paid to the precise econometric methods used.

 The findings in this section suggest that attempts to use detailed store-level expenditure patterns to
 impute household-specific budget shares if we observe only total spending may not be particularly
 successful. There is a large amount of unobserved heterogeneity in store-specific expenditure patterns
 not captured by the usual demographic covariates commonly featured in models of household spending.
 We may be able to do a reasonable job of predicting average budget shares but would be unlikely to
 replicate the distribution of actual budget shares, though of course more sophisticated econometrics may
 get us further towards that goal. Whilst from the perspective of estimating CPI budget shares getting the
 average right is the key objective, from a research perspective having accurate household-specific budget
 shares is vital (for example, in demand modelling and accurately estimating household responsiveness to
 price shocks, or in estimating the distributional consequences of policies, or how inflation rates vary
 across households). A consumer budget survey that relied heavily on imputed expenditure patterns might
 therefore be very undesirable. At the very least it would seem important to have a large enough subset of
 respondents provide detailed expenditure data without imputation, even if imputation were used to ‘fill
 in’ the spending patterns for households unable or unwilling to provide more than broad aggregates.

    6. Summary and conclusions
In-home scanner data offer a hugely exciting opportunity for researchers to explore detailed questions
about household expenditure behaviour and firm pricing decisions. Scanner datasets and scanners as a
method of data collection are also potentially of interest for statistical agencies in terms of how they might
inform, or be integrated into, budget survey data. Existing scanner data typically only cover a relatively
narrow subset of total expenditures. Nevertheless, in terms of the potential for using existing commercial
scanner datasets, organisations like the ONS or BLS may see three key opportunities:

    1.   Comparison and validation – do expenditures reported in scanner data tell a different story to
         those reported in budget survey data, and what can we learn from a more micro analysis of
         differences in spending across households?
    2.   Detail – having full knowledge of precisely what is bought helps inform the choice of
         representative items for inflation measurement, the weights that should be given to these items at
         the lowest level of disaggregation in inflation calculations, the importance of product turnover
         (particularly in dynamic sectors like grocery retail) and so on.
    3.   Duration – scanner data report spending over a long time period whereas budget surveys collect
         detailed spending only for a short duration. The scanner data can therefore give insight into
         whether short observation periods are appropriate even for non-durable commodities like food
         and whether the distribution of spending patterns across households is well measured.

However, crucial for any use of scanner data is an understanding of data quality. Researchers and data
collectors have, over a long period, developed a good knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of
budget survey data. Scanner data are more novel. The evidence in this paper and the previous literature
point to some consistent differences between scanner data and budget survey data collected via diaries –
in particular, that expenditures are lower in scanner data, that expenditures appear to be particularly low
for certain commodity groups like alcohol and soft drinks, that it matters whether or not participants have
to record non-barcoded products, and that there are differences in the relative under-reporting across
household groups (in particular relating to income and numbers of children, which plausibly reflect time
constraints). These differences point to modal effects. However, in some cases, differences between
scanner and budget survey expenditures which might in isolation be attributed to survey mode may, in
fact, be specific to the particular datasets studied. This implies that researchers and data collectors would
need to be aware of the features and methods of the particular scanner data they are using in order to
assess its likely benefits. Detailed cross-country comparisons of scanner and budget survey data which, as
far as possible, apply common methods would be a useful way to tease out modal effects. Collaboration
between national statistical agencies and researchers in different countries to share knowledge and carry
out such research would be desirable. For example, statistical agencies have access to much more
disaggregate information about households and shopping trips from the budget survey than are made
available to external researchers. This information could give more detailed insight into the differences
between diary-based and scanner expenditures, and so should be made available for this kind of analysis.
Another possibility would be for statistical agencies and commercial data collectors to collaborate
directly. For example, to address issues around sample representativeness in scanner surveys, agencies
could supply a household sample drawn at random from the population and ask the data collectors to try
and incorporate them into the sample, seeing who refuses, who drops out quickly, who appears to co-
operate effectively and so on. In some countries, notably Nordic ones, detailed population-level data
linked to identification records is maintained which would allow for detailed analysis of these sorts of
issues to be carried out.

Our comparisons between scanner data and budget survey data point to a number of key conclusions.
Most notably, scanner data are prone to large numbers of weeks in which no purchases at all are recorded,

                                                     32
even by ostensibly active households. We do not have a clear understanding of what drives this, but these
zeroes explain a large part of the raw gap between scanner and budget survey expenditures. However,
even when we restrict ourselves to a sample of households who are faithful reporters, and eliminate zero
spending weeks altogether, a large expenditure gap remains. Evidence from British data suggests that this
gap is not accounted for by observable demographic differences between samples. More reassuringly,
patterns of spending across surveys are similar even though the levels are different, and re-weighting the
food CPI using survey-specific budget shares has very little impact on inflation rates. The relationship
between total expenditures and commodity-level budget shares is also very similar across surveys.

We find compelling evidence that asking households to record detailed expenditures over a short horizon
leads to an inaccurate picture of the distribution of commodity-level budget shares, but not average
spending patterns. The two week duration of budget diaries both in the LCF and the CE is probably not
long enough to get a good measure of true food consumption patterns, generating too much variability in
the distribution of budget shares and too many zero expenditures for particular commodities.

We also consider the possibility that scanner data may be useful to ‘drill down’ into aggregate store-level
expenditures and impute commodity-specific expenditures. We find substantial differences in expenditure
patterns across store types which supports breaking down spending by store rather than imputing based
on total spending in all stores. However, we find very little relationship between expenditure patterns and
observable covariates. Thus whilst an imputation approach might get the averages broadly right, the
distribution of imputed budget shares is much less dispersed than the distribution of observed budget
shares. More sophisticated imputation or econometric methods may help, and we could also be hamstrung
in this analysis by the relatively limited set of demographic information in the scanner data. In general,
though, it would not appear to be sensible to rely too heavily on imputation methods to obtain detailed
measures of spending.

As mentioned in the introduction, rather than relying on existing commercial scanner data, agencies like
the BLS or ONS might be interested in the idea of establishing their own panel of households using
scanner methods to record their spending on an ongoing basis. If this were integrated with the budget
survey, there would be clear benefits in terms of immediately stripping out demographic differences as a
source of variation between scanner and other expenditure data, and in ensuring that the scanner sample
were collected using proper random sampling methods. It would also allow, for the first time, detailed
scanner data for particular commodities to be linked to more general expenditure patterns. Existing
scanner datasets are limited in coverage to food at home and a small number of non-food purchases.
Knowing how much households spent on food out as well as other expenditure categories would be
extremely beneficial, as would any other links that could be made between the detailed information in
scanner data and wider household characteristics relating to health, dwelling characteristics, durable
ownership and so on. A new dataset collected by a statistical agency would also enable experimental
analysis of the impact of survey mode, different scanner devices, different reporting requirements (e.g.
non-barcoded items), different incentives for participation, and so on. By providing ‘gold standard’
evidence of these issues using randomised trials, this would be extremely valuable not just for the
agencies themselves but also for researchers into survey design and data users.

We end by offering some thoughts, based on this paper and previous studies, on other ways in which new
scanner data could improve on existing commercial datasets. Firstly, one of the major limitations of the
Kantar Worldpanel relative to the LCF (and other datasets collected by statistical agencies and used
frequently by researchers) is the relatively poor demographic information. Scanner data are collected for
commercial marketing and market research purposes. The main clients are retailers and grocery
manufacturers who may need only relatively basic demographic profiles of the households in the sample.


                                                    33
Whilst the data follow the same households over time, one of the key findings from previous analysis of
the Kantar data is that important demographic transitions such as changes in employment status are not
well recorded. This may not be true of scanner datasets in general, but we are not aware of research which
has looked at this question for other data. Improperly recorded transitions hugely restrict the usefulness
of the panel nature of the data (for example, in analysing how detailed food spending behaviour changes
around retirement or in response to unexpected income shocks). New scanner data collected by statistical
agencies could presumably obtain much more detailed demographic information about household
members to match the kinds of data familiar in budget surveys, and ideally would also take more care to
ensure changes in demographics were captured if the same households were followed for an extended
period. This should extend not only to knowing whether a transition occurred but also when.

Secondly, a key unresolved problem with scanner data is to be the high prevalence of weeks in which no
expenditures are reported. This does not match up to budget survey data. Understanding this better
would be a key contribution of a new scanner dataset. For example, if no expenditures are recorded over a
week or a fortnight, households could be prompted with some form of contact from the statistical agency
to see what has driven this and then code this into the data. This would allow the agency and researchers
to distinguish genuine zeroes – holidays, weeks in which households simply used stocks of food or ate out
and so on – from non-genuine ones where trips were made but not reported for whatever reason. Indeed
it might be possible in this latter case to get retrospective information (from till receipts or recall
questions) or to impute missing trips altogether.

Thirdly, it seems important that any scanner data aims to be, as far as possible, a complete record of the
shopping trip. Most existing panels now require only a subset of respondents to report non-barcoded
purchases. In the Kantar data, this was justified by better reporting compliance for non-barcoded items.
However, our analysis suggests that this result is at least partly driven by demographic differences
between those who do and do not report non-barcoded purchases. It may also be differences in the type of
scanner device, rather than the lack of random weight reporting which gives this result. Our preference
would be that households were asked to record random weight purchases as well since not doing so risks
substantial bias in estimating consumption of certain commodities, particularly fruit and vegetables. The
aim should be to minimise the additional burden imposed by this requirement. One problem for
commercial scanner data is the need to include very detailed product characteristics which needed to be
manually input by respondents for random weight items (e.g. the country of origin of different fruits,
whether organic, the weight purchased). To the extent that such details are not needed by statistical
agencies they could be dispensed with altogether, or taken where available from till receipts, or imputed.
If recording random weight items simply required scanning a barcode from a generic booklet or tapping
an icon on the barcode reader itself then it may be little more onerous than recording barcoded products.

Finally, we would certainly advocate that any new scanner data made use of till receipts as well as the in-
home scanner. Studies of Nielsen data highlighted the problems of relying on imputed prices obtained
from centralised store-level databases given the growth of personalised pricing through vouchers and
loyalty cards, as well as store-specific special offers. Participants should be encouraged to send in receipts,
and it may be that technology could enable this to be done digitally (scanned receipts or optical character
recognition devices attached to computers) to integrate it with the data collection process more closely.
