                                         ABSTRACT

We review what is known about the economic efficiency of fuel taxes relative to efficiency
standards aimed at mitigating environmental externalities from automobiles. We present a
simplified model of car choice that allows us to emphasize the relationships between fuel
economy, other car attributes, and miles traveled. We focus on greenhouse gas emissions,
although we note how other environmental externalities affect our conclusions. Our main
conclusion—that standards are substantially less efficient than a fuel tax—is already familiar.
Less familiar are points we make about the relative importance of the rebound effect, on the
effects of attribute-based policies, and the implications of behavioral biases. We point to areas
where we believe future research can have the greatest contribution, including work on
uncertainty, heterogeneity, and empirical work in low and middle-income countries.

1    Introduction
Few policy challenges loom larger than climate change. Given the high stakes, policies designed
to mitigate carbon emissions should be both effective and efficient. Economists generally advocate
the use of carbon pricing for achieving efficient mitigation. Yet command-and-control regulations
proliferate. Can such regulations mimic the incentives of carbon pricing? If not, what are the costs
of inefficient regulations?
    In this review, we attempt to answer these questions for the transportation sector. Trans-
portation is an important piece of the climate change puzzle, accounting for about 13% of global
greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, there is a pronounced relationship between vehicle ownership
and wealth both over time and across countries, suggesting that this sector will become more im-
portant as low and middle-income countries grow. China—the prime example—boasted 22 million
cars sold in 2013 and has been the world’s largest car market since 2009. Are car fleets and carbon
emissions destined to grow in lock-step with economic growth?
    Even absent an economy-wide carbon tax, an efficient Pigouvian tax for transportation emissions
is available in the form of a tax on fuel. Are existing fuel taxes already inducing the efficient level
of mitigation? While fuel taxes are high in many countries, typical policies remain far from the
chalkboard ideal. The United States has the lowest fuel taxes among industrialized countries (Parry
and Small 2005), and many oil-producing countries actually subsidize the price of fuel, presumably
for political reasons (Parry, Veung, and Heine 2014; Davis 2014). Meanwhile, the European Union
explicitly exempted the transportation sector from its carbon pricing scheme. Moreover, despite
decades of research pointing to the superiority of fuel taxes, fuel-economy standards predominate
as the main environmental policy in the car market. Some countries, such as the United States and
Japan, have long-standing regulatory regimes, but similar policies have recently been adopted by
the European Union, China, India, and others.
    Our aim is to understand how these apparently entrenched regulations compare to a fuel tax in
terms of the incentives they create and the behaviors they induce. We first consider a traditional
fuel-economy standard, which requires manufacturers to sell vehicles that have a minimum average
fuel economy. We compare this standard to a feebate, which explicitly taxes or subsidizes vehicles
according to their fuel economy, as well as to attribute-based standards that provide a sliding
fuel-economy target based on a car’s size or weight.
    We focus on economic efficiency, though we note where equity concerns are most likely to alter
any findings. In addition, we focus on carbon emissions, but we discuss how our conclusions are
affected by considering local pollution, congestion, and safety externalities—in brief, our conclusions
are reinforced. We concentrate on the literature related to the United States, but we make attempts
to point to recent work in other countries. The relative efficiency of fuel-economy standards versus
a fuel tax is well-trod ground and addressed in several recent reviews (see Anderson, Parry, Sallee,
and Fischer 2011, Proost and Van Dender 2011, and Gillingham 2013). Thus, we do not attempt to
provide a comprehensive review of this literature. Instead, we focus on the most recent findings and
issues and, with an eye to future research, we attempt to identify the most important unanswered

                                                  2
questions.
   Our main conclusions can be summarized as follows:

  1. No regulatory alternative achieves the efficiency of a fuel tax.

  2. Theory and empirics around the rebound effect have often been mismatched. It is critical to
     understand the interaction between vehicle quality and miles traveled in determining which
     empirical estimates are relevant for a particular policy analysis.

  3. Biases in consumer choice are unlikely to be strong enough to overturn the traditional wisdom
     that a fuel tax is more efficient than standards.

  4. In practice, attribute-based standards function as technology-forcing policies by limiting other
     compliance options, thereby raising mitigation costs.

  5. Attribute-based standards are poorly suited for addressing behavioral biases, since they pre-
     serve existing tradeoffs between fuel economy and other car attributes.

   In our view, despite the substantial volume of research on these topics, a number of important
questions remain, including the following:

  1. The world’s largest car markets all feature attribute-based standards, but this topic has
     received little attention in the academic literature.

  2. A priority for future research should be to work on rapidly growing car markets, where both
     the car market and government regulation are inchoate.

  3. As compared to traditional standards, both attribute-based standards and feebates have the
     potential to stabilize regulatory incentives in the context of volatile fuel prices. Research
     quantifying the importance of this feature would be useful.

  4. Even if biases in consumer choice are small on average, they could nevertheless be quite large
     for some consumers. Too little is known about the effects of fuel-economy labels, information
     programs, and nudges on vehicle choice in this context.

  5. Much of the most credible empirical work estimates short-run effects, whereas long-run effects
     are relevant for policy. Innovative research designs that identify longer-run impacts and
     technological tradeoffs would make important contributions.

  6. The gap between on-road fuel economy and laboratory tests needs to be better understood,
     and the implications of gaming for policy design should be explored.

  7. Research aimed at understanding the political economy of fuel taxation might help identify
     scenarios in which such policies would be more politically palatable.




                                                 3
    The paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we lay out a simplified model of the car
market, which depicts a representative consumer making choices over vehicle fuel economy, other
vehicle attributes, and vehicle miles traveled. In section 3, using our theory as a guide, we describe
the incentives created by a fuel tax, which we then contrast with the incentives created by other
policies, including fuel-economy standards, feebates, and attribute-based standards. Section 4 in-
cludes a series of subsections that detail auxiliary issues, including the role of behavioral biases,
heterogeneity, supply-side distortions, gaming of emissions ratings, safety externalities, other en-
vironmental externalities, technological spillovers, and biofuels policies. We discuss findings from
both the theoretical and empirical literature throughout our review. Section 5 concludes.


2     Theoretical framework
This section lays out a stylized model of the automobile sector. It is useful in describing the key
distortions and margins of choice that constitute the objects of inquiry for the literature. We use
it as a guide to constructing our review.

2.1    Consumer welfare
We assume that the representative consumer has utility that is quasilinear in transportation services
and other goods, valued in dollars, such that welfare is also valued in dollars and is given by the
following expression:

                        W (n, x, v, g) = µ(n)θ(x)u(v) + y − nc(x, g) − n[p + d]gv,                           (1)

where: x is a vector of average car attributes (e.g., size and horsepower); v is the average number
of miles that each car travels; g is average per-mile fuel consumption; n is the total number of cars
(on a per-capita basis); y is the representative consumer’s exogenous income; p is the per-gallon
private marginal cost of fuel; and d is the per-gallon marginal social damage from fuel consumption.
Note that our quasi-linear utility specification rules out income effects.
    The expression µ(n)θ(x)u(v) is transportation services generated through the total number
of cars, their average attributes (all defined as “goods” that increase utility), and their average
utilization, where µ0 (·), θ0 (·), u0 (·) > 0 and µ00 (·), θ00 (·), u00 (·) ≤ 0. We interpret µ(n)θ(x)u(v) as the
quality-adjusted utility derived from driving, scaled by a function of market size. Our simplified
specification of utility implies that every mile driven in a high-quality car is more enjoyable than
in a low-quality car, while the value of quality is greater if the car is to be driven more often.
    The expression nc(x, g) is total costs for n cars with average attributes x and fuel consumption g,
with partial derivatives given by cx > 0, cxx ≥ 0, cg < 0, cgg ≤ 0, and cxg ≤ 0. That is, per-car costs
are increasing and concave in attributes, decreasing and concave in per-mile fuel consumption, and
the marginal cost of attributes is lower for cars with higher per-mile fuel consumption. Meanwhile,
the expression n(p + d)gv is total private expenditures on fuel (npgv) plus total external damages


                                                       4
from fuel consumption (ndgv).
   The necessary conditions that characterize welfare maximization are as follows:

                           ∂W
                                 = −ncg (x, g) − n[p + d]v = 0                                           (2)
                           ∂g
                           ∂W
                                 = µ(n)θ0 (x)u(v) − ncx (x, g) = 0                                       (3)
                           ∂x
                           ∂W
                                 = µ(n)θ(x)u0 (v) − n[p + d]g = 0                                        (4)
                           ∂v
                           ∂W
                                 = µ0 (n)θ(x)u(v) − c(x, g) − [p + d]gv = 0.                             (5)
                           ∂n

Expression (2) says that the marginal cost of a decrease in per-mile fuel consumption should be set
equal to the marginal social cost of the implied fuel savings (i.e., including both private expenditures
on fuel and external damages from greenhouse gas emissions). Expression (3) says that the marginal
utility of better car attributes (e.g., size) should be set equal to the marginal impact on the car’s
up-front purchase cost. Expression (4) says that the marginal utility of a mile should be set equal to
the per-mile marginal social cost of fuel consumption. Finally, expression (5) says that the marginal
utility of a car equals the marginal cost, inclusive of the up-front purchase cost, as well as the social
cost of the car’s fuel consumption. Denote the solution to these conditions by (n∗ , x∗ , v ∗ , g ∗ ).
   Much of the theoretical and empirical literature fails to model fuel economy (g), car attributes
(x), miles (v), and market size (n) jointly. As we will show below, however, interactions among
these different margins of choice can be quite important for predicting the impacts of policies and
for interpreting empirical results in the literature.

2.2    Externalities and internalities
Consumer choices will potentially deviate from the welfare-maximizing conditions above for two
reasons. First, consumers will ignore external costs when choosing their privately optimal level of
fuel consumption, which depends both on fuel consumption per mile and on utilization. Second,
consumers may fail even to make privately optimal decisions if they mis-perceive or mis-calculate
the costs of future fuel expenditures at the time they initially purchase their cars. In the presence of
these market imperfections—the fuel consumption externality, and the fuel economy “internality”
(see Allcott, Mullainathan, and Taubinsky 2014 and Allcott and Sunstein 2015)—corrective policies
will be necessary to restore economic efficiency.
   Let β > 0 be the share of future fuel consumption that consumers perceive at the time they
purchase their car. A value of β = 1 implies that the consumer properly values a dollar of future
fuel savings at exactly $1, while a value of β < 1 implies that the consumer undervalues such
savings. We assume that this “undervaluation factor” infects all decisions involving a comparison
of current costs and benefits against future fuel savings, including both the number of cars to buy
and the fuel economy of those cars. In contrast, we assume that consumers properly value the costs
and benefits of miles driven, conditional on fuel economy, and that they properly weigh the benefits


                                                     5
of vehicle quality against up-front purchase costs.

2.3   Policy options
Following the literature, we consider the effects of fuel taxes, fuel-economy standards, and attribute-
based standards—as well as a tax on cars—that could apply individually or simultaneously to affect
behavior along various dimensions of consumer choice:

   • A fuel tax imposes a per-gallon tax on fuel consumption. Let τf be this tax, such that the
      total tax paid is τf ngv.

   • A traditional fuel-economy standard imposes a maximum per-mile fuel consumption
      rate. When binding, the standard acts as an implicit, revenue-neutral tax on per-mile fuel
      consumption. Accordingly, let τg be this implicit tax rate and let σ > 0 be the binding
      standard, such that the revenue-neutral tax imposed is τg [g − σ]n.

   • An attribute-based fuel-economy standard replaces the fixed standard above with one
      that depends on car attributes. Let this standard be given by σ(x) > 0, such that the
      revenue-neutral tax imposed is now τg [g − σ(x)]n.

   • A car tax. Let τn be this per-car tax, such that the total tax paid is τn n.

These taxes (or subsidies, in the case of a negative tax) create policy incentives or “wedges” that
modify consumer behavior, as described immediately below.

2.4   Consumer behavior
In this section, we derive conditions that characterize consumer behavior in the presence of the above
policies. We potentially allow for all of the policies to apply simultaneously, but note that any of
the policies could be “turned off” by setting the appropriate tax incentives to zero. Further, since
the traditional fuel-economy standard is simply a special case of the attribute-based standard (i.e.,
with σ(x) = σ), we will not separately model the traditional standard. Given these assumptions,
the necessary conditions that characterize consumer behavior in the presence of the above policies
are as follows:

                  ∂B
                       = −ncg (x, g) − βn[p + τf ]v − τg n = 0                                     (6)
                  ∂g
                  ∂B
                       = µ(n)θ0 (x)u(v) − ncx (x, g) + τg nσ 0 (x) = 0                             (7)
                  ∂x
                  ∂B
                       = µ(n)θ(x)u0 (v) − n[p + τf ]g = 0                                          (8)
                  ∂v
                  ∂B
                       = µ0 (n)θ(x)u(v) − c(x, g) − β[p + τf ]gv − τg [g − σ(x)] − τn = 0,         (9)
                  ∂n

where ∂B denotes the consumer’s perceived change in private welfare associated with marginal
changes in the respective choice variables. Note in condition (6) that β < 1 would lead a consumer

                                                     6
to under-invest in fuel economy—a point that is well-known in the literature. But note also in
condition (9) that β < 1 would lead a consumer to over-invest in cars in general. Meanwhile, note
in conditions (7) and (8) that car attributes and miles traveled are chosen optimally, conditional
on the number of cars and their average per-mile fuel consumption.1 Denote the solution to these
conditions by (ĝ, x̂, v̂, n̂).

2.5     First-best corrective policies
Comparing the welfare-maximizing conditions in (2)-(5) to the consumer behavioral conditions in
(6)-(9) implies that the first-best policy will include a fuel tax given by τf = d, i.e., a Pigouvian
tax set equal to marginal damages. In the absence of consumer undervaluation (β = 1), the fuel
tax alone is the first-best policy. However, in the presence of undervaluation (β < 1), the first-best
policy must also include a fuel-economy standard with an implicit tax rate of τg = (1 − β)(p + d)v ∗
and a uniform target of σ(x) = g ∗ , as well as a car tax given by τn = (1 − β)(p + d)g ∗ v ∗ . Note that
the standard is equivalent to a revenue-neutral tax on per-mile fuel consumption, with the tax rate
set equal to the “undervalued” savings from marginal improvements in fuel economy, while the car
tax is set equal to the “undervalued” portion of total lifetime fuel expenditures. Note that if we
replaced the revenue-neutral standard with an explicit tax on per-mile fuel consumption, then we
could reduce or even eliminate the tax on cars—but a fuel tax by itself is not sufficient to restore full
market efficiency (an “exaggerated” fuel tax equal to d/β could correct the choices of fuel economy
and cars but would over-tax the subsequent choice of miles).

2.6     Limitations of our model
While our model is useful for gaining a broad intuition for the effects of different policies, we make
a number of important simplifications. Taken literally, our model assumes a single representative
consumer (or consumer type) simultaneously choosing cars, fuel economy, attributes, and miles—
while facing a continuous car price surface (either a technological cost frontier or hedonic price
equilibrium) and an exogenous price for undifferentiated transportation fuel. We do not explicitly
model consumer heterogeneity, uncertainty in costs and benefits, the supply of transportation fuels,
consumer choice of conventional vs. low-carbon fuels, the dynamics of new car purchases and used
car scrappage, or the fact that there are a discrete number of highly differentiated car models
manufactured and sold by oligopolistic firms—potentially important details that are featured in
many of the papers we cite. Instead, we discuss these issues qualitatively as extensions to our main
model.
    1
      Some readers might wonder why we do not explicitly write out an expression for total “perceived” welfare, with
the undervaluation factor applying to total fuel expenditures, and then take derivatives, following our derivation of
the welfare-maximizing conditions above. Note that this approach would lead the undervaluation factor (β) to infect
all margins of behavior, rather than just choices for fuel economy (g) and market size (n).

3     How do alternative policies affect behavior?
We now describe the incentives created by the fuel tax and the behavioral effects it induces. We
then describe the incentives created by alternative policies and the behavioral effects they induce,
comparing these incentives and effects to those of the fuel tax.

3.1     The effects of a fuel tax
Raising the price of fuel via a fuel tax causes consumers to adjust their behavior along a host of
margins. While it is possible to work out the full, general comparative statics using our model, this
work is tedious and the result is too complex to be useful. Thus, we make a number of simplifying
assumptions so that we can show graphically the key mechanisms of consumer response. Figure 1
illustrates these responses.

Figure 1: Effects of the fuel tax on (a) fuel economy, (b) car attributes, and (c) miles traveled.
These panels correspond respectively to necessary conditions (6), (7), and (8) in the text with a
fuel tax but no other policies (i.e., τf > 0 with τg = τn = 0). The number of cars (n) is implicitly
held fixed in all three panels, while panels (a) and (b) implicitly hold miles traveled fixed, as well.
In panel (c), we assume that the long-run effect on miles is negative, which we believe to be the
                                       empirically relevant case.



3.1.1       Cars get more efficient and shrink in size

When fuel prices are higher, the benefits of fuel economy are greater. Thus, consumers will demand
greater fuel economy (lower g), shifting away from other attributes (x). Panels (a) and (b) of figure
1 illustrate the key mechanisms underlying these changes, assuming for ease of exposition that
market size (n) and miles traveled (v) are fixed and that the marginal utility of car attributes
(θ0 (x)) is constant. In panel (a), an increase in the fuel price prices shifts the marginal benefit of
fuel economy (β[p + τf ]v) upward, while the marginal cost in terms of higher vehicle price (cg (x, g))
remains fixed. Thus, optimal per-mile fuel consumption decreases (from point A to point B).
Simultaneous reductions in car attributes (x), discussed momentarily, lead the marginal cost of


                                                                 8
fuel economy to shift downward, reinforcing this effect (from point B to point C). Meanwhile, in
panel (b), the marginal cost of car attributes (cx (x, g)) increases as a result of the improved fuel
economy, while the marginal benefit ([µ(n)/n]θ0 (x)u(v)) remains constant. Thus, the optimal level
of attributes also decreases (from point A to B). Intuitively, consumers respond to higher fuel prices
both by paying more for cars with additional fuel-saving technologies, conditional on attributes,
and by choosing cars with fewer attributes, since both mechanisms save fuel.2
    We are not aware of any purely empirical papers that estimate how consumers trade off costs,
attributes, and fuel economy in the long run, after allowing for the deployment of new fuel-saving
technologies. However, many empirical papers in the literature model consumers’ choices of cars
from among the current set of model offerings. These papers invariable show that higher fuel
prices shift market shares toward smaller, more efficient cars. For example, Busse, Knittel, and
Zettelmeyer (2013) present reduced-form estimates for 1999–2008, which imply that a $1 increase
in gasoline prices leads to a 3.7% increase in new-car fuel economy.3 Meanwhile, Beresteanu and Li
(2011) present a simulation based on structural estimation of demand and supply for 1999–2006,
showing that a $1 increase in gasoline taxes would increase new-car fuel economy by 4.5% (1.01
mpg on a 22.4 mpg base).
    All of these studies, however, likely understate the long-run effects of fuel prices on fuel economy,
since they implicitly treat as fixed the observed cross-sectional relationship that exists in the new car
market between costs, attributes, and fuel economy—in the longer run, we would expect car models
to be redesigned and outfitted with new technologies to save more fuel. Thus, studies attempting
to model longer-run changes typically augment their empirical analysis with data on engineering
costs (see Austin and Dinan 2005, Whitefoot and Skerlos 2012, Jacobsen 2013a, Whitefoot, Fowlie,
and Skerlos 2013), which can be difficult for economists to validate. Thus, we view the development
new empirical methods for estimating technology-cost tradeoffs as an important avenue for future
research.

3.1.2    Consumers drive fewer miles

Conditional on car attributes (x) and fuel economy (g), increasing the price of fuel will increase
the per-mile cost of driving while leaving marginal benefits unchanged—and vehicle miles traveled
(v) will therefore fall. Meanwhile, the simultaneous reduction in per-mile fuel consumption (g)
discussed above will tend to weaken this effect, as consumers demand greater fuel economy, while
the simultaneous reduction in car attributes (x) will tend to reinforce this effect by lowering the
quality-adjusted utility from driving. Panel (c) of figure 1 illustrates these responses, assuming
   2
     In appendix A, we reframe our model such that the consumer chooses car attributes x and car technology c,
with per-mile fuel consumption g(x, c) given as a direct function of car attributes and technology. This reframed
model better highlights the technological tradeoff between per-mile fuel consumption and car attributes by showing
that—holding car technology fixed—consumers will respond to higher fuel prices by directly trading off car attributes
for improved fuel economy.

     They estimate and report changes in market shares by fuel economy quartile. We calculate the implied change
in average new-car fuel economy, based on mean fuel economy for each quartile in 2006, as reported in their online
appendix.

for ease of exposition that market size (n) is fixed and that the marginal utility of car attributes
(θ0 (x)) is constant. An increase in fuel prices shifts the per-mile marginal cost of driving ([p + τf ]g)
upward (to the dashed blue line), while the per-mile marginal benefit ([µ(n)/n]θ(x)u0 (v)) remains
fixed. Thus, miles traveled decreases (from point A to point B). Note that this partial response, in
which car attributes and fuel economy are held fixed, corresponds conceptually to the “short-run”
elasticity of miles and fuel demand with respect to changes in fuel prices, as discussed below. The
simultaneous reduction in car attributes (x) and per-mile fuel consumption (g) discussed above will,
however, lead both the per-mile marginal benefit and per-mile marginal cost of fuel consumption
to shift downward. Thus, the long-run response of miles traveled to higher fuel prices (from point
A to point C) will generally diverge from the short-run response.
   A voluminous literature estimates the short-run and long-run response of miles traveled to
changes in fuel prices, with a central tendency of around −0.15 in the short run and −0.30 in the long
run. For reviews, see Goodwin (1992), Greening, Greene, and Difiglio (2000), Graham and Glaister
(2002), and Goodwin, Dargay, and Hanly (2004). For more recent examples, see Gillingham, Jenn,
and Azevedo (forthcoming-a) and Gillingham (2014a), who estimate static models using individual-
level micro data, as well as Small and Van Dender (2007), who estimate a dynamic model using
state-aggregate panel data. Meanwhile, an even more voluminous literature estimates the short-
run price elasticity of fuel demand, with a central tendency of around −0.25. Short-run responses
for miles traveled and fuel demand tend to align closely, since on-road fuel economy is largely
fixed in the short run. For reviews, see Dahl and Sterner (1991), Goodwin (1992), Espey (1998),
Graham and Glaister (2002), and Goodwin, Dargay, and Hanly (2004). For recent examples that
more credibly identify demand responses using shifts in fuel supply, see Kilian (2010), who use a
structural VAR approach, Coglianese, Davis, Kilian, and Stock (2015), who use changes in state
fuel taxes as instruments for retail prices, and Levin, Lewis, and Wolak (2015), who use city-level
weekly panel data and a rich set of fixed effects to control flexibly for potential demand shifters.

3.1.3   Consumers hold fewer cars

An increase in the fuel price makes cars more expensive to own and operate. This implies that
the new automobile market can be expected to shrink overall. The mechanisms underlying this
effect can be seen in condition (9). Holding miles and car attributes fixed, an increase in fuel
prices shifts per-car fueling costs (β[p + τf ]gv) upward, while the marginal benefit of a car net of
up-front purchase costs (µ0 (n)θ(x)u(v) − c(x, g)) remains fixed. Thus, the number of cars declines.
Simultaneous changes in miles, fuel economy, and car attributes will lead to further shifts in costs
and benefits, but the net effect should be an overall decline in market size. See Goodwin, Dargay,
and Hanly (2004) for a review. More recently, Edelstein and Kilian (2009) show that U.S. consumer
expenditures on new cars fall dramatically in response to energy price shocks—an effect that is
particularly pronounced for domestic cars, which tend to have lower fuel economy. Finally, most
discrete-choice models of car demand include an “outside good” option and therefore implicitly
feature market size effects—although they rarely emphasize such effects in their simulations.

3.1.4       Consumers scrap inefficient cars earlier

A richer understanding of how fuel taxes impact behavior is possible if we move beyond our model
and consider dynamic effects and heterogeneity in the car market. A fuel tax raises the optimal long-
run fuel economy of the car fleet, which—in addition to shifting market shares toward more efficient
new cars—will hasten the scrappage of inefficient used cars relative to efficient cars. Consistent
with this intuition, Jacobsen and van Benthem (2015) estimate that when gasoline prices increase
by $1, the annual scrap rate for the least efficient quartile of cars increases by 0.7 percentage
points relative to the most efficient quartile, and that this effect is highly concentrated in older
cars (see their online appendix for these estimates). Li, Timmins, and von Haefen (2009) present
qualitatively similar results. Note, however, that the severe contraction in the new-car market will
tend to mute this effect, and vice versa, since new and used cars are substitutes.

3.2     The effects of a fuel-economy standard
A fuel-economy standard also induces a host of responses. Figure 2 illustrates these responses,
which differ substantially from those of the fuel tax.

the text with a binding fuel economy standard but no other policies (i.e., τg > 0 and σ(x) = σ with
τf = τn = 0). The number of cars (n) is implicitly held fixed in all three panels, while panels (a)
                       and (b) implicitly hold miles traveled fixed, as well.



3.2.1       Cars get more efficient and shrink in size—same as the fuel tax

Like a tax on fuel, a fuel-economy standard directly shifts consumer demand toward greater fuel
economy, which will lead to a decrease in per-mile fuel consumption (g) and car performance
attributes (x) that compromise fuel economy. These effects are illustrated in panels (a) and (b) of
figure 2. In fact, holding market size (n) and miles traveled (v) fixed, a fuel-economy standard can
be designed to have precisely the same impact on fuel economy and car attributes as a fuel tax by


                                                                11
setting the tax rate on per-mile fuel consumption (τg ) equal to the perceived per-mile fuel tax that
would be paid by each car (βτf v). But the similarity between a fuel-economy standard and a fuel
tax ends there.

3.2.2   As the price of driving falls, consumers drive more—the “rebound effect”

Unlike the fuel tax, a fuel-economy standard provides no direct incentive to reduce miles traveled.
Worse, a fuel economy standard can have a perverse effect: by raising fuel economy while leaving fuel
prices unchanged, the standard lowers the per-mile cost of driving, and consumers might therefore
be expected to drive more. This intuition is illustrated in panel (c) of figure 2 as a downward shift in
the marginal per-mile cost of driving (pg), which, holding car attributes and therefore the marginal
benefit from driving ([µ(n)/n]θ(x)u0 (v)) fixed, leads to an increase in miles traveled (from point A
to point B). This response is known as the “rebound effect” and it is the subject of a voluminous
literature (for recent reviews and micro-theoroetic analyses, see Gillingham 2014b, Borenstein 2015,
Chan and Gillingham 2015, and Gillingham, Rapson, and Wagner forthcoming-b). In the presence
of various un-priced externalities that scale with miles traveled (e.g., car accidents, congestion, and
local pollution), this increase in miles traveled could potentially more than offset the reduction in
external costs associated with greenhouse gas emissions. See section 4.6 for detail.

3.2.3   The “rebound effect” may be weakened by shrinking car size

Traditional empirical estimates of the rebound effect have been drawn from studies that identify the
derivative of miles traveled (v) with respect to per-mile fuel costs (pg) using time-series variation in
fuel prices, while implicitly holding vehicle attributes (x) constant—corresponding to the behavioral
response described immediately above. But note that consumers will respond to fuel economy
standards, in part, by choosing smaller cars—which, in the context of our model, generate fewer
benefits per mile. Thus, adjustments in car attributes will tend to weaken the rebound effect. This
intuition is illustrated in panel (c) of figure 2 as a downward shift in the marginal benefits from
driving ([µ(n)/n]θ(x)u0 (v)), such that the net effect of fuel economy standards on miles traveled
(now, from point A to C) is weaker than when attributes are held constant—and the net response
of miles could potentially be zero or even negative.
   Consistent with this theoretical prediction, West, Hoekstra, Meer, and Puller (2015) use a
compelling regression discontinuity design to show that households that were “just barely eligible”
for the U.S. cash-for-clunkers program of 2009—based on the age and fuel economy of their used,
trade-in vehicles—purchased new cars with 3.9% higher fuel economy than those purchased by very
similar ineligible households. Meanwhile, these eligible households did not travel any more (or fewer)
miles. These results are relevant for understanding the potential impacts of fuel economy standards
since the cash-for-clunkers program effectively operated as a direct subsidy to the fuel economy of
new vehicles, closely approximating the incentives generated by a fuel-economy standard.
   But two important notes of caution are warranted. First, the cash-for-clunkers subsidy was
short-lived—only eight weeks. Thus, West et al. (2015) implicitly estimate the behavior of con-

                                                  12
sumers constrained to choose between the car models offered for sale during summer 2009. Miles
traveled could very well increase in the long run, as carmakers deploy fuel-saving technologies that
relax the tradeoff between fuel economy and car attributes. Second, even if the rebound effect net
of attribute changes is precisely zero, a fuel tax is still more efficient than a fuel-economy standard,
because the fuel tax directly increases the cost of driving, reducing miles traveled among both new
and used cars (note that the corresponding decrease in car attributes will tend to reinforce this
effect). This response can be qualitatively important (see Austin and Dinan 2005).

3.2.4   Consumers have zero direct incentive to hold fewer cars

A fuel tax raises the operating cost of all automobiles, but a revenue-neutral fuel-economy standard
implicitly taxes some products while subsidizing others. This fact is clear in our definition of the
policy in section 2.3, which shows that a car is taxed based on the difference between its per-mile
fuel consumption (g) and the standard (σ). Intuitively, this means that a fuel-economy standard
could plausibly tilt relative car prices to reflect external damages, but it cannot directly change
average prices. Thus, a fuel-economy standard fails to optimally shrink market size—and could even
increase it. Holland, Hughes, and Knittel (2009) make these points about performance standards
more generally.

3.2.5   Consumers scrap inefficient cars later—the “Gruenspecht effect”

As discussed above, a fuel tax will shrink the market share of inefficient new cars, while hastening
the scrappage of inefficient used cars. A fuel-economy standard will also shrink the market share
of inefficient new cars. However, unlike a fuel tax, a fuel-economy standard does not increase the
operating costs of inefficient used cars. Meanwhile, the contraction in the new-car market will, via
substitution, tend to increase the resale values of inefficient used cars. Thus, on net, the resale
values of inefficient used cars increase, perversely extending their lives—the so-called “Gruenspect
effect” (see Gruenspecht 1982). Jacobsen and van Benthem (2015) explore this dynamic in detail,
using variation in used-car resale values induced by changes in gasoline prices to estimate the “scrap
elasticity”—the effect of resale value on the probability of scrappage. They combine these estimates
with a rich model of car supply and demand to simulate the effects of fuel-economy standards on
overall fuel consumption, showing that 13%–16% of the savings anticipated for new cars is lost via
“leakage” to the used car market—comparable to the “leakage” due to the rebound effect.

3.2.6   Cost-effectiveness is undermined by firm, fleet, and year-specific standards

Our discussion above implicitly considers a second-best fuel-economy standard whose structure is
chosen optimally. But fuel-economy standards in practice fall far short of this second-best ideal.
First, fuel-economy standards historically have regulated automaker and fleet-specific averages,
leading—in the absence of efficient trading—to different marginal incentives to improve fuel econ-
omy for different firms and products. Second, the ability to re-design light trucks (e.g., minivans


                                                  13
and SUVs) to replace large cars with similar fuel economy (e.g., station wagons) simultaneously
undermined the effectiveness of both the car and light-truck standards (see Henderson 1985 and
Sallee 2011). Finally, shifts in consumer demand due to volatile fuel prices imply that the marginal
incentive to improve fuel economy is also quite volatile over time, in spite of limited provisions
for credit banking and borrowing. This volatility implies potentially large departures from cost-
effectiveness, given that the marginal benefits of carbon abatement are relatively constant over
time. We return to this issue below.

3.3      Is a feebate the same as a fuel-economy standard?
A “feebate” system is a series of “fees” on inefficient models and “rebates” for efficient models.
A major theme in environmental regulation is the close symmetry between price and quantity
instruments—and these same ideas and intuitions carry over to the comparison of a feebate (a
“price” mechanism) with a fuel-economy standard (a “quantity” mechanism). A pollution tax
makes explicit the implicit tax imposed by a cap on pollution. Likewise, a feebate simply makes
explicit the implicit system of taxes and subsidies associated with a fuel-economy standard—thus,
the effects of these policies are very similar.4 See Gillingham (2013) for analysis and extended
discussion of feebates and how they compare to fuel-economy standards, echoing many of our
points, and see Sallee (2011) for a review of tax and subsidy policies related to fuel economy more
generally.
       In principle, a feebate allows for a positive tax on all vehicles, more closely approximating the
effects of a first-best tax on fuel and raising revenue to offset distortionary taxes. In practice,
feebates have typically been designed to be revenue-neutral, largely for political reasons, obviating
these purported advantages. Moreover, a fuel-economy standard could be combined with a cap
(or a tax) on the number of cars to achieve the same effects. Thus, the perceived differences
of a feebate are more about political and administrative convenience. Likewise, it is sometimes
asserted that a feebate allows for greater flexibility in pricing—for example, by allowing the tax
schedule to be a nonlinear function of fuel consumption rates. But a fuel-economy standard could
achieve the same effects by re-weighting vehicles based on a nonlinear function of fuel consumption
when calculating fleet-average fuel economy, again reflecting the close symmetry between these
price and quantity instruments. Moreover, departures from linear pricing come with costs. Indeed,
feebates everywhere have featured highly nonlinear discrete jumps or “notches” in their tax and
subsidy schedules. Sallee and Slemrod (2012) demonstrate that carmakers reacted to notches in the
U.S. Gas Guzzler Tax by bunching vehicles around favorable fuel consumption rates. They show
theoretically that such a response is inefficient and argue for the use of smooth schedules instead
of notched ones.
       One real benefit of feebates in practice is that they harmonize incentives to improve fuel economy
   4
     As with other price and quantity mechanisms, this symmetry can break down when considering policy interactions.
For example, in the presence of a binding fuel-economy standard, raising the fuel tax would have no impact on fuel
economy—it would only lower the shadow price on the fuel-economy constraint. In the presence of a feebate, however,
raising the fuel tax would further increase fuel economy.


                                                        14
across firms, whereas firm-specific standards may give different marginal incentives, violating the
equi-marginal principle. Although this same benefit can, in principle, be achieved in a standard
by allowing compliance trading across firms—as is now permitted in the United States—the small
number of firms in this market may limit welfare-improving trades.
   Another real benefit of feebates in practice is that they provide certainty about the marginal
incentive to improve fuel economy. The marginal benefits from carbon abatement in the U.S.
transportation sector, arguably, are approximately constant within and across model years. Thus,
standard reasoning implies that setting a certain “price” via the feebate and being uncertain about
the level of fuel economy is better (i.e., has lower expected deadweight loss) than setting a certain
“quantity” via the standard and being uncertain about marginal compliance costs (see Weitz-
man 1974). This logic is especially compelling when one considers the difficulty of estimating the
marginal cost of a given standard, even ex post—indeed, several studies have attempted to estimate
such costs and have come to widely divergent conclusions (see Anderson and Sallee 2011 for a dis-
cussion). Moreover, fuel-economy standards in the United States are typically set several years in
advance, while demand for fuel economy fluctuates continuously and unpredictably with oil prices.
   While prior discussions comparing feebates to fuel-economy standards have emphasized revenue-
neutrality and flexible pricing as benefits of feebates, we argue that the more important benefits
are likely related to uncertainty. However, we know of no efforts to quantify these benefits in the
literature. This would be a fruitful area for future research.

3.4     What are the effects of an attribute-based fuel-economy standard?
In 2012, the U.S. fuel economy program became attribute-based. This means that, rather than
simply requiring all firms to meet a common fuel-economy target, a firm’s target depends on some
other attribute. In the United States, that attribute is a vehicle’s footprint—the rectangular area
bounded by a vehicle’s tires. Larger vehicles are credited with a lower fuel economy target. Other
countries all have weight-based standards. Thus, the world’s largest auto markets—China, the
United States, Europe, Japan and India—all have attribute-based standards.

3.4.1    Attribute-based standards implicitly subsidize car size, potentially leading to
         up-sizing

Attribute-basing changes the economics of standards by introducing an additional margin of compliance—
changes in the attribute. In our conceptual model, this effect is captured by showing that an
attribute-based standard creates an implicit subsidy to the attribute (the τg nσ 0 (x) term in equa-
tion 7), which accompanies the implicit tax on fuel economy (the τg n term in equation 6). Holding
the implicit tax on per-mile fuel consumption (τg ) fixed, this extra incentive would manifest in
figure 2 as a smaller downward shift in the marginal cost of fuel economy improvements (−cg (x, g))
in panel (a), and a smaller upward shift in the marginal cost of the attribute (cg (x, g)) in panel
(b)—implying smaller reductions in both per-mile fuel consumption and car attributes. Thus, rel-
ative to a traditional fuel-economy standard with the same incentive rate (τg ), the attribute-based

                                                 15
standard leads to up-sizing and implies lower fuel economy.
   Consistent with these theoretical predictions, Ito and Sallee (2015) demonstrate empirically
that weight-based standards in Japan have, in fact, led to increased vehicle weight. Japan’s weight-
based standards—though broadly set to match the observed pre-regulation correlation between fuel
economy and weight—nevertheless feature large “notches” below which the incentive to increase
weight is extremely powerful (note that the slope of the weight-based standard at the notch is
σ 0 (x) = ∞). Accordingly, they find that these notches are associated with significant “excess
bunching” in the distribution of weight on the policy-favored side of these notches.
   We are not aware of any similar studies that have used ex-post data to examine the effects
of footprint-based standards in the United States—where regulators explicitly chose footprint, in
part, because they believed it would be more difficult for carmakers to manipulate than weight.
Nevertheless, Whitefoot and Skerlos (2012) use an engineering cost model to conclude that dis-
tortions to footprint will be substantial. Meanwhile, the same perverse incentive to up-size cars
potentially exists in the European Union, China, and India—all of which feature weight-based
regulations—although Reynaert (2015) finds no strong evidence of weight manipulation in Europe.
Additional research on the actual effects of attribute-based standards in other markets would be
valuable, given the growing prevalence of such standards.

3.4.2   When calibrated to match pre-regulation market data, attribute-based stan-
        dards neutralize the incentive to up-size and instead force technology adoption

How do regulators choose the slope of an attribute-based policy? In practice, most regulators have
chosen the slope of the fuel-economy target (σ 0 (x)) by fitting a function to historical or projected
data on fuel economy vs. car size across the range of car models offered in the market. How should
we interpret this slope? Intuitively, we can think of this slope as deriving from heterogeneity in
consumer preferences for car size. This heterogeneity then traces out an equilibrium relationship
between fuel economy and car size, as consumers with stronger preferences for size—facing the
same cost and technological tradeoffs—optimally choose bigger, less efficient cars.
   What then are the consequences of choosing the slope of an attribute-based standard to match
the slope of this equilibrium relationship? Intuitively, the equilibrium relationship between fuel
economy and size defines the “baseline” car choices made by consumers prior to regulation. Thus, in
setting the target fuel economy function to be parallel to this baseline, an attribute-based standard
effectively neutralizes the incentive to comply via moving left or right—that is, by up-sizing or down-
sizing individual cars or by up-sizing or down-sizing the “average” car via mix-shifting. Instead,
the only compliance benefit is in moving up—that is, adding fuel-saving technologies.
   Consistent with this theoretical prediction, Reynaert (2015) studies the roll-out of weight-based
standards in the European Union, finding that compliance there is achieved entirely through tech-
nology gains—which are found to accelerate sharply when the weight-based standard in introduced.
Thus, theory and empirical evidence seem to suggest that the pronounced up-sizing of cars in Japan
is was due to the large notches in their weight-based standard.


                                                  16
3.4.3   Is there any efficiency or other justification for attribute-based standards?

As we note above, there is no efficiency justification for attribute-based standards in our conceptual
model—the optimal policy is a Pigouvian tax on fuel or (if v is exogenous) a tax on per-mile fuel
consumption with no attribute-basing. These same points are made by Ito and Sallee (2015),
who emphasize that the practical rationale for attribute-based standards is likely distributional.
Attribute-based standards spread compliance burdens more equally and tend to favor makers of
bigger and heavier cars—domestic carmakers in the United States and German carmakers in the
European Union.
   However, these distributional aims are achieved at the cost of introducing several possible
inefficiencies. First, the implicit subsidy to attributes under attribute-based standards distorts
consumers’ choices. As Ito and Sallee (2015) show in the context of Japan’s weight-based standards,
the implicit subsidy to weight creates a Harberger-like deadweight loss triangle between the marginal
benefits and costs of weight—the more elastic is weight, the larger is this deadweight loss. Second,
attribute-based standards substantially mute the incentive to down-size cars, which must weakly
increase the cost of achieving a given fuel-economy target. Ito and Sallee (2015) note that forcing
technology adoption could potentially be justified by technology spillovers, but they are skeptical
that these spillovers are large, given extensive patenting and licensing in the car market. Third,
weight-based standards exacerbate—or at least fail to mitigate—the safety-related externality that
heavier cars impose on occupants of other cars (see section 4.5 below). Finally, by neutralizing the
incentive to down-size and forcing technology adoption, attribute-based standards likely generate
a larger rebound effect than traditional standards. Thus, while we argue above that the “holding
attributes constant” empirical approaches common in the literature likely overstate the size of the
rebound effect for conventional fuel-economy standards, these concerns are rightly placed on an
attribute-based standard.
   Our discussion above ignores uncertainty. In a world with variable demand for fuel economy
due to volatile fuel prices, attribute-based standards—like feebates—have the potential benefit of
stabilizing the marginal cost of regulation. Under attribute-based standards, target fuel economy
would rise and fall in tandem with fuel prices, as demand shifted between big and small cars. Thus,
these shifts would have little effect on the regulatory shadow price. Instead, the shadow price would
be driven mainly by the costs less benefits of fuel-saving technology, which would vary some—but
much less—with fuel prices. As noted above, however, a feebate could also stabilize incentives but
without the concomitant distortions.

3.4.4   Attribute-basing undermines the logic of using standards to counteract myopia

Recent fuel-economy rules in the United States have, in their supporting documents, emphasized
consumer myopia (or other sources of consumer undervaluation) as a key justification for regulation.
However, attribute-based standards partially undermine this logic by neutralizing the incentive to
down-size cars and instead forcing the adoption of fuel-saving technologies. There is no reason
to believe that myopia, if it exists, applies only to the valuation of fuel-saving technologies for

                                                 17
cars with identical attributes and not to comparisons of cars with different attributes—indeed,
empirical evidence for myopia is based largely on observing how consumers trade off car size for
greater fuel economy when fuel prices rise, as we discuss in detail below. Thus, if myopia is the
rationale for regulation, the appropriate policy is a fuel-economy standard that preserves incentives
for down-sizing.


4     Additional considerations
In this section, we cover a number of auxiliary topics that do follow directly from the discussion of
our conceptual model.

4.1   Behavioral biases do little to justify fuel-economy standards
A substantial literature in energy economics studies the possibility that consumers might fail to
make rational investments in energy efficiency, due to present bias or some other behavioral bias
or market friction. Might behavioral biases overturn the traditional wisdom that a fuel tax is more
efficient than standards?
    As we discuss above, consumer undervaluation of fuel economy (β < 1) creates a second market
failure, such that a fuel tax must be complemented by a fuel-economy standard (or direct subsidy)
to restore full market efficiency. These results match those in Allcott, Mullainathan, and Taubinsky
(2014) and Heutel (2015)—although a tax on cars is also required in our setting. Note, however,
that unpriced miles-related externalities (e.g., congestion) weaken the case for a complementary
fuel-economy standard, since the standard induces a rebound effect. Indeed, given these un-priced
externalities, and assuming an optimal fuel tax, Parry, Evans, and Oates (2014) argue that an
extreme value of undervaluation (with β < 0.3) would be required before a complementary fuel-
economy standard becomes welfare-improving.
    Is such a large degree of undervaluation consistent with the data? In short: no. We focus
on what we believe to be the most credible empirical papers in the literature—those that use
panel identification strategies, regressing the market prices of various car models in different time
periods on a constructed measure of these cars’ future fueling costs (see Helfand and Wolverton
2011 and Greene 2010 for recent reviews of the broader literature). This approach enables the
inclusion of both time and car model fixed effects—thereby controlling for unobserved car attributes
and macroeconomic shocks—while still identifying the effect of future fuel costs on vehicle prices.
Kahn (1986) pioneered this approach using a handful of car models, while more recent iterations—
notably, Allcott and Wozny (2014), Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013), and Sallee, West,
and Fan (forthcoming)—use much more precise and comprehensive data. These three papers are
united in finding substantial valuation (estimates of β are closer to 1 than 0.5). However, all
three papers emphasize that their results are somewhat sensitive to chosen samples, specifications,
and assumptions about consumers’ fuel price forecasts and other objects used to construct future
fuel costs (see these papers and Anderson, Kellogg, and Sallee 2013). Thus, while their preferred


                                                 18
specifications do not consistently reject full valuation, alternative assumptions can lead to results
consistent with modest undervaluation.
   What about consumer heterogeneity? Bento, Li, and Roth (2012) show in a simulation that
falsely assuming a homogeneous valuation parameter can lead to an erroneous finding of mean un-
dervaluation. Meanwhile, Grigolon, Reynaert, and Verboven (2014) directly estimate heterogeneity
in preferences for fuel economy in a structural model applied to the European car market, finding
that the average car buyer fully values fuel economy. Again, however, the literature cannot rule
out that at least some consumers undervalue fuel economy.
   Such heterogeneity complicates policy analysis since a fuel-economy standard that corrects
the biases of “behavioral” agents will simultaneously distort the choices of “rational” agents (see
Allcott, Mullainathan, and Taubinsky 2014). Instead, behavioral nudges, information provision,
and fuel consumption labels might be better targeted to behavioral agents and could potentially
have large effects. Indeed, Allcott (2013) finds that there is wide dispersion in the accuracy of
beliefs about fuel costs and that consumers report spending very little time considering such costs.
Meanwhile, Davis and Metcalf (2014) and Newell and Siikamäki (2014) suggest that information
design can have important impacts on appliance choice. More such work is needed, in particular
for automobiles.

4.2   Heterogeneity in vehicle longevity and on-road fuel economy strengthen
      the case for a fuel tax
Fuel-economy standards (and feebates) only affect up-front purchase decisions, treating all cars with
the same fuel economy identically. Thus, such policies fail to account for substantial heterogeneity in
actual emissions across both cars and drivers, implying wide dispersion in marginal abatement costs.
One source of heterogeneity is vehicle longevity (durability). Jacobsen, Knittel, Sallee, and van
Benthem (2016) show that different types of cars have vastly different values for expected lifetime
mileage. They develop a sufficient statistics approach for characterizing the welfare implications of
a fuel-economy standard in light of this heterogeneity and conclude that the second-best standard
achieves only one-quarter to one-third of the welfare gains from a fuel tax. Another source of
heterogeneity is driver behavior. Langer and McRae (2014) observe wide dispersion in on-road fuel
economy across drivers operating a literally identical car in the same metro area, while Reynaert
and Sallee (2016) documents substantial variation using on-road data from the Netherlands, and
Sallee (2011) argues that the disparity between city and highway fuel economy in government tests
implies substantial heterogeneity across drivers based on where and when they drive. In contrast
to the standard, the fuel tax scales directly with total emissions, equalizing marginal abatement
costs across different cars and drivers—and without requiring any additional information on the
part of the policy maker.




                                                  19
4.3   The implications of imperfect competition for energy policy are not well-
      understood
Our model focuses on the consumer problem and posits a competitive supply side. In reality, the
automobile market is composed of a handful of major automakers who sell differentiated products
and thus enjoy some degree of market power. How might this influence our conclusions about policy
design?
   In general, welfare analysis is complicated by the presence of market power so that it is impossi-
ble to know ex ante whether any particular attribute (e.g., fuel economy) is over or under-provided
in the private equilibrium. First, firms will price to the marginal consumer for a product, rather
than the average (Spence 1975). Next, firms in the automobile market sell multiple differentiated
products, so the welfare analysis is further complicated by the potential incentives of firms to at-
tempt to price discriminate. As argued in Plourde and Bardis (1999) and Fischer (2005), firms
might use quality (e.g., fuel economy) as a way of segmenting the market, which can lead to inef-
ficient provision of attributes (e.g., fuel economy) to some market segments as a way of extracting
surplus from other segments.
   Thus, in general, imperfect competition could lead to either over or under-provision of fuel
economy. Testing these alternatives is very difficult and the literature provides little guidance or
evidence on this issue. Structural models typically estimate markups and separate producer and
consumer surplus, but those models generally take product attributes as fixed—allowing only prices
to change—so they are unable to tell us how policy design might affect fuel economy in the longer
run (a notable exception is Whitefoot, Fowlie, and Skerlos 2013).
   There are, however, some recent intriguing results regarding energy-efficiency policies and
supply-side behavior in the appliance market. Houde (2014) argues that imperfectly competi-
tive firms respond to Energy Star certification of appliances by increasing markups on certified
products, while Houde and Spurlock (2015) demonstrate that energy-efficiency standards are cor-
related with technological innovation in the appliance market, which they argue is rationalized by
imperfect competition. Clearly, greater consideration of the supply side in the car market is an
area where future research could have a major impact—although it is equally apparent that the
empirical challenges are substantial.

4.4   Cheating erodes the efficiency of standards
Fuel-economy standards and feebates must rely on official fuel-economy ratings based on laboratory
tests, which may differ from on-road performance. Indeed, mounting evidence gathered by industry
sources shows a remarkable divergence between official ratings and on-road performance. This gap
is modest in the United States (The International Council on Clean Transportation 2013), but it
is very large (around 40% in 2014) in Europe (The International Council on Clean Transportation
2015). Such gaps may, in fact, be due to the intentional gaming of test procedures, as evidenced
by the 2015 Volkswagen scandal involving its NOx emissions control system or controversy in 2012



                                                20
that forced Hyundai/Kia to downgrade fuel economy ratings for most of its cars.
   Reynaert and Sallee (2016) analyze the welfare implications of such cheating. When regulators
are aware of evasion and the cost of evasion is homogeneous across firms, regulators can still achieve
the intended level of fuel economy by tightening standards until actual fuel economy reaches the
desired level. But the gaming itself is socially wasteful. Moreover, when the cost of gaming is
heterogeneous across cars, consumers will generally be unable to infer the precise fuel economy of
each car, leading to inefficient car choices and further lowering welfare. Reynaert and Sallee (2016)
use data on heterogeneity in gaming and a discrete choice model to argue that these welfare costs
are substantial. Carmakers cannot cheat the gas tax in the same way—although consumers could
still be misled into making inefficient car choices. Thus, gaming provides yet another potential
benefit of a fuel tax over fuel-economy standards, though the size of this benefit will depend on the
ability of consumers (perhaps in conjunction with third-party testing) to see through such gaming
and observe true fuel economy.

4.5   Safety-related externalities are large
A politically and scientifically controversial issue in regulating fuel economy has been the potential
adverse impact on car safety, as it is intuitive that larger cars should provide their occupants more
protection in accidents, but potentially increase the risk to occupants of other cars—a risk that
may be exacerbated if cars and light trucks have “mismatched” body styles (see Transportation
Research Board and National Research Council 2002). A major rationale in moving to attribute-
based standards in the United States has therefore been the assumption that such standards would
substantially mute the incentive to down-size the fleet and thereby neutralize this controversial
issue (see U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2010).
   This is a complex issue, as overall fatality risks depend not only on the overall mix of cars on
the road, but on where, when, how much, and by whom these cars are driven. To address these
issues, Jacobsen (2013b) estimates fatality risks for accidents involving different combinations of
car classes, while controlling for driver behavior and other factors. His findings help explain why,
for example, minivans cause far fewer fatalities than their large size would imply—these cars tend
to be driven by safer drivers, or at safer times and locations. Jacobsen (2013b) then combines these
estimates with a model of the car market to simulate the impacts of fuel-economy standards on
fatalities, finding that 1 mpg increase would cause 149 extra deaths per year—but that a unified car
and truck standard or a footprint-based standard would have negligible impacts on fatalities. In
contrast, Anderson and Auffhammer (2014) focus specifically on the externality related to safety,
which is what matters for assessing the relative efficiency of competing policies. Using a rich dataset
on car accidents, they estimate that a 100-pound increase in weight is associated with a 4%–5%
increase in the probability that the other car’s occupants are killed in a serious accident. They
argue that these results would justify a gasoline tax of approximately $1, simply to address the
weight externality. We discuss implications for policy immediately below.



                                                  21
4.6   Accounting for other un-priced externalities reinforces the efficiency ad-
      vantage of a fuel tax
Thus far, we have focused on greenhouse warming externalities, which scale with total fuel con-
sumption. However, Parry, Walls, and Harrington (2007) survey evidence on all automobile-related
externalities, showing that un-priced externalities that scale with miles—namely, local pollution,
congestion, and car accidents—are potentially just as or even more important. Meanwhile, Ander-
son and Auffhammer (2014) recently quantify a large externality associated specifically with vehicle
weight, as discussed above.
   Thus, accounting for other un-priced externalities tends to reinforce our efficiency ranking of
policies: fuel tax > fuel-economy standard > attribute-based standard. Why? A fuel tax pro-
vides a direct incentive to decrease miles—reducing externalities from pollution, congestion, and
accidents—whereas traditional fuel-economy standards either fail to mitigate or exacerbate these
externalities. Likewise, traditional fuel-economy standards give potentially strong incentives to re-
duce vehicle size—reducing externalities from accidents—whereas size-based standards either fail
to mitigate or exacerbate these externalities. Of course, these second-best considerations would
be irrelevant in the presence of a first-best tax on local pollution emissions (or a combination of
instruments that replicate such a tax, as in Fullerton and West 2002 2010), time-of-use congestion
pricing, and a weight-differentiated tax on miles to internalize accident risks (see Anderson and
Auffhammer 2014). Indeed, the fuel-related externality of 51 cents is already quite close to the
current gasoline tax (average state plus federal tax).

4.7   Knowledge spillovers may make complementary policies efficient
If firms are unable to appropriate the full benefits of their own technological advances (i.e., there are
knowledge spillovers), then there is another market failure. This market failure could justify policies
to subsidize technology (see Anderson, Fischer, and Egorenkov 2015). As noted above, attribute-
based standards subsidize technology, but they do so in a way that distorts other margins. Thus, to
justify the use of such policies, technology spillovers must be substantial. Moreover, where subsidies
for technology are deployed in addition to a binding fuel-economy regulation, the subsidy will not
lower emissions beyond what is achieved by the regulation alone (due to the logic of overlapping
regulation, as discussed in Goulder, Jacobsen, and van Benthem 2012).

4.8   Barriers limiting the adoption of biofuels may make complementary policies
      efficient
Our discussion above focuses on reducing overall fuel consumption, but an alternative pathway is
to switch to low-carbon fuels. Generalizing to multiple fuel types, the first-best policy is a carbon
tax, which would raise the prices of all fuels in proportion to their carbon contents—inducing the
same behavioral responses as the fuel tax above—while optimally tilting relative prices in favor of
low-carbon fuels, such as ethanol.


                                                   22
    How do fuel markets respond to such incentives? We do not have a carbon tax, but the federal
Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and California’s low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS) also tilt relative
prices in favor of ethanol and other low-carbon fuels—albeit without directly raising average fuel
prices. Thus far, these policies have been accommodated by blending ethanol into regular gasoline
for use in conventional cars. However, to blend ethanol in ratios higher than 10%—the so-called
blend-wall—requires flexible-fuel vehicles and new retail fueling infrastructure (e.g., pumps and
storage tanks). Thus, as we approach the 10% blend wall, potential barriers to the adoption of
high-ethanol blends become important—and there several such barriers.
    First, micro-empirical studies on fuel-switching behavior among drivers of flexible-fuel vehicles
in the United States (Anderson 2012) and Brazil (Salvo and Huse 2013) indicate that many con-
sumers demand large price discounts before switching to ethanol. These consumer-level barriers
are exacerbated by a lack of flexible-fuel vehicles and ethanol refueling infrastructure. Pouliot and
Babcock (2014ab) show in a simulation model that these infrastructure constraints can severely
limit ethanol adoption in the short-run. Second, network externalities and coordination failures
in adoption—i.e., drivers depending on station owners to install pumps, and station owners de-
pending on drivers to buy flexible-fuel vehicles—could hinder investment in new infrastructure.
Indeed, Shriver (2015) estimates that new retailer entry increases flexible-fuel adoption in a county
by 6%, but that such entry first depends on the adoption of 300 or more new flexible-fuel vehi-
cles. Thus, current policies that implicitly subsidize the production of flexible-fuel vehicles (see
Anderson and Sallee 2011) or that directly subsidize new retail fueling infrastructure (recently and
massively expanded under the USDA Biofuels Infrastructure Partnership initiative) could poten-
tially be justified on efficiency grounds. Similar logic would apply to completely new technologies
(e.g., hydrogen cars). Finally, there is suggestive evidence that a lack of competition throughout
the supply chain may be limiting adoption. For example, Anderson (2012) and Knittel, Meiselman,
and Stock (2015) show that wholesale fuel prices and ethanol subsidies do not pass through fully
to retail prices for high-ethanol blends—consistent with retail market power—while it is rumored
that vertically integrated oil companies are loath to supply alternative fuels at competitive prices,
as such fuels would then compete directly with their upstream operations. Additional work should
explore these issues and the potential role of policy in addressing them.


5    Conclusion
How can we make cars greener? The chief aim of our review has been to assess the efficiency
of fuel-economy standards relative to the benchmark policy of a fuel tax. Traditional economic
wisdom advocates the use of a fuel tax (or carbon price) to achieve cost-effective mitigation. Policy
makers demonstrate a consistent preference for efficiency standards, however, and several decades
of research have demonstrated that this preference is costly—a fuel tax could reduce greenhouse
gas emissions by the same amount at substantially lower economic cost.
    Might feebates or attribute-based standards overturn this conclusion? Or could behavioral


                                                 23
biases or other market failures imply an important role for efficiency standards? Our reading of the
literature suggests that it is unlikely that such factors change the relative efficiency of standards
and fuel taxes. As detailed above and enumerated in the introduction, a number of important
questions remain. However, given our current knowledge, it appears that carbon pricing (or fuel
taxation) remains the most economically efficient policy instrument for mitigating carbon emissions
and other harmful pollutants related to automobiles.

A     Alternative model with fuel economy given as a function of car
      attributes and technology
In section 2 above, we model a consumer’s choice of car attributes and fuel economy, with the car’s
cost given as a function of car attributes and fuel economy. In this section, we model a consumer’s
choice of car attributes and car cost (i.e., technology), with the car’s fuel economy given as a
function of car attributes and costs. By reframing the model in this way, we are able to show that
consumer undervaluation of fuel economy will contaminate the tradeoff between car attributes and
fuel economy (in addition to the tradeoff between car technology and fuel economy that is clear in
the original formulation of our model).

A.1    Consumer welfare
Following the setup of our model in the main text above, we assume that the representative con-
sumer has utility that is quasilinear in transportation services and other goods, valued in dollars,
such that welfare is also valued in dollars and is given by the following expression:

                      W (c, x, v, n) = µ(n)θ(x)u(v) + y − nc − n[p + d]g(x, c)v,                      (10)

where: c is the cost of the car, which indexes the car’s technology level; g(x, c) is the average car’s
per-mile fuel consumption as a function of attributes x and cost c; and all other variables are as
above. Thus, g(x, c) traces out an iso-cost curve in g − x space. We assume partial derivatives
given by gx > 0, gxx ≥ 0, gc < 0, gcc ≥ 0, and gxc ≥ 0. That is, the per-mile fuel consumption rate
is increasing and convex in attributes, decreasing and concave in costs, and a dollar of technology
is less effective in reducing per-mile fuel consumption in cars with greater attributes.
    The necessary conditions that characterize welfare maximization are as follows:

                           ∂W
                                  = −n − n[p + d]gc (x, c)v = 0                                       (11)
                            ∂c
                           ∂W
                                  = µ(n)θ0 (x)u(v) − n[p + d]gx (x, c)v = 0                           (12)
                           ∂x
                           ∂W
                                  = µ(n)θ(x)u0 (v) − n[p + d]g(x, c) = 0                              (13)
                           ∂v
                           ∂W
                                  = µ0 (n)θ(x)u(v) − c − [p + d]g(x, c)v = 0                          (14)
                           ∂n

Expression (11) says that, holding car attributes fixed, fuel-saving technology should be added to
cars until the last dollar spent on technology reduces the social marginal costs of fuel consumption
by exactly one dollar. Expression (12) says that, holding car technology fixed, the marginal utility
of better car attributes (e.g., size) should be set equal to the corresponding marginal impact on
the social cost of fuel consumption that results from less efficient cars. The other expressions have
similar interpretations as above. Denote the solution to these conditions by (c∗ , x∗ , v ∗ , n∗ ).



                                                    31
A.2    Externalities and internalities
Consumer choices in general will differ from the welfare-maximizing conditions for the same reasons
as above. The marginal external damage from fuel consumption is again d, while the degree of
consumer undervaluation of future fuel expenditures is again given by β.

A.3    Policy options
We consider the same set of policies as outlined above.

A.4    Consumer behavior
Given these assumptions, the necessary conditions that characterize decentralized consumer behav-
ior are given as follows:

            ∂B
                  = −n − βn[p + τf ]gc (x, c)v − τg ngc (x, c) = 0                                   (15)
            ∂c
            ∂B
                  = µ(n)θ0 (x)u(v) − βn[p + τf ]gx (x, c)v − τg n[gx (x, c) − σ 0 (x)] = 0           (16)
            ∂x
            ∂B
                  = µ(n)θ(x)u0 (v) − n[p + τf ]g(x, c) = 0                                           (17)
            ∂v
            ∂B
                  = µ0 (n)θ(x)u(v) − c − β[p + τf ]g(x, c)v − τg [g(x, c) − σ(x)] − τn = 0,          (18)
            ∂n

where ∂B denotes the consumer’s perceived change in private welfare associated with marginal
changes in the respective choice variables. Note that the presence of the consumer undervaluation
factor β directly impacts choices related to car technology, car attributes, and the number of cars
purchased in conditions (15), (16), and (18). Denote the solution to these conditions by (ĉ, x̂, v̂, n̂).
   From here, it is clear in conditions (15) and (16) that both the fuel tax and the fuel-economy
standard will generate incentives for consumers to add fuel-saving technologies (c) and, holding
technology fixed, scale back car attributes (x) to save fuel.
