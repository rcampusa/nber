                                           ABSTRACT

Enrollment increased slightly at both the California State University and University of California
systems in fall 2020, but the effects of the pandemic on enrollment in the California Community
College system are mostly unknown and might differ substantially from the effects on 4-year
colleges. This paper provides the first analysis of how the pandemic impacted enrollment patterns
and the academic outcomes of community college students using administrative college-level
panel data covering the universe of students in the 116-college California Community College
system. We find that community college enrollment dropped precipitously in fall 2020 ­ the total
number of enrolled students fell by 4 percent in spring 2020 and by 15 percent in fall 2020
relative to the prior year. All racial and ethnic groups experienced large enrollment decreases in
spring and fall 2020, but African-American and Latinx students experienced the largest drops at
17 percent in fall 2020. Enrollment fell the most for first-year students in the community college
system, basic skills courses, and fields such as engineering/industrial technology, education,
interdisciplinary studies, and art. There were smaller decreases for continuing students, academic
courses transferable to four-year institutions, and business and science fields. Enrollment losses
were felt throughout the entire community college system, and there is no evidence that having a
large online presence in prior years protected colleges from these effects. In terms of course
performance, there was a larger disruption to completion rates, withdrawal rates, and grades in
spring 2020 than in fall 2020. These early findings of the effects of the pandemic at community
colleges, which serve higher percentages of lower-income and minority students, have
implications for policy, impending budgetary pressures, and future research.

Please note: Data from fall 2020 might overstate enrollment losses due to misinterpretation of
data that coincides with variation in college/district submission and verification as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The California Community College Chancellor's Office is reviewing the
processes in consultation with college and district stakeholders to produce complete, accurate,
and verified revised data.

1 Introduction
Both the University of California and the California State University systems recently reported
that total undergraduate enrollment increased slightly from fall 2019 to fall 2020. The effects of
the COVID-19 pandemic, however, on enrollment in the California Community College system
are not known. Community colleges serve different student populations, are less selective, and
could experience very different effects. The move to remote instruction due to COVID
restrictions might have caused incoming and continuing community college students to not enroll
given the more tenuous enrollment pattern of these students relative to their four-year college
peers and the emphasis on hands-on technical training in some programs. On the other hand,
given the extremely weak labor market during the pandemic, young adults might have been
attracted to open-enrollment and relatively inexpensive community colleges. Thus, theoretically
the direction of net impacts on community college enrollment is not clear.
        The effects of the pandemic on the academic performance of community college students
is also relatively unknown and theoretically ambiguous. Students might have struggled with
online learning given the lack of structure, requirement of more self-discipline, and technological
disruptions. On the other hand, instructors might have been more lenient in grading, students
were less distracted from social events, job opportunities were limited, COVID-19 relief aid was
available, and options for taking courses pass/no pass increased. Thus, GPAs and other outcomes
might have improved instead of worsened in the pandemic. The scant empirical evidence is
mixed. Students at Arizona State University studied less and were more likely to withdraw from
classes and delay graduation in the spring of 2020 (Aucejo et al., 2020). In contrast, while
students reported challenges with online learning at Queens College in New York City, GPAs
were higher and there was no effect on credits earned during spring semester (Rodríguez-Planas,
2020, 2021). 1
        We use administrative college-level panel data covering the universe of students and
courses from the California Community College System to provide the first detailed evidence of
the effect of COVID-19 and the transition to online classes on community college enrollment
and academic outcomes. Specifically, this short, primarily descriptive paper explores five
fundamental and policy-relevant questions regarding impacts of the pandemic. First, did


1
 Ahn, Lee and Winters (2020) find that high school graduation rates increased, perhaps due to limited labor market
opportunities during the early stages of the pandemic.

community colleges experience falling enrollment in spring and fall 2020 in contrast to the UC
and CSU systems? Were there disproportionate impacts on enrollment across racial and ethnic
groups? Second, in fall 2020, were new students dissuaded from starting community colleges
and was this effect larger than for continuing students trying to stay on track with their
educational goals? Third, which types of courses were affected the most? Specifically, did
enrollment effects differ for vocational courses relative to academic courses that can be
transferred to four-year institutions, and how did trends differ across fields of study? Fourth,
were falling enrollments in the pandemic concentrated in a few community colleges or were
losses spread across all campuses, and did having a larger online presence prior to the pandemic
insulate colleges from enrollment losses? Fifth, how were course loads, completion, and grades
affected by the pandemic?
         We explore these questions for the California Community College system which is the
largest higher educational system in the United States with 116 colleges and 2.1 million students
per year. 2 We find that community college enrolment dropped precipitously in fall 2020
contrasting with slight enrollment increases in the CSU and UC systems. The total number of
enrolled students fell year-over-year by 60,600 students or 4 percent in spring 2020 and by
235,842 students or 15 percent in fall 2020. 3 All racial and ethnic groups experienced large
enrollment drops in spring and fall 2020, but African-American and Latinx students experienced
the largest drops, 17 percent for both groups, in fall 2020. Enrollment fell the most for first-year
students in the community college system, basic skills courses, and fields such as
engineering/industrial technology, education, interdisciplinary studies, and art. Enrollment losses
were observed in every community college in the system. Interestingly, community colleges with
large online presences prior to the pandemic were not protected from losing students as courses
moved online in the pandemic.
         Our administrative data also contain information on academic outcomes among enrolled
students. Conditional on enrollment, student course loads were similar before and during the
pandemic. However, there were significant changes in course completion rates and grade

States, and 30 percent of all Californians ages 18-24 (CCCCO 2020).

  Data from fall 2020 might overstate enrollment losses due to misinterpretation of data that coincides with variation
in college/district submission and verification as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The California Community
College Chancellor's Office is reviewing the processes in consultation with college and district stakeholders to
produce complete, accurate, and verified revised data.

distributions, especially during the spring of 2020. From spring 2019 to spring 2020, course
completion dropped from 73 to 70 percent. The underlying cause was that a much higher
percentage of students withdrew or dropped their courses, while course fail rates decreased
substantially. The percentage of course grades of "A" increased from 40 percent in spring 2019
to 50 percent in spring 2020 whereas the percentage of courses with B's and C's decreased. Most
of these patterns were similar in fall 2020 but to a lesser extent.
        An examination of the impacts of COVID-19 on community colleges is especially
important. Community colleges enroll nearly half of all students attending public universities and
more than half of all minority students. Since community colleges, in addition to providing
workforce training, serve as an important gateway to 4-year colleges, they can be seen as a
crucial part of the post-secondary educational system in the United States. In fact, in some states,
including California, nearly half of all students attending a 4-year college previously attended a
community college. 4 With recent calls for major expansions in enrollments and provision of 4-
year transfer courses, one can expect that community colleges will gain even further
importance. 5 Impacts of the pandemic on community colleges are therefore likely to have major
effects on the educational system as a whole.
        These results build on the findings from a few related studies of the early effects of the
coronavirus on college enrollments and success. We provide the first analysis of changes in
community college enrollment and outcomes due to COVID-19 and for the fall semester of 2020
when online courses were anticipated. The California Community College system provides an
ideal setting to study these questions because of its size and diversity. The findings also
contribute to the broader literature on the effectiveness of online education which generally finds
worse outcomes for online instruction relative to in-person instruction prior to the pandemic. 6
Revealed preference of students in community colleges, which offer substantial flexibility in
course taking and enrollment, suggest that students generally view online classes as inferior to
in-person classes. The findings also contribute to a more general literature examining
recessionary effects on college enrollments (e.g., Betts and McFarland 1995; Barr and Turner

  In California, transfers from community colleges to the California State University (CSU) system are projected to
increase by 25 percent over the next decade (California Postsecondary Education Commission 2010).

recession, however, resulted in the opposite effect.




2 Recent Trends in Community College Enrollment
We first examine the impact of COVID-19 on how many students enrolled in the California
Community College system. To first think about the timing of potential impacts, on March 11
the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. 7 A few days later, the
San Francisco Bay Area imposed shelter-in-place or social-distancing restrictions (March 16,
2020). Then the State of California imposed restrictions on March 19. New York State followed
the next day, and by early April most states imposed social distancing restrictions that shifted in-
person instruction to online. The timeline suggests that health concerns and shelter-in-place
restrictions would have had their first potential effects during the spring semester of 2020 and
full impacts on fall semester 2020.


2.1 Enrollment Trends
Figure 1 displays the number of students enrolled in the system each semester over the past
decade. Only three community colleges operate on the quarter system so for those colleges we
use fall quarter and spring quarter to line up with fall and spring semesters. Enrollment in
community colleges decreased substantially in spring semester of 2020, which included the
social-distancing restrictions imposed by the state. The total number of enrolled students fell by
60,601 students or 4 percent from spring 2019 as instruction switched from in-person to online. 8
        Enrollment declined even more sharply in fall 2020. Year-over-year (YOY) enrollment
dropped by 15 percent from fall 2019 to fall 2020. Over the entire system there were 235,842
fewer students. As it became clear that classes would not be held in person in fall 2020 and some
classes that could only be held in-person would be cancelled, many students opted to not enroll
in community college. The large drops in enrollment in both spring 2020 and fall 2020 are
evident if we estimate an event-study regression in which we adjust for a time trends and include

  Four community colleges (of which two are very small) have not released their enrollment data as of April 1, 2021.
The reported enrollment change for the system excludes these colleges.

a semester dummy variable. The results do not change from the comparisons of fall 2020 to fall
2019 and spring 2020 to spring 2019, which is expected given the relatively constant level of
enrollment. We focus the remaining analysis on YOY comparisons for simplicity and clarity.
        Appendix Figure 1 extends the time period back to 1992 and displays YOY changes by
semester instead of trends in total enrollment. Only a few years reveal changes that were similar
in magnitude to the change from spring 2019 to spring 2020. The change in student enrollment
from fall 2019 to fall 2020 was much larger than changes in any year over the last two decades.
        In contrast to these patterns, enrollment in the California State University and University
of California systems did not fall from fall 2019 to fall 2020. 9 Figure 2 displays undergraduate
enrollment totals for both systems of higher education. In the CSU system, total undergraduate
enrollment increased by 2,355 students or 0.8 percent. Total undergraduate enrollment in the
University of California system increased by 328 students or 0.1 percent. Selective admissions
allowed both systems to maintain enrollment levels in the pandemic.


2.2 Patterns by Race and Ethnicity
        The California Community College system has a diverse student body with 50 percent
Latinx, 12 percent Asian, 6 percent African-American, and 25 percent non-Latinx white students.
Did enrollment fall disproportionately among minority students? Figure 3 displays YOY changes
in student enrollment for major racial and ethnic groups. African-American enrollment dropped
by 6 percent from spring 2019 to spring 2020, and by 17 percent from fall 2019 to fall 2020.
Latinx students, who represent nearly half of all students statewide, experienced a drop of 2
percent in spring 2020 and 16 percent in fall 2020. Asian students experienced YOY drops of 3
percent in spring 2020 and 12 percent in fall 2020, while white, non-Latinx students experienced
a larger drop in spring 2020 (9 percent) but a similar drop in fall 2020 (13 percent). 10 Thus, while
all racial and ethnic groups experienced large drops in enrollment during the pandemic, African-
American and Latinx students had the largest drops in the fall of 2020.


2.3 What Types of Students Stopped Enrolling in Community College?

  In addition to the California Community College System, the California State University and University of
California systems are part of the California master plan for higher education.

   In the California Community College system, Filipino student counts are not included in Asian student counts.
Filipino students experienced enrollment YOY drops of 5 percent in spring 2020 and 10 percent in fall 2020.

                                                         5
The California Community College system classifies students into several categories related to
their current or previous enrollment in a community college, another college, or high school.
Students in these groups having varying levels of attachment to education and therefore may
have responded differently to the pandemic and switch to fully online courses. Table 1 reports
enrollment totals and changes in enrollment for different classifications of students, focusing on
the large enrollment drop from fall 2019 to fall 2020. The largest YOY drops in enrollment in the
pandemic were for first-time students in the community college system. First-time student
enrollments fell by 22 percent in fall 2020. Apparently, many high school graduates chose not to
start college when it became clear that classes would be held remotely. Enrollment fell by 18
percent among students returning to the community college after taking time off from college.
Enrollment might have dropped for this group for similar reasons as first-year students. These
students had more flexibility or less attachment, and decided to skip or defer enrolling in
community college because of the shift to online courses and other educational disruptions
caused by the pandemic.
       Community college students continuing with their educations experienced a smaller,
though still substantial, drop in enrollment of 12 percent from fall 2019 to fall 2020. Another
group that likely to did not want to disrupt their longer-term education plans were first-time
transfer students. These are students transferring between community colleges in the system or
from a college outside of the system. Among these transfer students there was a decrease in
enrollments of 15 percent. Special admit students, primarily high-school students taking
community college courses, decreased slightly in the fall of 2020 (-1 percent). High school
students taking courses at community colleges might not have had as much flexibility to drop
classes given the requirements and strict timeline for graduating from high school. Also, the
tradeoff for these students was between taking a high school class online or a community college
class online.
       Although not reported, from spring 2019 to spring 2020 enrollment also dropped among
all of the groups of students. The one exception was for special admit students who experienced
a large increase in enrollment. The drops in enrollment were the largest again for those students
who might have the most flexibility and least attachment to community college ­ first-year
students (generally coming straight out of high school) and first-time transfer students. All of
these enrollment losses were much smaller than from fall 2019 to fall 2020.

                                                 6
2.4 Enrollment Losses by Course Type and Field
Were there differences in enrollment losses across general types of courses? Figure 4 displays
YOY changes in course enrollments for remedial skills, credit, degree applicable, transfer and
vocational courses. 11 Course taking for remedial skills experienced the largest drop from fall
2019 to fall 2020 with a reduction of 35 percent. But, overall no basic course type was spared
from large drops in enrollments in the pandemic. Vocational course enrollment fell by 16
percent. Academic courses that are transferable to four-year colleges such as the CSU and UC
systems fell by 13 percent. 12
         Were some fields of study spared enrollment losses in fall 2020 and others hit especially
hard? In conversations with officials at various community colleges we learned that the primary
response to the pandemic was that colleges did not drop sections for classes but instead switched
to teaching them remotely. The main exceptions were that programs such as nursing and medical
fields were considered essential and were generally taught in-person even in spring 2020.
Colleges continued to operate a handful of allied health programs in-person that would train
medical professionals to help with the community response to COVID. On the other hand, the
small subset of courses that were impossible to convert to online instruction because of
dependence on physical facilities (e.g. automotive, aviation, cosmetology, culinary arts, dental
hygiene, horticulture and welding) were cancelled.
         Table 2 reports enrollment changes from fall 2019 to fall 2020 by field. Some fields
experienced large enrollment losses in the pandemic. Among larger fields, Education,
Engineering and Industrial Technologies, Fine and Applied Arts, and Interdisciplinary Studies
each lost at least 20 percent of enrollment from fall 2019 to fall 2020. On the other side of the
spectrum, Physical Sciences, Biological Sciences, and Foreign Language experienced enrollment
losses of 3 percent or less in fall 2020. These results indicate that losses were felt across a wide
range of fields of study and were not limited to only a few fields. But, there is some evidence of



11
   Remedial courses do not count for credit towards degrees and transfer to other colleges. Vocational courses
provide credit for vocational degrees and certificates. Transfer courses provide credit for transfer to 4-year colleges
such as CSUs and UCs. Courses are not limited to one category.
12
   Partly reflecting pre-pandemic decisions and commitments the number of incoming transfer students to the CSU
and UC systems from California community colleges increased by 8 percent and 4 percent, respectively, from fall
2019 to fall 2020.

                                                           7
largest reductions in fields in which online learning might be inferior (e.g. industrial
technologies, teaching aides, art, and police training).


2.5 College Losses and Pre-Pandemic Online Share
Were enrollment losses felt by all community colleges or were they concentrated in only a few
colleges? Figure 5 displays the distribution of enrollment losses from fall 2019 to fall 2020
across community colleges in the system. Every college in the system experienced at least some
loss in enrollment in fall 2020. A large number of colleges experienced losses in the range of 8 to
18 percent. Only a handful of college experienced losses of less than 2 percent, while enrollment
fell by more than 20 percent for several colleges in the system.
       Did the relative online presence of community colleges prior to the pandemic limit
enrollment losses? This would be the case if, for example, colleges with more pre-existing online
offerings had an easier time transitioning courses online while maintaining quality, or if they
serve students who are more willing and accustomed to taking online courses. Many community
colleges in the system had strong online-distant learning presences before the pandemic. Using
data from fall 2019, we identify the online percentage of course enrollments for each community
college. Community colleges differed in the percentage of their courses that were held online
before the pandemic. The interquartile range is nearly 10 percentage points with 13 percent
online at the 25th percentile and 22 percent online at the 75th percentile.
       Figure 6 displays a scatterplot of the percent change in student enrollment from fall 2019
to fall 2020 by the online share of course enrollments in fall 2019. Each point represents a
different community college in the system. There does not appear to be a strong relationship
between student enrollment changes and pre-pandemic online shares. The point estimate from a
linear regression through the data is small, negative and not statistically significant. Apparently,
having a larger online presence prior to the pandemic did not protect colleges from enrollment
losses in fall 2020.


3 Student Outcomes
3.1 Course Completion and Grades
We turn to examining student success in courses and how this changed during the pandemic. We
first focus on course completion as the main outcome potentially affected by the shift to remote

                                                  8
learning. Figure 7 displays course completion rates since fall 2012. Course completion is defined
as receiving a passing grade in the course relative to failing, dropping or withdrawing from the
course. Course completion trended upwards and reached a high of 73 percent in spring 2019. In
spring 2020 course completion dropped to 70 percent. Course completion also declined in fall
2020 from the previous year but only slightly (71 percent to 70 percent). 13 In the past few years
there is a strong seasonal component (i.e. fall vs. spring) to course completion, and thus we focus
on YOY changes within fall or spring semester.
         The major cause of the decrease in course completion rates in spring 2020 is that a much
higher percentage of students withdrew or dropped courses during the semester. 14 Figure 8
displays course withdraw/drop rates and course fail rates, which are the primary reasons for not
completing courses. While course withdrawals increased substantially in spring 2020, this was
offset by a large reduction in course fail rates. In fall 2020 both withdraw/drop rates and fail rates
reversed course. However, withdraw rates are still higher than pre-pandemic fall 2019 levels.
Partially offsetting this effect on course completion, however, fail rates remained lower in fall
2020 than fall 2019.
         The decrease in fail rates in courses might be due in part to instructors being more lenient
in grading during the pandemic. Table 3 reports the distribution of grades from spring 2019 to
spring 2020. The percentage of courses with A's increased from 40 percent in spring 2019 to 50
percent in spring 2020 whereas the percentage of courses with B's and C's decreased. The shift
in the grade distribution is too large to be fully explained by the increased withdrawal rate among
students who would have otherwise earned low grades. Thus, there is evidence that instructors
were more lenient in awarding high grades during this period.
         The unanticipated disruption in spring 2020 resulted in more changes in course
completion, withdrawals and grades than during fall 2020. It was well known among students
that fall 2020 would be held online, and thus adjustments might have already been made through


13
   There is some evidence that course completion rates declined more at community colleges with higher shares of
underrepresented minority students (data are not available on the full grade distribution by student race). From linear
regressions using college-level data, we find that an increase in college minority share of 10 percentage points is
associated with larger course completion rate declines of 0.3 percentage points in spring 2020 and 0.4 percentage
points in fall 2020. Both relationships are statistically significant.
14
   Withdraws and drops differ in that drops are withdraw actions taken early in the quarter and thus do not show up
on a student's transcript. A regular withdraw that is done later in the quarter shows up on the student's transcript and
can create probationary problems in rare cases. Withdraws recorded as drops represent only 1 percent of all
withdraws.

enrollment decisions and by instructors in their teaching methods. Those students enrolling in
online courses during fall 2020 likely did so with full knowledge that courses would be taught
remotely. Instructors were more prepared to teach their classes remotely.


3.2 Course Loads
       The pandemic might have also impacted the number of units taken by students, affecting
their longer-term time to degree or transfer preparedness. One possibility is that students dislike
online learning and might have shifted their total units downward, taking only the most
important courses that they needed and postponing others. Alternatively, with higher
unemployment, students may have pursued more full-time education. Table 4 reports the
distribution of students taking different unit loads from spring 2019 to fall 2020. On average,
course loads did not change substantially. The percent of students taking 15 or more units, for
example, was 10 percent in fall 2019 and 11 percent in fall 2020. Similarly, the percent of
students taking 15 or more units was 10 percent in both spring 2019 and fall 2020. While it may
be the case that students who remained enrolled tended to be those inclined to take higher course
loads, the lack of significant changes in the distribution of unit totals provides some evidence
that there was not a major shift towards lower or higher loads during the pandemic.


4 Conclusions
       We use administrative college-level panel data covering the universe of students and
courses in the 116-college California Community College System to provide the first analysis of
COVID-19 impacts on community college students. We find that the pandemic had a large effect
on student enrollment in the system: a loss of roughly 61,000 students from spring 2019 to spring
2020 and approximately 240,000 students from fall 2019 to fall 2020. The enrollment drop of 15
percent in fall 2020 is unprecedented. These patterns contrast sharply with slight enrollment
increases in the CSU and UC systems. As noted above, actual losses might be less severe
because of some misinterpretation of data by colleges, but are likely to still be very large and
might only be a couple of percentage points lower.
       All racial and ethnic groups experienced large enrollment effects in the spring and fall of
2020, but African-American and Latinx students experienced the largest drops. Enrollment fell
the most for first-year students in the community college system, for basic skills courses, and

                                                 10
fields such as engineering/industrial technology, education, interdisciplinary studies, and art.
Enrollment losses were felt throughout the community college system, and colleges with larger
online presences prior to the pandemic were not insulated from these effects.
        Our administrative data also contain detailed information on unit loads, withdrawals,
completions, and grade distributions. In the disruption to courses caused by COVID-19 in spring
2020, there was a substantial drop in course completion among community college students.
Withdrawals and drops for courses in the spring increased despite evidence that, if anything,
professors awarded higher grades. Fall course completion was not as impacted, perhaps
reflecting the fact that students were aware that courses would be online and opted not to enrol.
Instructors also had more time to adjust to teaching their courses remotely, potentially affecting
course quality. Although it is too early to tell, these disruptions to course outcomes might have
derailed some students from obtaining degrees and transferring to four-year colleges, and
ultimately have a longer term effect on earnings. 15
        This first view of changes in enrolment and academic outcomes at community colleges in
the pandemic suggests that COVID-19 created a major and unprecedented disruption to
education. The results in this paper raise a number of interesting questions for future study as
more data becomes available. First, it will be important to shed additional light on why
enrolment at community colleges was so much more sensitive to the pandemic and the shift to
online courses than was four-year college enrolment. In particular, the interplay between labor
market opportunities, college cost, and fields of study seem especially compelling. Second, it
will be important to examine whether reductions in enrolment ultimately reduce the fraction of
students who earn associate's degrees or transfer to four-year colleges, and whether short-run
reduction in enrolment translate into permanent reductions in educational attainment that affect
future labor market returns. And finally, from the college perspective, the revenue losses from
losing nearly 250,000 students in the California community college system will be severe and
likely have looming budgetary consequences. Thus, it will be important to document how
community colleges address these issues and the effects this has on future educational
opportunities for low-income and minority students.

 The broader losses from the pandemic on learning, earnings and economies might be large (Hanushek and
Woessmann 2020).
