       This paper estimates and evaluates the contributions of R&D tax incentives and publicly

financed R&D investment policies in promoting growth of output and privately funded R&D

investment in US manufacturing industries. Publicly financed R&D induces cost savings but

crowds out privately-financed R&D investment while the incremental R&D tax credit and

immediate deductibility provision of R&D expenditures have a significant impact on privately

financed R&D investment. The optimal mix of both instruments is an important element for

sustaining a balanced growth in output and productivity in the manufacturing sector.

Introduction'

     An important characteristic of R&D investment which distinguishes it from

other types of investment is that its output has the properties of public

goods: It can be considered at least partially non-excludable and non-

rivalrous (see Arrow (1962), Spence (1984), and Romer (1990)). Indeed, the

empirical literature provides evidence that not only is the rate of return of

privately-funded R&D very high compared to that of investment in physical

capital, but, more importantly, its social rate of return is several times

higher than its private rate of return (see, for instance, Cohen and Levin

(1989), Griliches (1979, 1991), Mohnen (1989, 1990) and Nadiri (1980, 1993))

This suggests that there are substantial externalities associated with R&D

investment,   and therefore privately-financed R&D is suboptimal and may require

the direct or indirect support of government.

    Theoretically, there are many different ways to deal with market failure

associated with externalities.2 For instance, externality-generating

activities can be encouraged by providing subsidies, by granting producers

property rights and charging differential prices for their use by others, by

allowing firms to internalize the externality and, finally, by having the

government engage directly in externality-generating activities. Indeed, in

the postwar period, the US government has followed a combination of these

policies: establishment of innovators' property rights through the patent

system, encouragement of firms to form joint R&D ventures, direct investment

of R&D through R&D contracts with companies, universities and other nonprofit

institutions, and lastly, tax incentives for company-financed R&D.

    The objective of this paper is to evaluate the contributions of tax

incentives and public financing of R&D investment policies in promoting growth

of output and productivity of the US manufacturing industries. First, we
                                     -2-



provide econometric evidence of the effects of R&D tax policies in stimulating

privately-funded R&D.3 We are particularly interested in calculating the

effect of R&D tax credit and of treating R&D expenditures as an operating

expense rather than capital expenditures. To put it differently, we are

interested in measuring how much private R&D investment would have fallen if

the R&D tax credit were abolished and if R&D expenditures were treated as

capital expenditures similar to the expenditures on plant and equipment.

Second, we investigate the existence and extent of the spillover effects of

publicly-funded R&D capital on the cost structure of manufacturing industries

at a disaggregated level.

   A number of studies have examined the effect of industry-specific,

publicly-financed R&D granted to firms in specific industries. The empirical

results have been thus far inconclusive.' In contrast, however, we are

interested in evaluating the effects on growth and productivity of publicly

financed R&D performed within the industries (internal R&D) as well as the

effects of publicly financed R&D performed in other industries and non-profit

institutions (external R&D). This type of spillover effect of publicly-

financed R&D has not, to our knowledge, yet been studied. Finally, we

evaluate these policies by estimating (i) a social benefit-cost ratio of

publicly-financed R&D, and (ii) the additional privately-funded R&D

expenditures generated by the R&D tax policies relative to the foregone

government tax revenues.

    To achieve these objectives, we estimate a cost function dual to a

production function where, except for the traditional inputs, the rental price

of company-financed R&D capital, and the capital of publicly-financed R&D

explicitly enter into the cost function. Our results suggest that, on the one

hand, publicly-financed R&D induces cost savings but crowds privately-financed

R&D investment. On the other hand, the incremental R&D tax credit introduced

in 1981 and the immediate deductibility provision of R&D expenditures,

especially the latter, have a substantial inducement effect on private R&D

expenditures in the manufacturing sector.



The Model and Empirical Implementation

    The theoretical basis of our model is the standard neoclassical production

function augmented to include three R&D capital stocks, one financed by the

industry and two publicly financed R&D, one performed within the industry and

the other outside, which may capture potential spillover benefits from

government-financed R&D activities. We assume that firms within an industry

minimize their post-tax long-run cost of production subject to the production

function, and that the two types of publicly-financed R&D are unpaid inputs of

production. The post-tax long-run cost function of an industry at time t     is
given by


                C — C (p, y, C; t),                                           (1)

where p is a vector of the after-tax rental price of inputs, y is the

industry's output, and C is the vector of publicly financed R&D capital

stocks.

    To estimate the productive effects of government's R&D tax policy, we need

to know the elasticity of company-financed R&D with respect to its own price,

and the cross-price elasticities of all other inputs with respect to the price

of R&D, as well as the effect of tax incentive on the after-tax rental price

of company-financed R&D. A convenient feature of duality theory is that the

second derivatives of cost function with respect to input prices, i.e., the

Bordered Hessian matrix C —   (82C/8pp),    correspond to the input demand price
                                                -4-



derivatives (see Diewert (1974) or Varian (1984)). The effect of tax

incentives on the input demands can therefore be calculated in a

straightforward manner by estimating a cost function like (1), and by knowing

the effect of tax incentives on the rental price of company-financed R&D.

    In addition, the effect of publicly-financed R&D stocks can be estimated

by observing that its derivative of cost, 8C/3C ("               0),    corresponds to the cost

change due to an additional unit of public R&D. If the sign is negative, a

positive externality exists, while a positive sign indicates the existence of

a negative externality. The marginal benefits or marginal willingness to pay

functions for the publicly financed R&D stocks can be defined as


                b3(p, y, G; t)         —    - ÔC/3C1.                                               (2)
                                                                                   s —    I,   E;



b3 measures the benefit, in terms of cost reduction, gained by an industry

due to an increase of a unit of government-financed R&D capital (see Diewert

(1986)).

    We specify a translog cost function, assuming that industry h employs four

private inputs, namely labor, intermediate inputs, physical capital

(structures plus equipment), company-financed R&D capital, and two publicly-

financed R&D capital stocks. The post-tax cost function is given by


           in Ch,p    —        +   a   Dh +   (     +   a   D") in Yb

           +    (fit +     a   Dh) in w +           t+           in Yb   in

                                                                                    i,'j —     L,K,R;

                                                                                         h —

where C, •w, Y, t, C, D denote, respectively, total production cost (C —

xi),   the vector of relative input prices with respect to the price of

materials, p,1 (w1 — p1/p,1). output, a time shift variable representing

exogenous technological change or other time-specific effects experienced by

the industries, the two publicly-financed R&D capital, and a set of dummy

variables capturing industry specific effects. The subscripts i and j denote

the own inputs, and h the industries; the subscripts M, L, K, R, denote,

respectively, the intermediate inputs, labor, physical capital, and the

industries' privately-financed R&D capital. The two types of publicly

financed R&D capital stocks are distinguished by the subscript s.                C1 refers

to publicly financed R&D performed internally in the industry and GE refers to

publicly financed R&D performed outside of the industry in question. The

parameters        capture the externalities generated from the public R&D capital.

The existence of parameters a and -y enables us to capture industry specific

effects as deviations from the                and parameters. The coefficients of the

dummy variables have been normalized such that for the industry n, a —                  -—
0.

       Applying Shephard's lemma (Diewert (1974)), the following share equations

are obtained:


       S —    +a     Dh             In Yb +    in w +   fi1 t   +   4'1 in G5,           (4)

                                                                                  i —   L,K,R;
                                                                                  s —   I, E;
                                                                                  h —   l,.,n,
where S —     p   x /     Gb.       The share of the input used for the normalization is

calculated by S —         I     -     S. Shares are affected by publicly-financed R&D

capital stocks and the parameter                 determines the factor bias effect

associated with these stocks in each industry.

   The Hessian matrix (a2C/8p8p) should be negative semi-definite in order

for the cost function to be concave in input prices. In addition, for the

cost function to be convex in C, the matrix (32C/3GIGE) should be positive

semi-definite. Note that in order for the technology set to be convex, all of

the above conditions should be satisfied (see Diewert (1986)). Furthermore,

in order for the spillovers to have a meaningful context, the cost function

should be non-increasing in C. Finally, the cost function must be non-

decreasing in output, and linear homogeneous in input prices (see Jorgenson

(1986)). The last condition is automatically satisfied, since we have

normalized with the price of intermediate inputs.

     The model is applied in a sample of twelve manufacturing industries, plus

three groups of industries which were aggregated because the National Science

Foundation does not provide R&D data individually. The sample covers all

industries of the manufacturing sector, which are reported in table 1. The

estimation period covers the years 1956 to 1988. A detailed description and

construction of the variables of the model are reported In the appendix.5

Assuming that the errors attached to equations (3) and (4) are optimizing

errors, they are jointly normally distributed with zero expected value, and

with a positive definite symmetric covariance matrix. The data on industries

are pooled and the estimation is carried out with the full information maximum

likelihood estimator.

     Our estimation results are reported in table 2.6 The individual

parameter estimates have a high t-statistic, and R2 of the estimating

equations are high. The standard errors of the regressions are quite low,

indicating a good fit. The parameters associated with government-financed R&D

capital stocks are statistically significant, which implies that there are

indeed spillovers associated with publicly-funded R&D capital. In addition,
                                            -7-



the coefficients of industry dummy variables (not reported) were also jointly

statistically significant, implying interindustry differences in technology.

   A number of hypothesis tests were carried out based on the likelihood

ratio test. These tests are reported in table 3.                 First, we tested whether

the production technology across industries is the same or whether industries

have the same technology only for the private inputs. These hypotheses are

rejected as indicated by the chi-square statistics shown in the first and

second rows of table 3.      Second, we tested whether the cost function is

independent of publicly-financed R&D. We reestimated the model by setting all

publicly financed R&D parameters equal to zero, only the "internal public" R&D

parameters equal to zero and finally the "external public" R&D parameters

equal to zero. The log of likelihood function as well the chi-square

statistic of these tests are reported in the third, fourth and fifth rows of

table 3 respectively. These hypotheses were also decisively rejected. We

also tested that industries do not experience exogenous technological shocks.

This hypothesis was also clearly rejected (see table 3, sixth row). Finally,

we parametrize differently our model to test the hypothesis that the marginal

benefits of the two types of public capital are the same. Instead of the two

public capital variables being entered separately in the cost function we

specify one publicly financed R&D variable by in (C +                (l+w)     C1) which can be

approximated   by In C0 + w   ir1, where C0 —     GE
                                                       +      and w1 —   G1   / C0.   The null

hypothesis    is   that the marginal effects on cost are equal, ie., ' — 0.                 This

hypothesis    is also rejected with an estimated value of w equal of 3.71 (std.
err.—.485).


The Effects of R&D Tax      Policy   on Cost Structure
    The federal government, recognizing the                importance of R&D investment for
economic growth and international competitiveness, has historically treated

R&D investment more favorably than other kinds of investments. The federal

government basically uses two kinds of tax policy instruments to stimulate R&D

expenditures. One, in place since 1954, is the immediate deductibility

provision of company—financed R&D expenditures, and the other is the direct

R&D tax credit introduced by the Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA) of 1981.

The ERTA, in addition to the introduction of the Accelerated Recovery System

(ARCS) for investment in plant and equipment, introduced an incremental R&D

tax credit for qualified research expenditures. Firms were eligible to claim

either 25% credit if their R&D expenditures exceeded the average of R&D

spending of the three previous years or half of the credit if they were above

twice the base. This credit was initially intended to expire at the end of

1985, but was renewed at a rate of 20% for two additional years in the Tax

Reform Act of 1986 (TRA).7

    In order to see the effect of these two R&D tax    incentives      on the price of

R&D, assume that a firm   incurs   $1 of R&D expenditures in excess of its R&D

expenditures in the past three years. With an incremental tax credit of 25%,

this means that the cost to the firm will be reduced by $1 x .25—$.25.

However, the $1 increase in R&D expenditures decreases the incremental R&D tax

credit for the next three years by $.33 x .25 —    $.083 for each year, since the
credit is based on the average of the R&D expenditures of the three previous

years. Thus with a discount rate of 10% the net tax reduction of a $1

increase in R&D expenditures is $.25 -     (_ $.083   / (1 +   .1O))    —   .045$, and
the actual post-tax cost of the expenditures is $1 -     $.045    $.9S5.

    Consider now the effect of the immediate deductibility provision of R&D

expenditures. Suppose that the corporate income tax rate is 46%; then the tax

reduction is $.46, and the after-tax cost of R&D expenditures $1 -          $.46
                                                -9-



$.54. Combining these two incentives, the after-tax cost of $1 of R&D

expenditures is $1 -   $.46   -   $.045— $.495, i.e., about 50% less than its before

tax cost.

    In order for the firms to benefit from the tax incentives, they must have

sufficient taxable income. In addition, in the case of incremental R&D tax,

Eisner et. al (1984) have estimated that in 1981 and 1982 about 25% and 35%,

respectively, of the firms in the manufacturing sector did not claim the

incremental R&D tax credit either because they did not increase their R&D

expenditures over the base or they did not have sufficient federal income tax

liabilities. Also note that the incremental character of the credit in some

cases might even make the effective rate negative (see, Eisner et al. (1984)

and Hall (1992)). In the absence of information, we assume that the firms in

our sample of industries have enough tax liabilities, and that the increase of

their R&D expenditures was greater than the base but less than twice the base.

    Under the above assumptions, let u be the corporate income tax rate,

the incremental R&D tax credit, and A a parameter taking values of 1 if there

is immediate expensing of R&D expenditures, but values less than 1 otherwise.8

The after-tax cost of R&D expenditures is given by qg (1 - A u, -           v   c),   where

   is the acquisition price, v —       (1   -         .33/(1+r)) and r is the discount

rate.9 Table 4 shows the after-tax cost of $1 R&D expenditures for the period

1981 to 1988. The average after-tax cost of $1 R&D expenditures for this

period is about $.55, where the contributions of immediate expensing and the

incremental R&D tax credit are about .42 and .038 respectively.

     Let the after-tax rental price of R&D capital services (PR) be defined by

the equality between the post-tax cost of acquisition and the present value of

future rentals (see for instance Hall and Jorgenson (1967)), then the post-tax

rental price of company-financed R&D capital is given by
                                                          -10-

where r is the discount rate and 5R                      is   the depreciation rate of company-

financed R&D capital. For a given level of output, the effect of a change in

tax incentives (T) on the demand of R&D capital stock and on the other inputs

is given by

 intermediate inputs vary from one industry to another.
                                                             Conversely, the own
 price   elasticity of company-financed R&D capital does not
                                                               vary much from
 industry to industry.'0 The own   price   elasticity of private R&D capital
 ranges from -l in the three aggregates textile and apparel

 scientific instruments (38). The company-financed R&D
                                                            elasticity estimated in
 this study is in the middle range of own
                                             price elasticities of R&D reported in
 the literature. Hines (1991) has estimated
                                                 a price elasticity of company..
 financed R&D about -1.2, Hall (1992) about -1, while Nadiri and Prucha

 (l994b), Bernstein and Nadiri (1989) have
                                               reported a price elasticity of total
 R&D (company- plus publicly-financed) of about -0.4 to -0.5. Our estimates

are closer to Hall (1992) and Hines's (1991). The
                                                       difference between our
estimates of own price elasticity of company-financed R&D and the estimates of

Bernstein and Nadiri and Nadiri and Prucha
                                               can be explained by the fact that
the elasticities estimated by those authors pertain to total R&D performed by

the industry, ie., company-financed as well as publicly-financed and thus

respond less to price changes.

    Another interesting observation that emerges from table 5 is that company-

financed R&D capital and physical capital are substitutes. In high R&D

intensive industries, however, this relation is rather weak. It also seems

that a change in the price of company-financed R&D affects physical capital

relatively less than a change in the price of physical capital affects

company-financed R&D capital; This has a very important implication for

public policy since the tax policy for structures and equipment will have

significant indirect effects on the R&D investment.     Cordes (1984), for
instance, has argued that the Accelerated
                                            Recovery System, introduced in 1981
for plant and equipment investment, has reduced the relative price of physical
                                          -12-



 capital in comparison to that of R&D capital. Thus the introduction of an

 incremental R&D tax credit Was necessary to restore to some degree the

 incentives for R&D investment.
                                     Finally, while company-financed R&D is a
 substitute for labor, it is a complement of intermediate inputs in low R&D

 intensive industries, but a weak substitute in high-tech industries, such as

 chemical (28), machinery (35), electrical equipment (36), transportation

 equipment (37), and scientific instruments (38).

     The average elasticities of cost, labor, physical capital, R&D capital and

 intermediate inputs with respect to incremental R&D tax credit are reported in

 table 6.11 This table has been constructed by
                                                     multiplying the input price
elasticities by the percentage change of rental R&D price due to a change in

the incremental R&D tax credit. Similarly, in table 7, we present the average

elasticities of the cost and input demands with respect to the rate of

immediate expensing of R&D expenditures.
                                                 Clearly, a change in the rate of

expensing has a much larger effect, by almost ten times, than a change in

incremental R&D tax credit. This is because the immediate deduction of R&D

expenditures constitutes about 90% to 96% of the reduction of the cost of R&D,

while the incremental R&D tax credit constitutes the rest. The effect of the

incremental R&D tax credit is small but
                                           nevertheless significant. Both
effects are relatively larger in the low R&D intensive industries than in

high-tech industries, reflecting the fact that industries with a long

tradition of R&D investment respond less
                                            to the cost changes of R&D investment
This is consistent with the evidence from the tax forms of 1981, 1982 and

1983, (see Cordes (1988, 1989))
                                   showing that, after the introduction of R&D
tax credit, the high-tech
                            manufacturing industries reported smaller increases
in the R&D expenditures than the
                                   other manufacturing industries.
   Based on our estimates, the
                                   incremental R&D tax credit had generated about
                                          - 13-


 $2.5 billion dollars (on average) of additional R&D expenditures per year at

 the manufacturing sector for the period 1981-1988. This estimate is

 consistent with that reported by Baily and Lawrence (1992) and Hall (1992).

If it is adjusted with the eligibility ratio of about .63 (see Eisner et al.

 (1984)), the R&D credit has stimulated about $1.6 billion dollars of

additional R&D expenditures per year.12           However, it should be noted that

this estimate might be bias upwards since there is evidence that many firms

redefined activities as R&D, after the introduction of R&D tax credit as noted

by Mansfield (1994).

      Suppose now that the government, instead of allowing the immediate

deductibility of R&D investment, allows only the economic depreciation of R&D

expenditures to be deducted from current income. With a discount rate and

depreciation rate of 10% (see footnote 8), this implies that the value of the

parameter A is .5, and will account on average for a roughly 35% decline of

R&D expenditures, or about $16 billion dollars per year for the manufacturing

sector as a whole. Combining this estimate with the additional expenditures

stimulated by the R&D tax credit, government tax incentives would generate

about $18 billion dollars per year of additional R&D expenditures. This

amounts to approximately 40% of the total privately-financed R&D of the entire

manufacturing sector. Moreover, if one takes into account that government

directly finances about 30% of total R&D performed in the manufacturing

sector, the tremendous support of R&D activity by the federal government is

quite clear.



The   Effects of Publicly-Funded R&D on   the Cost Structure

      An increase of publicly-funded R&D has a significant effect on the cost of

industries if, as has been discussed, the derivatives of cost function with
                                          -14-


respect to publicly-financed R&D capital stocks are different from zero.

Taking the derivative of cost function with respect to internally and

externally performed publicly financed R&D, the elasticity of cost is given by


    — 3m Ch /   3m G     —   +   1h Dh + c in yh              in   +       t     (7)
                                                                       s—I,E
                                                                       h —     l,..,n.
In addition, a change of publicly-financed R&D affects not only the cost

function, but also the demand for inputs. The elasticity of the inputs'

demand is given by


                     —   3m x    /   3m   —      +   (1 /   S) 4               (8)
                                                                       j   — L,K,R,M;
                                                                       s—I,E

If (8) is positive, negative or zero, it implies that the publicly-financed

capital s and the jth private input are complements, substitutes, or

independent, respectively.

    The effects of internal and external publicly-financed R&D on the cost and

input demands are reported in table 8. In addition we have calculated the

effect of total publicly financed R&D, assuming that the distribution of

publicly financed R&D investment across industries remains the same.13         Our
results support the hypothesis that there is a positive externality from

Publicly-financed R&D. This finding is in contrast with other studies which

usually report insignificant or weak effects on productivity from
                                                                       publicly
financed R&D performed within an industry (see for instance Griliches (1980,

1986), and Terleckyj (1974, 1984)). The total effect on cost is significant

in all industries in the manufacturing sector except in primary metals (33).
                                      -15-



A percentage change in publicly financed R&D performed outside of the
                                                                          industry
has significant and much higher percentage effect on cost than the
                                                                        publicly
financed R&D carried out internally, with the exception in primary metals

industry (33) where the cost elasticity of external public R&D is

statistically insignificant. However, if we compare the relative marginal

cost reductions (dC'/dG —   Ch/ G)   of internal and external public R&D,

the marginal cost reduction of internal publicly financed R&D is
                                                                    substantially
higher than the external one. For instance, in chemical industry (28), in

1982, the cost elasticity of internal publicly financed R&D is 37% as large as

the cost elasticity of external publicly financed R&D; But since the external

publicly financed R&D is almost 73 times larger than the internal publicly

financed R&D, the marginal cost reduction of internal publicly financed R&D

is about 27 times larger than the external publicly financed R&D. The same is

true for all the other industries, with the relative internal public R&D

marginal cost reduction being larger than the marginal cost reduction of

external publicly financed R&D from 2 times in electrical equipment (36) and

transportation equipment (37) to 142 times in stone, clay and glass products

(32).

    In all industries the labor and intermediate inputs are substitutes with

the internal and external publicly-financed R&D capital. The effect of

internal and external publicly-financed R&D capital on physical capital varies

across industries in terms of the magnitude as well as its direction.

Internal publicly-financed R&D and physical capital are substitutes in all

industries with stronger substitution effect in high-tech industries, like

machinery (35), electrical equipment (36), and scientific instruments (38). On

the other hand physical capital is a weak complement to external publicly

financed R&D in high tech industries or independent in low tech industries.
                                         -16-


    Two   hypotheses   have been advanced between the relationship of publicly-

financed and privately-financed R&D performed by the industries. One supports

the idea that new scientific knowledge resulting from government financed R&D

expands firms' basic knowledge and thus induces the firms own R&D (Goldberg

(1979), Jaffe (1989), Levin and Reiss (1984), Levy and Terleckyj (1983), Link

(1982), Nadiri (1980) and Scott (1984)); the other suggests that publicly-

financed and company-financed R&D are substitutes, because either the output

of public R&D activity is internalized by the firms, or the publicly-financed

R&D performed by the firms causes the firms to reach their full R&D     capacity
(Carmichael (1981), Lichcenberg (1984, 1988) and Nadiri (1980)). Our

estimates seem to support the former hypothesis for the internally performed

publicly financed R&D, and the latter hypothesis for the externally performed

publicly financed R&D. Indeed, company financed R&D and "inside" publicly

financed R&D is a complement in low R&D intensive industries and independent

in high R&D intensive industries. On the other hand, company financed R&D and

"outside" publicly financed R&D are substitutes, especially in the low R&D

intensive industries, where the effect is more than one.

    Overall, our estimates suggest that the spillover effect of publicly-

financed R&D reduces the cost to industries and thus enhances their

productivity growth. However, it seems that the overall effect of publicly-

financed R&D crowds out company-financed R&D in all industries. Indeed, in

low R&D intensive industries the crowding-out effect of publicly-financed R&D

is more than one to one, while in high-tech industries publicly and privately-

financed R&D are weak substitutes, as for instance in machinery (35),

electrical equipment (36), transportation equipment (37) and scientific

instruments (38).

The Effectiveness   of Publicly-Financed R&D   and R&D Tax Policy

    The objective of this section is to evaluate the effectiveness of tax

policies and the federal government's R&D expenditures. As far as the

incremental R&D tax credit is concerned, this can be done by measuring the

additional R&D expenditures generated relative to foregone tax revenues. For

publicly-financed R&D, this can be done by comparing the social benefits and

costs of publicly-financed R&D capital.

    There is some disagreement among economists about the effectiveness of R&D

tax credit. For instance, Mansfield (1985, 1986) has estimated that the

additional R&D expenditures per dollar cost to the government ranges between

$.3 to $.4. Baily and Lawrence (1992) have estimated it to be about $1 to

$1.4. About the same estimates as Baily's are provided by Hines (1991), while

Hall (1992) estimates that the ratio is about 2. These differences in

estimates are basically due to different price elasticities of R&D employed by

the authors. Noting that the tax incentives are subsidies to production, for

a given output the resulting reduction in industry costs is equal to the loss

of government revenue. Thus, we can calculate the ratio of additional R&D

capital services over the foregone government revenue by


                r—          PR X5 / )h iç Ci',                          (9)


where the numerator is the sum of additional R&D capital services over all

industries and the denominator is the foregone government revenues. Our

estimate implies an average of additional R&D per dollar of government revenue

lost to be about .95 for the period 1981 to 1988 for all industries in our

sample. Comparing this ratio with the findings reported in the literature as

noted earlier, our estimate is in the middle range. If the upwards bias due

to redefinition of activities as R&D is ignored, it appears that the R&D tax
                                       -18-



credit has had a modest but significant impact in stimulating R&D investment.

Moreover, if one takes into account the induced output effect from increases

of R&D expenditures, as well as the extent to which there are spillovers from

privately-financed R&D (and the empirical literature supports this hypothesis

(see for instance, Nadiri (1991)), and company-financed R&D and R&D spillovers

are complements, then the benefit-cost ratio of incremental R&D tax credit

will be substantially higher.

    Turning now to the evaluation of the relative effectiveness of publicly-

financed R&D, assume that the social planner's objective is to maximize the

producer surpluses generated by publicly-financed R&D. Then the sum of

marginal benefit over industries can correspond to a measure of social

benefit.'4 This measure, however, is crude, since the effects of publicly-

financed R&D capital on the rest of the economy, as well as the benefits of

the particular projects for which has been financed, are not taken into

account.. Nevertheless, the ratio of benefits to cost of an additional unit of

total publicly-financed R&D is given by


                           —
                                h -q   (C'/C0) /   q                      (10)


where the numerator of (10) is the sum of marginal benefits of industries from

an additional unit of total publicly-financed R&D capital, and the denominator

the marginal cost of an additional unit of publicly-financed R&D capital taken

to be equal to its acquisition price qc Table 9 shows the marginal benefit

of total publicly financed R&D, C0. For each additional unit of total

publicly-funded R&D, in 1982 industries are willing to pay from 0 in primary

metals (33) to ll in electrical equipment(36). The sum of marginal benefits

is 78 for each additional unit of publicly-funded R&D capital, which implies

that the rate of return of publicly-funded R&D, calculated using equation (10)
                                     -19-



is about .78 in 1982. This suggests that there might be underinvestment of

publicly financed R&D, and that government should increase its investment.

    In fact, as Mansfield (1986) has pointed out, some economists have argued

that government should abolish the incremental R&D tax credit because it is

ineffective, and instead increase publicly financed R&D expenditures by the

amount of revenues saved. If this were done, what would be the impact on the

industries' production cost and R&D investment in the manufacturing sector?

As noted earlier, the effect of the two instruments on company-financed R&D

are quite different. The publicly-financed R&D crowds out privately-financed

R&D investment, while the R&D tax credit induces it. In table 10 we report

the results of the following experiment: First, we assume that for the year

1988 the government abolishes the incremental R&D tax credit and also that it

allows only the economic depreciation of R&D expenditures to be deducted from

the current income. Given our estimates of tables 6 and 7, these assumptions

would imply that the additional cost for the industry or the revenues saved by

the government would be about $16.9 billion. Second, we assume that the

government increases the publicly financed R&D by the exact amount of revenues

saved which represents a 3.6% increase of publicly financed R&D. Using the

total cost elasticities of table 8, the cost reduction of all industries due

to a 3.6% increase of publicly financed R&D would be $18.2 billion. Thus the

manufacturing sector would be better off by $1.3 billion in terms of potential

cost reduction. However, the reduction of R&D tax incentives would increase

the rental price of company-financed R&D which would reduce R&D investment by

$16.2 billion. Onto that amount we have to add an additional $0.9 billion of

reduction of company-financed R&D investment due to the crowding out effect of

a 3.6% increase of publicly-financed R&D.

    Thus, keeping the government budget constant, an equiproportional change
                                     -20-



of R&D tax incentives and publicly-financed R&D would reduce R&D investment in

all industries of the manufacturing sector, and reduce the after-tax cost of

the whole sector (see table 10). However, the net effect on cost would not be

the same for all industries. Publicly-financed R&D has a distributive effect:

High-tech industries, for instance, machinery (35), electrical equipment (36),

and transportation equipment (37), would be worse off, i.e., their after-tax

costs would have increased. On the other hand, low-tech industries, for

instance, food and kindred products (20) and other manufacturing industries

(42), would be better off. This of course is not surprising since the low-

tech industries have very small R&D cost shares, and thus the removal of the

subsidies has relatively smaller effect on their cost.



Conclusion

    We have examined the effects of publicly-funded R&D and R&D tax policy on

the cost structure of the manufacturing industries at the two-digit level. It

has been shown that the effects of publicly-financed R&D are overall

significant and vary across industries. We also found that the publicly

financed R&D performed inside a particular industry has a stronger marginal

effect on cost savings compared to that of the publicly financed R&D performed

outside of an industry. Furthermore, the results show that publicly-financed

R&D and company-financed R&D are substitutes in low R&D intensive industries,

while weak substitutes in high R&D intensive industries. Thus, an increase in

publicly-financed R&D capital increases the efficiency, in ternis of unit cost

savings, of the industries of the manufacturing sector, but crowds out

privately-financed R&D investment. On the other hand, our results suggest

that the incremental R&D tax credit is modestly successful in inducing

company-financed R&D. However, if the government had to switch to a regime
                                     -21-



where R&D expenditures were treated like tangible investment, there would be a

substantial reduction in privately-financed R&D investment. It seems that

publicly-financed R&D investment is a more appropriate tool for increasing

efficiency and possibly for stimulating output growth, while the R&D tax

policy is a more appropriate tool for stimulating private sector's R&D

investment. Therefore, both instruments, subsidies and direct financing of

publicly financed R&D expenditures, are important elements for sustaining

output growth and productivity increase in the manufacturing sector.

OUTPUT (7), LABOR     (L),   PHYSICAL CAPITAL (K), AND INTERMEDIATE INPUTS (M):

     Data on the quantities and priceindices of output, labor, physical

capital and intermediate inputs were obtained from the Bureau of Labor

Statistics (BLS) for the manufacturing industries at the two-digit level,

reported in table 1. The sample covers the period from 1956 to 1988. All

price indices have been normalized to be equal to one at 1982 value.

      For each industry, the quantity of output is measured as the value of

gross output divided by the output price index. The value of gross output

corresponds to shipments plus the change of inventories, and is inclusive of

any portion which is consumed by the same industry. The output price deflator

index is implicitly defined by a Tornqvist aggregation of four-digit gross

outputs.

      The labor input quantity is measured as the cost of labor divided by the

price of labor index. The labor input is measured in terms of man hours,

estimated by the BLS Current Establishment Survey. It corresponds to the sum

of   hours of all persons engaged in production in the industry. The price

deflator of labor is measured implicitly by dividing the labor compensation by

the labor hours.

      The price of intermediate inputs is derived by a Tornqvist index of the

price indices of materials, energy, and purchased services, obtained from ELS.

The quantity of intermediate inputs is measured as the total cost of

materials, energy, and purchased services divided by the price index of

intermediate inputs.         All price deflators of the above inputs have been

constructed implicitly by using a Tornqvist index to aggregate the

corresponding quantities .

      Since own   R&D is explicitly introduced as an input of production, the
                                        -23-


quantities of labor and intermediate inputs are adjusted for their R&D

components in order to avoid double counting (see Schankerman (1981)). For

labor, the R&D labor cost, i.e., the wages of scientists, engineers, and

supporting personnel, has been subtracted from the total labor cost; for

intermediate inputs, the materials and supplies component of R&D has been

subtracted from the total intermediate input cost. The overhead cost

component of R&D weighted by the cost share of labor and intermediate inputs

has been subtracted from both labor and intermediate inputs. The R&D cost

components have been obtained from Research and Development in Industry

(various issues). Finally, the prices of output, labor and intermediate

inputs are multiplied by one minus the corporate income tax to convert them to

after-tax prices. For the period before 1981, the corporate income tax rate

has been obtained from Auerbach (1983) and Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981); for

the period 1981 to 1985, the rate remains the same at .46, while it was

reduced to .34 in 1986 by the Tax Reform Act (TRA).

    The physical capital stock is defined as the sum of structures and

equipment capital stock which have been constructed by the perpetual inventory

method. The deflator of physical capital is derived as a Tornqvist index of

the investment price deflators of structures and equipment.

    The rental rate of physical capital is measured as PK —     q   (r+6K)(l -


u a)   (see Bernstein and Nadiri (1987)), where q is the physical capital

deflator, r is the discount rate taken to be the rate on Treasury notes of

ten-year maturity obtained from Citibase, 8K    is   the physical capital

depreciation rate obtained from 61.5,      is the investment tax credit, u, is

the corporate income tax rate, and a is the present value of capital

consumption allowances. The investment tax credit until 1980 is taken from

Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981); 8% is used for 1981, and 7.5% for 1982 to 1985;
                                       -24-


finally,   the rate is zero for 1986 when it was abolished by the TRA. The

present values of capital consumption allowances are constructed as a — p      (1. -



O £K)/(r + p)   (see Bernstein and Nadiri (1987)), where p is the capital

consumption allowance rate obtained by dividing the capital consumption

allowances by the capital stock, and B takes value 0 except for the 1962-1963

period in which firms had to reduce the depreciable base of the assets by half

of the amount of the investment tax credit under the Long Amendment Act.

COMPANY-FINANCED R&D (R) AND PUBLICLY FINANCED R&D (C):

    Privately-financed R&D capital is constructed using the perpetual

inventory method with a 10% depreciation rate. A constant depreciation rate

of 10% has been used in many studies of R&D spillovers (see, for instance,

Bernstein and Nadiri (1990) and U.S. Department of Labor (1989)). An estimate

consistent with a 10% depreciation rate for the R&D capital has also been

obtained by Nadiri and Prucha (1994a) in a dynamic production model where the

depreciation rate of R&D capital is endogenously determined. The deflated

company-financed R&D expenditures are accumulated for the period 1956-1988.

The initial privately-financed R&D capital stock is found by dividing the real

R&D expenditures of the year 1957 by the sum   of   the R&D depreciation rate and

the average growth rate of physical capital for the period 1948-1956. The

company-financed R&D expenditures have been obtained from Research and

Development in Industry (various issues). The price deflator of R&D capital

is constructed by linking Mansfield's (1987) constructed deflator series

backward with Schankerman's (1979) constructed R&D deflator series, and

forward with the GNP deflator. Mansfield's R&D deflator series goes from 1969

to 1983. Schankerman's goes from 1957 to 1975. For       the years   prior to 1957

and after 1983, the Schankerman and Mansfield deflators are linked to the CNP

deflator. The after-tax rental rate of R&D capital is defined by the equation
                                       -25-


(5) in the text (see discussion there and table 4).

      The total government R&D capital stock, C0, and the publicly financed R&D

performed within an industry 01 are constructed along the same lines as

company-financed R&D capital stock, i.e., by using the perpetual inventory

method with a 10% depreciation rate. Data on total federal government

financed R&D expenditures for the period 1970-1988 were obtained from the

Federal Funds for Research and Development (1992). For the period 1953-1970,

they were obtained from Historical Statistics. Colonial Times to 1970 (1975).

These series consist of the total publicly-financed R&D expenditures performed

by the industries, government agents, and nonprofit institutions. The

implicit price deflator of government purchases of goods and services,

obtained from the Statistical Abstracts of the United States (1990), was used

to deflate the R&D expenditure series. The 1952 benchmark is estimated by

dividing the R&D expenditures by the sum of government R&D depreciation rate

and the growth rate of the government physical capital stock (obtained from

the Bureau of Economic Analysis) prior to the sample period. Similarly, for

each industry we constructed the internally publicly financed R&D capital

stock C, obtaining data on industry publicly financed R&D expenditures from

Research and Development in Industry (various issues). Then the external

publicly financed R&D capital Stock for each industry is defined as GE —    G     -

    See, for instance, Arrow (1969), Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980), and Varian
(1984)

  Evidence of the effectiveness of R&D tax incentives in encouraging
privately-financed R&D spending is somewhat mixed. Evidence from tax
returns (Cordes (1989, 1988)). from surveys (Mansfield (1985, 1986)), from
comparisons of the user cost (Cordes (1984), Cordes et al. (1987), Fullerton
and Lyon (1983), and Hulten and Robertson (1984)), and from econometric
estimates (Baily et al. (1985), Baily and Lawrence (1992), Hines (1991), and
Hall (1992)) are not unambiguous. See Cordes (1988, 1989) for a review.

  Studies conducted at the industry or firm level, which usually estimate
total factor productivity regressions (see Leonard (1971), Terleckyj (1974,
1984), Criliches (1980, 1986), Griliches and Lichtenberg (1984) and
Lichtenberg and Siegel (1989)), have not found any evidence of a significant
productivity effect from government funded R&D. Barteisman (1990) has
provided a mixture of evidence, while Nadiri and Mamuneas (1994) and
Mamuneas (1993)), in a cost function framework, have found significant
effects of total publicly-funded R&D. For a collection of case studies
dealing with the effects of federal government's R&D policy see Nelson
(1982).

 Half of the industries in our sample, especially the low tech industries,
perform trivial or zero amounts of publicly-financed R&D. Since the
logarithm of zero is not defined, for the purpose of estimation we redefined
the logarithm of internally performed public R&D as in z — in (1 + G1).
This transformation does not affect the parameter estimates but should be
taken into account when elasticities are calculated.
6
   We have imposed constant returns to scale on conventional inputs- -labor,
capital, and intermediate inputs- -while the privately financed R&D capital
is allowed to capture the degree of internal returns to scale in the
industry. This was a necessary restriction, since preliminary estimation of
a more general cost function caused thereturns to scale to be unreasonably
high and unstable. The technological change parameters consistently had the
wrong sign, making it difficult to distinguish shifts of the cost function
due to scale or technological change over time.    Also note that we
initially experimented with a more flexible functional form of cost
function. These attempts were also not fruitful since the second order
conditions were always violated.

      The credit has from then renewed at a rate of 20%. See Hall (1992) for a
    brief history of the credit rate, qualified expenditure rules and base
    levels during the period 1981-91.

8 The parameter A can be considered as the rate with which R&D expenditures
are allowed to be deducted in the current period. To see the significance
of immediate expensing of R&D expenditures compare it with the case in which
the government allows only the economic depreciation of R&D expenditures to
be deducted from current income. The present value of the depreciation
deductions of $1 of R&D with a depreciation and discount rate of 10% is
equal to .50 (— .l0/(.l0+.lO)) and the parameter A takes the value .50.

  For 1981 &' — (I- .5/(l+r)-_2 .33/(l+r)) since for 1982 the base was the
average of R&D expenditures of 1980 and 1981 (see Eisner et al. (1984)).


10 However, the hypothesis that the mean elasticities are equal across
industries has been tested and rejected.

11 The elasticity of Cost with respect of Tax incentives is given by

          , —ainc1 /alnTS         (3lnp/8lnT)
12 Cordes (1989) has estimated that the credit stimulated about $560
million to $1.5 billion, while Hall (1992) has estimated that the additional
spending stimulated is about $2 billion 1982 dollars per year.

14 Kaizuka (1965) was the first to derive the conditions of production
efficiency when collective goods are used as inputs in the production
process. Sandmo (1972) explored the general equilibrium implications of
these conditions.
