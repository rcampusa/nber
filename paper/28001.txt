                                       ABSTRACT

Labor market frictions are crucial for the equity premium in production economies. A dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium model with recursive utility, search frictions, and capital
accumulation yields a high equity premium of 4.26% per annum, a stock market volatility of
11.8%, and a low average interest rate of 1.59%, while simultaneously retaining plausible
business cycle dynamics. The equity premium and stock market volatility are strongly
countercyclical, while the interest rate and consumption growth are largely unpredictable.
Because of wage inertia, dividends are procyclical despite consumption smoothing via capital
investment. The welfare cost of business cycles is huge, 29%.

1        Introduction

Mehra and Prescott (1985) show that the equity premium (the average difference between the stock

market return and risk-free interest rate) in the Arrow-Debreu economy is negligible relative to its

historical average. Subsequent studies have largely succeeded in specifying preferences and cash flow

dynamics to explain the equity premium in endowment economies (Campbell and Cochrane 1999;

Bansal and Yaron 2004; Barro 2006). Unfortunately, explaining the equity premium in general equi-

librium production economies, in which cash flows are endogenously determined, has proven more

challenging.1 To date, no consensus general equilibrium framework has emerged. Consequently,

finance and macroeconomics have largely developed in a dichotomic fashion. Finance specifies "ex-

otic" preferences and exogenous cash flow dynamics to match asset prices but ignore firms, whereas

macroeconomics analyzes full-fledged general equilibrium production economies but ignore asset

prices with simple preferences (Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans 2005; Smets and Wouters 2007).

        This macro-finance dichotomy has left many important questions unanswered.                           What are

the microeconomic foundations underlying the exogenously specified, often complicated cash flow

dynamics in finance models (Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron 2012; Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and

Ursua 2013)? What are the essential ingredients in the production side that can endogenize the key

elements of cash flow dynamics necessary to explain the equity premium? To what extent do time-

varying risk premiums matter quantitatively for macroeconomic dynamics? How large is the welfare

cost of business cycles in an equilibrium production economy that replicates the equity premium?

        Our long-term objective is to formulate a unified equilibrium theory that explains the equity
    1
     Rouwenhorst (1995) shows that the standard real business cycle model cannot explain the equity premium
because optimal investment of firms provides a powerful mechanism for the representative household to smooth con-
sumption, yielding little consumption risks. With internal habit preferences, Jermann (1998) and Boldrin, Christiano,
and Fisher (2001) adopt capital adjustment costs and cross-sector immobility, respectively, to restrict consumption
smoothing to match the equity premium. However, both models struggle with excessively high interest rate volatilities
because of low elasticities of intertemporal substitution. Using recursive utility, Tallarini (2000) shows that increasing
risk aversion in a real business cycle model improves its fit with the market Sharpe ratio but does not materially
affect macro quantities. However, the model fails to match the equity premium and its volatility. Kaltenbrunner
and Lochstoer (2010) show that long-run consumption risks arise endogenously from consumption smoothing in a
real business cycle model, but the model falls short in explaining the equity premium and stock market volatility.

premium puzzle, while simultaneously retaining plausible business cycle dynamics. We embed

the standard Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides search model of equilibrium unemployment into a dy-

namic stochastic general equilibrium framework with recursive utility and capital accumulation.

When calibrated to the consumption growth volatility in the Jord`
                                                                a-Schularick-Taylor macrohistory

database, the model succeeds in yielding an equity premium (adjusted for financial leverage) of

4.26% per annum, which is close to 4.36% in the historical data. The average interest rate is 1.59%,

which is not far from 0.82% in the data (the difference is insignificant). However, the stock market

volatility is 11.8% in the model, which, although sizeable, is still significantly lower than 16% in

the data. Also, the model implies strong time series predictability for stock market excess returns

and volatilities, some predictability for consumption volatility, and weak to no predictability for

consumption growth and the real interest rate. Quantitatively, the model explains stock market

predictability but somewhat overstates consumption growth predictability in the historical data.

   Wage inertia plays a key role in our model. To keep the model parsimonious, we work with the

Nash wage that features a low bargaining weight of workers and a high flow value of unemployment.

This calibration implies a wage elasticity to labor productivity of 0.256 in the model. Hagedorn

and Manovskii (2008) estimate this elasticity to be 0.449 in the U.S. postwar 1951­2004 sample.

Drawing from historical sources (Kendrick 1961; Officer 2009), we extend the Hagedorn-Manovskii

evidence and estimate the wage elasticity to be 0.267 in the historical 1890­2015 sample.

   Unlike endowment economies, in which cash flows can be exogenously specified to fit the equity

premium, the main challenge facing general equilibrium production economies is that cash flows

are often endogenously countercyclical. With frictionless labor market, wages equal the marginal

product of labor, which is almost as procyclical as output and profits (output minus wages). Alas,

investment is more procyclical than output because of consumption smoothing, making dividends

(profits minus investment) countercyclical (Kaltenbrunner and Lochstoer 2010). With wage iner-

tia, profits are more procyclical than output. The magnified procyclicality of profits is sufficient to

overcome the procyclicality of investment (and vacancy costs) to render dividends procyclical. In

                                                  2
addition, wage inertia is stronger in bad times, with smaller profits. This time-varying wage inertia

amplifies risks and risk premiums in bad times, giving rise to time series predictability of the equity

premium and stock market volatility. Finally, despite adjustment costs, investment still absorbs a

large amount of shocks, making consumption growth and the interest rate largely unpredictable.

   Risk aversion strongly affects quantity dynamics, in contrast to Tallarini (2000). In comparative

statics, reducing risk aversion from 10 to 5 lowers the equity premium to 0.54% per annum. More

important, consumption volatility falls from 5.13% to 3.93%, and consumption disaster probability

from 5.83% to 3.82%. A lower discount rate raises the marginal benefit of hiring and reduces the un-

employment rate from 8.63% to 4.63%. Echoing Hall's (2017) partial equilibrium analysis, our gen-

eral equilibrium results indicate that it is imperative to study quantity and price dynamics jointly.

   Our model predicts downward-sloping term structures of the equity premium and equity volatil-

ity, consistent with Binsbergen, Brandt, and Koijen (2012). Intuitively, when the search economy

slides into a disaster, short-maturity dividend strips take a big hit because of inertial wages. In con-

trast, long-maturity strips are less impacted because disasters are followed by subsequent recoveries.

Also, despite recursive utility calibrated to feature the early resolution of uncertainty, the timing

premium (the fraction of the consumption stream that the investor is willing to trade for the early

resolution) is only 15.3% in our model. Intuitively, the expected consumption growth and condi-

tional consumption volatility in our search economy are much less persistent than those typically cal-

ibrated in the long-run risks model, thereby avoiding its pitfall of implausibly high timing premiums.

   Finally, the average welfare cost of business cycles is huge, 29.1%, which is more than 580 times

of 0.05% in Lucas (2003). More important, the welfare cost is countercyclical with a long, right

tail. In simulations, its 5th percentile of 18.4% is not far below its median of 24.4%, but its 95th

percentile is substantially higher, 56.3%. As such, countercyclical policies aimed to dampen disaster

risks are even more important than what the average welfare cost estimate of 29.1% would suggest.

   We view this work as a solid progress report toward a unified theory of asset prices and business


                                                   3
cycles. This holy grail of macro-finance has proven elusive for decades. Petrosky-Nadeau, Zhang,

and Kuehn (2018) show that the standard search model exhibits disaster dynamics. However, their

asset pricing results are very limited because of no capital. Capital is particularly important for asset

prices because it represents the core challenge of endogenizing procyclical dividends in production

economies (Jermann 1998). We embed capital and recursive utility simultaneously to study asset

prices with production, while overcoming ensuing heavy computational burden. Bai (2020) incorpo-

rates defaultable bonds to study the credit spread. We instead focus on the equity premium puzzle.

    Embedding rare disasters per Rietz (1988) and Barro (2006) into a real business cycle model,

Gourio (2012) shows that aggregate risks significantly affect quantity dynamics. Echoing Gourio,

we show that Tallarini's (2000) separation between prices and quantities does not hold under more

general settings. However, we differ from Gourio in that disasters arise endogenously from labor

market frictions. We also endogenize operating leverage via wage inertia to explain the equity

premium and stock market volatility. In contrast, Gourio relies on exogenous leverage to gener-

ate volatile cash flows but "does not address the volatility of the unlevered return on capital (p.

2737)." Kilic and Wachter (2018) embed the exogenous Rietz-Barro diasters into the search model

of unemployment to yield a high unemployment volatility and examine its relation with a high

stock market volatility. While our work differs from Kilic and Wachter's in many details, the most

important distinction is, again, the endogenous nature of disasters in our setting.2

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 constructs the general equilibrium model.

Section 3 presents the model's key quantitative results, including the equity premium, stock mar-

ket volatility, and their predictability. Section 4 examines several additional implications of the

model, including the welfare cost of business cycles. Section 5 concludes. Appendix A describes

     Several recent studies have examined the equity premium in general equilibrium production economies but
outside the disasters framework. Croce (2014) embeds exogenous long-run productivity risks into a production
model. While long-run risks increase the equity premium, the return volatility is only about one quarter of that
in the data. Kung and Schmid (2015) endogenize long-run productivity risks via firms' research and development
in an endogenous growth model. Favilukis and Lin (2016) examine the impact of infrequent wage renegotiations in
a stochastic growth model with long-run productivity risks. Finally, Chen (2017) examines a general equilibrium
production model with external habit and emphasizes the role of endogenous consumption volatility risks.

2    A General Equilibrium Production Economy

The economy is populated by a representative household and a representative firm. Following Merz

(1995), we assume that the household has perfect consumption insurance. A continuum of mass

one of members is either employed or unemployed at any point in time. The fractions of employed

and unemployed workers are representative of the population at large. The household pools the

income of all the members together before choosing per capita consumption.

    The household maximizes recursive utility, denoted Jt , given by:
                                                                                     1
                                                                      1-1/         1-1/

in which Ct is consumption,  time preference,  the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, and

 relative risk aversion (Epstein and Zin 1989; Weil 1990). The consumption Euler equation is:


                                         1 = Et [Mt+1 rSt+1 ],                                    (2)


in which rSt+1 is the firm's stock return, and Mt+1 the household's stochastic discount factor:
                                                                            1 -

                           Mt+1                                        1             .            (3)

The riskfree rate is rf t+1 = 1/Et [Mt+1 ], which is known at the beginning of t.

    The representative firm uses capital, Kt , and labor, Nt , to product output, Yt , with a constant

elasticity of substitution (CES) production technology (Arrow et al. 1961):
                                                                           1
                                                                           
                                               Kt
                                Yt = Xt                 + (1   - )Nt           ,                  (4)
                                               K0

in which  is the distribution parameter, and e  1/(1 -  ) the elasticity of substitution between

capital and labor. When  approaches zero in the limit, equation (4) reduces to the special case of

                                                    5
the Cobb-Douglas production function with a unitary elasticity. To facilitate the model's calibra-

tion, we work with the "normalized" CES function in equation (4), in which K0 > 0 is a scaler that

makes the unit of Kt /K0 comparable to the unit of Nt (Klump and La Grandville 2000). Specifically,

we calibrate K0 to ensure that 1 -  matches the average labor share in the data (Section 3.2). Do-

ing so eliminates the distribution parameter, , as a free parameter.3 Finally, the CES production

function is of constant returns to scale, Yt = Kt Yt /Kt + Nt Yt /Nt (the Internet Appendix).

       The firm takes the aggregate productivity, Xt , as given, with xt  log(Xt ) governed by:


                                      xt+1 = (1 - x )x + x xt +  x            t+1 ,                                 (5)


in which x is unconditional mean, 0 < x < 1 persistence,  x > 0 conditional volatility, and                   t+1   an

independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) standard normal shock. We scale x to make the av-

erage marginal product of labor around one in simulations to ease the interpretation of parameters.

       The representative firm posts a number of job vacancies, Vt , to attract unemployed workers, Ut .

Vacancies are filled via the Den Haan-Ramey-Watson (2000) matching function:

                                                               Ut Vt
                                           G(Ut , Vt ) =                  ,                                         (6)
                                                           (Ut + Vt )1/

in which  > 0. This matching function has the desirable property that matching probabilities fall

between zero and one. In particular, define  t  Vt /Ut as the vacancy-unemployment (V /U ) ratio.

The probability for an unemployed worker to find a job per unit of time (the job finding rate) is
                                        -1/
f (t )  G(Ut , Vt )/Ut = 1 + -
                             t
                               
                                              . The probability for a vacancy to be filled per unit of time
                                                              -1/
(the vacancy filling rate) is q (t )  G(Ut , Vt )/Vt = (1 + t)    . It follows that f (t ) =  t q ( t ) and

q ( t ) < 0. An increase in the scarcity of unemployed workers relative to vacancies makes it harder

to fill a vacancy. As such, t is labor market tightness, and 1/q ( t ) the average duration of vacancies.

       The representative firm incurs costs in posting vacancies. The unit cost per vacancy is given by
   3
     In contrast, in prior applications of the CES production function in asset pricing, the distribution parameter, ,
is largely treated as a free parameter (Favilukis and Lin 2016; Kilic and Wachter 2018; Bai 2020).

 > 0. The marginal cost of hiring, /q ( t ), increases with the mean duration of vacancies, 1/q ( t ).

In expansions, the labor market is tighter for the firm ( t is higher), and the vacancy filling rate,

q (t ), is lower. As such, the marginal cost of hiring is procyclical.

   Jobs are destroyed at a constant rate of s per period. Employment, Nt , evolves as:


                                     Nt+1 = (1 - s)Nt + q ( t )Vt ,                               (7)


in which q ( t )Vt is the number of new hires. Population is normalized to be one, Ut + Nt = 1,

meaning that Nt and Ut are also the rates of employment and unemployment, respectively.

   The firm incurs adjustment costs when investing. Capital accumulates as:


                                    Kt+1 = (1 -  )Kt + (It , Kt ),                                (8)


in which  is the capital depreciation rate, It is investment, and

                                                                        1-1/

                          t  (It , Kt ) = a1 +                                  Kt ,              (9)
                                                     1 - 1/       Kt

is the installation function with the supply elasticity of capital  > 0. We set a1 = /(1 -  ) and

a2 =  1/ to ensure no adjustment costs in the deterministic steady state (Jermann 1998). This

parsimonious parametrization involves only one free parameter,  .

   The dividends to the firm's shareholders are given by:


                                     Dt = Yt - Wt Nt - Vt - It ,                                 (10)


in which Wt is the equilibrium wage rate. Taking Wt , the household's stochastic discount factor,

Mt+1 , and the vacancy filling rate, q ( t ), as given, the firm chooses optimal investment and the

optimal number of vacancies to maximize the cum-dividend market value of equity, St :

subject to equations (7) and (8) as well as a nonnegativity constraint on vacancies, Vt  0. Because

q (t ) > 0, Vt  0 is equivalent to q (t )Vt  0. In contrast, equation (9) implies that  t /It =

a2 (It /Kt )-1/ , which goes to infinity as investment, It , goes to zero. As such, It is always positive.

   From the first-order conditions for It and Kt+1 , we obtain the investment Euler equation:

                    1/                                         1/
         1    It                      Yt+1   1          It+1                          1 It+1
                         = Et Mt+1         +                        (1 -  + a1 ) +               .   (12)
         a2   Kt                      Kt+1 a2           Kt+1                          - 1 Kt+1

Equivalently, Et [Mt+1 rKt+1 ] = 1, in which rKt+1 is the investment return:

              Yt+1 /Kt+1 + (1/a2 )(1 -  + a1 ) (It+1 /Kt+1 )1/ + (1/( - 1))(It+1 /Kt+1 )
     rKt+1                                                                                       .   (13)
                                              (1/a2 ) (It /Kt )1/


   Let t be the multiplier on q (t )Vt  0. From the first-order conditions with respect to Vt and

Nt+1 , we obtain the intertemporal job creation condition:

                                    Yt+1                                   
                      - t = Et Mt+1      - Wt+1 + (1 - s)                         - t+1     .        (14)
               q (t )               Nt+1                                q ( t+1 )

Equation (14) implies that Et [Mt+1 rN t+1 ] = 1, in which rN t+1 is the hiring return:

                               Yt+1 /Nt+1 - Wt+1 + (1 - s) (/q ( t+1 ) - t+1 )
                     rN t+1                                                    .                     (15)
                                              /q ( t ) - t

Finally, the optimal vacancy policy also satisfies the Kuhn-Tucker conditions:


                              q (t )Vt  0,   t  0,       and   t q ( t )Vt = 0.                      (16)



   Under constant returns to scale, the stock return of the representative firm, rSt+1 , is a weighted

average of the investment return and the hiring return (the Internet Appendix):

                                 Kt Kt+1                   N t Nt+1
                   rSt+1 =                      rKt+1 +                   rN t+1 ,                   (17)
                             Kt Kt+1 + N t Nt+1         KtKt+1 + N t Nt+1

in which the shadow value of capital, Kt , equals the marginal cost of investment, (1/a2 )(It /Kt )(1/ ) ,

and the shadow value of labor, N t , equals the marginal cost of hiring, /q ( t ) - t .


                                                    8
   The equilibrium wage rate is determined endogenously by applying the sharing rule per the out-

come of a generalized Nash bargaining process between employed workers and the firm (Pissarides

2000). Let   (0, 1) be the workers' relative bargaining weight and b the workers' flow value of

unemployment. The equilibrium wage rate is given by (the Internet Appendix):

                                             Yt
                                   Wt =         + t       + (1 -  )b.                                (18)
                                             Nt


   The wage rate increases with the marginal product of labor, Yt /Nt , and the vacancy cost per

unemployed worker, t . Intuitively, the more productive the workers are, and the more costly for

the firm to fill a vacancy, the higher the wage rate is for the employed workers. In addition, the

workers' bargaining weight,  , affects the wage elasticity to labor productivity. The lower  is, the

more the equilibrium wage is tied with the constant b, reducing the wage elasticity to productivity.

   The competitive equilibrium consists of optimal investment, It , vacancy posting, Vt , multiplier,

t , and consumption, Ct , such that (i) Ct satisfies the consumption Euler equation (2); (ii) It satisfies

the investment Euler equation (12), and Vt and t satisfy the intertemporal job creation condition

(14) and the Kuhn-Tucker conditions (16), while taking the stochastic discount factor, Mt+1 , in

equation (3), and the equilibrium wage in equation (18) as given; and (iii) the goods market clears:


                                          Ct + Vt + It = Yt .                                        (19)



   Solving for the competitive equilibrium is computationally challenging. We adapt Petrosky-

Nadeau and Zhang's (2017) globally nonlinear projection method with parameterized expectations

to our setting (Appendix A). The state space consists of employment, capital, and productivity.

We parameterize the conditional expectation in the right-hand side of equation (14) and solve for

the indirect utility, investment, and conditional expectation functions from equations (1), (12), and

(14). We use Rouwenhorst's (1995) discrete state method to approximate the log productivity with

17 grid points. We use the finite element method with cubic splines on 50 nodes on the employ-


                                                    9
ment space and 50 nodes on the capital space and take their tensor product on each grid point of

productivity. To solve the resulting system of 127,500 equations, we use the derivative-free fixed

point iteration with a small damping parameter (Judd, Maliar, Maliar, and Valero 2014).


3        Quantitative Results

We describe our data in Section 3.1 and calibrate the model in Section 3.2. We examine the model's

unconditional moments in Section 3.3, sources of the equity premium in Section 3.4, and time-

varying risks and risk premiums in Section 3.5. Finally, we report comparative statics in Section 3.6.

3.1       Data

For business cycle moments, we use the historical cross-country panel of output, consumption,

and investment from Jord`
                        a, Schularick, and Taylor (2017), who in turn build on Barro and Urs´
                                                                                            ua

(2008). For asset pricing moments, we use the Jord`
                                                  a et al. (2019) cross-country panel. We obtain

                      a-Schularick-Taylor macrohistory database.4 The database contains macro
the data from the Jord`

and return series for 17 developed countries. The only missing series are returns for Canada, which

we supplement from the Dimson-Marsh-Staunton (2002) database purchased from Morningstar. Al-

though the Dimson-Marsh-Staunton database contains asset prices and the Barro-Urs´
                                                                                 ua database

provides consumption and output series for more countries, we mainly rely on the Jord`
                                                                                     a-Schularick-

Taylor database because it provides quantities and asset prices for the same set of countries. More

important, it also contains investment series. The sample starts as early as 1871 and ends in 2015.5

        Table 1 shows the properties of log growth rates of real consumption, output, and investment

per capita in the historical panel. From Panel A, the consumption growth is on average 1.62%

per annum, with a volatility of 5.45%, and a skewness of -0.67, all averaged across 17 countries.

The first-order autocorrelation is 0.12. The consumption volatility exhibits a substantial amount

    More precisely, in the Jord`
                               a-Schularick-Taylor database, the consumption, output, and investment series start in
1870, meaning that their growth rates start in 1871. The quantities series end in 2016, but asset prices end in 2015.

of cross-country variation, ranging from 2.76% in UK to 8.72% in Belgium. The first-order auto-

correlations also varies widely across countries, ranging from -0.2 in Switzerland to 0.39 in France.

       From Panel B, averaged across countries, the output growth has a mean of 1.78% per annum,

a volatility of 5.1%, a skewness of -1.06, and a first-order autocorrelation of 0.18. The output

volatility of 5.1% is lower than the consumption volatility of 5.45%.6 Finally, Panel C shows

that the investment growth volatility is high on average, 13.5% per annum, varying from 8.2% in

Netherlands to 24.4% in the United States. Its first-order autocorrelation is 0.13.

       Following Barro (2006), we calculate leverage-adjusted equity premium as one minus financial

leverage times the unadjusted equity premium and calculate leverage-adjusted market volatility as

the standard deviation of the leverage-weighted average of stock market and bill returns. We set

leverage to be 0.29, which is the mean market leverage ratio in a cross-country panel reported in

Fan, Titman, and Twite (2012). From Panel D, the leverage-adjusted equity premium is 4.36%

per annum on average, varying from 2.71% in Portugal to 6.8% in Finland. The leverage-adjusted

stock market volatility is on average 16%, ranging from 11.9% in Denmark to 23% in Finland. For

the real interest rate, the mean is only 0.82% across countries. Finland has the lowest mean interest

rate of -0.74%, whereas Denmark has the highest of 3.08%. Finally, the real interest rate volatility

is on average 7.3%, ranging from 4.32% in Australia to 13.22% in Germany.7

       The asset pricing literature has traditionally focused only on the postwar U.S. data. Table S2

in the Internet Appendix reports basic macro and asset pricing moments in the 1950­2015 cross-

country sample. The real consumption, output, and investment growth rates are less volatile, with

standard deviations of 2.4%, 2.47%, and 7.06% per annum, respectively, averaged across countries.

The U.S. macro volatilities are lower still at 1.73%, 2.21%, and 4.98%, respectively. Relatedly,
   6
      As explained in Barro and Urs´ua (2008), government purchases rise sharply in wartime, decrease consumption
relative to output, and raise the consumption volatility relative to the output volatility.
    7
      When calculating the return moments, we require stock, bond, and bill returns to be nonmissing for a given year
in a given country. Relaxing this restriction has little impact on the moments. In Table S1 in the Internet Appendix,
we recalculate the moments with the longest sample possible for each series. The leverage-adjusted equity premium
remains at 4.36% per annum, and the leverage-adjusted stock market volatility rises lightly from 16.04% to 16.08%.
The mean real interest rate increases somewhat from 0.82% to 1.05%, and its volatility from 7.3% to 7.53%.


                                                         11
the consumption, output, and investment growth rates are more persistent in the postwar sam-

ple, with the first-order autocorrelations of 0.46, 0.39, and 0.29, respectively. However, the postwar

leverage-adjusted equity premium is higher than the historical equity premium, 5.38% versus 4.36%.

The leverage-adjusted stock market volatility is also higher in the postwar sample, 17.15% versus

16.04%. The evidence indicates that the postwar U.S. sample might not be representative. As

such, we mostly rely on the historical cross-country panel to calibrate our model.

      For labor market moments, to our knowledge, a historical cross-country panel is unavailable.

As such, we work with the U.S. historical monthly series compiled by Petrosky-Nadeau and Zhang

(2020).8 Following Weir (1992), in addition to civilian unemployment rates, Petrosky-Nadeau and

Zhang construct a separate series of private nonfarm unemployment rates, by subtracting farm and

government employment from both civilian labor force and civilian employment. Because this un-

employment series better depicts the functioning of the private economy (Lebergott 1964), we focus

our calibration on this series. This series dates back to 1890, and the vacancy rate series to 1919.

      From January 1890 to December 2015, the mean private nonfarm unemployment rate is 8.94%.

The skewness and kurtosis of the unemployment rates are 2.13 and 9.5, respectively. In the post-

war sample from January 1950 to December 2015, the mean unemployment rate is lower, 7.65%.

Skewness is also smaller, 0.55, and kurtosis is close to that of the normal distribution, 2.92.

      To calculate the second moments, we follow Shimer (2005) to take quarterly averages of monthly

unemployment and vacancy rates to convert to quarterly series, which are detrended as Hodrick-

Prescott (1997, HP) filtered proportional deviations from the mean with a smoothing parameter of

1,600. We do not take log deviations from the HP trend because the V  0 constraint can be occa-

sionally binding in the model. From 1890 onward, the private nonfarm unemployment volatility is

24.43% per quarter (25.9% with log deviations). From 1919 onward, the vacancy rate volatility is

18.98% (17.36% with log deviations). For labor market tightness (the ratio of the vacancy rate over

the private nonfarm unemployment rate), the volatility is 61.62% (but only 38.38% with log devia-

tions). The U -V correlations are -0.57 and -0.79 across the two detrending methods, respectively.9

3.2      Calibration

We calibrate the model in monthly frequency. We set the time discount factor  = 0.9976 to

help match the mean real interest rate. We set the risk aversion,  , to 10 per the long-run risks

literature (Bansal and Yaron 2004). We set the elasticity of intertemporal substitution,  , to 2

per Barro (2009), who is in part based on Gruber's (2013) microeconomic estimates. Following

Gertler and Trigari (2009), we set the persistence of the log productivity, x , to be 0.951/3 , and set

its conditional volatility,  x , to match the consumption growth volatility in the data. Instead of

the output volatility, we target the consumption volatility, which is more important for the model's

asset pricing properties. This procedure yields a value of 0.015 for  x . This value implies a con-

sumption volatility of 5.13% per annum, which is close to but lower than 5.45% in the data (Table

1). However, the output volatility is 6.43%, which is higher than 5.1% in the data.

       For the CES production function, we set  = -1.5. This  value implies an elasticity of capital-

labor substitution of 0.4, which is the point estimate in Chirinko and Mallick (2017). When cali-

brating the distribution parameter, , we target the average labor share. Gollin (2002) shows that

factor shares are approximately constant across time and space. Table S3 in the Internet Appendix

reports the labor shares for the 12 countries that are in both the Gollin and the Jord`
                                                                                      a-Schularick-

Taylor databases. The average labor shares across the countries from Gollin's first two adjustment

methods are 0.765 and 0.72, respectively, with an average of 0.743. Gollin emphasizes that these

two adjustments "give estimated labor shares that are essentially flat across countries and over time

(p. 471)." As such, we set  = 0.25, which yields an average labor share of 0.746 in simulations.

       The distribution parameter, , is close to one minus the average labor share only in the

"normalized" CES production function, in which the capital unit is comparable to the labor unit
   9
    Labor market volatilities are lower in the postwar sample. From 1950 onward, the private nonfarm unemployment
volatility is 13.81% per quarter, and the vacancy rate volatility is 13.49%. The market tightness volatility is 26.17%,
and the U -V correlation -0.9. Detrending with log deviations from the HP trend yields very similar estimates.

(Klump and La Grandville 2000). We calibrate the capital scaler, K0 , at 13.75 to set the labor share

at the deterministic steady state at 0.75. For comparison, the value of capital at the deterministic

steady state is 16.14. Despite the model's nonlinearity, the labor share is very close across the

deterministic and stochastic steady states. We calibrate the long-run mean of the productivity, x =

0.1887, to target the marginal product of labor, Yt /Nt , around one on average in simulations.10

       The supply elasticity of capital,  , governs the magnitude of adjustment costs. A lower  implies

higher adjustment costs, which reduce the investment volatility but raise the consumption volatility.

Alas, direct estimates of  seem scarce. We set  to 1.25 and the depreciation rate, , to 1.25%. We

set the separation rate, s, to 0.035, which is the average total nonfarm separation rate in the Job

Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) at Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The curvature

of the matching function, , is 1.25, which is based on Den Haan, Ramey, and Watson (2000).

3.2.1      Wage Inertia

We are left with the bargaining weight of workers,  , the flow value of unemployment activities, b,

and the unit cost of vacancy posting, . To match the equity premium without overshooting the

mean unemployment rate, we combine inertial wages and low vacancy costs. Specifically, we set

 = 0.015 and b = 0.91, which yield a wage elasticity to labor productivity of 0.256 in the model.

We set the unit vacancy cost, , to 0.01, to obtain a mean unemployment rate of 8.63%, which is

close to the average private nonfarm unemployment rate of 8.94% in the 1890­2015 sample.

       Is the model implied wage elasticity to labor productivity empirically plausible? Hagedorn and

Manovskii (2008), for example, estimate the wage elasticity to labor productivity to be 0.449 in the

postwar 1951­2004 quarterly sample from BLS.11 However, a voluminous literature on economic

history documents severe wage inertia and quantifies its large impact during the Great Depression.12
  10
     Setting Yt /Nt = 1 at the deterministic steady state yields x = 0.1787. However, Yt /Nt at the stochastic
steady state is somewhat lower than one. As such, we manually adjust x to 0.1887 to yield the desired outcome.
  11
     Both real wages and labor productivity are in logs and HP-filtered with a smoothing parameter of 1,600.
  12
     Prominent examples include Eichengreen and Sachs (1985), Bernanke and Powell (1986), Bernanke and Carey
(1996), Hanes (1996), Dighe (1997), Bordo, Erceg, and Evans (2000), Cole and Ohanian (2004), and Ohanian (2009).




                                                      14
As such, we extend the Hagedorn-Manovskii evidence to a historical U.S. sample.

       To construct a historical series of real wages, we draw elements from Gordon (2016). From

1929 to 2015, we obtain compensation of employees from National Income and Product Accounts

(NIPA) Tables 6.2A­D (line 3, private industries, minus line 5, farms) at Bureau of Economic

Analysis. We obtain the number of full-time equivalent employees from NIPA Tables 6.5A­D (line

3, private industries, minus line 5, farms). Dividing the compensation of employees by the number

of employees yields nominal wage rates (compensation per person). We deflate nominal wage rates

with the personal consumption deflator from NIPA Table 1.1.4 (line 2) to obtain real wage rates.

       From 1890 to 1929, we obtain the average (nominal) hourly compensation of production work-

ers in manufacturing and consumer price index from measuringworth.com (Officer and Williamson

2020a, 2020b). The nominal compensation series from their Web site only has two digits after the

decimal. We instead use the average hourly compensation series, with three digits after the deci-

mal, from Officer (2009, Table 7.1). To obtain an index of hours, we divide the index of manhours

by the index of persons engaged in manufacturing from Kendrick (1961, Table D-II). We multiply

the average hourly compensation series with the hours index to obtain the nominal compensation

per person, which we then deflate with the Officer-Williamson consumer price index to obtain the

series of real wages. Finally, we splice this series in 1929 to the NIPA series from 1929 onward

to yield an uninterrupted series from 1890 to 2015. Splicing means that we rescale the pre-1929

series so that its value in 1929 is identical to that for the NIPA post-1929 series.13 Finally, for labor

productivity, we use the historical 1890­2015 series from Petrosky-Nadeau and Zhang (2020).14 We
  13
     We differ from Gordon (2016) in two aspects. First, Gordon measures real wages as real compensation per
manhour. We instead use real compensation per person that better fits our model with no hours. This practice
seems standard in the macro labor literature (Shimer 2005). Second, Gordon measures nominal compensation as total
compensation of employees from NIPA Table 1.10 (line 2), which includes government and farm employees. We instead
use employee compensation for the private nonfarm sector, which matches the measurement of labor productivity.
  14
     The monthly series is the ratio of a nonfarm business real output series over a private nonfarm employment series.
The real output series draws from Kendrick (1961) and NIPA (from 1929 onward) as well as monthly industrial pro-
duction series (as monthly indicators) from Miron and Romer (1990) and Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (from 1919
onward). The private nonfarm employment series draws from Weir (1992) and Current Employment Statistics at BLS
as well as monthly employment indicators from NBER macrohistory files. From January 1947 onward, the monthly
labor productivity series is benchmarked to the quarterly nonfarm business real output per job series from BLS.

time-aggregate their monthly series into annual by taking the monthly average within a given year.

       We detrend the annual real wages and labor productivity series as log deviations from their HP-

trends with a smoothing parameter of 6.25, which is equivalent to a quarterly smoothing parameter

of 1,600.15 In our postwar 1950­2015 annual sample, regressing the log real wages on the log labor

productivity yields a wage elasticity of 0.406, with a standard error of 0.081. The elasticity estimate

is not far from the Hagedorn-Manovskii estimate of 0.449 in their 1951­2004 quarterly sample.

       More important, in our 1890­2015 historical sample, the wage elasticity to labor productivity

is estimated to be 0.267, with a standard error of 0.066. Deflating the pre-1929 nominal com-

pensation series with the Johnston-Williamson (2020) implicit GDP deflator, as opposed to the

Officer-Williamson (2020b) consumer price index, yields a similar wage elasticity of 0.263, with a

standard error of 0.062. Our evidence that real wages are more inertial in the historical sample ac-

cords well with the economic history literature (footnote 12). In particular, the low wage elasticity

to labor productivity, 0.256, in our model is empirically plausible.

       Our value of b = 0.91 might seem high, as the marginal product of labor is around one in the

model's simulations. However, the value of b includes unemployment benefits, the value of home

production, self-employment, leisure, and disutility of work. Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008) ar-

gue that b should equal the marginal product of capital in a perfectly competitive labor market.

Ljungqvist and Sargent (2017) show that to explain the unemployment volatility, a search model

must diminish the fundamental surplus, which is the fraction of output allocated to the firm by

the labor market. We view our high-b calibration as perhaps the simplest way to achieve this goal.

More important, we view our high-b-low- calibration as a parsimonious metaphor for real wage

inertia. More explicit structures of wage inertia, such as alternating offer bargaining in Hall and

Milgrom (2008) or staggered multiperiod Nash bargainng in Gertler and Trigari (2009), are likely

to deliver similar quantitative results but would complicate our model greatly.16

     Ravn and Uhlig (2002) show that the smoothing parameter should be adjusted by the fourth power of the obser-
vation frequency ratio, which equals four going from the quarterly to annual frequency. In particular, 1600/44 = 6.25.
  16
     The high-b calibration is also of contemporary interest. Ganong, Noel, and Vavra (2020) document that under

3.3     Unconditional Moments

We report basic business cycle, labor market, and asset pricing moments from the model economy.

3.3.1    Business Cycle Moments

From the model's stationary distribution (after a burn-in period of 1,200 months), we repeatedly

simulate 10,000 artificial samples, each with 1,740 months (145 years). The length of each sample

matches the length of the Jord`
                              a-Schularick-Taylor database (1871­2015). On each artificial sample,

we time-aggregate monthly consumption, output, and investment into annual observations. We add

up 12 monthly observations within a given year and treat the sum as the year's annual observation.

For each annual series, we compute its volatility, skewness, kurtosis, and autocorrelations of up to

five lags of log growth rates. For each moment, we report the mean as well as the 5th, 50th, and

95th percentiles across the 10,000 simulations. We also report the p-value that is the fraction with

which a given moment in the model is higher than its matching moment in the data. The fraction

can be interpreted as the p-value for a one-sided test of our model using the moment in question.

    Panel A of Table 2 shows that the model does a good job in matching consumption moments.

None of the p-values for one-sided tests are significant at the 5% level. The consumption growth

volatility in the model is 5.13% per annum, which is close to 5.45% in the data (p = 0.41). Kurtosis

is 8.09 in the model, which is close to 10.34 in the data (p = 0.18). The first-order autocorrela-

tion is 0.21 in the model, which is higher than 0.12 in the data, but the difference is insignificant

(p = 0.78). The autocorrelations at higher orders are close to zero in the model as in the data.

    From Panel B, the output volatility in the model is 6.43% per annum, which is higher than 5.1%

in the data, but the difference is insignificant (p = 0.86). The model falls short in explaining the

skewness, 0.09 versus -1.06, and kurtosis, 5.45 versus 14.09, of the output growth. Both differences

are significant. The model comes close to match the first-order autocorrelation, 0.2 versus 0.18.
the 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, the ratio of mean benefits to mean earnings in the data
is roughly 100%. The median replacement ratio is even higher at 134%. Finally, 68% of eligible unemployed workers
have replacement ratios higher than 100%, and 20% of the workers have replacement ratios higher than 200%.



                                                        17
From Panel C, the investment volatility in the model is only 8.59% per annum, which is lower than

13.53% in the data. The difference is significant, but none of the p-values for other investment

moments are significant. The kurtosis in the model is 7.12, relative to 10.75 in the data (p = 0.08).

The first-order autocorrelation is 0.15 in the model, which is close to 0.13 in the data.

3.3.2   Labor Market Moments

Panel D of Table 2 shows that the model does a good job matching the first four moments of the

unemployment rate. The mean unemployment rate is 8.63% in the model, which is close to 8.94%

in the data (p = 0.37). The skewness is 2.64, relative to 2.13 in the data (p = 0.53), and the

kurtosis, 13.45 versus 9.5 (p = 0.35). The unemployment volatility is 32.2% per quarter, which is

higher than 24.43% in the data. However, the difference is not significant (p = 0.76).

   The vacancy rate volatility is 33.73% per quarter in the model, which is significantly higher

than 18.98% in the data. The volatility of labor market tightness is 33.98%, which is significantly

lower than 61.62% in the data. However, as noted, this data moment is sensitive to detrending

method and is only 38.38% with log deviations from the HP-trend. The unemployment-vacancy

correlation is only -0.07 in the model, which is lower in magnitude than -0.57 in the data. How-

ever, this moment is also sensitive to detrending method. Using the monthly data simulated from

the model with no detrending yields a U -V correlation of -0.475, which is close to the matching

data moment of -0.517, and the difference is insignificant (p = 0.66). Finally, the wage elasticity

to labor productivity is 0.256, and the data moment of 0.267 yields an insignificant p-value of 0.23.

3.3.3   Asset Pricing Moments

Most important, Panel E shows that our general equilibrium production economy succeeds in yield-

ing an equity premium of 4.26% per annum, which is close to 4.36% in the data. The data moment

lies comfortably within the model's 90% confidence interval, with a p-value of 0.34. The mean

interest rate is 1.59% in the model, which is not far from 0.82% in the data. The data moment is

again lies within the model's 90% confidence interval (p = 0.87).

                                                 18
   The model implies a stock market volatility of 11.77% per annum, which is significantly lower

than the data moment of 16.04%, although the U.S. volatility of 13.66% (Table 1) falls within the

model's 90% confidence interval. The model's performance in matching stock market volatility

improves over prior attempts in general equilibrium production economies (Gourio 2012).

   The interest rate volatility in the model is 3.13% per annum, which is significantly lower than

7.3% in the data. The most likely reason is that we do not model sovereign default and hyperin-

flation that are the driving forces behind the historically high interest rate volatilities in Germany,

Italy, and Japan. These destructive forces play only a limited role in the U.S., which has an interest

rate volatility of only 4.65% (Table 1). It is well within the model's 90% confidence interval.

3.4     Sources of the Equity Premium

In this subsection we examine the driving forces behind the model's equity premium.

3.4.1    Dividend Dynamics

Rouwenhorst (1995) points out the difficulty in explaining the equity premium in production

economies. Unlike endowment economies, in which dividends are exogenously specified to fit the

data, dividends are often endogenously countercyclical in production economies. Dividends equal

profits (output minus wages) minus investment. Intuitively, with frictionless labor market, wages

equal the marginal product of labor, which is almost as procyclical as output. With the Cobb-

Douglous production function, the marginal product of labor is exactly proportional to output.

As such, profits are no more procyclical than output. However, due to consumption smooth-

ing, investment is more procyclical than output and profits, rendering dividends countercyclical.

Kaltenbrunner and Lochstoer (2010) demonstrate this insight in a stochastic growth model.

   In contrast, dividends are endogenously procyclical in our search economy. Under the bench-

mark calibration, wages are more inertial than the marginal product of labor, making profits more

procyclical than output. The magnified procyclical dynamics of profits then overpower the pro-



                                                  19
cyclical dynamics of vacancy costs and capital investment to make dividends procyclical.17

       To what extent are the model's implied dividend dynamics empirically plausible? For each coun-

try, the Jord`
             a-Schularick-Taylor macrohistory database provides separate capital gain, dividend-

to-price, and consumer price index series, from which we construct the real dividend series (the

Internet Appendix). Table S4 shows that dividends are procyclical in the historical cross-country

panel. The correlation between the cyclical components of annual dividends and output is on aver-

age 0.11 across the countries, ranging from -0.02 from Portugal to 0.47 in the U.S. Only 3 out of 17

countries have negative correlations, all of which are small in magnitude. The relative volatility of

dividends (the ratio of the dividend volatility over the output volatility) is 8.61 across the countries,

varying from 3.06 from Portugal to 16.81 in Netherlands (3.18 in the U.S.).18 Time-aggregating

annual observations into 3- and 5-year observations raises the dividend-output correlation to 0.31

and 0.35 and lowers the relative volatility of dividends to 6.54 and 5.69, respectively.

       The model explains procyclical dividends but overshoots the dividend-output correlation, 0.947.

The model also underestimates the relative volatility of dividends at 2.89. Both differ significantly

from their data moments. Time-aggregating does not materially affect the model's estimates. The

dividend-output correlations are 0.954 and 0.952, and the relative volatility of dividends 2.83 and

2.74 at the 3- and 5-year frequencies, respectively. In the historical data, there are likely measure-

ment errors in real dividends, which tend to average out over time, yielding higher dividend-output

correlations at longer horizons. In contrast, no such measurement errors exist within the model.

       A possible reason why the model overshoots the dividend-output correlation is that dividends

in the data refer only to cash dividends, but dividends in the model match more closely to net

payouts. Net payouts in the data include not only cash dividends but also share repurchases net of
  17
     Petrosky-Nadeau, Zhang, and Kuehn (2018) examine this mechanism in a baseline search model without capital.
However, with capital, consumption smoothing via investment strengthens the countercyclicality of dividends. We
overcome this core challenge via wage inertia, for which we also provide new, supportive evidence (Section 3.2.1).
  18
     Due to a few zero-dividend observations (7 out of 2,034), we detrend dividend and output series with HP-filtered
proportional deviations from the mean. Using HP-filtered log deviations after discarding the 7 observations yields
a higher dividend-output correlation of 0.24 and a relative dividend volatility of 7.92 averaged across the countries.




                                                         20
equity issuances (Boudoukh et al. 2007). Alas, to our knowledge, a historical sample of net payouts

is not available. Perhaps more important, our model has only one shock, which drives the high

dividend-output correlation, but there exist most likely multiple shocks in the data.

3.4.2    Disaster Dynamics

As shown in Petrosky-Nadeau, Zhang, and Kuehn (2018), the search model of equilibrium unem-

ployment gives rise endogenously to rare disasters. To explain the equity premium, we formulate

a more general model by incorporating both recursive utility and capital accumulation. Disaster

risks in consumption play a key role in explaining the equity premium in our framework.

    To characterize disasters in the data, we apply the Barro-Urs´
                                                                 ua (2008) peak-to-trough method

on the Jord`
           a-Schularick-Taylor cross-country panel of consumption and output. Disasters are iden-

tified as episodes, in which the cumulative fractional decline in consumption or output exceeds a

predetermined hurdle rate. We adopt two such hurdle rates, 10% and 15%.19 We adjust for trend

growth in the data because our model abstracts from growth. We subtract the mean log annual

consumption growth of 1.62% from each consumption growth observation and subtract the mean

log annual output growth of 1.78% from each output growth in the historical data (Table 1).

    Table 3 shows that with a disaster hurdle rate of 10%, the consumption disaster probability is

6.4%, and the output disaster probability 5.78% in the cross-country panel. With a higher hurdle

rate of 15%, the probabilities drop to 3.51% and 2.62%, respectively. The disaster size is 23.2%

and 22.3% for consumption and output with a hurdle rate of 10%, but higher, 30.4 and 32.9, re-

spectively, with a higher hurdle rate of 15%. The duration for consumption and output disasters

lasts 4.2 and 4.1 years with a hurdle rate of 10%, but 4.5 and 5 years with a hurdle rate of 15%.

    The model implied consumption disaster dynamics, which are crucial for the equity premium,
   19
      Suppose there are two states, normalcy and disaster, in a given period. The number of disaster years is the number
of years in the interval between peak and trough for each disaster event. The number of normalcy years is the total
number of years in the sample minus the number of disaster years. The disaster probability is the likelihood with
which the economy switches from normalcy to disaster in a given year. We calculate this probability as the ratio of
the number of disasters over the number of normalcy years. For each disaster event, the disaster size is the cumulative
fractional decline in consumption or output from peak to trough. Duration is the number of years from peak to trough.


                                                          21
are empirically plausible. We simulate 10,000 artificial samples from the model's stationary dis-

tribution, each with 1,740 months, matching the 1871­2015 sample length. On each sample, we

time-aggregate monthly into annual consumption and apply the exact peak-to-trough method as in

the data. From Panel A of Table 3, the disaster probabilities are 5.83% and 3.64%, which are rela-

tively close to 6.4% and 3.51% in the data, with the hurdle rates of 10% and 15%, respectively. The

size and duration of consumption disasters in the model are also close to those in the data, 23.4%

versus 23.2% for size, and 4.1 versus 4.2 years for duration, with a hurdle rate of 10%, for example.

The p-values all indicate that the differences between the model and data moments are insignificant.

   As noted, consumption is more volatile than output in the cross-country panel, likely due to gov-

ernment purchases during wartime (Barro and Urs´
                                               ua 2008). In contrast, consumption is naturally

less volatile than output in production economies because of consumption smoothing. We focus on

matching consumption dynamics because of their paramount importance for the equity premium.

Consequently, the model overshoots output disasters. From Panel B, the output disaster probability

is 10.9%, which is higher than 5.78% in the data (p = 0.97), with a hurdle rate of 10%. With a higher

hurdle of 15%, the disaster probability is 6.1% in the model, which is still higher than 2.62% in the

data (p = 0.94). However, disaster size and duration are relatively close to their data moments.

3.4.3   Consumption Dynamics

We dig deeper by comparing consumption dynamics in the search economy with those specified

in the long-run risks literature (Bansal and Yaron 2004). Kaltenbrunner and Lochstoer (2010)

show that long-run risks (high persistence in expected consumption growth) arise endogenously

in production economies with frictionless labor market via consumption smoothing. Because of

persistent aggregate productivity and consumption smoothing, long-run risks might also be present

in our model. What is the relative role of long-run risks compared with disaster risks in our model?

This economic question is important because different specifications of consumption dynamics can

largely accord with observed moments of consumption growth, such as volatilities and autocorre-



                                                 22
lations, in the data. However, different specifications imply vastly different economic mechanisms.

       We calculate the expected consumption growth and conditional consumption growth volatility

in the model's state space. We use these solutions to simulate one million monthly periods from

the model's stationary distribution. Fitting the consumption growth process specified by Bansal

and Yaron (2004) on the simulated data yields:

                                                                    g

and     t+1   is 0.024, and the unconditional correlation between            t+1   and   t+1   is 0.079 in simulations.

       Equation (21) shows that the persistence in expected consumption growth is only 0.288 in our

model, which is substantially lower than 0.979 in Bansal and Yaron (2004).20 However, our expected

consumption growth is more volatile, with its conditional volatility about 70.5% of the conditional

volatility of realized consumption growth. This fraction is much higher than 4.4% in Bansal and

Yaron. Similarly, our persistence of expected consumption growth, 0.288, is also much lower than

that implied by baseline production economies in Kaltenbrunner and Lochstoer (2010).21 As such,

despite recursive utility and autoregressive productivity shocks, long-run risks (in the sense of highly

persistent expected consumption growth) do not play an important role in our economy.

       Equation (22) shows that the search economy gives rise endogenously to time-varying volatil-

ities (Bloom 2009). The consumption conditional variance appears "stochastic" in our model. Its

persistence is 0.964, which is lower than 0.987 calibrated in Bansal and Yaron (2004) and 0.999 in

Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron (2012). However, the volatility of our stochastic variance is 0.42×10-5 ,

which is higher than 0.23×10-5 in Bansal and Yaron and 0.28×10-5 in Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron.

The time-variation of volatilities is another important dimension along which our search economy

differs from stochastic growth models. These models with frictionless labor market yield largely con-

stant volatilities (Kaltenbrunner and Lochstoer 2010). Perhaps more important, our quantitative

results in equation (22) suggest that long-run risks in consumption volatility can be observationally

equivalent to consumption disaster risks, potentially lending support to disaster models.

3.5     Time-varying Risks and Risk Premiums

We quantify the model's implications on time-varying equity premium and stock market volatility.

3.5.1    Equilibrium Properties

We first evaluate qualitative implications of the model's competitive equilibrium. From the model's

stationary distribution (after a burn-in period of 1,200 months), we simulate a long sample of one

million months. Figure 1 shows the scatterplots of key conditional moments against productivity.

From Panel A, the price-to-consumption ratio, Pt /Ct , increases with productivity. In the 1-million-

month sample, the correlations of Pt /Ct with productivity, output, unemployment, vacancy, and

the investment rate are 0.97, 0.78, -0.48, 0.9, and 0.6, respectively. Clearly, Pt /Ct is procyclical.

   In contrast, Panel B shows that the expected equity premium, Et [rSt+1 ] - rf t+1 , is countercycli-

cal. Its correlations with productivity, output, unemployment, vacancy, and the investment rate

are -0.84, -0.86, 0.66, -0.87, and -0.36, respectively. In addition, the correlation between the

expected equity premium and price-to-consumption is -0.88. Stock market volatility,  St , is also

countercyclical (Panel C). Its correlations with productivity, output, unemployment, vacancy, and

the investment rate are -0.91, -0.83, 0.57, -0.92, and -0.42, respectively. In addition, its correla-

tions with the expected equity premium and price-to-consumption are 0.98 and -0.95, respectively.

                                                  24
       Panel D shows that the riskfree rate, rf t+1 , is weakly procyclical in the model. Its correla-

tions with productivity, output, unemployment, vacancy, and the investment rate are 0.23, 0.22,

-0.2, 0.1, and 0.27, respectively. In addition, its correlations with the expected equity premium,

stock market volatility, and price-to-consumption are -0.15, -0.13, and 0.28, respectively. Panel

E shows that expected consumption growth, Et [gCt+1 ], behaves similarly as the risk-free rate. The

correlation between Et [gCt+1 ] and rf t+1 is 0.998. Panel F shows that consumption volatility,  Ct , is

weakly countercyclical. Although its correlations with output and unemployment are high, -0.48

and 0.74, its correlations with productivity and investment rate are low, -0.05 and 0.1, respectively.

       In all, the model implies strong predictability for stock market excess return and volatility, some

predictability for consumption volatility, and weak to no predictability for consumption growth and

the interest rate. Intuitively, wage inertia yields operating leverage. In bad times, output falls, but

wage inertia causes profits to drop disproportionately more than output, thereby magnifying the

procyclical covariation of profits and dividends, causing the expected equity premium to rise.

       More important, the impact of wage inertia is stronger in bad times, when the profits are

even smaller because of low productivity. This time-varying wage inertia amplifies the risks and

risk premiums, making the expected equity premium and stock market volatility countercyclical.22

In contrast, consumption growth and consumption volatility are less predictable because of con-

sumption smoothing via capital investment. Despite adjustment costs, investment absorbs a large

amount of shocks to render the first two moments of consumption growth less predictable.

3.5.2      Data

Before quantifying the model's implications on time-varying risks and risk premiums, Table 4 shows

long-horizon regressions of stock market excess returns and log consumption growth on log price-

to-consumption in the historical data. We follow Beeler and Campbell (2012) but implement the
  22
    Relatedly, Favilukis and Lin (2016) study this time-varying mechanism in a general equilibrium production econ-
omy with (exogenously specified) infrequent wage renegotiation, long-run risks, and labor adjustment costs. In con-
trast, wage inertia arises endogenously in our economy, and the equity premium arises from endogenous disaster risks.

tests on the Jord´
                 a-Schularick-Taylor historical cross-country panel. We perform the regressions on

log price-to-consumption, as opposed to log price-to-dividend, because dividends (net payouts) can

be negative in the model. To align the data moments with the model moments, we adjust excess

returns in the data for financial leverage (by multiplying unadjusted excess returns with 0.71).

   Panel A shows long-horizon predictive regressions of market excess returns:

                       H
                            [log(rSt+h ) - log(rf t+h )] = a + b log(Pt /Ct ) + ut+H ,          (23)
                      h=1


in which H is the forecast horizon, Pt real market index, Ct real consumption at the beginning of

period t, and ut+H the residual. Panel B shows long-horizon regressions of log consumption growth:

                               H
                                    log(Ct+h /Ct ) = a + b log(Pt /Ct ) + vt+H ,                (24)
                              h=1


in which vt+H is the residual. In both long-horizon regressions, log(Pt /Ct ) is standardized to have

a mean of zero and a volatility of one. H ranges from one to five years. Finally, the t-values are

adjusted for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations of 2(H - 1) lags.

   Panel A shows some evidence of predictability of market excess returns. The slopes are largely

negative across the countries and forecast horizons from one to five years, and their t-values are

often significant, especially at the longer horizons. The R-squares averaged across the countries

vary from 1.87% to 9% as the forecast horizon goes from one to five years. The prior asset pricing

literature has mostly focused on the U.S. sample, which is an outlier in Panel A. In particular,

the U.S. features the strongest evidence of predictability in terms of the t-values of slopes and

R-squares. For example, in the 5-year horizon, the R2 is 33.6% in the U.S. and 28% in the U.K.,

in contrast to 0% in Germany, 1% in Italy and Portugal, and 2% in France.

   In the Internet Appendix (Table S5, Panel A), we document stronger stock market return pre-

dictability in the post-1950 sample. The slopes are all negative and mostly significant across the

countries and forecast horizons. On average, the slopes are significant for all horizons except year


                                                      26
one. The R-squares range from 4.9% in year one to 17.8% in year five.

   Panel B of Table 4 shows that consumption growth is largely unpredictable. In the historical

sample, the slopes averaged across the countries are all negative but insignificant. Even at the

5-year horizon, the R2 is only 5.77% on average. In the post-1950 sample, the average slopes all

flip to positive but remain insignificant, although the average R-squares increase somewhat, for

example, to 9.1% in year five (Table S5, Panel B, the Internet Appendix).

   Table 5 shows long-horizon regressions of excess return and consumption growth volatilities

on log price-to-consumption. For a given forecast horizon, H , we measure excess return volatility
                    H -1
as  St,t+H -1 =     h=0 | St+h |,   in which   St+h   is the h-period-ahead residual from the first-order

autoregression of log excess returns, log(rSt+1 ) - log(rf t+1 ) (again adjusted for financial leverage).

Panel A performs long-horizon predictive regressions of excess return volatilities:


                               log  St+1,t+H = a + b log(Pt /Ct ) + ut+H .                                 (25)


                                                              H -1
In Panel B, the consumption volatility is  Ct,t+H -1 =        h=0 | Ct+h |,   in which   Ct+h   is the h-period-

ahead residual from the first-order autoregression of log consumption growth, log(Ct+1 /Ct ). We

then perform long-horizon predictive regressions of consumption volatilities:


                                                                     
                               log  Ct+1,t+H = a + b log(Pt /Ct ) + vt+H .                                 (26)



   Panel A of Table 5 shows weak predictability for excess return volatilities. The average slopes are

all negative and marginally significant in the first two years. The average R-squares range from 6.3%

in year one to 19% in year five. However, the evidence is sensitive to sample period. In the post-1950

sample, the average slopes are all insignificant, with mixed signs (Table S6, Panel A, the Internet

Appendix). Consumption volatilities are essentially unpredictable with log price-to-consumption.

In the historical sample, the average slopes are all positive and, in long horizons, marginally

significant. However, in the post-1950 sample, the slopes all flip to negative and insignificant.


                                                      27
3.5.3    The Model's Performance

We simulate 10,000 samples from the model's stationary distribution, each with 1,740 months. On

each sample, we time-aggregate monthly returns and consumption into annual observations and im-

plement the same procedures as in the data. Overall, the model succeeds in explaining stock market

predictability but somewhat overstates consumption growth predictability, especially its volatility.

   Table 6 shows the details. From Panel A, market excess returns are predictable in the model.

The slopes are all significantly negative, and the R-squares range from 3.9% in year one to 13.5%

in year five. None of the p-values for the slopes, their t-values, and R-squares are significant at the

5% level. From Panel B, the model overstates somewhat the consumption growth predictability.

The slopes are all significantly negative. However, except for year one, the p-values for the slopes

and their t-values indicate only insignificant differences between the model and data moments.

   Panel C shows that stock market volatility is weakly predictable with log price-to-consumption

in the model. As in the data, the slopes are all negative but insignificant. None of the p-values

for slopes and their t-values suggest that the model moments deviate significantly from their data

counterparts. However, the R-squares in the model are significantly lower than those in the data.

More important, from Panel D, the model overstates the predictability of consumption growth

volatility. While the slopes are mostly insignificant and positive in the data, the slopes in the

model are significantly negative, and the p-values for the slopes and their t-values are significant.

3.6     Comparative Statics

In this subsection, we conduct comparative statics to shed light on the inner workings of our model.

In each experiment, we vary one parameter only, while keeping all the other parameters identical to

those in the benchmark calibration. (For log utility, we set both the risk aversion and intertemporal

elasticity of substitution to one.) In all experiments, we recalibrate the capital scalar, K0 , to ensure

the average labor share is unchanged from the benchmark calibration. Otherwise, the impact from

changing a given parameter would be confounded with the impact of changing the labor share. The

                                                   28
only exception is the  = 0.3 experiment, in which we recalibrate K0 to match the average labor

share of 0.7. The simulations follow the same design as in the benchmark model.

3.6.1   Preference Parameters

Table 7 details the results. Not surprisingly, the risk aversion,  , has a quantitatively important

impact on the equity premium. Reducing  from 10 to 7.5 and further to 5 lowers the equity pre-

mium from 4.26% per annum in the benchmark calibration to 1.55% and further to 0.54%. Stock

market volatility also falls from 11.8% to 9.5% and further to 8%.

   Most important, risk aversion also affects quantities. Reducing  from 10 to 7.5 and further to

5 lowers consumption volatility from 5.13% to 4.24% and further to 3.93%. The probability of con-

sumption disasters falls from 5.83% to 4.28% and further to 3.82%, and the disaster size also drops

somewhat. A lower discount rate (the equity premium plus the interest rate) raises the marginal

benefit of hiring, stimulating employment. Consequently, the mean unemployment rate falls from

8.63% to 5.71% and further to 4.63%. Although the unemployment volatility remains stable, the

vacancy and labor market tightness volatilities both fall by about one-third. As such, echoing

Gourio (2012) and Hall (2017) but differing from Tallarini (2000), our results indicate the necessity

to jointly study macro quantities and asset prices, which do not seem to be determined separately.

   The intertemporal elasticity of substitution,  , governs the willingness of the representative

investor to substitute consumption over time. A lower elasticity indicates stronger incentives for

consumption smoothing. Consequently, reducing  from 2 to 1.5 and further to 1 lowers the con-

sumption volatility from 5.13% per annum to 4.89% and further to 4.51%. The consumption disaster

probability falls from 5.83% to 5.4% and further to 4.77%. The disaster size also drops somewhat.

The lower consumption risks reduce the equity premium from 4.26% to 3.82% and further to 3.17%.

The lower discount rate again raises the marginal benefit of hiring to reduce the unemployment

rate to 7.9% and further to 6.87%. However, labor market volatilities remain largely unchanged.

   Finally, the log utility ( =  = 1) implies lower consumption, output, and investment volatil-

                                                 29
ities, 3.83%, 5.21%, and 5.32% per annum, than the benchmark calibration with recursive utility,

5.13%, 6.43%, and 8.59%, respectively. Although the unemployment volatility is largely unaf-

fected, the vacancy and labor market tightness volatilities both fall by about one-third. The equity

premium drops from 4.26% to only 0.53%, and stock market volatility from 11.77% to 8.68%.

3.6.2   Labor Market Parameters

The flow value of unemployment, b, plays an important role in driving our results. Lowering its

value from 0.91 to 0.85 is sufficient to reduce the unemployment rate from 8.63% to 3.45% and the

unemployment volatility from 0.32 to 0.07. Intuitively, a lower b reduces wages and raises profits,

stimulating hiring incentives. A lower b also enlarges the fundamental surplus allocated to the firm,

dampening the unemployment volatility (Hagedorn and Manovskii 2008; Ljungqvist and Sargent

2017). This mechanism also reduces the consumption volatility from 5.13% per annum to 2.62%

and the consumption disaster probability from 5.83% to 2.36%. The smaller consumption risks

then reduce the equity premium to only 0.45% and stock market volatility to 7.33%.

   The bargaining weight of workers,  , also plays an important role in driving our results. Raising

 from 0.01 to 0.025 makes wages more sensitive to shocks. The wage elasticity to labor productiv-

ity rises from 0.26 to 0.37. Because wages become more cyclical, profits and dividends become less

cyclical, and the equity premium falls to 3.98% per annum. In addition, because workers gain a

larger fraction of bargaining surplus, the unemployment rate rises somewhat from 8.63% to 8.81%.

However, business cycle and labor market volatilities are largely unchanged.

   The results are relatively insensitive to the separation rate, s. Reducing s from 3.5% to 3.25%

lowers the unemployment rate slightly from 8.63% to 8.51%. The impact on business cycle and

labor market volatilities is also small. The equity premium rises slightly from 4.26% per annum to

4.41%, and stock market volatility from 11.77% to 11.91%. The results are also relatively insensi-

tive to the curvature parameter in the matching function, . Raising  from 1.25 to 1.35 makes the

matching process less frictional. The unemployment rate falls slightly from 8.63% to 8.5%. The im-


                                                 30
pact on business cycle and labor market volatilities is also small. The equity premium rises slightly

from 4.26% per annum to 4.3%, but stock market volatility falls slightly from 11.77% to 11.72%.

       Raising the unit cost of vacancy posting, , from 0.01 to 0.025 increases the marginal cost of

hiring, causing the unemployment rate to rise from 8.63% to 8.9%. The consumption, output, and

investment volatilities all go up, but labor market volatilities remain largely unchanged. The equity

premium falls somewhat from 4.26% per annum to 4.02%, but stock market volatility remains stable.

From equation (18), a higher  makes wages more sensitive to procyclical labor market tightness,

t . Consequently, profits and dividends become less procyclical, dampening the equity premium.

3.6.3      Technology Parameters

The supply elasticity of capital,  , governs the magnitude of capital adjustment costs. A rising

 from 1.25 to 1.5 means falling adjustment costs, which in turn imply a stronger mechanism of

consumption smoothing via investment. Consequently, the consumption volatility falls from 5.13%

per annum to 4.98%, but the investment volatility rises from 8.59% to 9.41%, even though the

output volatility remains largely unchanged at 6.45% (6.43% in the benchmark calibration). The

lower consumption risks give rise to a lower equity premium, 4.03%, echoing Jermann (1998). A

lower discount rate then raises the marginal benefit of hiring, reducing the unemployment rate to

8.54%. However, similar to the output volatility, labor market volatilities are largely unchanged.

       Lowering the rate of capital depreciation,  , from 1.25% to 1% per month reduces the consump-

tion volatility from 5.13% to 4.71% per annum and the consumption disaster probability from 5.83%

to 5.26%. The output volatility also falls to 5.98%, and the investment volatility to 7.3%. The lower

amount of consumption risk reduces the equity premium from 4.26% to 2.56%. The lower discount

rate provides stronger hiring incentives and reduces the unemployment rate to 6.86%. Intuitively,

a lower  gives rise to a larger stochastic steady state capital than the benchmark calibration, 18.2

versus 14.7. The larger capital stock helps stabilize the economy in the presence of shocks.23
  23
    This effect of  on the capital stock is distinct from the impact of the capital share. As note, we recalibrate the
capital scalar, K0 , to keep the average labor share unchanged. Scaling by their respective K0 values still yields a


                                                         31
    Raising the elasticity of capital-labor substitution, e = 1/(1 -  ), from 0.4 to 0.5 increases

the business cycle and labor market volatilities. The consumption volatility rises from 5.13% per

annum to 5.78%, and the consumption disaster probability from 5.83% to 6.31%. From the CES

production function in equation (4), Yt /Xt increases with  (and e). The higher amount of

consumption risk implies a higher equity premium of 4.72% and a higher stock market volatility of

12.13%. Finally, a higher discount rate in turn implies a higher unemployment rate of 9.06%.

    Finally, we change the distribution parameter, , from 0.25 to 0.3. The average labor share falls

to 0.7 in simulations. Although the stochastic steady state capital rises to 20.64, its value scaled

by K0 remains at 1.07, which is identical to the benchmark calibration. Because of a smaller labor

share, labor market frictions play a less prominent role in this economy. Consequently, the business

cycle and labor market volatilities all fall. The consumption volatility declines to 4.26% per annum,

and the consumption disaster probability to 5.1%. As a result of the lower consumption risk, the

equity premium falls to only 2.27%, and stock market volatility to 9.15%. The lower discount rate

raises the marginal benefit of hiring, reducing the unemployment rate to 7.2%.


4     Additional Predictions

In this section, we quantify several additional implications from the model, including the term

structure of the equity premium (Section 4.1), the term structure of real interest rates (Section

4.2), the timing premium (Section 4.3), and the welfare cost of business cycles (Section 4.4).

4.1    The Term Structure of the Equity Premium

Binsbergen, Brandt, and Koijen (2012) show that short-maturity dividend strips on the aggregate

stock market have higher expected returns and volatilities than long-maturity dividend strips. This

downward-sloping pattern seems difficult to reconcile with leading consumption-based models.24
somewhat higher stochastic steady state capital for the low- economy than the benchmark economy, 1.1 versus 1.07.
  24
     Intuitively, in the Campbell-Cochrane (1999) external habit model, the impact of shocks on slow-moving surplus
consumption is more pronounced for long-maturity dividend strips than for short-maturity strips, giving rise to an
upward-sloping term structure of equity returns. In the Bansal-Yaron (2004) long-run risks model, small shocks
on highly persistent expected consumption growth and to stochastic consumption volatility gradually build up


                                                        32
                                                                    D denote the price of an n-
    Our model yields a downward-sloping equity term structure. Let Pnt
                                   D = E [M
period dividend strip. For n = 1, P1                                            D
                                    t   t  t+1 Dt+1 ]. For n > 1, we solve for Pnt recursively from

 D = E [M     D                        D       D         D
Pnt   t  t+1 Pn-1,t+1 ]. We calculate rn,t+1  Pn-1,t+1 /Pnt as the return of buying the n-period

dividend strip at time t and selling it at t +1. However, as noted, dividends in the model are net pay-

outs, which can be negative in certain states of the world. Negative prices on these dividend strips

then render their returns undefined. In practice, dividends are all positive when n  67 months.

As such, we calculate the equity term structure from year 6 to 40. In contrast, consumption in the

model is always positive in all states of the world. Accordingly, we also calculate the term structure

of consumption strips from year 1 to 40. The definitions of price of an n-period consumption strip,
 C , and its return, r C
Pnt                   n,t+1 , are exactly analogous to those of the n-period dividend strip.


    Figure 2 shows that risk premiums, volatilities, and Sharpe ratios on dividend and consumption

strips are largely downward-sloping in our model. From Panel A, the dividend risk premium falls

from 7.91% per annum in year 6 to 6.64% in year 10 and further to 1.26% in year 40. The volatility

of the dividend strip falls from 22.54% in year 6 to 18.6% in year 10 and further to 3.86% in year

40 (Panel B). The Sharpe ratio of the dividend strip starts at 0.35 in year 6, rises slightly to 0.36

in year 10, and then falls steadily to 0.32 in year 40 (Panel C). For the consumption strip, the risk

premium starts at 2.37% in year 1, rises to 2.52% in year 6, and then falls gradually to 0.59% in

year 40 (Panel D). Its volatility starts at 6.82% in year 1, rises to 7.04% in year 4, and then drops

to 2.49% in year 40 (Panel E). The Sharpe ratio starts at 0.348 in year 1, rises slightly to 0.358

in year 8, and falls to 0.237 in year 40 (Panel F). Finally, for the wealth portfolio that pays the

consumption stream as its dividends, its risk premium is 2.23%, and its volatility 5.17%.

    Intuitively, short-maturity dividend and consumption strips are riskier in our model because of

their higher exposures to disaster risks. When the economy slides into a disaster, short-maturity
over longer horizons to make long-maturity dividend strips riskier than short-maturity strips, again yielding an
upward-sloping equity term structure. In the Rietz-Barro baseline disaster model, dividend strips of all maturities
are exposed to the same amount of disaster risks, which are specified to be i.i.d., yielding a flat equity term structure.
Finally, in the Wachter (2013) model with time-varying, but highly persistent disaster probabilities, small shocks on
the disaster probabilities build up over time to yield an upward-sloping equity term structure.



                                                           33
dividends and consumption take a big hit because of inertial wages. Long-maturity dividend and

consumption strips are less impacted because disasters are followed by subsequent recoveries.25

4.2       The Term Structure of Real Interest Rates

We calculate the prices of real zero-coupon bonds for maturities ranging from 1 month to 10 years.

Let Pnt denote the price of an n-period zero-coupon bond. For n = 1, P1t = Et [Mt+1 ]. For n > 1,

we solve for Pnt recursively from Pnt = Et [Mt+1 Pn-1,t+1 ]. The log yield-to-maturity is ynt 

- log(Pnt )/n. Let rn,t+1  Pn-1,t+1 /Pnt be the return of buying the n-period zero-coupon bond at

time t and selling it at t + 1. Excess returns are in excess of the 1-month interest rate, rn,t+1 - rf t+1 .

       To calculate the term structure, we simulate one million months from the model's stationary

distribution. The real yield curve is downward sloping in the model. The yield-to-maturity starts

at 1.53% per annum for 1-month zero-coupon bond but falls to 1.29% for 1-year, 0.95% for 5-year,

and further to 0.72% for 10-year zero-coupon bond. The average yield spread is -0.81% for the

10-year zero-coupon bond relative to the 1-month bond. The real term premium is also negative,

-1.11%, for the 10-year zero-coupon bond. Intuitively, long-term bonds earn lower average returns

because these bonds are hedges against disaster risks. Disasters stimulate precautionary savings,

which in turn drive down real interest rates and push up real bond prices. Because the prices of

long-term bonds tend to rise at the onset of disasters, these bonds provide hedges against disaster

risks and, consequently, earn lower average returns (Nakamura et al. 2013; Wachter 2013).

       Evidence on the slope of the real yield curve seems mixed. A large and liquid market for inflation-

indexed bonds (index-linked gilts) has existed in the UK since 1982. Evans (1998) and Piazzesi

and Schneider (2007) document that real yield curve is downward sloping in the U.K. In the U.S.,

Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) start trading in 1997. Piazzesi and Schneider show

that the TIPS yield curve appears to be upward sloping but caution that interpreting the evidence
  25
    Nakamura et al. (2013) show that a model with (exogenous) multiperiod disasters and subsequent recoveries also
yields a downward-sloping equity term structure. Our work differs in that disasters and recoveries are endogenous.

might be complicated by the relatively short sample and poor liquidity in the TIPS market.26

4.3    The Timing Premium

Epstein, Farhi, and Strzalecki (2014) show that the representative investor in the Bansal-Yaron

(2004) model would give up an implausibly high fraction, 31%, of its consumption stream for the

early resolution of consumption risks. In the Wachter (2013) model with time-varying disaster

probabilities, this fraction is even higher at 42%. Epstein et al. argue that the fractions (dubbed

the timing premium) seem too high because the household cannot use the information from the

early resolution to modify its risky consumption stream. Because we follow Bansal and Yaron

when calibrating preference parameters, with risk aversion higher than the inverse of the elasticity of

intertemporal substitution (10 > 1/2), it is natural to ask what the timing premium is in our model.

    The timing premium is defined as   1 - J0 /J0 , in which J0 is the household's utility with

risks resolved gradually, and J0 is the utility with risks resolved in the next period. Formally,

                                                                                      1
                                            1- 1                   1-
                                                                          1-1/      1-1/
                           J0 = (1 -      )C0      +  Et (J1 )             1-
                                                                                           ,                    (27)


in which the continuation utility J1 is given by
                                                                           1
                                                                         1-1/
                                                                  1- 1
                                     J1 = (1 -  )            t-1 Ct             .                               (28)
                                                      t=1


    Following Epstein, Farhi, and Strzalecki (2014), we calculate J0 via Monte Carlo simulations,

with the economy's stochastic steady state (Nt = 0.9137, Kt = 14.6909, and xt = 0.1887) as the

initial condition. Specifically, we simulate in total 100,000 sample paths, each with T = 2, 500

months, while pasting J0 as the continuation value at T . J0 is available from our projection algo-

rithm. On each path, we calculate one realization of J1 using equation (28). The expectation in

equation (27), Et (J1 )1- , is calculated as the cross-simulation average.
  26
     We wish to point out that the downward sloping real yield curve in our model does not necessarily contradict the
upward sloping nominal yield curve in the data. Nominal bonds are subject to inflation risks, which are left outside
our model. Because long-term bonds are more exposed to persistent inflation risks, a positive inflation risk premium
would give rise to an upward sloping nominal yield curve. We leave such an extension of our model to future work.


                                                         35
   The timing premium in our model is only 15.3%. We view this estimate to be empirically

plausible. For comparison, Epstein, Farhi, and Strzalecki (2014) calculate the timing premium to

be 9.5% with i.i.d. consumption growth, a risk aversion of 10, and an elasticity of intertemporal

substitution of 1.5. In the Barro (2009) model with a constant disaster probability, a risk aversion

of 4, and an elasticity of intertemporal substitution of 2, the timing premium is 18%.

   Intuitively, the long-run risks model assumes extremely high persistence in expected consump-

tion growth (Bansal and Yaron 2004) or in conditional consumption volatility (Bansal, Kiku, and

Yaron 2012). Analogously, the Wachter (2013) model assumes very high persistence in time-varying

disaster probabilities. Because the risks are not resolved until much later, the investor that prefers

early resolution of uncertainty would pay a high timing premium for the risks to be resolved early. In

contrast, in our model, the expected consumption growth and conditional consumption volatility are

much less persistent, as shown in equations (21) and (22), yielding a relatively low timing premium.

4.4   The Welfare Cost of Business Cycles

Lucas (1987, 2003) argues that the welfare cost of business cycles is negligible. Assuming log util-

ity for the representative household and log-normal distribution for consumption growth, Lucas

(2003) calculates that the agent would sacrifice a mere 0.05% of their consumption in perpetuity to

eliminate consumption fluctuations. However, Lucas assumes log utility that fails to explain the eq-

uity premium puzzle. Atkeson and Phelan (1994), for example, argue that welfare cost calculations

should be carried out within models that at least roughly replicate how asset markets price consump-

tion risks. Because our model replicates the equity premium, we quantify its implied welfare cost.

   Following Lucas (1987, 2003), we define the welfare cost of business cycles as the permanent

percentage of the consumption stream that the representative household would sacrifice to elim-

inate aggregate consumption fluctuations. Formally, let t C  {Ct , Ct+1 , . . .} be the consumption

stream starting at time t. For a given state of the economy, (Nt , Kt , xt ), at date t, we calculate the




                                                   36
welfare cost, denoted t  (Nt , Kt , xt ), implicitly from:


                                          J (t C (1 + t )) = J ,                                         (29)


in which J is the recursive utility derived from the constant consumption at the deterministic steady
                                                                                  1
                                                              1             1
                                                           1-            1-     1-1/
state, C . We solve for J by iterating on J = (1 -  )C             + J                 . Because the recursive

utility Jt is linear homogeneous, J (t C (1 + t )) = (1 + t )J (t C ), solving for t yields:

                                                    J
                                              t =      - 1.                                              (30)
                                                    Jt


    We calculate the welfare cost, t , on the state space, (Nt , Kt , xt ). To evaluate its magnitude, we

simulate one million months of t from the model's stationary distribution. The average welfare cost

in simulations is 29.1%, which is more than 580 times of the Lucas estimate of 0.05%. The consump-

tion in the stochastic steady state is 3.13% lower than the deterministic steady state consumption.

    Perhaps more important, the welfare cost is time-varying and strongly countercyclical. In sim-

ulation, its median is 24.4%, and the 2.5th, 5th, and 25th percentiles are 17.3%, 18.4%, and 21.5%,

whereas the 75th, 95th, and 97.5th percentiles are 31.7%, 56.3%, and 66.1%, respectively. Figure 3

shows the scatterplot of the welfare cost against the productivity in simulations. The welfare cost

is clearly countercyclical. Its correlations with productivity, output, unemployment, vacancy, and

the investment rate are -0.76, -0.97, 0.94, -0.66, and -0.46, respectively. The countercyclicality

of the welfare cost imply that optimal fiscal and monetary policies aimed to dampen disaster risks

are even more important than what the average welfare cost of 29.1% would suggest.


5    Conclusion

Labor market frictions are crucial for explaining the equity premium puzzle in general equilibrium.

A dynamic stochastic general equilibrium economy with recursive utility, search frictions, and cap-

ital accumulation yields a high equity premium of 4.26% per annum and a low average interest rate



                                                    37
of 1.59%, while simultaneously obtaining plausible quantity dynamics. The equity premium and

stock market volatility are both countercyclical, and the real interest rate and consumption growth

are largely unpredictable. The welfare cost of business cycles is huge, 29%. Wage inertia plays a

key role by amplifying the procyclical dynamics of profits, which in turn overcome the procyclical

dynamics of investment and vacancy costs to make dividends endogenously procyclical.

   Several directions arise for future research. First, one can embed our model into a New Keyne-

sian framework to examine the nominal yield curve and the interaction between the equity premium

and fiscal and monetary policies. Second, one can extend our model to a multi-country setting to

study international asset prices and business cycles. Finally, one can incorporate heterogeneous

firms to study how the cross-sectional distribution impacts on aggregate quantities and asset prices.

A     Computational Algorithm
We adapt the globally nonlinear projection method with parameterized expectations in Petrosky-
Nadeau and Zhang (2017) to our more general setting.
    We approximate the xt process with the discrete state space method of Rouwenhorst (1995)
with 17 grid points, which are sufficient to cover the values of xt within four unconditional standard
deviations from its unconditional mean, x. The Rouwenhorst grid is symmetric around x. The grid
is also even-spaced, with the distance between any two adjacent grid points, dx , given by:

                                          dx  2/ (1 - 2 )(nx - 1),                                                (A.1)

in which  is the persistence,  the conditional volatility of xt , and nx = 17. We still need to
construct the transition matrix, , in which the (i, j ) element, ij , is the probability of xt+1 = xj
conditional on xt = xi . To this end, we set p = ( + 1)/2, and:

which is the transition matrix for nx = 3. To obtain (17) , we use the following recursion:

            (nx ) 0                      0 (nx )                      0     0           0 0
       p                  + (1 - p)                    + (1 - p)                 +p                    ,          (A.3)
            0     0                      0 0                          (nx ) 0           0 (nx )

in which 0 is a nx × 1 column vector of zeros. We then divide all but the top and bottom rows by
two to ensure that the conditional probabilities sum up to one in the resulting transition matrix,
(nx +1) . Rouwenhorst (p. 306­307; p. 325­329) contains more details.
    The state space of our model consists of employment, capital, and productivity, (Nt , Kt , xt ).
The goal is to solve for the indirect utility function, J (Nt , Kt , xt ), the optimal vacancy func-
tion, V (Nt , Kt , xt ), the multiplier function, (Nt , Kt , xt ), and the optimal investment function,
I (Nt , Kt , xt ), from the following three functional equations:

Also, V (Nt , Kt , xt ) and (Nt , Kt , xt ) must satisfy the Kuhn-Tucker conditions.
    Following Petrosky-Nadeau and Zhang (2017), we deal with Vt  0 by exploiting a convenient
mapping from the conditional expectation function, Et  E (Nt , Kt , xt ), defined as the right-hand
side of equation (A.6), to policy and multiplier functions to eliminate the need to parameterize the
                                                               ~( t ) = 0 / (Et - 1 ) . If q
multiplier separately. After obtaining Et , we first calculate q                           ~( t ) < 1, the
Vt  0 constraint is not binding, we set t = 0 and q (t ) = q     ~(t ). We then solve t = q -1 (~  q (t )),
in which q -1 (·) is the inverse function of q (t ), and Vt = t (1 - Nt ). If q  ~( t )  1, the Vt  0
constraint is binding, we set Vt = 0, t = 0, q ( t ) = 1, and t = 0 + 1 - Et . An advantage of
the installation function, t , is that when investment goes to zero, the marginal benefit of invest-
ment,  (It , Kt )/It = a2 (It /Kt )-1/ , goes to infinity. As such, the optimal investment is always
positive, with no need to impose the It  0 constraint. We approximate I (Nt , Kt , xt ) directly.
    We approximate J (Nt , Kt , xt ), I (Nt , Kt , xt ), and E (Nt , Kt , xt ) on each grid point of xt . We use
the finite element method with cubic splines on 50 nodes on the Nt space, [0.245, 0.975], and 50 nodes
on the Kt space, [5, 20]. We experiment to ensure that the bounds are not binding at a frequency
higher than 0.01% in the model's simulations. We take the tensor product of Nt and Kt for each grid
point of xt . We use the Miranda-Fackler (2002) CompEcon toolbox for function approximation and
interpolation. With three functional equations on the 17-point xt grid, the 50-point Nt grid, and the
50-point Kt grid, we must solve a system of 127,500 nonlinear equations. we use such a large system
to ensure the accuracy of our numerical solution. Following Judd et al. (2014), we use derivative-
free fixed point iteration with a damping parameter of 0.00325. The convergence criterion is set to
be 10-4 for the maximum absolute value of the errors across the nonlinear functional equations.

     Table 1 : Basic Properties of the Real Consumption, Output, and Investment Growth and Asset Prices in the Historical Sample

     The historical cross-country panel is from the Jord`  a-Schularick-Taylor macrohistory database, except for Canada's asset prices, which we obtain
     from the Dimson-Marsh-Staunton (2002) database purchased from Morningstar. All (annual) series end in 2015. In Panels A and B, the column
     "Sample" indicates the sample's starting year. In Panels C and D, besides the starting year, the "Sample" column also reports the missing years
     in parentheses. For example, the real investment growth series for Australia starts in 1871 but is missing from 1947 to 1949. Other than Italy,
     which has missing asset prices from 1872 to 1884, in Panel D, all other missing years are in the 20th century. In Panel A, g C ,  C , SC , KC , and
       (i)
     C denote the mean (in percent), volatility (in percent), skewness, kurtosis, and ith-order autocorrelation, for i = 1, 2, . . . , 5, of log real per capita
                                                                (i)
     consumption growth. In Panel B, gY ,  Y , SY , KY , and Y denote the mean (in percent), volatility (in percent), skewness, kurtosis, and ith-order
                                                                                                 (i)
     autocorrelation for log real per capita output growth. In Panel C, g I ,  I , SI , KI , and I denote the mean (in percent), volatility (in percent),
     skewness, kurtosis, and ith-order autocorrelation for log real per capita investment growth. Finally, in Panel D, E [rS ],  S , and E [rS - rf ] are the
     average stock market return, stock market volatility, and the equity premium, respectively, without adjusting for financial leverage. E [rS - rf ] and
      S are the equity premium and stock market volatility, respectively, after adjusting for financial leverage. E [rf ] is the mean real interest rate, and
      f the interest rate volatility. All asset pricing moments are in annual percent. We require nonmissing stocks, bonds, and bills.

               Table 2 : Basic Moments in the Model Under the Benchmark Calibration

The model moments are based on 10,000 simulated samples, each with 1,740 months. On each artificial
sample, we calculate the moments and report the mean as well as the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles across
the 10,000 simulations. p-value is the fraction with which a model moment is higher than its data moment.
The data moments are from Table 1. In Panel A,  C , SC , KC , and Ci , for i = 1, 2, . . . , 5, denote the
volatility (in percent), skewness, kurtosis, and ith-order autocorrelation of the log consumption growth. The
symbols in Panels B and C are defined analogously. In Panel D, E [U ], SU , and KU are the mean, skewness,
and kurtosis of monthly unemployment rates,  U ,  V , and   are the volatilities of quarterly unemployment,
vacancy, and labor market tightness, respectively. UV is the cross-correlation of quarterly unemployment
and vacancy rates, and ew,y/n the wage elasticity to labor productivity. In Panel E, E [rS - rf ], E [rf ],  S ,
and  f are the average equity premium, average real interest rate, stock market volatility, and interest rate
volatility, respectively, all of which are in annual percent.

                                              Table 3 : Disaster Moments in the Data and in the Model

     The data moments are obtained by applying the Barro-Urs´      ua (2008) peak-to-trough method on the Jord`   a-Schularick-Taylor cross-country panel.
     We adjust for trend growth in the data (no growth in our model). We subtract each log annual consumption growth observation with its mean of
     1.62% and subtract each log annual output growth with the mean of 1.78% in the historical panel. For model moments, we simulate 10,000 artificial
     samples from the model's stationary distribution under the benchmark calibration, each with 1,740 months, matching the number of years, 145,
     from 1871 to 2015. On each artificial sample, we time-aggregate consumption and output into annual observations and apply the peak-to-trough
     method to identify disasters as cumulative fractional declines of consumption or output of at least 10% or 15%. We report the mean, 5th, 50th,
     and 95th percentiles across the simulations. If no disaster appears in an artificial sample, we set its disaster probability to zero and calculate the
     model's disaster probability moments across all the 10,000 simulations. However, we calculate disaster size and duration across samples with at
     least one disaster. The disaster probability and size are in percent, and duration in the number of years.

The cross-country panel is from the Jord` a-Schularick-Taylor macrohistory database, except for Canada. The
annuals series start as early as 1870 and end in 2015 (the Internet Appendix). Panel A performs predictive
                                                                               H
regressions of stock market excess returns on log price-to-consumption, h=1 [log(rSt+h ) - log(rf t+h )] =
a + b log(Pt /Ct ) + ut+H , in which H is the forecast horizon, rSt+1 the real stock market return, rf t+1 the
real interest rate, Pt the real stock market index, and Ct real consumption. rSt+1 and rf t+1 are over the
course of period t, and Pt and Ct are at the beginning of period t (the end of period t - 1). Excess returns
are adjusted for a financial leverage ratio of 0.29. Panel B performs long-horizon predictive regressions of

log consumption growth on log(Pt /Ct ), h=1 log(Ct+h /Ct ) = c + d log(Pt /Ct ) + vt+H . In both regressions,
log(Pt /Ct ) is standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. H ranges from one year
(1y) to five years (5y). The t-values of the slopes are adjusted for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations of
2(H - 1) lags. The slopes and R-squares are in percent.

                   with Log Price-to-consumption in the Historical Sample

The cross-country panel is from the Jord`   a-Schularick-Taylor macrohistory database, except for Canada.
The annuals series start in 1870 and end in 2015. For a given forecast horizon, H , we measure excess
                                    H -1
return volatility as  St,t+H -1 = h=0 | St+h |, in which St+h is the h-period-ahead residual from the first-
order autoregression of excess returns, log(rSt+1 ) - log(rf t+1 ). Excess returns are adjusted for a financial
leverage ratio of 0.29. Panel A performs long-horizon predictive regressions of excess return volatilities,
                                                                                               H -1
log  St+1,t+H = a + b log(Pt /Ct ) + ut+H . Consumption growth volatility is  Ct,t+H -1 =      h=0 | Ct+h |, in
which Ct+h is the h-period-ahead residual from the first-order autoregression of log consumption growth,
log(Ct+1 /Ct ). Panel B performs long-horizon predictive regressions of consumption growth volatilities,
                                         
log  Ct+1,t+H = c + d log(Pt /Ct ) + vt  +H . log(Pt /Ct ) is standardized to have a mean of zero and a
standard deviation of one. H ranges from one year (1y) to five years (5y). The t-values are adjusted
for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations of 2(H - 1) lags. The slopes and R-squares are in percent.

Table 6 : Predicting Excess Returns, Consumption Growth, and Their Volatilities with Log
                            Price-to-consumption in the Model

The data moments are the mean estimates in Tables 4 and 5 on the Jord`       a-Schularick-Taylor database. For
the model moments, we simulate 10,000 artificial samples from the model's stationary distribution (with a
burn-in of 1,200 months), each with 1,740 months. On each artificial sample, we time-aggregate monthly
market excess returns and consumption growth into annual observations and implement the exactly same
procedures as in Tables 4 and 5. We report the mean, 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles across the simulations as
well as the p-value that is the fraction of simulations with which a given model moment is higher than its data
moment. In all the long-horizon regressions, the log price-to-consumption ratio, log(Pt /Ct ), is standardized
to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The forecast horizon, H , ranges from one year
(1y) to five years (5y). The t-values of the slopes are adjusted for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations of
2(H - 1) lags. The slopes and R-squares are in percent.

              Figure 3 : Scatterplot of the Welfare Cost Against Productivity

From the model's stationary distribution with the benchmark calibration (after a burn-in period
of 1,200 monthly periods), we simulate a long sample path with one million months. The vertical
axis is the welfare cost, t , and the horizonal axis is the productivity, exp(xt ).

                  "Searching for the Equity Premium"

A     Data
For each country, we construct its dividend index based on three series in the Jord`  a-Schularick-
Taylor macrohistory database, including capital gain (Pt /Pt-1 ), in which Pt is the nominal price
level of a stock market index; dividend-to-price (Dt /Pt ), in which Dt is nominal dividends delivered
by the index; and consumer price index. We first back out the Pt series by cumulating the capital
gain series and then construct the Dt series by multiplying Pt with the dividend-to-price series.
We scale nominal dividends by consumer price index to yield real dividends. The total number
of nonmissing dividends between 1870 and 2015 in the Jord`
                                                         a-Schularick-Taylor dataset is 2,034.
Three countries have in total seven dividend observations that equal zero, Germany, Portugal, and
Spain. For Switzerland, the capital gain series runs from 1900 to 2015, with 1926­1959 missing.
As such, its constructed dividends series starts in 1960. For Netherlands, both its capital gain and
dividend-to-price series are missing from 1918 to 1949. As such, its dividends series starts in 1950.

    In predicting market excess returns, consumption growth, and their volatilities, we drop Canada
from Jord`
         a-Schularick-Taylor macrohistory database. The reason is that its capital gain series (re-
quired to construct the price-to-consumption ratio) is incompatible with its total return series from
the Dimson-Marsh-Staunton (2002) database. The implied dividend series are frequently negative,
unlike the other countries, all of which have nonnegative dividends.

As such, Yt is of constant returns to scale, i.e., Kt Yt /Kt + Nt Yt /Nt = Yt . From equation (9):
                                                        1

                                   Kt           -1          Kt

It follows that (It , Kt ) is of constant returns to scale, i.e., It  t /It + Kt  t /Kt = t .

   The Lagrangian for the firm's problem is:

L = · · · + Yt - Wt Nt - Vt - It - N t [Nt+1 - (1 - s)Nt - q (t )Vt ] - Kt [Kt+1 - (1 - s)Kt - (It , Kt )]
   +t q (t )Vt + Et Mt+1 Yt+1 - Wt+1 Nt+1 - Vt+1 - It+1 - N t+1 [Nt+2 - (1 - s)Nt+1 - q (t+1 )Vt+1 ]

The first-order conditions with respect to Vt and Nt+1 are given by, respectively,

                                    
                       N t =            - t                                                    (S6)

                                              Nt+1

Combining the two equations yields the intertemporal job creation condition in equation (14). The
first-order conditions with respect to It and Kt+1 are given by, respectively,

Combining equations (S3)­(S9) yields equation (12).

   We first show Pt = Kt Kt+1 + N t Nt+1 , in which Pt = St - Dt is ex-dividend equity value,
with a guess-and-verify approach (Goncalves, Xue, and Zhang 2020). We first assume it holds for
t + 1: Pt+1 = Kt+1 Kt+2 + N t+1 Nt+2 . We then show it also holds for t. It then follows that
the equation must hold for all periods. We start with recursively formulating equation (11): Pt =
Et [Mt+1 (Pt+1 + Dt+1 )]. Using Pt+1 = Kt+1 Kt+2 + N t+1 Nt+2 to rewrite the right-hand side yields:

Pt = Et Mt+1 Kt+1 Kt+2 + N t+1 Nt+2 + Dt+1
    = Et Mt+1 Kt+1 [(1 -  )Kt+1 + t+1 ] + N t+1 [(1 - s)Nt+1 + q (t+1 )Vt+1 ]
      +Yt+1 - Wt+1 Nt+1 - Vt+1 - It+1 ]]
                                     t+1         t+1
    = Et Mt+1 Kt+1 (1 - )Kt+1 +          It+1 +      Kt+1 + N t+1 [(1 - s)Nt+1 + q (t+1 )Vt+1 ]

    = Kt+1 Et Mt+1        + 1-+               Kt+1 + Kt+1         It+1

in which the third equality follows from constant returns to scale for Yt+1 and t+1 , and the last


                                                  2
equality follows from equations (S6), (S7), (S8), (S9), and the Kuhn-Tucker condition (16).

B.2    Wages
We extend the derivation in Petrosky-Nadeau, Zhang, and Kuehn (2018) to our setting with capi-
tal accumulation. Let Jt /Nt be the marginal value of an employed worker to the representative
household, Jt /Ut the marginal value of an unemployed worker to the household, t the marginal
utility of the household, St /Nt the marginal value of an employed worker to the representative
firm, and St /Vt the marginal value of an unfilled vacancy to the firm. A worker-firm match turns
an unemployed worker into an employed worker for the household as well as an unfilled vacancy
into an employed worker for the firm. As such, the total surplus from the Nash bargain is:

                                         Jt   Jt              St   St
                                 Ht         -          /t +      -    .                         (S12)
                                         Nt Ut                Nt   Vt

The equilibrium wage arises from the Nash worker-firm bargain as follows:
                                                                          1-
                                       Jt   Jt                St   St
                         max              -        /t            -             ,                (S13)
                         {Wt }         Nt Ut                  Nt   Vt

in which 0 <  < 1 is the worker's bargaining power. The outcome is the surplus-sharing rule:

                  Jt   Jt                          Jt   Jt                St   St
                     -           /t = Ht =            -            /t +      -    .             (S14)
                  Nt Ut                            Nt Ut                  Nt   Vt

As such, the worker receives a fraction of  of the total surplus from the wage bargain.

 B.2.1    Workers

 Tradeable assets consist of risky shares and a riskfree asset. Let rf t+1 denote the risk-free interest
 rate,  t the household's financial wealth, t the fraction of the household's wealth invested in the
 risky shares, rt+1  t rSt+1 + (1 - t )rf t+1 the return on wealth, and Tt the taxes raised by the
 government. The household's budget constraint is given by:

                                          t+1
                                              =  t - Ct + Wt Nt + Ut b - Tt .                                 (S15)

 The household's dividends income, Dt , is included in the current financial wealth,  t .

    Let t denote the Lagrange multiplier for the household's budget constraint (S15). The house-
 hold's maximization problem is given by:
                                                             1

 The first-order condition for consumption yields:

B.2.2   The Representative Firm

We start by reformulating the firm's problem recursively as:

                           St = Yt - Wt Nt - Vt - It + t q (t )Vt + Et [Mt+1 St+1 ],                                 (S24)

subject to Nt+1 = (1 - s)Nt + q (t )Vt and Kt+1 = (1 -  )Kt + (It , Kt ).

   The first-order condition with respect to Vt says:

                              St                           St+1
                                 = - + t q ( t ) + Et Mt+1      q (t ) = 0.                                          (S25)
                              Vt                           Nt+1



                                                               5
  Equivalently,
                                                          St+1
                                            - t = Et Mt+1      .                                  (S26)
                                     q (t )               Nt+1
  In addition, differentiating St with respect to Nt yields:

                               St   Yt                       St+1
                                  =    - Wt + (1 - s)Et Mt+1      .                               (S27)
                               Nt   Nt                       Nt+1

  Combining the last two equations yields the job creation condition.

  B.2.3   The Wage Rate

  From equations (S20), (S23), and (S27), the total surplus of the worker-firm relationship is:

                           Jt+1       Jt+1
Ht = Wt + Et Mt+1 (1 - s)          +s           /t+1 - b
                           Nt+1       Ut+1
                      Jt+1                 Jt+1            Yt                       St+1
      -Et Mt+1 f (t )       + (1 - f (t ))         /t+1 +     - Wt + (1 - s)Et Mt+1
                      Nt+1                 Ut+1            Nt                       Nt+1
      Yt                           Jt+1     Jt+1            St+1
    =    - b + (1 - s)Et Mt+1             -          /t+1 +
      Nt                           Nt+1 Ut+1                Nt+1
                                Jt+1     Jt+1
             -f (t )Et Mt+1           -           /t+1
                               Nt+1 Ut+1
      Yt
    =    - b + (1 - s - f (t ))Et [Mt+1 Ht+1 ] .                                     (S28)
      Nt

  The sharing rule implies St /Nt = (1 -  )Ht , which, combined with equation (S27), yields:

                                      Yt
                        (1 -  )Ht =      - Wt + (1 -  )(1 - s)Et [Mt+1 Ht+1 ] .                   (S29)
                                      Nt

  Combining equations (S28) and (S29) yields:

  Yt                                                 Yt
     - Wt + (1 -  )(1 - s)Et [Mt+1 Ht+1 ] = (1 -  )      - b + (1 -  )(1 - s)Et [Mt+1 Ht+1 ]
  Nt                                                 Nt
                                               -(1 -  )f (t )Et [Mt+1 Ht+1 ]
                                              Yt
                                     Wt =         + (1 -  )b + (1 -  )f (t )Et [Mt+1 Ht+1 ] .
                                              Nt

  Using equations (S14) and (S26) to simplify further:

                                   Yt                               St+1
                          Wt =        + (1 -  )b + f (t )Et Mt+1                                  (S30)
                                   Nt                               Nt+1
                                   Yt                        
                          Wt    =     + (1 -  )b + f (t )         - t .                           (S31)
                                   Nt                     q ( t )




                                                    6
If Vt > 0, then t = 0, and equation (S31) reduces to equation (18) because f (t ) = t q (t ). If
Vt  0 is binding, t > 0, but Vt = 0 means t = 0 and f (t ) = 0. Equation (S31) reduces to
Wt = Yt /Nt + (1 -  )b. Because  t = 0, equation (18) continues to hold.

    from the Dimson-Marsh-Staunton (2002) database purchased from Morningstar. All (annual) series end in 2015. E [rS ],  S , and E [rS - rf ] are the
    average stock market return, stock market volatility, and the equity premium, respectively, without adjusting for financial leverage. E [rS - rf ] and
     S are the equity premium and stock market volatility, respectively, after adjusting for financial leverage. E [rf ] is the mean real interest rate, and
     f the interest rate volatility. All asset pricing moments are in annual percent. We use the longest possible samples of stocks, bills, and bonds
    described in the second, third, and fourth column, respectively, to calculate each moment. For example, in Australia, the sample for stock market
    returns starts in 1871, the sample for real interest rates start in 1871, with missing observations from 1945 to 1947, and the sample for long-term
    government bonds starts in 1900. Other than Italy, which has missing asset prices from 1872 to 1884, all other missing years are in the 20th century.

                                     Table S4 : Dividend Dynamics in the Historical and Post-1950 Samples

     Real output is from the Jord`   a-Schularick-Taylor macrohistory database. Appendix A describes our construction of dividends from their database.
     We use two detrending methods for real dividends and output. "Prop. dev." means the HP-filtered proportional deviations from the mean, and
     "Log dev." means log deviations from the HP-trend. DY is the correlation between the cyclical components of dividends and output, and  D / Y
     the volatility of the cyclical component of dividends divided by that of output. We examine three frequencies, annual, 3-year, and 5-year. For the
     3-year frequency, we sum up the three annual observations within a given 3-year interval. The 3-year intervals are nonoverlapping. The 5-year
     series are constructed analogously. The HP smoothing parameters for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year series are 1600/44 = 6.25, 1600/124 = 0.077, and
     1600/204 = 0.01, respectively, all of which correspond to 1,600 in the quarterly frequency. in Panel A, the column "Sample" indicates the starting
     year of a country. For Japan, the annual observations from 1946 and 1947 are missing. In Panel B, all countries start their samples in 1950, except
     for Switzerland, which starts in 1960. In calculating log deviations, the zero-dividend observations are removed.

           Table S5 : Predicting Excess Returns and Consumption Growth with Log
                        Price-to-consumption in the post-1950 Sample

The historical cross-country panel is from the Jord`      a-Schularick-Taylor macrohistory database, except for
Canada. The annuals series start in 1950 and end in 2015. Panel A performs predictive regressions of stock
                                                           H
market excess returns on log price-to-consumption, h=1 [log(rSt+h ) - log(rf t+h )] = a + b log(Pt /Ct )+ ut+h ,
in which H is the forecast horizon, rSt+1 real stock market return, rf t+1 real interest rate, Pt real
market index, and Ct real consumption. rSt+1 and rf t+1 are over the course of period t, and Pt and
Ct are at the beginning of t. Excess returns are adjusted for a financial leverage ratio of 0.29. Panel B
                                                                                               H
performs long-horizon predictive regressions of log consumption growth on log(Pt /Ct ), h=1 log(Ct+h /Ct ) =
c + d log(Pt /Ct )+ vt+h . In both regressions, log(Pt /Ct ) is standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard
deviation of one. H ranges from one year (1y) to five years (5y). The t-values of the slopes are adjusted for
heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations of 2(H - 1) lags. The slopes and R-squares are in percent.

Table S6 : Predicting Volatilities of Stock Market Excess Returns and Consumption Growth
                  with Log Price-to-consumption in the Post-1950 Sample

The historical cross-country panel is from the Jord`   a-Schularick-Taylor macrohistory database, except for
Canada. The annuals series start in 1950 and end in 2015. For a given horizon, H , we measure excess
                                     H -1
return volatility as  St,t+H -1 = h=0 | St+h |, in which St+h is the h-period-ahead residual from the first-
order autoregression of excess returns, log(rSt+1 ) - log(rf t+1 ) (adjusted for a financial leverage ratio of
0.29). Panel A performs long-horizon predictive regressions of excess return volatilities, log  St+1,t+H =
                                                                                               H -1
a + b log(Pt /Ct ) + ut+H . For a given H , consumption growth volatility is  Ct,t+H -1 =      h=0 | Ct+h |, in
which Ct+h is the h-period-ahead residual from the first-order autoregression of log consumption growth,
log(Ct+1 /Ct ). Panel B performs long-horizon predictive regressions of consumption growth volatilities,
                                          
log  Ct+1,t+H = c + d log(Pt /Ct ) + vt   +H . log(Pt /Ct ) is standardized to have a mean of zero and a
standard deviation of one. H ranges from one year (1y) to five years (5y). The t-values are adjusted
for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations of 2(H - 1) lags. The slopes and R-squares are in percent.
