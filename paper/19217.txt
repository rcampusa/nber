Entry, Exit, Firm Dynamics, and Aggregate Fluctuations

                                           ABSTRACT

Do firm entry and exit play a major role in shaping aggregate dynamics? Our answer is yes. Entry
and exit propagate the effects of aggregate shocks. In turn, this results in greater persistence and
unconditional variation of aggregate time-series. These are features of the equilibrium allocation in
Hopenhayn (1992)'s model of equilibrium industry dynamics, amended to allow for investment in
physical capital and aggregate fluctuations. In the aftermath of a positive productivity shock, the
number of entrants increases. The new firms are smaller and less productive than the incumbents,
as in the data. As the common productivity component reverts to its unconditional mean, the new
entrants that survive become more productive over time, keeping aggregate efficiency higher than
in a scenario without entry or exit.

1        Introduction

During the last 25 years or so, empiricists have pointed out a tremendous amount of
between–firm and between–plant heterogeneity, even within narrowly defined sectors. Yet,
for most of its young life the modern theory of business cycles has completely disregarded
such variation. What is the loss of generality implied by this methodological choice?
        There are many reasons why heterogeneity may matter for aggregate fluctuations,
some of which have received a substantial attention in the literature.1 Our goal is to
contribute to the understanding of the role played by entry and exit. What are, if any,
the costs of abstracting from firm entry and exit when modeling aggregate fluctuations?
        Our main result is that entry and exit propagate the effects of aggregate shocks. We
find this to be a feature of the equilibrium allocation in Hopenhayn (1992)’s model of
industry dynamics, amended to allow for investment in physical capital and for aggregate
fluctuations. We assume that firms’ productivity is the product of a common and of an
idiosyncratic component, both driven by persistent stochastic processes and orthogonal
to each other. Differently from Hopenhayn (1992), potential entrants are in finite mass
and face different probability distributions over the first realization of the idiosyncratic
shock.
        We assume that the demand for firms’ output and the supply of physical capital are
infinitely elastic at the unit price, while the supply of labor services has finite elasticity.
The wage rate fluctuates to ensure that the labor market clears. This is crucial, as it is
often the case that the effects of shocks on endogenous variables are muted or reversed by
the ensuing adjustment in prices.
        When parameterized to match a set of empirical regularities on investment, entry,
and exit, our framework replicates well–documented stylized facts about firm dynamics.
To start with, the exit hazard rate declines with age. Employment growth is decreasing
with size and age, both unconditionally and conditionally. The size distribution of firms
is skewed to the right and the skewness of a cohort’s size distribution declines with age.
Furthermore, the entry rate is pro–cyclical, while the exit rate is counter–cyclical.
        The mechanics of entry is straightforward. A positive shock to the common productiv-
ity component makes entry more appealing. This is the case because, with a labor supply
elasticity calibrated to match the standard deviation of employment relative to output,
the equilibrium response of the wage rate is not large enough to undo the impact of the
    1
    This is the case for the possibility that the occasional synchronization in the timing of establishments’
investment may influence aggregate dynamics when nonconvex capital adjustment costs lead establish-
ments to adjust capital in a lumpy fashion. See Veracierto (2002) and Khan and Thomas (2003, 2008).

innovation in aggregate productivity.
      Entrants are more plentiful, but of lower average idiosyncratic efficiency. This happens
because, with a time–invariant cost of entry, firms with poorer prospects about their
productivity find it worth entering. Aggregate output and TFP are lower than they
would be in the absence of this selection effect. However, given the small output share of
entering firms, the contemporaneous response of output is not very different from the one
that obtains in a model that abstracts from entry and exit.
      It is the evolution of the new entrants that causes a sizeable impact on aggregate
dynamics. As the common productivity component declines towards its unconditional
mean, there is a larger–than–average pool of young firms that increase in efficiency and
size. The distribution of firms over idiosyncratic productivity improves. It follows that
entry propagates the effects of aggregate productivity shocks on output and increases its
unconditional variance.
      For a version of our model without entry or exit to generate a data–conforming per-
sistence of output, the first–order autocorrelation of aggregate productivity shocks must
be as high as 0.775. In the benchmark scenario with entry and exit, it needs only be
0.685. As pointed out by Cogley and Nason (1995), many Real–Business–Cycle models
have weak internal propagation mechanisms. In order to generate the persistence in ag-
gregate time–series that we recover in the data, they must rely heavily on external sources
of dynamics. Our work shows that allowing for firm heterogeneity and for entry and exit
can sensibly reduce such reliance.
      The propagation result depends on the pro–cyclicality of the entry rate, for which
evidence abounds,2 and on the dynamics of young firms. According to our theory, the
relative importance of a cohort is minimal at birth and increases over time. Strong support
for this prediction comes from Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan (2001), who document that
the (positive) productivity gap between entrants and exiters grows larger over time.
      In our setup idiosyncratic shocks only affect technical efficiency. In reality, however,
plants also face random shifts in input supply and product demand schedules, which lead
to changes in input and product prices, respectively.
      It must be clear that the main implications of our theory do not hinge upon the
origin of plant–level shocks. In particular, they will still hold in setups with horizontal
product differentiation where idiosyncratic demand shocks play a major role, as long as
such models admit reduced forms where innovations in demand boil down to shocks to
Revenue Total Factor Productivity (TFPR) that resemble our own disturbances.

                                                 2
   Exploiting data from the five Census of Manufacturing in the period 1977–1997, Fos-
ter, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008, 2012) conclude that in the case of ten seven–digit
industries, the dynamics of TFPR was mostly the result of idiosyncratic demand shocks.
Entrants displayed about the same technical efficiency as incumbents, but faced much
lower demand schedules, and therefore charged lower prices. Over time, conditional on
survival, demand shifted outwards, leading to higher prices and greater TFPR.
   To rationalize these findings, Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2012) posit a stochas-
tic process for idiosyncratic demand shocks which leads to a TFPR dynamics very similar
to ours. Therefore we conjecture that our results for cross–sectional heterogeneity and
aggregate dynamics would not change if we amended our model to allow for idiosyncratic
random variation in demand.
   A final caveat is that ours is not a theory of the firm. That is, we do not provide an
explanation for why single–plant and multi–plant business entities coexist. While our cal-
ibration relies exclusively on plant–level data, throughout the paper we will alternatively
refer to production units as firms or plants.

   In recent years, a number of scholars have built upon Hopenhayn (1992) to produce
novel theories of aggregate fluctuations with firm heterogeneity. We think for example
at the business cycle theories of Veracierto (2002), Khan and Thomas (2003, 2008), and
Bachman and Bayer (2013), the asset pricing model by Zhang (2005), and the work by
Lee and Mukoyama (2012). With the exception of the latter, however, all of those papers
abstract from entry and exit. Lee and Mukoyama (2012)’s framework differs from ours in
key modeling assumptions. In particular, they do not model capital accumulation and let
the free–entry condition pin down the wage rate.
   Campbell (1998), one of the earliest treatments of entry and exit in a model with ag-
gregate fluctuations, focuses on investment–specific technology shocks and makes a list of
assumptions with the purpose of ensuring aggregation. In turn, this leads to an environ-
ment that has no implications for most features of firm dynamics. Cooley, Marimon, and
Quadrini (2004) and Samaniego (2008) characterize the equilibria of stationary economies
with entry and exit and study their responses to zero–measure aggregate productivity
shocks.
   A somewhat different strand of papers, among which Devereux, Head, and Lapham
(1996), Chatterjee and Cooper (1993), and Bilbiie, Ghironi, and Melitz (2012), model
entry and exit in general equilibrium models with monopolistic competition, but abstract
completely from firm dynamics. Interestingly, also in these frameworks entry leads to a
propagation of exogenous random disturbances. The reason, however, is very different.

                                                3
Entry increases the diversity of the product space. Because of increasing returns, this
encourages agents to work harder and accumulate more capital.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The model is introduced in Section
2. In Section 3, we characterize firm dynamics in the stationary economy. The analysis
of the scenario with aggregate fluctuations begins in Section 4, where we describe the
impact of aggregate shocks on the entry and exit margins. In Section 5, we characterize
the cyclical properties of entry and exit rates, as well as the relative size of entrants and
exiters. We also gain insights into the mechanics of the model by describing the impulse
responses to an aggregate productivity shock. In Section 6, we illustrate how allowing for
entry and exit strengthen the model’s internal propagation mechanism and we outline its
implications for the cyclicality of the cross–sectoral distribution of productivity. Section
7 concludes.


2    Model
Time is discrete and is indexed by t = 1, 2, .... The horizon is infinite. At time t, a positive
mass of price–taking firms produce an homogenous good by means of the production
function yt = zt st (ktα lt1−α )θ , with α, θ ∈ (0, 1). With kt we denote physical capital, lt is
labor, and zt and st are aggregate and idiosyncratic random disturbances, respectively.
    The common component of productivity zt is driven by the stochastic process

                                log zt+1 = ρz log zt + σz εz,t+1 ,

where εz,t ∼ N (0, 1) for all t ≥ 0. The dynamics of the idiosyncratic component st is
described by
                                log st+1 = ρs log st + σs εs,t+1 ,

with εs,t ∼ N (0, 1) for all t ≥ 0. The conditional distribution will be denoted as H(st+1 |st ).
    Firms hire labor services on the spot market at the wage rate wt and discount future

profits by means of the time–invariant factor       R,   R > 1. Adjusting the capital stock by x
bears a cost g(x, k). Capital depreciates at the rate δ ∈ (0, 1).
    We assume that the demand for the firm’s output and the supply of capital are in-
finitely elastic and normalize their prices at 1. The supply of labor is given by the function
Ls (w) = wγ , with γ > 0.
    Operating firms incur a cost cf > 0, drawn from the common time-invariant distribu-
tion G. Firms that quit producing cannot re–enter the market at a later stage and recoup
the undepreciated portion of their capital stock, net of the adjustment cost of driving it
to 0. The timing is summarized in Figure 1.

    Every period there is a constant mass M > 0 of prospective entrants, each of which
receives a signal q about their productivity, with q ∼ Q(q). Conditional on entry, the
distribution of the idiosyncratic shock in the first period of operation is H(s′ |q), strictly
decreasing in q. Entrepreneurs that decide to enter the industry pay an entry cost ce ≥ 0.
    At all t ≥ 0, the distribution of operating firms over the two dimensions of heterogene-
ity is denoted by Γt (k, s). Finally, let λt ∈ Λ denote the vector of aggregate state variables
and J(λt+1 |λt ) its transition operator. In Section 4, we will show that λt = {Γt , zt }.

2.1    The incumbent’s optimization program

Given the aggregate state λ, capital in place k, and idiosyncratic shock s, the employment
choice is the solution to the following static problem:3

                                  π(λ, k, s) = max sz[k α l1−α ]θ − wl.
                                                 l

Upon exit, a firm obtains a value equal to the undepreciated portion of its capital k, net of
the adjustment cost it incurs in order to dismantle it, i.e. Vx (k) = k(1−δ)−g [−k(1 − δ), k].
    Then, the start–of–period value of an incumbent firm is dictated by the function
V (λ, k, s) which solves the following functional equation:
                                        Z      n                      o
              V (λ, k, s) = π(λ, k, s) + max Vx (k), Ve (λ, k, s) − cf dG(cf )

     We drop time indexes in the remainder of the paper, except in parts where such choice may jeopardize
clarity of exposition.

For an aggregate state λ, the value of a prospective entrant that obtains a signal q is
                                         Z

She will invest and start operating if and only if Ve (λ, q) ≥ ce .

2.3    Recursive Competitive Equilibrium

For given Γ0 , a recursive competitive equilibrium consists of (i) value functions V (λ, k, s),
Ve (λ, k, s) and Ve (λ, q), (ii) policy functions x(λ, k, s), l(λ, k, s), k ′ (λ, q), and (iii) bounded
sequences of wages {wt }∞                               ∞                                ∞
                        t=0 , incumbents’ measures {Γt }t=1 , and entrants’measures {Et }t=0
such that, for all t ≥ 0,

    1. V (λ, k, s), Ve (λ, k, s), x(λ, k, s), and l(λ, k, s) solve the incumbent’s problem;

    2. Ve (λ, q) and k ′ (λ, q) solve the entrant’s problem;

3     The Stationary Case
We begin by analyzing the case without aggregate shocks, i.e. σz = 0. In this scenario,
our economy converges to a stationary equilibrium in which all aggregate variables are
constant. First, we introduce our assumptions about functional forms. Then we illustrate

                                                         6
the mechanics of entry, investment, and exit. After calibrating the model, we detail
the model’s implications for several features of firm dynamics, among which the relation
between firm growth and survival, size, and age.

3.1     Functional Forms

Investment adjustment costs are the sum of a fixed portion and of a convex portion:
                                                      x 2
                          g(x, k) = χ(x)c0 k + c1             k, c0 , c1 ≥ 0,
                                                      k
where χ(x) = 0 for x = 0 and χ(x) = 1 otherwise. Notice that the fixed portion is scaled
by the level of capital in place and is paid if and only if gross investment is different from
zero.
    The distribution of signals for the entrants is Pareto. See the left panel of Figure 2. We
posit that q ≥ q ≥ 0 and that Q(q) = (q/q)ξ , ξ > 1. The realization of the idiosyncratic
shock in the first period of operation follows the process log(s) = ρs log(q) + σs η, where
η ∼ N (0, 1).
    Finally, we assume that the distribution of the operating cost G is log–normal with
parameters µcf and σcf .

3.2     Entry, Investment, and Exit

Since an incumbent’s value V (k, s) is weakly increasing in the idiosyncratic productivity
shock s and the conditional distribution H(s′ |q) is decreasing in the signal q, the value
of entering Ve (q) is a strictly increasing function of the signal. In turn, this means that
there will be a threshold for q, call it q ∗ , such that prospective entrants will enter if and
only if they receive a draw greater than or equal to q ∗ .
   The mass of actual entrants with productivity less than or equal to any s̄ ≥ 0 will be
  R s̄ R
M       q ∗ dQ(q)dH(s|q). See the right panel of Figure 2.
    Let k ′ (q) denote the optimal entrants’ capital choice conditional on having received a
signal q. For every k̄ ≥ k ′ (q ∗ ) and for all s̄ ≥ 0, the portion of entrants characterized by
                                                          R s̄ R q−1 (k̄)
pairs (s, k) such that s ≤ s̄ and k ≤ k̄ will be M              q∗        dQ(q)dH(s|q), where q −1 is
the inverse of the mapping between signal and capital choice.
    Our treatment of the entry problem is different from that in Hopenhayn (1992). There,
prospective entrants are identical. Selection upon entry is due to the fact that firms that
paid the entry cost start operating only if their first productivity draw is greater than
the exit threshold. In our framework, prospective entrants are heterogeneous. Some

obtain a greater signal than others and therefore face better short–term prospects. As a
consequence, they start with greater capital and are likely to hire more employees.
    Investment is modeled as in the standard neoclassical framework with non-convex
adjustment costs. See for example Khan and Thomas (2008). The fixed cost of investment
gives rise to policy functions of the S–s type, which in turn are responsible for the periods
of inaction that are characteristic of all firm– and plant–level datasets.
    Firms exit whenever they draw an operating cost cf such that the value of exiting
Vx (k) is greater than the value of continuing operations, i.e. Ve (k, s) − cf . Figure 3
depicts the probability of survival as a function of the state variables. For given capital,
the probability of exiting is decreasing in the idiosyncratic productivity. This is not
surprising, given that the value of exiting does not depend on s, while the continuation
payoff is obviously greater, the larger is productivity. Survival chances also improve with
capital, for given level of productivity. Both the value of continuing and exiting are
increasing in capital, but simple inspection reveals that the marginal impact of raising
capital is greater on the value of staying.
    Differently from Hopenhayn (1992), where firms exit with certainty when productivity
falls below a certain threshold and continue with certainty otherwise, in our framework all
firms survive with positive probability and survival is smoothly increasing in both capital
and productivity. If we let the distribution of the operating cost collapse to a singleton,
the exit policy would be characterized by a decreasing schedule, call it s(k), such that a
firm equipped with capital k will exit if and only if its productivity is lower than s(k).

3.3       Calibration

Our parameter values are listed in Table 1. One period is assumed to be one year.
Consistent with most macroeconomic studies, we assume that R = 1.04, δ = 0.1, and
α = 0.3. We set θ, which governs returns to scale, equal to 0.8. This value is on the lower
end of the range of estimates recovered by Basu and Fernald (1997) using industry–level
data. Using plant–level data, Lee (2005) finds that returns to scale in manufacturing vary
from 0.828 to 0.91, depending on the estimator.
   The remaining parameters are chosen in such a way that a number of statistics com-
puted using a panel of simulated data are close to their empirical counterparts. Unless
indicated otherwise, the simulated data is drawn from the stationary distribution. We list
the simulated moments and their empirical counterparts in Table 2.
   Because of non–linearities, it is not possible to match parameters to moments. How-
ever, the mechanics of the model clearly indicates which are the key parameters for each
set of moments. What follows is a summary description of the algorithm that assigns



                                               9
values to parameters.
   First, notice that there are uncountably many pairs (M, γ) which yield stationary
equilibria identical to each other except for the volume of operating firms (and entrants).
All the statistics of interest for our study are the same across all such allocations. To see
why this is the case, start from a given stationary equilibrium and consider raising the
labor supply elasticity γ. The original equilibrium wage will now elicit a greater supply of
labor. Then, simply find the new, greater value for M , such that the aggregate demand
for labor in stationary equilibrium equals supply at the original wage.
   The property just described will not be true in the general model with σz > 0. We
decide to borrow the value of γ from the calibration of that model, to be illustrated in
Section 4. Given this choice, we set M in such a way that the equilibrium wage is 3.0.
This value is clearly arbitrary. However – it will be clear at the end of this section – it
involves no loss of generality.

   The parameters of the process driving the idiosyncratic shock, along with those gov-
erning the adjustment costs, were chosen to match the mean and standard deviation of
the investment rate, the autocorrelation of investment, and the rate of inaction, i.e. the
fraction of periods in which the investment rate is less than 1%. The targets are the
moments computed by Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006) using a balanced panel from the
LRD from 1972 to 1988. Because of selection in entry and exit, such statistics are likely
to be biased estimates of the population moments. To ensure consistency between the


                                             10
simulated statistics and their empirical counterparts, we follow Cao (2007) and compute
our moments on balanced panels extracted from the simulated series.
      A simpler version of the neoclassical investment model with lognormal disturbances –
one without investment adjustment costs – has the interesting properties that (i) the mean
investment rate is a simple non linear function of of the parameters ρs and σs and that (ii)
the standard deviation of the investment rate is a simple non–linear function of the mean.
It follows that in that framework, mean and standard deviation do not identify the pair
{ρs , σs }. While these properties do not hold exact in our model, inspection reveals that
similar restrictions exist. We proceed to set σs = 0.22, a value consistent with available
estimates of the standard deviation of the innovation to idiosyncratic productivity shocks,4
and set ρs to minimize a weighted average of the distances of mean and standard deviation
of investment rate from their targets.
      The remaining parameters are set so that the model gets close to match the average
entry rate and the relative size of entrants and exiters with respect to survivors, respec-
tively. The definitions of these ratios are those of Dunne, Roberts, and Samuelson (1988)
and the targets are the statistics obtained by Lee and Mukoyama (2012) using the LRD.
The mean of the operating cost has the largest effect on the exit rate, which in stationary
equilibrium must equal the entry rate. The variance of the operating cost pins down the
relative size of exiters.
      Finally, the pair {ξ, ce } determines the relative size of entrants. For simplicity, we set
ce equal to the mean operating cost, and then pick the value of the Pareto exponent to
hit the target.

      We claimed above that our arbitrary choice of M implies no loss of generality. How
would the stationary equilibrium look like if, say, we chose a greater value? The wage rate
would be higher and therefore all firm sizes would decline. Exit would be more appealing,

      See Haltiwanger (2011) and Castro, Clementi, and Lee (2013).


                                                   11
which in turn would imply higher exit (and entry) rate. However, firms dynamics will be
exactly the same, as the investment process is invariant to the wage rate. It follows that
by revising our choices for the parameters governing entry and exit, we can generate an
economy that differs from ours only in its scale. All the moments of interest will be the
same, and so will be the model’s implications for entry, growth, and survival.

3.4          Firm Dynamics

In this section, we describe the model’s implications for firm growth and survival, and
compare them with the empirical evidence. Unless otherwise noted, size is measured
by employment. The appropriate empirical counterpart of our notion of productivity is
revenue total factor productivity (TFPR), as defined in Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson
(2008).
      The left panel of Figure 4 illustrates the unconditional relation between exit hazard
rate and age. Consistent with Dunne, Roberts, and Samuelson (1989) and all other
studies we are aware of, the exit hazard rate decreases with age. This is the case because
on average entrants are less productive than incumbents. As a cohort ages – see the right
panel – the survivors’ productivity and value increase, leading to lower exit rates.

                                    Figure 4: The exit hazard rate

      A similar mechanism is at work in Hopenhayn (1992). In his framework, however, there
exists a size threshold such that the exit rate is 100% for smaller firms and identically
zero for larger firms. This feature is at odds with the evidence.5 In our model, firms with
the same employment are characterized by different combinations of (k, s) and therefore
have different continuation values. Those with relatively low capital and relatively high
productivity are less likely to exit.

                                                    12
      Dunne, Roberts, and Samuelson (1989) also found that in the US manufacturing sector,
establishment growth is unconditionally negatively correlated with both age and size – a
finding that was confirmed for a variety of sectors and countries.6 Evans (1987) and Hall
(1987) found evidence that firm growth declines with size even when we condition on age,
and viceversa.
      Hopenhayn (1992) is consistent with these facts, with the exception of the conditional
correlation between growth and age. In his model, idiosyncratic productivity is a suffi-
cient statistics for firm size and growth. Conditional on age, smaller firms grow faster
because the stochastic process is mean–reverting. However, firms of the same size behave
identically, regardless of their age. The model generates the right unconditional relation
between age and growth, simply because age and size are positively correlated in the
stationary distribution. When controlling for size, age is uncorrelated with growth.

                 Figure 5: Unconditional Relationship between Growth, Age, and Size.

      Our version of the model is consistent with all the facts about growth listed above.
Figure 5 illustrates the unconditional correlations. Recall that the state variables are
productivity and capital. Conditional on age, employment growth declines with size
because larger firms tend to have higher productivity levels. Given that productivity is
mean–reverting, their growth rates will be lower.
      Now consider all the firms with the same employment. Since adjustment costs prevent
the instantaneous adjustment of capital to the first–best size implied by productivity, some
firms will be characterized by a relatively low capital and high shock, and others by a
relatively high capital and low shock. The former will grow faster, because investment and
employment are catching up with the optimal size dictated by productivity. The latter
will shrink, as the scale of production is adjusted to the new, lower level of productivity.

                                                              13
    The conditional negative association between age and size arises because, on average,
firms with relatively high k and low s (shrinking) will be older than firms with low k
and high s (growing). For shrinking firms, productivity must have declined. For this to
happen, they must have had the time to grow in the first place. On average, they will be
older than those that share the same size, but are growing instead.
    The model is consistent with the evidence on firm growth even when we measure size
with capital rather than employment. Conditional on age, capital is negatively correlated
with growth for the same reason that employment is. It is still the case that larger firms
have higher productivity on average. Another mechanism contributes to generating the
right conditional correlation between growth and size. Because of investment adjustment
costs, same–productivity firms have different capital stocks. It turns out that on average
the larger ones have seen their productivity decline, while the smaller ones have seen their
efficiency rise. The former are in the process of shrinking, while the latter are growing.
    We just argued that firms with the same capital will have different productivity levels.
For given capital, firms with higher shocks are growing, while firms with lower shocks
are shrinking. Once again, the negative conditional correlation between growth and age
follows from the observation that, on average, firms with higher shocks are younger.
    It is worth emphasizing that, no matter the definition of size, the conditional relation
between age and growth is driven by relatively young firms. Age matters for growth
even when conditioning on size, because it is (conditionally) negatively associated with
productivity. To our knowledge, only two other papers present models that are consistent
with this fact. The mechanism at work in D’Erasmo (2009) is similar to ours. Cooley and
Quadrini (2001) obtain the result in a version of Hopenhayn (1992)’s model with financial
frictions and exogenous exit.
    The left panel of Figure 6 shows the firm size distribution that obtains in stationary
equilibrium. Noticeably, it displays positive skewness. The right panel illustrates the
evolution of a cohort size size distribution over time. Skewness declines as the cohort
ages. Both of these features are consistent with the evidence gathered by Cabral and
Mata (2003) from a comprehensive data set of Portuguese manufacturing firms.


4    Aggregate Fluctuations – Mechanics

We now move to the scenario with aggregate fluctuations. In order to formulate their
choices, firms need to forecast next period’s wage. The labor market clearing condition

implies that the equilibrium wage at time t satisfies the following restriction:
                           log[(1 − α)θzt ]        1 − (1 − α)θ
                           log wt =           +                  Ωt ,              (1)

with Ωt = log    sk αθ 1−(1−α)θ dΓt (k, s) . The log–wage is an affine function of the
logarithm of aggregate productivity and of a moment of the distribution.
   Unfortunately, the dynamics of Ωt depends on the evolution of Γt . It follows that
the vector of state variables λt consists of the distribution Γt and the aggregate shock
zt . Faced with the formidable task of approximating an infinitely–dimensional object, we
follow Krusell and Smith (1998) and conjecture that Ωt+1 is an affine function of Ωt and
log zt+1 . Then, (1) implies the following law of motion for the equilibrium wage is

                          log wt+1 = β0 + β1 log wt + β2 log zt+1 + β3 log zt + εt+1 .                                           (2)

   When computing the numerical approximation of the equilibrium allocation, we will
impose that firms form expectations about the evolution of the wage assuming that (2)
holds true. This means that the aggregate state variables reduce to the pair (wt , zt ). The
parameters {β0 , β1 , β2 , β3 } will be set equal to the values that maximize the accuracy of
the prediction rule. The definition of accuracy and its assessment are discussed in Section
4.2. The algorithm is described in detail in Appendix A.

4.1         Calibration

With respect to the stationary case, we need to calibrate three more parameters. These
are ρz and σz , which shape the dynamics of aggregate productivity, and the labor supply
elasticity γ. We set them in order to match the standard deviation and auto–correlation
of output growth, as well as the standard deviation of employment growth.

                                                              15
   The targets for the first two are standard deviation and autocorrelation of the growth
in non–farm private value added from 1947 to 2008, from the US Bureau of Economic
Analysis. The third target is the standard deviation of employment growth, also in the
non–farm private sector and for the same period, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

                       Description                    Symbol    Value

                                 Table 3: Parameter Values.

   Our parameter values are listed in Table 3. Our choice for γ is close to recent estimates
of the aggregate labor supply elasticity. For example, Rogerson and Wallenius (2009)
conclude that for micro elasticities ranging from 0.05 to 1.25, the corresponding macro
elasticities are in the range of 2.25 to 3.0. Fiorito and Zanella (2012) estimate a micro
elasticity of 0.1 and macro elasticities in the range 1.1-1.7. At the quarterly frequency,
our values for ρz and σz imply an autocorrelation of about 0.91 and a standard deviation
of about 0.008. In comparison, Cooley and Prescott (1995) set the two parameters at 0.95
and 0.007, respectively.

4.2   The Forecasting Rule

The forecasting rule for the equilibrium wage turns out to be

   log(wt+1 ) = 0.38385 + 0.65105 log(wt ) + 0.53075 log(zt+1 ) − 0.21508 log(zt ) + εt+1 .

The wage is persistent and mean–reverting. A positive aggregate shock increases the
demand for labor from both incumbents and entrants. This is why β2 , the coefficient of
log(zt+1 ), is estimated to be positive. The coefficient of log(zt ) – β3 – is negative because
the larger the aggregate shock in the previous period, the smaller is going to be the
expected increment in aggregate productivity, and therefore the lower the wage increase.


                                              16
        In the literature with heterogeneous agents and aggregate risk it has become standard
to evaluate the accuracy of the forecasting rule by assessing the R2 of the regression,
which in our case is 0.9971. However, as pointed out by Den Haan (2010), this choice
is questionable on at least three grounds. To start with, the R2 considers predictions
made conditional on wages generated by the true law of motion. In this sense, it only
assesses the accuracy of one–period ahead forecasts. Second, the R2 is an average. In the
numerical methods literature, it is standard to report maximum errors instead. Last, but
not least, the R2 scales the error term by the variance of the dependent variable. The
problem here is that it is often not clear what the appropriate scaling is. The root mean
squared error (0.00103 in our case) does not suffer from the latter shortcoming, but is
affected by the first two.
        Here we follow Den Haan (2010)’ suggestion to assess the accuracy of our forecasting
rule by calculating the maximum discrepancy (in absolute value) between the actual
wage and the wage generated by the rule without updating. That is, we compute the
maximum pointwise difference between the sequence of actual market–clearing wages and
that generated by our rule, when next period’s predicted wage is conditional on last
period’s prediction for the current wage rather than the market clearing wage. The value
of that statistics over 24,500 simulations is 0.765% of the market clearing wage.
        The frequency distribution of percentage forecasting errors is illustrated in the left
panel in Figure 7. The absolute value of the forecasting error is greater than 0.5% of
the clearing wage in only 1.3% of the observations. The right panel is a scatter plot of
equilibrium wages and their respective forecasts. It shows that the points are aligned
along the 45o line and that forecasting errors are small with respect to the variation in
equilibrium wages. More diagnostics is reported in the Appendix.

4.3          Entry and Exit

Recall that in the stationary equilibrium analyzed in Section 3, the solution to the entry
problem consists of a time–invariant threshold on the signal space and a policy function
for investment. Here the threshold will be time-varying, and will depend on the wage and
on the aggregate productivity realization.
    The value of an incumbent is strictly increasing in aggregate productivity and strictly
decreasing in the wage, while the cost of entry is constant. It follows that the entry
threshold will be greater the lower is aggregate productivity and the greater is the wage.
See the left panel in Figure 8 for an illustration.
    Everything else equal, a rise in aggregate productivity (or a decline in the wage) will
lead to an increase in the number of entrants. Given that the distribution of idiosyncratic
shocks is stochastically increasing in the value of the signal, such a rise will also lead to a
decline in entrants’ average idiosyncratic efficiency.7

   Figure 8: Left: Entry Threshold on the Signal Space. Right: Survival Probability.

    The conditional probability of survival is also time–varying. Since the value recovered
upon exit is not a function of aggregate variables, survival chances are greater the higher
is aggregate productivity and the lower is the wage. The right panel of Figure 8 illus-
trates how the probability of continuing to operate changes with the two aggregate state
variables, for a given pair of individual states {k, s}.
    Everything equal, a positive shock to aggregate productivity leads to a decline in the
number of exiting firms. Since the distribution of the idiosyncratic shock is invariant over
time and across firms, the average idiosyncratic efficiency of exiters will also decline.
    7
      For high levels of aggregate productivity and low wages the schedule on the left panel of figure 8 is
flat. In that portion of the aggregate state space, the signal threshold coincides with its lower bound and
all potential entrants find it optimal to start producing. It turns out, however, that this portion of the
state space does not belong to the ergodic set.


                                                                           18
    The equilibrium dynamics of the entry and exit margins will obviously depend on the
response of the wage to innovations in aggregate productivity. The wage and aggregate
shock will be strongly positively correlated. The milder the response of the wage to
positive aggregate productivity shocks, the higher the likelihood that periods of high
aggregate TFP will be characterized by high entry volumes, high survival rates, and
relatively low productivity of entrants and exiters.


5     Aggregate Fluctuations – Results
5.1    Cyclical Behavior of Entry and Exit

Table 5 reports the raw correlations of entry rate, exit rate, and the size of entrants
and exiters (relative to incumbents) with industry output. Consistent with the evidence
presented by Campbell (1998), the entry rate is pro–cyclical and the exit rate is counter–
cyclical.

                 Entry Rate    Exit Rate    Entrants’ Size   Exiters’ Size
                   0.402        -0.779         -0.725           -0.892


                       Table 5: Correlations with industry output.

    Interestingly, Campbell (1998) also provides evidence on the correlations between entry
rate, exit rate, and future and lagged output growth. He finds that the correlation of entry
with lagged output growth is greater than the contemporaneous correlation and that the
exit rate is positively correlated with future output growth.
    Our model is consistent with both features. The correlation of entry rate with con-
temporaneous output growth is 0.0039, while that with one–period lagged output growth
is 0.8359. The reason is that the entry decision is taken contingent on the information
available one period before the start of operations. The correlation coefficient between
exit rate and one– and two–period ahead output growth are 0.13 and 0.26, respectively.
Periods of low exit tend to be periods of high output. Given the mean–reverting nature
of aggregate productivity, on average such periods are followed by times of low output
growth.
    Analyzing data from the LRD, Lee and Mukoyama (2012) find that selection at entry
is quantitatively very important. Relative to incumbents, entering plants tend to be larger
during recessions. This is the case, according to their evidence, because entrants’ average
idiosyncratic productivity is counter-cyclical. Our model shares these features of the data.


                                            19
When the common productivity component is low, only firms with a relatively high level
of idiosyncratic productivity find it worthwhile to enter.
   The banking literature also found evidence in support of the claim that aggregate
conditions have an impact on selection at entry. A number of papers, among which
Cetorelli (2013), find that when credit market conditions are relatively favorable, entering
firms are less productive on average.
   In our model, the relative size of exiters is also higher during recessions. A drop in the
common productivity component leads to a lower value of all incumbents. It follows that
the marginal exiter will have a higher value of the idiosyncratic productivity component.

5.2   Impulse Responses

The objective of this section is to describe the impulse response functions in order to gain
some more intuition about the model’s dynamics. We initialize the system by assuming
that the distribution of firms is equal to the point–wise mean of distributions on the
ergodic set. The common productivity component is set at its mean value. At time t = 1,
we impose that the exogenous aggregate productivity component rises by about 7% and
we compute the evolution of the size distribution over the next 25 periods. We repeat

common productivity component from its unconditional mean. Not surprisingly, output,
the wage rate and employment display similar dynamics.
       Because of our timing assumptions, the industry composition does not depend upon
contemporaneous shocks. Entry is governed by past aggregate conditions, and exit occurs
after production has taken place. It follows that the contemporaneous response of output,
employment, and wage to the positive productivity shock is entirely due to the expansion
in hiring by incumbents.
       The compositional effects of the aggregate shock appear in the next period. The exit
rate declines, while the entry rate rises.8 As a result, the number of operating firms
also rises. It peaks in period 5, when the exit volume, which is rising back towards its
unconditional mean, overcomes the declining entry volume.
       Figure 10 illustrates the dynamics of selection in entry and exit. The average size and
idiosyncratic productivity of entrants (relative to incumbents) declines and then converges
back to its unconditional mean. This is the case because, on balance, the hike in aggregate
productivity and the ensuing increase in the wage imply a rise in the value of incumbency.
It follows that the average idiosyncratic productivity of the pool of entrants declines.
       The average size and idiosyncratic productivity of exiters (relative to non-exiters)
also declines. The improvement in aggregate factors implies an increase in the value of
continuing operations. As a result, the marginal firms, i.e. those indifferent between
exiting and staying, decline in quality. Since entry increases while exit declines, the
cross–sectional mean of idiosyncratic productivity decreases.
       Notice that the convergence of entry rate and exit rate to their respective unconditional
means is not monotone. The exit rate overshoots its long–run value. The entry rate
undershoots. Similarly, for all the statistics illustrated in Figure 10, except for the mass
of operating firms. This happens because the wage decays at a lower pace than aggregate
productivity.
       A few periods after the positive shock hits, the aggregate component of productivity
is back close to its unconditional mean. However, the wage is still relatively high. The
reason is that the volume of entry is finite and firms are born relatively small. As the
new entrants become more efficient, their labor demand increases, keeping the wage from
falling faster. With a relatively high wage and relatively low aggregate productivity, the
selection effect changes sign. Entry falls below its long–run value, while exit is higher
than that.
   8
    Following Dunne, Roberts, and Samuelson (1988), the period-t exit rate is the ratio of firms exiting
between period t and t + 1 and the number of operating firms in time t. This statistic drops in the period
where the shocks hits, but the effect of exit on the distribution only appears in the next period.

6     The relevance of entry and exit for aggregate dynamics
In this section we show that allowing for entry and exit enhances the model’s internal
propagation mechanism. A corollary is that measuring the aggregate Solow residual as
it is customary done in macroeconomics results in an upward bias in its persistence’s
estimate.
    This is the outcome of two forces. One is the pro–cyclicality of the entry rate. The
other is the fact that firms start out relatively unproductive, but quickly grow in size
and efficiency. This dynamics is reflected in the contribution of net entry to aggregate
productivity growth. As it is the case in the data, the contribution of new entrants is
small in their first year, but grows over time.
    Finally, we describe our model’s implications for the cyclicality of selected cross–
sectional moments.

6.1   Propagation

Think of the economy considered in Section 5, but abstract from entry and exit. At
every point in time, there is a mass of firms whose technology is exactly as specified
above. However, firms never exit. As our purpose is to compare such economy with
our benchmark, assume that the number of operating firms is equal to the unconditional
average number of incumbents that obtains along the benchmark’s equilibrium path.

                                     Figure 11: The effect of entry & exit on output dynamics.


   Figure 11 depicts the impulse response of industry output to a positive aggregate
shocks in our benchmark scenario and in the scenario without entry and exit, respectively.
   We argued above that in the benchmark scenario the contemporaneous response of
output is entirely due to incumbents. Therefore it is not surprising that the period–1
percentage deviation from the unconditional mean is the same across the two economies.
In period 2, output is greater in the benchmark economy, due to the increase in net entry.
   What we find particularly interesting is that the gap between the two time series keeps
increasing beyond t = 5, the period when net entry becomes negative. This is due to the
dynamics of firms born in the aftermath of the shock. Upon entry, these entities are
very small and therefore account for a rather small fraction of total output. Over time,
however, they grow in efficiency and size. This process takes place at the same time in
which the aggregate productivity component regresses towards its unconditional mean.
As a result, aggregate output falls at a slower pace.
   The mean–reversion of output is slower when we allow for entry and exit. In other
words, aggregate output is more persistent.
   A confirmation that this mechanism is indeed at work comes from inspection of Fig-
ure 12, which illustrates the dynamics of the Solow residual in the two economies. The
residual is computed by assuming an aggregate production function of the Cobb–Douglas
form with capital share equal to 0.3. That is, we plot log(Yt ) − α log(Kt ) − (1 − α) log(Lt ).
   The Solow residual is uniformly higher in the benchmark scenario with entry and exit.

              Figure 12: The effect of entry & exit on productivity dynamics.


The dynamics of the residual depends on the evolution of both zt and the distribution of
the idiosyncratic component st . In the benchmark economy, such distribution improves
stochastically over time. In the case without entry and exit, instead, it is time–invariant.
     This simple exercise hints that trying to infer information about the process generating
factor–neutral exogenous technical change using a model without entry or exit will give the
wrong answer. Such model will interpret changes in aggregate efficiency that results from
the reallocation of output shares towards more efficient firms as changes in the exogenous
aggregate component.
     We also conducted the alternative experiment of setting the parameters in the economy
without entry and exit in such a way that it generates the same values of the target
moments as the benchmark economy. To generate the target autocorrelation for output
growth, we had to set ρz = 0.775, much higher than the value of 0.685 assumed in Section
4.

6.2    Productivity Decomposition

Entry and exit enhance the model’s propagation mechanism because entry is pro–cyclical
and entrants’ productivity grows faster than incumbents’, drawing a reallocation of market
share towards them. Strong evidence in support of the latter claim comes from the litera-
ture that exploits longitudinal establishment data to study the determinants of aggregate
productivity growth.

                                                              24
       After thoroughly reviewing that literature, Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan (2001)
conclude that “studies that focus on high–frequency variation tend to find a small contri-
bution of net entry to aggregate productivity growth while studies over a longer horizon
find a large role for net entry.” They go on to add that “Part of this is virtually by con-
struction... Nevertheless, ... The gap between productivity of entering and exiting plants
also increases in the horizon over which the changes are measured since a longer hori-
zon yields greater differential from selection and learning effects.” That is, conditional on
survival entrants’ productivity grows faster.
       Not surprisingly, a productivity decomposition exercise carried out on simulated data
generated by our model yielded results which are qualitatively consistent with the evidence
illustrated by Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan (2001). On average, the contribution of net
entry to productivity growth is positive, as entering firms tend to be more productive than
the exiters they replace. Its magnitude is small when the interval between observations is
one period (equivalent to one year), but it increases with the time between observations.
In part, this is due to the mere fact that the output share accounted for by entrants is
larger, the longer the horizon over which changes are measured. However, it is also due
to the fact that entrants grow in size and productivity at a faster pace than incumbents.
       Define total factor productivity as the weighted sum of firm–level Solow residuals,
where the weights are the output shares. Let Ct denote the collection of plants active in
both periods t − k and t. The set Et includes the plants that entered between the two
dates and are still active at time t. In Xt−k are the firms that were active at time t − k,
but exited before time t.
       Following Haltiwanger (1997), the growth in TFP can be decomposed into five com-
ponents, corresponding to the addenda in equation (3). They are known as (i) the within
component, which measures the changes in productivity for continuing plants, (ii) the
between–plant portion, which reflects the change in output shares across continuing plants,
(iii) a covariance component, and finally (iv) entry and (v) exit components.9

In the last column, labeled Net Entry, we report the difference between the entry and exit
components. Recall that in our model the unconditional mean of aggregate productivity
growth is identically zero.

                   Table 6: Productivity Decomposition (percentages).

    The between and within components are necessarily negative, because of mean rever-
sion in the process driving idiosyncratic productivity. Larger firms, which tend to be more
productive, shrink on average. Smaller firms, on the contrary, tend to grow. The covari-
ance component is positive, because firms that become more productive also increase in
size.
    On average, both the entry and exit contributions are negative. This reflects the fact
that both entrants and exiters are less productive than average. However, entrants tend
to be more productive than exiters. The contribution of net entry to productivity growth
is positive regardless of the horizon.
    What’s most relevant for our analysis is that for k = 5 the contribution of net entry
is about twice that for k = 1. In part, this is due to the fact that the share of output
produced by entrants increases with k. However, this cannot be the whole story. The
contribution of entry is roughly −0.3% for k = 1 and goes to −0.76% for k = 5. If
entrants’ productivity did not grow faster than average, the contribution of entry for the
k = 5 horizon would be much smaller.

6.3     Cyclical Variation of Cross–sectional Moments

Starting with Eisfeldt and Rampini (2006), a number of papers have assessed the cyclical
behavior of the cross–sectional distribution of productivity. Particular interest has been
paid to the evolution of the second moment.
    Exploiting the German dataset USTAN and data from the US Census of Manufactur-
ing, respectively, Bachman and Bayer (2013) and Bloom, Floetotto, Jaimovich, Saporta-
Eksten, and Terry (2012) conclude that the standard deviation of idiosyncratic TFP
growth is countercyclical. Kehrig (2011), also analyzing US Census data, reports that a
measure of dispersion of the level of TFP is countercyclical as well.
    In spite of our assumption that the stochastic process governing idiosyncratic produc-


                                            26
tivity is constant across time and across firms, the equilibrium allocation of our model
features non–trivial dynamics of the cross–sectional distribution of productivity. The rea-
son, as it is by now clear, is that the net entry rate, as well as selection in entry and exit,
are time–varying.
   The impulse response functions discussed in section 5 hint that when industry output
is high, the idiosyncratic productivity of both entrants and exiters is relatively low. Since
the entry-rate is pro–cyclical while the exit–rate is counter–cyclical, it follows that the
first moment of the idiosyncratic productivity distribution is counter-cyclical.
   Another robust implication of the model is that skewness is pro–cyclical. In Section 3
we showed that, consistent with the evidence, the productivity distribution is positively
skewed. During expansions, both entrants and exiters are less productive than average.
Since the net entry rate is pro–cyclical, skewness increases.
   This feature is illustrated in Figure 13, which plots the difference between the (av-
erage) fraction of firms associated with each level of idiosyncratic shock in expansion
and in recession, respectively. When industry output is high, there are relatively more
low–productivity firms and relatively less high–productivity firms. The right tail of the
distribution is thinner.

   Unfortunately the prediction for the cyclicality of the second moment is not robust.
Our simulations show that the sign of the correlation between second moment and industry
output changes with relatively minor changes in parameter values.

7    Conclusion

This paper provides a framework to study the dynamics of the cross–section of firms and
its implications for aggregate dynamics. When calibrated to match a set of moments of
the investment process, our model delivers implications for firm dynamics and for the
cyclicality of entry and exit that are consistent with the evidence.
    The survival rate increases with size. The growth rate of employment is decreasing
with size and age, both unconditionally and conditionally. The size distribution of firms
is skewed to the right. When tracking the size distribution over the life a cohort, the
skewness declines with age.
    The entry rate is positively correlated with current and lagged output growth. The
exit rate is negatively correlated with output growth and positively associated with future
growth.
    We show that allowing for entry and exit enhances the internal propagation mechanism
of the model. This obtains because the entry rate is pro–cyclical and recent entrants grow
faster than incumbents.
    A positive shock to aggregate productivity leads to an in increase in entry. Con-
sistent with the empirical evidence, the new entrants are smaller and less efficient than
incumbents. The skewness of the distribution of firms over the idiosyncratic productivity
component increases. As the exogenous component of aggregate productivity declines
towards its unconditional mean, the new entrants that survive grow in productivity and
size. That is, the distribution of idiosyncratic productivity improves.
    For a version of our model without entry or exit to generate a data–conforming per-
sistence of output, the first–order autocorrelation of aggregate productivity shocks must
be 0.775. In the benchmark scenario with entry and exit, it needs only be 0.685.

A      Numerical Approximation

Our algorithm consists of the following steps.
                                                                        n                     o
    1. Guess values for the parameters of the wage forecasting rule β̂ = β̂0 , β̂1 , β̂2 , β̂3 ;

    2. Approximate the value function of the incumbent firm;

    3. Simulate the economy for T periods, starting from an arbitrary initial condition
       (z0 , Γ0 );

    4. Obtain a new guess for β̂ by running regression (2) over the time–series {wt , zt }Tt=S+1 ,
       where S is the number of observations to be scrapped because the dynamical system
       has not reached its ergodic set yet;

    5. If the new guess for β̂ is close to the previous one, stop. If not, go back to step 2.

A.1     Approximation of the Value Function

The incumbent’s value function is approximated by value function iteration.

    1. Start by defining grids for the state variables w, z, k, s. Denote them as Ψw , Ψz ,
       Ψk , and Ψs , respectively. The wage grid is equally spaced and centered around
       the equilibrium wage of the stationary economy. The capital grid is constructed
       following the method suggested by McGrattan (1999). The grids and transition
       matrices for the two shocks are constructed following Tauchen (1986). For all pairs
       (s, s′ ) such that s, s′ ∈ Ψs , let H(s′ |s) denote the probability that next period’s
       idiosyncratic shock equals s′ , conditional on today’s being s. For all (z, z ′ ) such
       that z, z ′ ∈ Ψz , let also G(z ′ |z) denote the probability that next period’s aggregate
       shock equals z ′ , conditional on today’s being z.

    2. For all triplets (w, z, z ′ ) on the grid, the forecasting rule yields a wage forecast for
       the next period (tildes denote elements not on the grid):

                           log(w̃′ ) = β̂0 + β̂1 log(w) + β̂2 log(z ′ ) + β̂3 log(z).

       In general, w̃′ will not belong to the grid of wages. There will be contiguous grid
                                                                                            w̃ ′ −wi
       points (wi , wi+1 ) such that wi ≤ w̃′ ≤ wi+1 . Now let J(wi |w, z, z ′ ) = 1 −     wi+1 −wi ,
                                w̃ ′ −wi
       J(wi+1 |w, z, z ′ ) =   wi+1 −wi ,   and J(wj |w, z, z ′ ) = 0 for all j such that j 6= i and
       j 6= i + 1. This allows us to evaluate the value function for values of the wage which
       are off the grid by linear interpolation;

                                                     29
 3. For all grid elements (w, z, k, s), guess values for the value function V0 (w, z, k, s);

 4. The revised guess of the value function, V1 (w, z, k, s), is determined as follows:

        V1 (w, z, k, s) =π(w, z, k, s) + P r[cf > c∗f (w, z, k, s)]Vx (k)

      over the dimensions (w, q).               For all pairs w̃, q̃, denote the value of entering as
      Ṽe (w̃, z, q̃).

A.4                                More Accuracy Tests of the Forecasting Rule

Forecasting errors are essentially unbiased – the mean error is -0.00017% of the forecasting
price – and uncorrelated with the price (the correlation coefficient between the two series
is -0.0456) and the aggregate shock (-0.0045).

               In the left panel of Figure 14 is the scatter plot of the forecasting errors against the
market clearing price. In the right panel is the time series of the forecasting error. The
good news is that errors do not cumulate.
