                                          ABSTRACT

We study the resolution of global banks by national regulators. Single-point-of-entry (SPOE)
resolution, where loss-absorbing capital is shared across jurisdictions, is efficient but may not be
implementable. First, when expected transfers across jurisdictions are too asymmetric, national
regulators fail to set up SPOE resolution ex ante. Second, when required ex-post transfers are too
large, national regulators ring-fence assets instead of cooperating in SPOE resolution. In this
case, a multiple-point-of-entry (MPOE) resolution, where loss-absorbing capital is preassigned, is
more robust. Our analysis highlights a fundamental link between efficient bank resolution and the
operational structures and risks of global banks.

    One of the main unresolved issues in financial regulation is how to deal with global financial banks

that are too big to fail. The collapse of Lehman Brothers demonstrated the immense costs of the failure of

such an institution, with devastating repercussions for the financial system and the broader economy. Yet

bailouts and public guarantees that would prevent such failures also involve costs, creating moral hazard

and incentives for financial institutions to grow ever larger and more complex. The proposed solution to

this dilemma is bank resolution. Both Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S. and the Bank Recovery

and Resolution Directive (BRRD) in the E.U. call for novel but, as of yet, untested resolution mechanisms

for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The aim of these proposals is to end too big to fail by

providing a credible way to resolve and recapitalize failing G-SIBs with minimal disruption and without

taxpayer support.1

    In this paper we analyze the key trade-offs that arise in cross-border resolution of global banks, taking

into account the political constraints faced by national regulators. We show that, although conducting a

single, global resolution for an entire multinational bank (a “single-point-of-entry” resolution) is efficient in

principle, it is not always compatible with the interests of national regulatory authorities, who may prefer

to ring-fence their national banking industries. In that situation, conducting (and planning for) separate

resolutions in different jurisdictions (a “multiple-point-of-entry” resolution) is more efficient. Overall, our

model highlights that credible G-SIB resolution is not “one size fits all.” Rather, resolution should take

into account a bank’s risk structure and operational complementarities across different jurisdictions.

    The challenge in designing resolution mechanisms for G-SIBs is to adapt existing resolution procedures

for smaller (i.e., national or regional) banks to the resolution of much larger banks that operate across

multiple jurisdictions. Indeed, resolution under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act is partially modeled after

the FDIC receivership procedure used to resolve smaller and medium-sized banks. A central element

of FDIC resolution is Purchase and Assumption (P&A), by which a healthy bank purchases assets and

assumes liabilities of the troubled bank. For a modest-sized bank, such a resolution and sale can usually

be completed over a weekend, such that operations can resume on the following Monday. In contrast, for

a failing G-SIB such a swift transfer of assets and liabilities over the course of a weekend is typically not

feasible. G-SIBs are simply too large, and their balance sheets far too complex for a quick P&A to be an

option. In addition, the resolution of G-SIBs has an inherent cross-jurisdictional component that is not an

issue when the FDIC resolves a domestic bank.

   The proposed solution to this challenge is to perform a G-SIB resolution through a liability-side re-

structuring of the failing institution (see FDIC and Bank of England (2012), Financial Stability Board

(FSB) (2014)). Specifically, troubled operating subsidiaries of a G-SIB are recapitalized by writing down

long-term liabilities known as TLAC (“total loss absorbing capital” in the form of equity and subordinated

long-term debt) issued by a non-operating holding company. Crucially, recapitalization via a non-operating

holding company allows the G-SIB’s operating subsidiaries to remain open for business as usual during

the resolution and protects the operating subsidiaries’ runnable short-term liabilities, thereby preventing

destabilizing runs on the G-SIB’s operations.

   There has been a lively debate among policymakers about two alternative resolution models, illustrated

in Figure 1: Multiple-point-of-entry (MPOE) resolution, under which the global bank is split along ju-

risdictional lines and national regulators perform a separate resolution, drawing on loss-absorbing capital

and liquidity held separately by national holding companies in each jurisdiction, and single-point-of-entry

(SPOE) resolution, under which a global bank is resolved as a whole through a single global holding com-

pany that holds banking subsidiaries in multiple jurisdictions. The key difference is that under MPOE

loss-absorbing capital is not shared across jurisdictions and no cross-jurisdictional transfers occur, whereas

SPOE allows for the sharing of loss-absorbing capital and cross-jurisdictional transfers during resolution.

   The contribution of our paper is to characterize the main trade-offs between MPOE and SPOE reso-

lution in the context of a simple model of global banks and national regulators. We first show that bank

resolution that is conducted exclusively through an intervention on the liability side—by imposing losses on

equity or writing down debt issued by the financial institution’s holding company—has to go hand in hand

with a regulatory requirement for holding companies to issue a sufficient amount of equity or long-term

debt so as to guarantee sufficient loss-absorbing capacity. In our model, asymmetric information about

Figure 1: MPOE and SPOE resolution. The figure illustrates multiple-point-of-entry (MPOE) and
single-point-of-entry (SPOE) resolution. Under MPOE (left panel), loss-absorbing capital, in the form of
outside equity and long-term debt, is issued separately by national holding companies in each jurisdiction.
In resolution the global bank is split up, and national regulators perform separate resolutions, drawing on
the loss-absorbing capital available in each jurisdiction. Consequently, loss-absorbing capital is not shared,
and there are no cross-jurisdictional transfers during resolution. Under SPOE (right panel), loss-absorbing
capital is issued by a global holding company and is therefore shared across jurisdictions. Because the
bank is resolved as a whole, in contrast to MPOE, SPOE allows for cross-jurisdictional transfers during
resolution.

long-term cash-flows makes equity and long-term debt expensive relative to short-term debt. Therefore,

absent a requirement to issue long-term loss-absorbing securities, financial institutions may choose to rely

excessively on short-term debt as a source of funding. Because runnable short-term debt cannot credibly

be written down, an orderly resolution then becomes impossible. As in the fall of 2008, this would leave a

disorderly liquidation via a bank run or a tax-funded bailout as the only remaining options.

   We then show that for global financial institutions that operate in multiple jurisdictions, SPOE is the

efficient resolution mechanism in a benchmark setting in which regulators maximize joint surplus and can

commit to cooperating in the middle of a crisis, thereby emulating the actions of a benevolent supra-


                                                                   3
national regulator. Because SPOE resolution allows regulators to transfer resources between operating

subsidiaries in different jurisdictions, a successful SPOE resolution regime can be achieved with a lower

amount of required loss-absorbing capital than would be possible under separate national MPOE resolution

schemes. As a result, for the same level of risk acceptable to regulators, SPOE resolution allows global

financial institutions to provide more socially beneficial banking services than would be possible under

MPOE resolution. Moreover, because the bank is resolved as a whole, efficiency gains from global banking

are preserved.

   However, under the regulatory status quo—in which global financial institutions are resolved by na-

tional regulators—it may be difficult to realize the benefits of a global SPOE resolution. First, whenever

expected cross-jurisdictional transfers are sufficiently asymmetric, the national regulator that makes the

larger expected transfer has an incentive to opt out of a globally efficient cross-jurisdiction SPOE resolu-

tion and to set up a national resolution scheme instead. From an ex-ante perspective, the creation of an

efficient SPOE resolution regime is therefore feasible only if the expected cross-jurisdictional transfers are

sufficiently symmetric.

   Second, SPOE resolution may not be implementable ex post, even when agreed upon ex ante. When

the cross-jurisdictional transfer required for a successful SPOE resolution is too large, regulators may

prefer to ring-fence assets in their own jurisdiction, thereby preventing the required transfers. The planned

SPOE resolution breaks down, leading to a disorderly liquidation or a tax-funded bailout. We show that

the possibility of such an ex-post breakdown of a planned SPOE resolution depends on the risk profile

and operational structure of the financial institution at hand. In particular, incentive-compatible SPOE

resolution requires operational complementarities across national banking operations, such as those arising

from joint cash management or other shared services. It is the prospect of losing these complementarities

that incentivizes regulators not to ring-fence assets ex post.

   When SPOE resolution is not ex-post incentive compatible, MPOE resolution, where loss-absorbing

capital is held by national holding companies in each jurisdiction, can still support a successful resolution.

MPOE resolution eliminates some of the diversification benefits that would be achievable under SPOE, but


                                                      4
the absence of cross-jurisdictional transfers implies that MPOE is not subject to ex-post incentive compati-

bility constraints. Accordingly, ex-post incentive compatibility generates a link between bank structure and

the appropriate resolution model. In particular, for global banks with more decentralized operations and

larger required transfers during resolution, a more robust MPOE resolution model is appropriate. More

generally, we show that the constrained optimal resolution mechanism in this situation follows a hybrid

approach, where an appropriate amount of loss-absorbing capital is pre-assigned to particular jurisdictions,

thereby restoring incentive compatibility while preserving (some) of the benefits of resource sharing in res-

olution. These results shed light on recent proposals for the prepositioning of “internal TLAC” within

G-SIBs.

   Finally, we investigate how the choice of resolution regime affects the incentives of local operating

subsidiaries. We first show that, under SPOE resolution, the local operating subsidiaries only exert effort

to produce cash flows that generate diversification benefits across jurisdictions if resolution is sufficiently

unlikely. Effectively, cross-jurisdictional transfers result in a state-contingent debt overhang problem that

reduces incentives to generate cash flows that generate diversification benefits. When incentives to generate

these cash flows cannot be sustained in equilibrium, SPOE resolution loses some of its appeal and an MPOE

approach can become more appropriate. We then provide a more general comparison of incentives under

MPOE and SPOE. Here we show that the operating subsidiaries’ incentives to produce the cash flows

depend on the net effect of two forces. On the one hand, SPOE dampens incentives relative to MPOE

because cash flows generated in one jurisdiction can be transferred to plug a hole in the other jurisdiction.

On the other hand, because it economizes on loss-absorbing capital, SPOE resolution can allow the bank to

offer larger (inside) equity stakes to affiliate managers, providing stronger incentives to generate cash flow.

TLAC composition affects incentives under both SPOE and MPOE. However, whereas under SPOE a larger

fraction of TLAC in the form of debt always improves incentives, under MPOE it is possible that incentives

are maximized under all-equity TLAC. With respect to the hotly debated issue of TLAC composition, our

model therefore indicates that the right debt-equity mix depends on the adopted resolution model.




                                                      5
   Despite the ongoing policy debate (see, in particular, Tucker (2014a,b)), there is almost no formal

economic analysis of the trade-offs between MPOE and SPOE resolution. One exception is Faia and

Weder di Mauro (2016), who analyze how the losses that regulators impose on domestic and foreign

bondholders under MPOE and SPOE resolution depend on a bank’s mix of domestic and foreign assets

and liabilities. Another exception is Ervin (2017), who provides a quantitative analysis of the loss of

diversification and greater risk of failure, for the same amount of aggregate capital, that results from the

elimination of a flexible central capital reserve under MPOE resolution. Several related papers investigate

other aspects of bank resolution: Jackson and Skeel (2012) and Skeel (2014) compare resolution under Dodd

Frank with the alternative of restructuring a failed G-SIB through bankruptcy; Duffie (2014) discusses the

resolution of failing central counterparties, which, like G-SIBs, are likely to be too big to fail; Walther and

White (2017) provide a model of bank resolution in which regulators may be too soft during a resolution,

for fear of spooking market participants; Beck et al. (2013) analyze how incentives for national regulators

to intervene depend on foreign asset holdings and equity ownership of the bank in question. The cross-

jurisdictional focus of our analysis relates to the literature on transnational bankruptcy for non-financial

institutions. In particular, consistent with our analysis, Bebchuk and Guzman (1999) argue that the

territoriality rule in bankruptcy law is inefficient and dominated by the universalism rule. Nevertheless,

political economy considerations often lead national bankruptcy courts to inefficiently implement national

bankruptcy proceedings.

   A number of papers explore the supervision (but not resolution) of multinational banks. Dell’Ariccia

and Marquez (2006) characterize the trade-off between internalizing externalities and loss of flexibility

inherent in regulatory unions. They show that supra-national capital regulation is less likely to emerge when

national regulators differ in the extent to which they are captured by their domestic financial industries.

In similar spirit, Beck and Wagner (2013) find that the benefits from supra-national regulation increase

with cross-border externalities but decrease with country heterogeneity. Carletti et al. (2015) show that

some of the benefits of centralized supervision may be offset by inferior information collection by national

regulators. Calzolari and Lóránth (2011), Colliard (2015), and Calzolari et al. (2015) study the incentives


                                                      6
of regulators to monitor multinational banks and investigate how national or supra-national supervision

interacts with banks’ legal structures and their decisions to expand abroad. Lóránth and Morrison (2007)

consider a model of a multinational bank that has excess risk-taking incentives driven by insured deposits.

They argue that bank shareholders prefer to set up foreign subsidiaries rather than bank branches because

this organizational structure gives rise to a less diversified portfolio, which is more attractive to risk-

seeking shareholders. Our analysis complements these studies by exploring the supra-national aspects of

bank resolution (as opposed to supervision). More generally, the idea of resolving banks and preventing

bank runs by imposing losses on long-term creditors is related to recapitalization via contingent convertible

securities (CoCos). For a survey of this literature, see Flannery (2014). Finally, whereas our analysis focuses

on loss-absorbing capital on the liability side, Diamond and Kashyap (2015) explore the role of liquidity

requirements on the asset side in preventing bank runs.


1     Model


We consider a model with three dates, t = 0, 1, 2. There are two types of players: (1) a multinational

financial institution that operates in two jurisdictions and (2) two national regulators with resolution

authority in their respective jurisdiction.


1.1    The Global Bank

A multinational financial institution operates two subsidiaries, each located in a different jurisdiction,

i = 1, 2, say, the U.S. and the U.K.2 Each operating subsidiary runs its own stylized banking operation,

which we model as follows. At date 0, each subsidiary raises a fixed amount F , which it invests in the

provision of banking services. This investment is funded through a combination of short-term debt with

face value R1 due at date 1 (for example, demand deposits, wholesale funding, certificates of deposit, short-

term commercial paper), long-term subordinated debt with face value RLT due at date 2, and an outside
   2
     In line with current resolution proposals, we focus our analysis on subsidiary structures. In Section 6.4, we provide
a discussion of the choice between branch and subsidiary structures in the context of bank resolution. Note also that, in
practice, global banks usually also have multiple operating subsidiaries within the same jurisdiction. We abstract away from
this consideration in order to focus on the international aspect of resolving global financial institutions.



                                                             7
equity stake α0 that is issued at date 0. We assume that outside equity and long-term subordinated debt

are issued by a holding company that owns the equity of the operating subsidiaries, as illustrated in Figure

1. Under this arrangement, operating subsidiary losses are automatically passed up to the holding company

and absorbed by the holders of equity and long-term debt issued by the holding company. Issuing loss-

absorbing securities at the holding company level implies that these securities are structurally subordinated

to the short-term debt claims that are issued by the operating subsidiaries. During a resolution, when time

is of the essence, it is then straightforward to determine which claims will absorb losses, allowing for a

speedy resolution.3 Moreover, issuing subordinated claims at the holding company level potentially allows

for the sharing across jurisdictions of the loss-absorbing capacity that is provided by these securities.

       To capture the benefits of banking activity and liquidity provision, we assume that each dollar of

safe short-term debt issued by the bank yields a liquidity benefit γ > 0 over and above the cash flows

backing this claim. This assumption captures, in reduced form, the benefits from maturity transformation

performed by banks4 and the non-pecuniary liquidity services obtained from safe money-like securities

issued by banks.5

       Banking operations yield cash flows at dates 1 and 2. At date 1, there are two possible aggregate states.

With probability p1 the high aggregate state occurs and both operating subsidiaries receive a high cash

flow C1H . With probability 1 − p1 , the low aggregate state is realized and both subsidiaries receive the low

cash flow 0 < C1L < C1H . The aggregate state captures undiversifiable cash-flow risk that both operating

subsidiaries are exposed to. For simplicity, we assume that the two operating subsidiaries have the same

exposure to the aggregate shock.
   3
      In addition, to guarantee structural subordination, the holding company is generally required not to have any operations
of its own (i.e., it is a non-operating or “clean” holding company).
    4
      See Diamond and Dybvig (1983), Calomiris and Kahn (1991), and Diamond and Rajan (2001)
    5
      When safe short-term debt issued by the bank functions as money (e.g., deposits), the interest paid by the bank on these
claims is lower than the market interest rate, reflecting the demand for money, as in Klein (1974). As pointed out by Nagel
(2016), the available evidence suggests that demand deposits pay between 1/3 and 1/2 of the market interest rate. For claims
that are close money substitutes (e.g., repos, short-term commercial paper, etc.), the interest paid by the bank is reduced by
the premium on near-money assets. Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) and Greenwood et al. (2015) document a
premium for near-money assets of around 40-70 basis points. Sunderam (2014) and Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen
(2015) show that the financial sector reacts to capture this premium by issuing safe short-term debt.




                                                              8
       In addition to this aggregate cash-flow risk, the operating subsidiaries are also exposed to diversifiable

cash-flow risk at date 1. Specifically, we assume that one of the two banking subsidiaries receives an

additional cash flow of ∆ > 0. This additional cash flow ∆ is received by the operating subsidiary in

jurisdiction i with probability θi , where θ1 + θ2 = 1. Therefore, even though ∆ is risk-free from a global

perspective, it is a risky cash flow from the perspective of each individual operating subsidiary.6 We assume

that the bank cannot easily hedge this risk.7 We assume that C1H is sufficiently high that both operating

subsidiaries can meet their short-term liabilities in the high cash-flow state, irrespective of who receives ∆.

When C1L is realized, on the other hand, the banking subsidiaries will not necessarily have sufficient funds

to repay or roll over their short-term debt obligation R1 , thereby creating a need for bank resolution.

       The cash flow at date 2 summarizes the continuation (or franchise) value of the two subsidiaries. We

assume that with probability pi2 the operating subsidiary in jurisdiction i receives a positive continuation

value of C2 = V .8 With probability 1 − pi2 , there is no continuation value (C2 = 0). The probability pi2

of receiving the continuation value V is private information of the bank, both at date 0 and at date 1.

For simplicity, we assume that pi2 ∈ {0, 1} and that uninformed investors’ belief that pi2 = 1 is given by

p2 (again, both at date 0 and at date 1). As in Bolton and Freixas (2000, 2006), the assumption that

pi2 is private information implies that it is expensive for a bank with high pi2 to raise funds against the

continuation cash flows at date 2. This is why long-term debt and equity are expensive funding sources

relative to short-term debt.
   6
     This cash flow structure captures the diversification benefits arising from operations in multiple jurisdictions. Empirically,
these diversification benefits can be estimated from the correlation of earnings across jurisdictions. We have chosen the simplest
possible representation of these benefits, where ∆ is of known size and always materializes. It is relatively straightforward to
extend our framework to allow for random ∆ or for uncertainty about whether ∆ is received at all. We discuss these extensions
in more detail in the online appendix. They do not lead to major changes in the economic insights of our model.
   7
     In the simplest interpretation, this assumption captures the fact that there may simply be no financial instrument available
for hedging this risk. Even when a hedging instrument is available, it is realistic to assume that this does not allow the bank
to hedge this risk in the resolution state, where private contracts can be overruled by resolution authorities. In particular,
resolution authorities can generally prevent a transfer of resources from one jurisdiction to the other by ring-fencing assets, as
discussed in more detail below.
   8
     Without much loss of generality and to reduce the number of subcases to consider we assume that the date-2 continuation
values of the operating subsidiaries in each jurisdiction i are identical, Vi = V .




                                                                9
       When an operating subsidiary is unable to repay or roll over its short-term debt at date 1, short-term

creditors run on the bank’s short-term liabilities and the bank is liquidated at date 1.9 We assume that

that liquidation is inefficient, in the sense that the liquidation payoff L is strictly smaller than the market’s

expected value of the banking franchise, L < p2 V .

       Finally, we model the (potential) benefits arising from global banking activity by assuming that the

continuation value V is contingent on the two subsidiaries continuing to operate within the same global

bank after date 1. If the two subsidiaries are separated at date 1 (for example, because national regulators

invoke separate resolution procedures, or when one of the two subsidiaries is liquidated), this reduces the

continuation value to λV , where λ ≤ 1. This assumption captures the loss of economies of scale and scope

that results from the break-up of the global bank. For example, separation of the subsidiaries eliminates

efficiency gains arising from joint cash management, common IT systems, and other shared services.10 If

the operating subsidiaries want to prevent the reduction in continuation value that results from a split-up

of the global bank at date 1, they can do so by setting up redundant systems ex ante (for example, by

making sure that each operating subsidiary has its own independent cash management system). Redundant

systems require a higher setup cost Fe > F . However, when a split-up of the global bank is sufficiently

likely, it may be efficient to incur this higher setup cost than losing economies of scope ex post. A key

implication of this assumption is that it generates an interaction between the resolution model and the

global bank’s operational structure: SPOE may be better suited to a G-SIB without redundant systems

and with large economies of scale and scope, while MPOE may be more appropriate for a G-SIB with

redundant systems in place.11
   9
      More precisely, a run occurs when, at date 1, the sum of the current cash flow and the value of future cash flows that
can be pledged to short-term creditors is less than the face value to be repaid to short-term creditors. This means that, for
simplicity, we rule out coordination-driven runs.
   10
      While the early empirical literature did not find conclusive evidence of economies of scale and scope in banking activity
(see, e.g., the survey by Berger et al. (1993)), more recent papers, relying on more recent data and updated methodology,
document significant economies of scale and scope in banking. For example, Wheelock and Wilson (2012) find evidence of
positive returns to scale for most banks, even the largest ones, over the sample period of 1984-2006. Hughes and Mester (2013)
find positive returns to scale, with the largest estimated scale economies in the largest size categories (above $50 bn in assets).
Anderson and Jõeveer (2017) find efficiency benefits for large, complex banks, stemming particularly from a bank’s scope (i.e.,
the diversity of its business lines). They show that bank scope, in turn, is strongly correlated with being a global bank.
   11
      The assumption on scale economies implies that, in our framework, a banking structure with two national banks is always
dominated by initially setting up a global bank that may then sometimes be split during an SPOE resolution. Intuitively
speaking, it is better to lose economies of scale only when necessary.



                                                                10
1.2      National Bank Regulators

Whereas the bank is global in its operations, the regulators that act as resolution authorities are national.

This assumption, which captures the regulatory status quo, constitutes the key regulatory friction in our

model. Specifically, we assume that national regulators follow national objectives and that their sovereignty

allows them to ring-fence assets in their own jurisdiction. In the context of our model, ring-fencing means

that the diversifiable cash flow ∆ can be shielded from being used for cross-jurisdictional transfers by the

authorities in the jurisdiction where this cash flow materializes (i.e., ∆ can be ring-fenced in the jurisdiction

in which it materializes).

       In Section 3, we first consider a benchmark case, in which the two national regulators jointly maximize

global welfare and can credibly commit to a resolution plan ex ante, thereby emulating a supra-national

regulatory authority. In Section 4, which contains our main results, we then contrast this benchmark

with the more realistic scenario, in which regulators cannot credibly commit to a resolution plan and

act according to the best interests of their own jurisdiction. This non-commitment case captures the

regulatory status quo because, in the absence of an international treaty on bank resolution, sovereignty

makes it impossible for regulators to credibly commit to cooperating with other regulators in a G-SIB

resolution. Therefore, when push comes to shove, regulators will act in their own national interest and

regulatory incentive constraints become key to successful resolution.12 While in our model national interests

are simply assumed, they arise naturally from political economy considerations. In particular, national

regulators are likely to be reluctant to share resources with other jurisdictions in resolution, unless doing so

improves the resolution outcome in their own jurisdiction.13 To capture this in the simplest possible way,

we assume that, in resolution, each national regulator maximizes value in its own jurisdiction, disregarding
  12
     Notwithstanding the efforts of the G-20, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and the Basel Accords, a binding treaty on
bank resolution that is enshrined in international law is unlikely to emerge anytime soon. In the absence of such an international
treaty, regulators and resolution authorities can form supervisory colleges and issue Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs).
However, because MoUs are not legally binding, they generally do not solve the problem that regulators will ultimately act
in their national interest. As pointed out by Schoenmaker (2013, p.15): “The last article of a typical MoU specifies that the
arrangements discussed are not legally binding and thus preserve the sovereignty of national supervisors.”
  13
     For example, if sharing resources does not improve outcomes in their own jurisdiction, national regulators are likely to
prefer retaining those resources as dry powder should the situation in their own jurisdiction worsen. Alternatively, they may
want to improve recovery amounts in their jurisdiction. For example, if holders of TLAC securities are predominantly located
in the home jurisdiction, then the home regulator may prefer to sacrifice operations in the host jurisdiction to improve recovery
for domestic TLAC investors.


                                                               11
outcomes in the other jurisdiction. Of course, assuming this extreme form of national interest is not

necessary; all of our results hold as long as the regulator in jurisdiction i applies a discount to cash flows

in jurisdiction j.


1.3     Discussion of Model Ingredients

The main goal of our analysis is to isolate the key trade-offs involved in choosing between different resolution

regimes for global banks. To do this in a transparent fashion, our model is intentionally simple and a number

of model features are simply represented in reduced form. The model could be extended to explicitly

microfound these ingredients, but this would result in a more complicated and much less transparent

framework.

      Of course, the simplicity of our model necessarily implies that some important aspects of bank resolution

are not addressed in our framework. For example, our model assumes that it is always feasible to set aside

sufficient loss absorbing capacity to recapitalize a troubled subsidiary. An interesting extension of our

analysis would consider what happens when this is not the case. Moreover, the two-period structure of

our model does not deal with some important dynamic issues, such as how banks rebuild loss-absorbing

capacity over time after a resolution. It also precludes a quantitative analysis of the required amount of

loss-absorbing capital. These are certainly interesting issues for future research.


2     The Need for Minimum Loss-Absorbing Capital Requirements


A key condition for the proposed G-SIB resolution mechanisms to work is that the bank holding company

has total loss-absorbing capital (TLAC)—in the form of equity or subordinated long-term debt—that is

large enough to absorb losses that arise at its operating subsidiaries to an extent that the short-term

liabilities of the operating subsidiaries are safe. Then, even if heavy losses reduce the value of operating

subsidiary assets below its liabilities, the holding company has sufficient capital to plug the hole, thereby

preventing a creditor run on its operating subsidiaries, which can continue to operate as usual during

resolution.


                                                       12
    Because the proposed resolution mechanisms rely on sufficient loss-absorbing capital, the first key

question in assessing G-SIB resolution is whether the controlling shareholders of the bank holding company

will, in fact, find it in their interest to issue a sufficient amount TLAC. As we show in Proposition 1, this

is generally not the case. The reason is that asymmetric information about long-term cash flows make

equity and long-term debt expensive relative to short-term debt. If the asymmetric information discount is

large enough, the shareholders of the holding company find it privately optimal to rely on risky short-term

debt financing, even at the risk of a default and ensuing creditor run at date 1. Therefore, a minimum

TLAC requirement is an essential complement to the proposed G-SIB resolution mechanisms. Proposition

1 summarizes this result. The detailed derivation of the bank’s financing choices and the resulting pooling

equilibrium is provided in Appendix A.


Proposition 1. Minimum TLAC requirement. In the absence of a minimum amount of required

TLAC, the equityholders of the holding company choose to rely exclusively on risky short-term debt financing

when p2 < p∗2 (γ, L). Therefore, when p2 < p∗2 (γ, L), a minimum TLAC requirement is necessary as a

complement to both SPOE and MPOE resolution.


    Proposition 1 shows that when the asymmetric information friction is sufficiently severe, the equilibrium

financing choice of the bank holding company is risky short-term debt. Essentially, when p2 is sufficiently

low relative to the benefits of safe short-term debt and liquidation costs, the shareholders of a bank with

high continuation value (C2 = V ) finds it optimal to risk liquidation at date 1 and lose the benefit of safe

short-term debt financing in order to escape the discount associated with long-term financing.14 From a

social perspective, exclusive reliance on short-term debt when p2 < p∗2 (γ, L) is inefficient. Risky short-

term debt has no social benefit (whenever funding is possible with short-term debt, it is also possible

with sufficient loss-absorbing capital). Yet risky short-term debt has a social cost, because it but leads to

inefficient liquidation in the bad state and eliminates the social value of safe short-term debt securities.15
  14
     Banks with low continuation value (C2 = 0) have no choice but to mimic this funding choice, because otherwise they
would be revealed as unprofitable.
  15
     It is worth pointing out that the unwillingness of owners of the banking operation to issue securities that provide enough
loss-absorbing capacity is not driven by an expectation of a bailout at date 1. Even if the government can commit not to
bail out, the dilution cost associated with claims that provide loss-absorbing capacity implies that the owners of the banking


                                                              13
3     MPOE and SPOE Resolution under a Supra-National Regulator


In this section, we compare MPOE and SPOE resolution in a benchmark setting, in which the resolution

is carried out by a benevolent supra-national regulator. This benevolent supra-national regulator chooses

the resolution regime that maximizes the ex-ante expected value of the global bank (equivalent to ex-ante

surplus) and can commit to implement the required ex-post transfers across jurisdictions under SPOE

resolution. There are two main advantages of SPOE resolution: First, the ability to make transfers across

subsidiaries in different jurisdictions generates coinsurance benefits, which translate into lower required

TLAC for the global bank. This, in turn, increases the bank’s capacity to provide banking services through

short-term debt issuance. Second, under SPOE resolution, the two subsidiaries continue to operate as part

of the same global bank even after a resolution, allowing the global bank to fully capture economies of

scale and scope from shared services.


3.1     MPOE Resolution

MPOE involves a separate resolution in each jurisdiction. During this process, the global bank is broken

up.16 In addition, TLAC for each subsidiary is held by the respective national holding company and is not

shared across jurisdictions. Accordingly, TLAC in each jurisdiction must be set such that the operating

subsidiary can meet its short-term liabilities R1 even when it generates only C1L at date 1 and the G-SIB

is split up during resolution.

      To guarantee a successful resolution, the amount of short-term debt issued by the operating subsidiary

must be limited to an amount that it can be safely serviced or rolled over during a resolution. The maximum

amount of short-term debt that can be rolled over at date 1 (with the resolution authority imposing losses
operation may prefer to rely exclusively on short-term debt. Of course, if the government faces a commitment problem that
could result in ex-post bailouts, the incentives to rely on short-term debt are even larger.
   16
      The break-up that occurs as part of MPOE resolution is highlighted, for example, by Tucker (2013), who notes that under
SPOE “[t]he group stays together” whereas “[u]nder multiple-point-of-entry or MPE resolutions, by contrast, a group would
be split up into some of its parts.”Similarly, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) (2013, p.13) writes: “Multiple point of entry
[...] involves the application of resolution powers by two or more resolution authorities to different parts of the group, and is
likely to result in a break-up of the group into two or more separate parts.” The reason that a break-up is usually necessary
under MPOE is that, for each point of entry, resolution requires the creation of a new legal entity under separate control
from group headquarters (usually by putting part of the group into receivership and then forming a bridge institution), which
entails breaking up the global group, at least partially.



                                                               14
on long-term claims if necessary) depends on whether the G-SIB has redundant systems in place. Without

redundant systems, splitting up the bank at date 1 leads to a reduction in expected franchise value to λp2 V ,

so that the maximum amount of safe short-term debt that can be issued is C1L + λp2 V . In the presence

of redundant systems, the expected franchise value is unaffected by the organizational split resulting from

MPOE resolution, so that the maximum safe short-term debt is C1L +p2 V . It is efficient to set up redundant

systems only if the benefits outweigh the additional ex-ante investment Fe − F . There are two benefits from

such redundancy: (i) increased short-term debt issuance γ(1 − λ)p2 V and (ii) no expected separation costs

from MPOE resolution (1 − p1 )(1 − λ)p2 V .

       Thus, depending on whether redundant systems are set up, the national holding company needs to

raise TLAC in the amount of either F − (1 + γ)(C1L + λp2 V ) or Fe − (1 + γ)(C1L + p2 V ). As discussed in the

previous section, it is in the interest of each national holding company to issue some TLAC in the form

of subordinated long-term debt. More precisely, it is privately optimal to issue long-term debt with a face

value that weakly exceeds the maximum amount of cash that the bank may carry forward from date 1 to

date 2 (see Appendix A for a detailed discussion). Doing so ensures that all fairly priced (date 1) cash flows

are sold to investors, thereby minimizing the amount of financing that has to be raised against V , which

is subject to a lemons problem. The maximum amount of cash the bank has left after repaying short-term

debt at date 1 is given by C1H + ∆ − R1 . Therefore, the bank will set RLT
                                                                        MPOE
                                                                             ≥ C1H + ∆ − R1 ≡ R̂LT
                                                                                                MPOE 17
                                                                                                    .

       We summarize these findings in the lemma below.


Lemma 1. Funding and TLAC under MPOE.


  (i) When Fe − F ≥ (1 − p1 + γ)(1 − λ)p2 V , it is not efficient for subsidiaries to set up redundant systems.

         Each subsidiary issues safe short-term debt with face value R1MPOE = C1L + λp2 V . Required TLAC

         per subsidiary is given by F − (1 + γ)R1MPOE = F − (1 + γ)(C1L + λp2 V ) and is raised by the national

         holding company via a combination of equity and subordinated long-term debt.
  17
    The bank’s preference to issue a certain amount of TLAC in the form of debt has implications for the current discussion
on TLAC composition. We discuss these in Section 6.2.




                                                            15
 (ii) When Fe − F < (1 − p1 + γ)(1 − λ)p2 V , it is efficient for subsidiaries to set up redundant systems.

        Each subsidiary issues safe short-term debt with face value R1MPOE = C1L + p2 V . Required TLAC per

        subsidiary is given by Fe − (1 + γ)R1MPOE = Fe − (1 + γ)(C1L + p2 V ) and is raised by the national holding

        company via a combination of equity and subordinated long-term debt.

                                                                                    MPOE
(iii) In both cases, each subsidiary finds it privately optimal to raise at least R̂LT   = C1H + ∆ − R1MPOE

        of the required TLAC as subordinated long-term debt, so that all fairly priced cash flows are sold to

        investors.


(iv) The subsidiaries are separated during resolution, so that each subsidiary bears an effective redundancy

        or separation cost of min[Fe − F, (1 − p1 + γ)(1 − λ)p2 V ].


3.2      SPOE

SPOE resolution has two advantages relative to MPOE. First, the diversifiable cash flow ∆ can be shared

across the two subsidiaries. We initially focus on the case in which the two jurisdictions share ∆ equally.18

In this case, SPOE raises the minimum cash flow received by each subsidiary at date 1 from C1L to C1L +∆/2.

Second, even without redundant systems each subsidiary can always roll over an amount p2 V of short-term

debt at date 1, since the two subsidiaries are not separated under an SPOE resolution. Hence, under SPOE

resolution each subsidiary can issue more safe short-term debt, generating larger benefits from the banking

activity. The maximum face value of safe short-term debt (imposing losses on long-term claims in in a

resolution if necessary) of each subsidiary under SPOE is:



                                           R1SPOE = C1L + ∆/2 + p2 V > R1MPOE .                                     (1)



TLAC is required if F > (1 + γ)(C1L + ∆/2 + p2 V ), which we assume is the case, and is raised by the global

holding company through a combination of subordinated long-term debt and equity. It is again privately

optimal for the global holding company to issue subordinated long-term debt with a face value that is at
 18
      We discuss the possibility of sharing the diversifiable cash flow asymmetrically at the end of Section 4.2.



                                                                16
least as large as the amount of cash that is carried forward by the two subsidiaries when they receive the
                 SPOE
high cash-flow: RLT   ≥ 2C1H + ∆ − 2R1SPOE ≡ R̂LT
                                               SPOE
                                                    . We summarize the above discussion in the following

lemma.

Lemma 2. Funding and TLAC under SPOE.


  (i) Under SPOE resolution, each subsidiary issues short-term debt with face value R1SPOE = C1L + ∆/2 +

      p2 V . Required TLAC per subsidiary is given by F − (1 + γ)R1SPOE = F − (1 + γ)(C1L + ∆/2 + p2 V )

      and is raised by the global holding company via a combination of equity and subordinated long-term

      debt.

                                                                                SPOE
 (ii) The global holding company finds it privately optimal to raise at least R̂LT   = 2C1H + ∆ − 2R1SPOE of

      the required TLAC as subordinated long-term debt.


(iii) Because the subsidiaries are not separated during resolution, there are no redundancy or separation

      costs.


   A comparison of Lemmas 1 and 2 establishes our second main result.

Proposition 2. SPOE dominates under supra-national regulation. In the benchmark case with

a supra-national regulator, SPOE resolution dominates MPOE resolution. SPOE resolution allows for a

larger provision of liquidity services at the same level of risk and allows the two subsidiaries to capture the

benefits from global banking, generating a net social benefit (relative to MPOE resolution) of



                               γ∆                    +   2 min[Fe − F, (1 − p1 + γ)(1 − λ)p2 V ].          (2)
                             | {z }                      |                 {z                 }
                     additional liquidity services                     benefits from
                         from diversification                         global banking


It is efficient to structure global banks as multi-national holding companies with shared services across

jurisdictions, with national banking subsidiaries sharing TLAC issued by the global holding company.

   Proposition 2 highlights the appeal of SPOE resolution: If regulators can commit to cooperate in the

midst of a crisis, then SPOE dominates MPOE resolution. The reason is twofold. First, the ability to make

                                                             17
cross-jurisdictional transfers under SPOE resolution lowers the amount of required loss-absorbing capital.

Accordingly, under SPOE the G-SIB can increase its issuance of safe short-term debt by a total amount

of ∆, resulting in additional surplus arising from liquidity services of γ∆. Second, SPOE resolution allows

the G-SIB to fully harness economies of scale or scope that result from global banking, because effective

SPOE resolution guarantees that the two subsidiaries remain integrated in the global bank organization.

This means in particular that subsidiaries can reap the benefits of shared services (such as joint cash

management or IT systems) without risk of incurring separation costs or the cost of setting up redundant

systems. As shown in Proposition 2, this second channel results in an additional increase in surplus of

2 min[Fe − F, (1 − p1 + γ)(1 − λ)p2 V ]. Note that this second channel is reinforced by the first—because

benefits from global banking are preserved in resolution, the bank can issue safe short-term debt against

future banking activities that under MPOE would be lost due to the separation of the bank’s activities.

In short, a higher value of liquidity services γ reinforces the benefit from preserving the global bank, as

indicated in the second term of equation (2).


4   SPOE and MPOE with National Regulators


We now depart from the benchmark case of a supra-national regulator and enrich the model to reflect the

regulatory status quo, in which bank resolution is conducted by national regulators. This section contains

the main results of the paper: Ex-ante and ex-post incentive compatibility constraints significantly limit

the applicability of SPOE resolution, despite the conceptual advantages of SPOE resolution discussed

in Section 3. First, we show that, from an ex-ante perspective, national regulators may not find it in

their interest to set up a viable SPOE regime. In this case, MPOE resolution is the only viable option.

Second, we show that an SPOE resolution that is implemented by national regulators can fail ex post,

because regulators may prefer to ring-fence assets in their own jurisdiction, rather than going along with

the planned SPOE resolution. When this is the case, planning for an MPOE resolution is the more efficient.

Overall, the regulatory status quo, in which the resolution of multinational banks is carried out by national

regulators, therefore significantly limits the attainable benefits of SPOE resolution.


                                                     18
4.1      Ex-ante Incentive Compatibility

Recall that the objective function of national regulators is to maximize outcomes in their own jurisdiction.

We show in this section that this implies that, from an ex-ante perspective, national regulators will only

agree to set up an SPOE resolution regime if the probabilities of making and receiving transfers are

sufficiently symmetric. If one of the two jurisdictions is significantly more likely to make transfers under

SPOE resolution, the regulator in that jurisdiction will not agree to put in place an SPOE resolution

mechanism, even if this would be efficient in the sense of maximizing overall surplus.

       To see this, recall that the additional cash flow ∆ appears in jurisdiction 1 with probability θ1 and in

jurisdiction 2 with probability θ2 , where θ1 + θ2 = 1. Consider first the expected benefits from entering an

SPOE resolution scheme. If ∆ is shared equally and each of the two the subsidiaries increases their issuance

of safe short-term debt by the same amount, then a move from MPOE to SPOE resolution yields additional

liquidity services of value γ∆/2 in each jurisdiction. Moreover, SPOE resolution allows the bank to capture

economies of scale and scope benefits from global banking, which per jurisdiction amount to the lesser of

the cost of setting up redundant systems and expected separation costs, min[Fe − F, (1 − p1 + γ)(1 − λ)p2 V ].

       The cost of SPOE resolution, from the perspective of a national regulator, is the expected net transfer

that has to made to the other jurisdiction in the low cash flow state. Even though this is a pure transfer

when looking at the two subsidiaries as a whole, the assumption that regulators follow national objectives

implies that in, their eyes, this transfer constitutes a loss for their jurisdiction.19 Consider the regulator

in jurisdiction 1 under SPOE. With probability (1 − p1 )θ1 , jurisdiction 1 makes a transfer of ∆/2 to

jurisdiction 2. With probability (1 − p1 )θ2 , jurisdiction 1 receives a transfer of size ∆/2 from jurisdiction
                                                                                                    ∆
2. The net expected transfer that jurisdiction 1 makes to jurisdiction 2 is therefore               2   (1 − p1 )(θ1 − θ2 ) .

The regulator in jurisdiction 1 is then willing to enter into an SPOE resolution regime if the benefits

from increased banking activity and shared services given in Equation (2) outweigh the cost in the form
  19
    In our discussion of the ex-ante and ex-post incentive constraints, we will somewhat loosely refer to transfers that are
made from one jurisdiction to the other under SPOE resolution. In practice, making these transfers involves upstreaming ∆/2
from the operating subsidiary that received ∆ to the global holding company, and then downstreaming it to the operating
subsidiary in need of resources. Crucially, at some point this process involves moving ∆/2 across jurisdictional lines. This
opens up the possibility of ring-fencing by the regulator required to make the transfer.



                                                            19
of expected net transfers. Because both regulators have to agree to set up an SPOE resolution regime,

an analogous condition has to hold for the regulator in jurisdiction 2. Combining the ex-ante incentive

constraints of both regulators, we then arrive at the following proposition.


Proposition 3. Ex-ante incentive compatibility of SPOE resolution. SPOE bank resolution is

ex-ante incentive compatible only if the benefit from increased banking activity and the gains from global

banking in each jurisdiction outweigh the expected net transfer payments to the other jurisdiction. This

requires that cash flows in each jurisdiction are sufficiently symmetric:

                                              "                               #
                                    γ    2      Fe − F        γ
                     |θ1 − θ2 | ≤       + min          , 1+          (1 − λ)p2 V .                         (3)
                                  1 − p1 ∆      1 − p1      1 − p1


   Proposition 3 establishes that ex-ante implementation of SPOE requires sufficient symmetry in payoffs

across jurisdictions. The left hand side of the ex ante IC constraint (3) states that the probabilities θi of

receiving the diversifiable cash flow ∆ must be sufficiently symmetric across the two jurisdictions. When

one jurisdiction is significantly more likely to make a transfer under SPOE, the regulator of that jurisdiction

does not find it in its interest to set up an SPOE resolution scheme. The right-hand side of the ex ante

IC constraint (3) states that SPOE is more likely to be ex-ante incentive compatible when the incremental

social benefit from banking activity γ is large, and when there are significant returns to scale and scope

to global banking. A larger benefit from additional banking activity and from returns to scale and scope

makes it more likely that nationally minded regulators agree to SPOE, even if for one of the jurisdictions

this means making a net expected transfer to the other jurisdiction. Overall, the implication is therefore

that when national regulators are in charge of designing a resolution scheme for multinational banks, they

will choose a more efficient SPOE resolution mechanism only if the costs of SPOE resolution are shared

sufficiently symmetrically across jurisdictions.

   Let us make two brief observations regarding Proposition 3. First, the conclusion that asymmetry across

jurisdictions can prevent regulators from setting up an efficient resolution regime echoes Dell’Ariccia and

Marquez (2006), who show that national regulators may not agree on a centralized supra-national capital


                                                      20
regulation framework when these regulators differ in the extent that they are captured by their domestic

financial industries. Our analysis shows that heterogeneity across jurisdictions is also an obstacle in the

context of multinational bank resolution. Second, Proposition 3 rules out transfer payments between

regulators. Our assumption is that such transfer payments are politically infeasible. The protracted

discussions about the European deposit insurance scheme are a good illustration of the reality that agreeing

on such transfers can be extremely difficult. If such transfer payments were possible, then the regulator in

the jurisdiction that is more likely to receive a transfer under SPOE resolution could make an appropriate

transfer payment to induce the other regulator to join the resolution mechanism.


4.2     Ex-post Incentive Compatibility

We now shift our focus to ex-post incentive compatibility, perhaps the biggest obstacle to a successful

SPOE resolution. Assume that an SPOE resolution has been agreed to by the two regulators. Then the

key issue ex post (after the low state has realized and the global bank has to be resolved) is that sovereignty

allows the regulator in each jurisdiction to unilaterally ring-fence assets, thereby preventing the transfers

of resources ∆/2 that is necessary for a successful SPOE resolution. The question is therefore whether the

regulator in the jurisdiction that receives the additional cash flow ∆ finds it in its own interest to make

the required transfer of ∆/2 to the other jurisdiction.

      Our model indicates that there are two ways in which a planned SPOE resolution can break down ex

post. First, when the cash flow ∆ materializes in the jurisdiction in which the global holding company

is located (the home jurisdiction), the home regulator may refuse to make the required transfer to the

operating subsidiary in the other jurisdiction (the host jurisdiction). This happens when the transfer of

∆/2 to the host institution is larger than the home jurisdiction’s expected loss in case the subsidiary in

the other jurisdiction faces a bank run and is liquidated. This cost consists of the loss of shared services

(1 − λ)p2 V . Second, when the cash flow ∆ materializes in the host jurisdiction, the regulator in the host

jurisdiction may prefer to ring-fence assets in response to an SPOE resolution in the home jurisdiction.

Again, such ring-fencing is privately optimal when the transfer of ∆/2 to the home subsidiary is larger


                                                      21
than the expected loss of shared services (1 − λ)p2 V . Assuming equal continuation values V in the two

jurisdictions, these two cases reduce to the same incentive constraint, as summarized in the following

proposition.


Proposition 4. Ex-post incentive compatibility of SPOE resolution. In the presence of national

regulators that cannot commit to ex-post transfers, SPOE resolution is not incentive compatible whenever

the required ex-post transfer across jurisdictions is larger than the loss of global banking benefits that results

from unilateral ring fencing,
                                                ∆
                                                  > (1 − λ)p2 V.                                              (4)
                                                2

   Proposition 4 has two main implications. First, when the cross-jurisdictional transfer that is required

under SPOE is too large, the necessary incentive constraint (4) is not satisfied, leading to a breakdown of the

SPOE resolution scheme. Such an ex-post breakdown of a planned SPOE resolution is, of course, the worst

possible outcome: Having planned for an SPOE resolution, the ex-post unwillingness of regulators to make

required transfers leaves no other option than a disorderly liquidation following a bank run or a tax-funded

bailout, precisely the scenarios that bank resolution is meant to prevent. Second, Proposition 4 shows that

incentive compatible SPOE resolution is facilitated by operational complementarities across jurisdictions

that arise from ring-fencing (as captured by a low λ). It is precisely the loss of complementarities across

the two bank affiliates that incentivizes regulators not to ring-fence assets ex post.

   One assumption we maintained in the analysis above is that the additional short-term debt that is

issued under SPOE is allocated symmetrically across jurisdictions. However, Propositions 3 and 4 also

help us shine a light on whether incentives under SPOE could be restored by allocating this additional

short-term debt asymmetrically. Indeed, from Proposition 3 we can see that, by allowing the operating

subsidiary in the jurisdiction that is more likely to receive ∆ to issue more of the additional short-term

debt, the ex-ante incentive constraint (3) can be satisfied in situations where a symmetric allocation of the

benefits from additional short-term debt across jurisdictions would not be ex-ante incentive compatible.

At the same time, however, Proposition 4 shows that this would make the ex-post incentive constraint (4)



                                                       22
harder to satisfy. In particular, successful resolution is only guaranteed when the ex-post IC is satisfied for

the maximum necessary transfer. The maximum transfer, however, is larger than ∆/2 when short-term

debt is allocated asymmetrically across jurisdictions.


4.3     Bank Resolution and the Structure of Global Banks

Proposition 4 generates a clear prediction as to which types of global banks can be resolved successfully

under SPOE: Cross-jurisdictional complementarities must be large enough to render transfers during res-

olution incentive compatible. Banks for which the incentive constraint is unlikely to be satisfied, on the

other hand, should plan for MPOE resolution. Moreover, for banks that opt for MPOE resolution it may

then also be efficient to make an ex-ante investment in redundant systems. This is the case whenever the

additional cost of setting up redundant systems, Fe − F , is smaller than the expected separation costs under

MPOE, (1 − p1 + γ)(1 − λ)p2 V . Jointly, the ex-post incentive constraint and the ex-ante choice to set up

redundant system then characterize the link between bank resolution and the risk profile and operational

structure of global banks.


Proposition 5. Bank resolution and the structure of global banks.

               ∆
  (i) When     2   ≤ p2 (1 − λ)V , SPOE resolution is ex-post incentive compatible and it is efficient for global

        banks to adopt a multinational holding company structure and maximize reliance on shared services.

               ∆
 (ii) When     2   > p2 (1 − λ)V , SPOE resolution is not ex-post incentive compatible and, therefore, MPOE

        resolution based on separate national holding companies is preferable.


(iii) Under MPOE resolution, setting up redundant systems that facilitate the separation of banking sub-

        sidiaries during a resolution is efficient when Fe − F < (1 − p1 + γ)(1 − λ)p2 V .


      According to Proposition 5, the efficient choice between SPOE and MPOE depends on the structure

of a global bank’s business risks (captured by ∆) and the size of the complementarities between operating

subsidiaries in different jurisdictions (captured by λ). Therefore, a one-size-fits-all approach to G-SIB

Figure 2: Bank resolution (MPOE or SPOE) and bank structure. The figure illustrates the
correspondence between bank resolution and bank structure established in Proposition 5. The x-axis
plots the required ex-post transfer under SPOE resolution ∆/2. The y-axis plots the loss of franchise
value that results when subsidiaries with shared services are separated as part of an MPOE resolution
(1 − λ)p2 V . The 45-degree line represents the ex-post incentive constraint for successful SPOE resolution
(4). Whenever the ex-post incentive constraint is satisfied (i.e., to the left of the 45-degree line), SPOE
resolution combined with a bank structure with shared services dominates MPOE resolution. When the
ex-post incentive constraint is not satisfied (to the right of the 45-degree line) SPOE fails and therefore
MPOE resolution is efficient. Under MPOE resolution, bank structure should respond through an ex-ante
investment in redundant systems when the cost of such an investment is less than the expected separation
cost (i.e., Fe − F < (1 − p1 + γ)(1 − λ)p2 V ), as illustrated by the dashed line.


resolution is unlikely to be efficient. Rather, a bank’s resolution plan should correspond to a bank’s cash

flow risk and operational structure.

   This correspondence is illustrated in Figure 2. Specifically, banks for which SPOE resolution is ex-post

incentive compatible should be resolved under SPOE. In the figure, these banks are located above the

45-degree line; they are characterized by relative large scale or scope economies (i.e., large λ) and low

to moderate idiosyncratic cash-flow risk across jurisdictions (i.e., ∆ not too large). Because these banks

will be resolved as a whole, they should also capitalize on their economies of scale by relying on shared

systems, rather than investing in redundant systems. In contrast, banks with modest economies of scale



                                                            24
and scope (small λ) and significant diversifiable cash flow risk (large ∆) cannot be resolved under SPOE

in an incentive compatible fashion. Therefore, these banks should adopt an MPOE resolution plan. In the

figure, these banks are located below the 45-degree line. Because these banks will be split up in resolution,

it may then also be efficient to set up redundant systems ex ante, in order to prevent the ex-post loss of

value that arises when operating subsidiaries are separated in resolution.

      To give a concrete example, consider a decentralized G-SIBs with small cross-jurisdictional comple-

mentarities, such as HSBC or Santander. For these banks, SPOE resolution is unlikely to be incentive

compatible and a more robust MPOE resolution that does not require incentive compatibility across juris-

dictions is appropriate. Consistent with this prediction, the HSBC (2015) annual report states that “[i]t is

our view that a strategy by which the Group breaks up at a subsidiary bank level at the point of resolution

(referred to as a Multiple Point of Entry) is the optimal approach, as it is aligned to our existing legal and

business structure.” In the same annual report, HSBC also states a preference for setting up redundant

systems: “[W]e are working with our regulators to mitigate or remove critical inter-dependencies between

our subsidiaries to further facilitate the resolution of the Group.” Therefore, HSBC would be located in

the top right region illustrated in Figure 2. In contrast, a G-SIB with significant complementarities across

jurisdictions, such as JPMorgan Chase, would be located in in the top left region of Figure 2 and is resolved

more efficiently under SPOE. Indeed, in its 2017 resolution plan, JPMorgan Chase states that “[W]e have

determined that the best strategy for resolving our firm [...] is a Single Point of Entry resolution strategy.”


4.4     Optimal Ex-Post Incentive Compatible Resolution: A Hybrid Approach

Up to now our analysis focused on a comparison between a pure SPOE resolution (all loss-absorbing capital

is shared across jurisdictions) and a pure MPOE resolution (all loss-absorbing capital is issued separately

at the national level). We now build on these results to show that, when SPOE is not ex-post incentive

compatible, the constrained optimal resolution mechanism is a hybrid model. In this hybrid model, some

loss-absorbing capital is sill shared across jurisdictions, but a sufficiently large amount is effectively pre-

assigned to a particular jurisdiction to guarantee incentive compatibility.


                                                      25
   The idea behind this hybrid model is relatively straightforward. As shown above, a pure SPOE res-

olution breaks down when the transfer that is required during resolution violates the ex-post incentive

constraint. In this case, a pure MPOE approach can still provide a successful resolution, but it sacrifices

all of the benefits from resource sharing across jurisdictions and resolving the bank as a global whole.

The constrained optimal model lies somewhere in between: it reduces cross-jurisdictional transfers to an

amount that just satisfies the ex-post IC constraint (i.e., equation (4) holds with equality). Of course,

relative to SPOE, the smaller size of the cross-jurisdictional transfer has to be offset by an increase in

loss-absorbing capital in each jurisdiction. The following proposition formalizes this intuition.


Proposition 6. Constrained optimal bank resolution. Assume that ∆/2 > p2 (1 − λ)V , so that the

ex-post incentive constraint for SPOE resolution (4) is violated. The constrained-optimal bank resolution

scheme limits the amount of short-term debt issued by each operating subsidiary such that the required

transfer in resolution just satisfies the ex-post IC constraint,



                                               T ∗ = p2 (1 − λ)V,                                            (5)



where T ∗ < ∆/2. This allows each operating subsidiary to issue safe short-term debt of R1∗ = C1L +p2 V +T ∗ ,

where R1MPOE < R1∗ < R1SPOE .


   From a practical perspective, the constrained optimal resolution mechanism characterized in Propo-

sition 6 can be implemented through judicious prepositioning of TLAC in intermediate national holding

companies. In particular, loss-absorbing capital that is shared across jurisdictions is issued by the global

holding company. Loss-absorbing capital that is not shared across jurisdictions is issued by intermediate

national holding companies, either to the global parent or outside investors. The presence of this pre-

positioned TLAC and the associated reduction in short-term debt in each jurisdiction lower the required

transfer during resolution to T ∗ , so that the ex-post incentive constraint is just satisfied. While this hybrid

model does not generate the same liquidity benefits as the benchmark case of SPOE under a single supra-

national regulator, it exploits the advantages of shared loss-absorbing capital and global resolution as much

                                                       26
as is incentive compatible under the constraints imposed by national regulators. As we discuss in more

detail in Section 6, this hybrid resolution model provides a framework to assess the recent policy proposals

that have advocated the use of “prepositioned resources” to limit the ex-post reliance on “contributable

resources” (i.e., transfers that rely on the cash flow ∆).


5        Bank Incentives under MPOE and SPOE Resolution


Under a bank resolution model in which loss absorbing capital is always sufficient to absorb operating

losses, the usual disciplining role of debt is muted. This makes equity-based incentives for management

particularly important. Accordingly, an important question is whether MPOE or SPOE resolution results

in better incentives for managers running the operating subsidiaries.

         In this section, we extend our model to analyze equity-based incentives for managers of the G-SIB’s

operating subsidiaries. To do so, we introduce a simple managerial effort problem into our model. Specif-

ically, we assume that each subsidiary manager has to exert effort e ∈ {0, 1} to generate the diversifiable

cash flow ∆.20 Subsidiary i receives ∆ with probability θi if its manager exerts effort (e = 1). On the

other hand, if the manager of subsidiary i does not exert effort (e = 0), this subsidiary receives ∆ only

with a lower probability of θi − . Exerting effort is costly for the manager because it results in the loss

of a non-pecuniary private benefit B > 0. As before, we assume that θ1 + θ2 = 1, so that the cash flow ∆

is generated for sure (in one of the jurisdictions) if both subsidiaries exert effort, but ∆ is received with

probability less than one if at least one subsidiary manager shirks. For ease of exposition, we initially focus

on the case in which TLAC takes the form of an outside equity stake α0 . We then turn to the issue of

TLAC composition at the end of the section.21
    20
     We focus on incentives to produce ∆ because who receives this cash flow is critically affected by the choice of resolution
model. In particular, under SPOE resolution, the operating subsidiary that generates ∆ loses half of this cash flow as part of
the transfer that occurs in resolution. Our model also allows us to study incentives to produce the high aggregate cash flow
C1H . We explore this extension in the online appendix.
  21
     We also abstract away from the issue of setting up redundant systems, which is orthogonal to the incentive issues studies
in this section.




                                                              27
5.1     Incentives under SPOE Resolution

As we have seen, the benefits of SPOE resolution stem to a significant extent from the ability to share the

cash flow ∆ across jurisdictions. But will operating subsidiaries have sufficient incentives to produce this

cash flow given the prospect that it may be transferred to the operating subsidiary in the other jurisdiction

in a resolution?

      To gauge these incentives, we need to make an assumption about how profits are divided between the

national banking subsidiaries. The most natural assumption is that the global holding company pays out

a fraction α0SPOE of total profits to outside shareholders, and that national operating subsidiaries receive

the remaining fraction 1 − α0SPOE of the profits that were generated in that particular jurisdiction.

      Under SPOE, inside equityholders do not receive a payoff in the low aggregate cash-flow state. In

particular, in the low cash-flow state, ∆ is shared across jurisdictions to repay short-term debt in each

subsidiary.22 Acting in the interest of the owners of the national operating subsidiaries, the manager of

operating subsidiary i then exerts effort if the payoff given effort is larger than the payoff when not exerting

effort and enjoying the private benefit:



   p1 (1 − α0SPOE ) C1H + θi ∆ − R1SPOE + pi2 V ≥ p1 (1 − α0SPOE ) C1H + (θi − )∆ − R1SPOE + pi2 V + B.
                                                                                                
                                                                                                                        (6)



Collecting terms and simplifying, under SPOE it is optimal for the manager of each national operating

subsidiary to exert effort if

                                                 (1 − α0SPOE )p1 ∆ ≥ B.                                                (7)


If the manager exerts effort, α0SPOE satisfies the breakeven condition



                        α0SPOE p1 (2C1H + ∆ − 2R1SPOE + 2p2 V ) ≥ 2 [F − (1 + γ)R1SPOE ] ,
                                                              
                                                                                                                        (8)
  22
     In fact, recall that the face value of short-term debt is higher under SPOE, so that ∆ is always paid out to short-term
debtholders.




                                                            28
so that sufficient TLAC for both operating subsidiaries is raised. Substituting in for R1SPOE = C1L + p2 V +

∆/2, yields a minimum required outside equity stake of:


                                              F − (1 + γ) C1L + p2 V + ∆/2
                                                                          
                                     SPOE
                                   α0       =                                .                                        (9)
                                                      p1 (C1H − C1L )


      Based on the incentive constraint (7) and the equilibrium value of the outside equity stake (9), we then

see that resolution has to be sufficiently unlikely (i.e., p1 has to be sufficiently high) for the manager to be

willing to exert effort to produce ∆.


Proposition 7. Under SPOE resolution, operating subsidiary managers exert effort to produce ∆ only if
                                                                                     F −(1+γ)R1SPOE
the resolution state is sufficiently unlikely, p1 ≥ p∗1 ≡ p1 +    B
                                                                 ∆ ,   where p1 =      C1H −C1L
                                                                                                    .   If p1 < p∗1 , ∆ is

not always produced and a successful SPOE resolution cannot be guaranteed.


      To understand the condition in Proposition 7, note that p1 is the minimum value for p1 such that the

bank can raise enough funds with TLAC securities to fund the initial setup cost F (by setting α0SPOE = 1).

Therefore, the condition in the proposition shows that there is an interval [p1 , p∗1 ) in which the moral

hazard problem generated by the private benefit B impedes successful SPOE resolution. In this case, a

successful SPOE resolution cannot be guaranteed and it is therefore more efficient set up a more robust

MPOE resolution.


5.2     Incentives under MPOE Resolution

There are two aspects under which SPOE and MPOE differ with respect to the incentives to produce the

diversifiable cash flow ∆. The first is that MPOE is designed to be robust with respect to whether ∆ is

available or not. In this sense, whether ∆ is produced is irrelevant for a successful MPOE resolution. The

second aspect is operational efficiency. In particular, the choice of the resolution regime affects the bank

manager’s incentives to produce the cash flow ∆. As we show below, taken together these two forces imply

that MPOE resolution often results in a more resilient but potentially less efficient G-SIB.




                                                        29
       Let us first briefly point out the key robustness property of MPOE resolution with respect to incentives

to produce ∆. Since TLAC for each subsidiary is set to cover the shortfall R1MPOE − C1L = p2 λV , under

MPOE a run on short-term debt can be avoided by writing down claims on the bank’s continuation value,

irrespective of whether ∆ materializes. Therefore, successful resolution under MPOE does not depend on

the presence of adequate managerial incentives to produce ∆. Of course, as shown above, this robustness

comes at the expense of reducing the amount of liquidity services provided by the G-SIB as well as reducing

scale economies from global banking.

       We now show how incentives to produce ∆ differ between SPOE and MPOE resolution. To do this,

we derive the analogue to incentive constraint (7) under MPOE resolution. While the payoff in the high

cash-flow state can be calculated in analogous fashion, a key difference to SPOE is that under MPOE inside

equityholders sometimes also receive a payoff in the low cash-flow state. In particular, with probability

(1 − p1 )θi , the subsidiary receives C1L + ∆. In this case, because ∆ is available to reduce outstanding

short-term debt, equityholders are only partially wiped out in resolution. Specifically, the fraction x of

equity that is wiped out satisfies xp2 λV = p2 λV − ∆, such that inside equityholders receive an expected
                                                                   pi

                                                                    2


(e = 0), inside equityholders’ payoffs are analogous, except that ∆ is received only with probability θi − .

       Exerting effort is individually optimal for the manager of subsidiary i if producing ∆ with probability

θi leads to a higher payoff for the manager than receiving ∆ with probability θi −  and enjoying the private

benefit B. Simplifying terms analogously to the derivation of (7), the incentive constraint under MPOE

reduces to

To raise sufficient TLAC, the outside equity stake under MPOE must satisfy



                          p1 (C1H + θi ∆ − R1MPOE + p2 V ) + (1 − p1 )θi ∆ ≥ F − (1 + γ)R1MPOE ,

  23
    There are two reasons why ∆ is paid out to reduce short-term debt. First, the high-type bank strictly prefers to do so,
because raising funds against future cash flows is costly as it occurs at a discount. As before, the low-type bank will mimic
the high type. Second, legally it would be difficult for the bank to effectively pay out a dividend ∆ just before going into
resolution.

where the payoff in the low cash-flow state is the outside equityholders’ expectation of the diminished

equity stake (1 − p1 )θi (1 − x)p2 λV = (1 − p1 )θi ∆. Substituting in for R1MPOE = C1L + p2 λV , this yields a

minimum required outside equity stake of:


                                 MPOE          F − (1 + γ)(C1L + p2 λV )

   Comparing the incentive constraints (7) and (10) reveals that differences in incentives under MPOE and

SPOE resolution are driven by two effects. First, incentives under SPOE are muted because the operating

subsidiary never receives the cash flow ∆ in the low cash-flow state. Effectively, the higher amount of

short-term debt under SPOE results in debt overhang, reducing the manager’s incentive to produce ∆.

Second, the required outside equity stakes α0 differ across MPOE and SPOE, as illustrated by equations

(9) and (12). Therefore, incentives to exert effort are stronger under SPOE only if the inside equity stake

that can be retained under SPOE is sufficiently larger, outweighing the debt overhang effect. The following

proposition summarizes these results.


Proposition 8. Incentives under MPOE and SPOE.


  (i) Operating subsidiary i has stronger incentives to exert effort to produce ∆ under SPOE than under

      MPOE when the retained inside equity stake under SPOE is sufficiently larger than inside equity

      stake that can be retained under MPOE,

                                                       > 1 +            .                                 (13)
                                            1 − α0,i

 (ii) When the probabilities of receiving the additional cash flow ∆ are symmetric across jurisdictions

      (θ1 = θ2 = 21 ), a sufficient condition for better incentives for subsidiary i under SPOE is that


                                           ∆   (1 − p1 )(C1H − C1L ) pi2
                                             >                           .                                (14)
                                           2          1+γ            p2




                                                      31
(iii) When the probabilities of receiving the additional cash flow ∆ are asymmetric across jurisdictions

         (θ1 6= θ2 ), it becomes easier to sustain incentives for both operating subsidiaries under SPOE, because

         incentives are reduced for one of the two subsidiaries under MPOE.


       Proposition 8 shows that incentives under SPOE and MPOE resolution depend on the trade-off between

two forces. On the one hand, SPOE dampens incentives because some of the cash flows generated by the

manager are transferred to the other jurisdiction, which makes it harder to sustain high effort. On the

other hand, SPOE can allow the firm to retain a larger inside equity stake, which helps align incentives.

Part (i) of Proposition 8 shows that the net effect of these two forces is positive if and only if the retained

equity stake under SPOE is sufficiently larger than the retained equity stake under MPOE. Of course, the

retained equity stakes are endogenous quantities. To gain intuition for when the condition given in part

(i) of Proposition 8 holds, it is useful to first consider the symmetric case (θ1 = θ2 = 1/2). As shown

in part (ii) of Proposition 8, in the symmetric case incentives to exert effort are stronger under SPOE

when ∆ is sufficiently large. Part (iii) considers the asymmetric case (θ1 6= θ2 ). Whereas asymmetry

does not affect incentives for operating subsidiaries under SPOE, it worsens incentives for one of the two

operating subsidiaries under MPOE, because the operating subsidiary for which θi < 1/2 has to issue a

larger outside equity stake. Therefore, relative to SPOE, under MPOE it is harder to sustain incentives

for both operating subsidiaries to produce ∆, as stated in part (iii) of Proposition 8.24


5.3      The Effect of TLAC Composition on Incentives

Above, we have assumed for simplicity that the bank issues TLAC in the form of an equity stake. We now

relax this assumption and allow for TLAC in the form of equity and debt. The key novel effect is that

TLAC composition can affect the operating subsidiaries’ incentives to produce ∆.
  24
     In our analysis of moral hazard concerns, we focused on how operating subsidiary managers can be incentivized through
equity participation to offset the lack of discipline from debt markets. Alternatively, moral hazard concerns could be addressed
by monitoring subsidiary managers. The analysis above can be straightforwardly adapted to this alternative specification by
focusing on the holding company manager’s incentives to monitor its subsidiaries, with e ∈ {0, 1} standing for monitoring
effort as opposed to the effort needed to produce the cash flow ∆.




                                                              32
      The easiest way to see how TLAC in the form of debt affects incentives is from the incentive constraints

(7) and (10). Consider first the effect on effort incentives of a small amount of long-term debt under SPOE.

In the high aggregate cash-flow state, there is no resolution and RLT is repaid in full regardless of whether

∆ is produced. Therefore, the only change in the incentive constraint (7) is an increase in the inside equity

stake 1 − αSPOE that results when a larger fraction of the bank’s TLAC is raised in the form of debt.

With a larger retained equity stake, the incentive constraint (7) becomes easier to satisfy. Under SPOE,

more TLAC in form of debt therefore improves the operating subsidiaries’ incentives to produce ∆, an

illustration of the classic incentive property of debt, as pointed out by Jensen and Meckling (1976).25

      Under MPOE, the effect of long-term debt on incentives is more subtle. As the incentive constraint (10)

shows, there is now a second effect that counteracts the improvement in incentives. In the low aggregate

cash flow state, the presence of long-term debt reduces the payoff to (inside and outside) equityholders from

equity stake 1−αMPOE . The net effect of long-term debt on incentives to produce ∆ is therefore ambiguous.

In particular, in contrast to SPOE, it is possible that incentives to produce ∆ are strongest under MPOE

when TLAC is all equity.


6     Discussion


In this section, we link our analysis to the current policy discussion on bank resolution, focusing on

recent resolution proposals, TLAC composition, the possibility that resolution areas include more than

two countries, and the legal structures of global banks (i.e., the choice between branches and subsidiaries).


6.1     Assessing the FSB and Fed TLAC Policy Proposals

In this section, we provide a brief discussion of how our results help shed light on the policy proposals put

forward by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) (2015) and the Federal Reserve (2015). These proposals
  25
     One potential concern with TLAC in the form of debt is that it may create risk-shifting incentives. For a model that
examines the trade-off between the incentive and risk-shifting properties of debt and equity-based TLAC, but without our
focus on MPOE and SPOE resolution, see Mendicino et al. (2016)




                                                           33
broadly advocate an SPOE approach, and address incentive and ring-fencing issues through the pre-

positioning of TLAC and liquidity.26 In their general contours, the FSB and Fed G-SIB resolution proposals

therefore reflect the hybrid resolution model discussed in Section 4.4.

    As highlighted by our analysis, one of the key challenges in G-SIB resolution under SPOE is ensuring

that national regulators are willing to cooperate. Such cooperation cannot be taken for granted, because

national regulators may prefer to ring-fence domestic assets rather than cooperate in a cross-border SPOE

resolution that involves transfers to recapitalize operations in another jurisdiction. In our model, this issue

arises when the required transfer of ∆/2 is so large that ring-fencing ∆ becomes privately optimal for

national regulators.

    The FSB and Fed resolution proposals recognize the challenge of ensuring coordination among regula-

tors. In particular, US regulators have asked G-SIBs based in the US to adopt corporate structures that

limit the need for action by foreign regulators under SPOE resolution. Under the envisioned corporate

structure, only the global parent goes into resolution, whereas all key operating entities continue to operate

as usual, shielded from the resolution process. For example, under JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan, key

operating entities are held by a bankruptcy-remote US intermediate holding company (IHC) that holds all

non-prepositioned capital and liquidity to support affiliates as going concerns in the event of an SPOE res-

olution of the parent company. This IHC is shielded from the resolution process (and, in particular, claims

of long-term TLAC creditors of the parent) via a trust structure.27 However, although this structure indeed

requires minimal action from foreign regulators, it does not prevent ring-fencing when foreign regulators

determine that the resolution involves transfers that are not in their (national) interests. In fact, in its

resolution plan, JPMorgan Chase (2017) acknowledges that “[a]lthough we have made these preparations,

as a conservative measure, our resolution plan assumes soft ring-fencing, which is where foreign regulators

limit transfers of assets between affiliates resolution.”
  26
     In our model, liquidity corresponds to the minimum (total) cash flow 2C1L + ∆, where C1L can be pre-positioned in each
jurisdiction, whereas ∆ cannot be prepositioned because ex-ante it is not known where this cash flow will materialize.
  27
     The resolution plan JPMorgan Chase (2017) states: “We designed our resolution strategy to minimize or eliminate the
need for global regulatory cooperation by having only our parent company enter resolution proceedings in the United States,
while our Key Operating Entities receive necessary capital and liquidity support and continue as going concerns under a trust
insulated from the resolution process. This means that the only necessary actions by foreign regulators generally are processing
of or approving the indirect change in control to the trust.”


                                                              34
       Therefore, ensuring incentive compatibility requires additional measures. Two such measures are dis-

cussed in the current policy proposals. First, under the FSB proposal, minimum TLAC requirements are

not imposed on a consolidated basis on a whole banking group, but rather on “each resolution entity within

each G-SIB” (Financial Stability Board (FSB), 2015, p.9). Moreover, what counts as a resolution entity

is flexible.28 At least in principle, this flexibility allows regulators to set resolution-entity boundaries such

that cross-jurisdictional transfers do not violate ex-post incentive compatibility constraints.

       Second, within resolution areas, both the FSB and the Federal Reserve envision that incentive com-

patibility could be ensured through “prepositioned resources”, essentially TLAC and liquidity that is pre-

assigned to an affiliate in a particular jurisdiction. For example, the Federal Reserve’s rules require U.S.-

based intermediate holding companies of foreign G-SIBs to hold minimum amounts of “internal TLAC” in

the form of convertible long-term debt that is issued to the foreign parent. The idea is that if the interme-

diate holding company (or the regulator) holds the trigger for conversion of this convertible long-term debt,

losses in the intermediate holding company can be pushed up unilaterally to the foreign parent holding

company. This is effectively a pre-allocation of loss-absorbing capacity, so as to limit ex-post transfers and

ensure incentive compatibility.

       Broadly speaking, the constrained-efficient resolution regime characterized in Section 4.4 supports the

view that loss-absorbing capital may have to be pre-assigned to jurisdictions. However, as shown in

Proposition 6, pre-allocation of TLAC must go hand in hand with a reduction in the required cross-

jurisdictional transfers during resolution. The issue is that the diversifiable cash flow ∆ cannot be pre-

assigned to a jurisdiction and therefore can be ring-fenced even in the presence of internal TLAC. In addition

to prepositioning capital, making transfers incentive compatible therefore requires limiting short-term debt

in each affiliate. In addition, intermediate holding companies in each jurisdiction could issue external TLAC

(i.e., long-term securities issued to outside investors rather than the parent holding company), such that
  28
    “A resolution entity may be a parent company, an intermediate or ultimate holding company, or an operating subsidiary.
A G-SIB may have one or more resolution entities.” Financial Stability Board (FSB) (2015, p.9). Note that, in contrast to
the Fed proposal, the FSB proposal does not require the resolution entity to be a holding company.




                                                           35
some losses are absorbed by outside investors and not passed up to the global holding company, thereby

limiting required transfers.

      Interestingly, while our analysis suggests that it is efficient to set preassigned TLAC requirements to just

satisfy ex-post incentive compatibility (thereby maximizing the diversification benefits from shared loss-

absorbing capacity subject to incentive compatibility), the internal TLAC rules proposed by the Federal

Reserve seem to go significantly beyond what is required for incentive compatibility: Out of the 21% TLAC

requirement at the global holding company level, the proposed rules require that foreign G-SIBs with large

affiliates in the US pre-position as much as 18% as internal TLAC for the US affiliate in an intermediate

holding company based in the US. By pre-positioning almost all loss-absorbing capacity, this requirement

significantly limits the sharing of loss-absorption capacity across jurisdictions, thereby diminishing one of

the key advantages of a global SPOE resolution. From the perspective of a non-US G-SIB, the resulting

resolution framework then looks essentially like an MPOE.


6.2     TLAC Composition

Our model also sheds light on the debate about TLAC composition. In particular, our results highlight

two advantages of having some TLAC in the form of debt rather than equity. First, in our analysis of

privately optimal TLAC composition we show that, up to a certain amount, banks have a preference

for issuing TLAC in the form of long-term debt rather than equity because this reduces the asymmetric

information discount on TLAC securities. Insisting on all-equity TLAC may therefore affect the bank’s

participation constraint: Because of the asymmetric information discount, the bank may decide not to

operate or, in a model with variable scale, operate at an inefficient scale. Second, our analysis of incentives

establishes that TLAC in the form of long-term debt can have desirable incentive effects. However, recall

that the incentive effects of the TLAC composition differs across SPOE and MPOE resolution. Under

SPOE long-term debt always improves incentives, but this is not the case under MPOE, where equity




                                                        36
can be incentive-maximizing. Interestingly, these justifications for TLAC in the form of debt rather than

equity differ from those put forward by the Fed.29


6.3    Resolution Areas

Our model can be extended to resolution areas consisting of more than two jurisdictions. Following the

same logic as in the analysis above, we can rewrite both the ex-ante and ex-post incentive constraints for

SPOE resolution with N jurisdictions. Specifically, assume that jurisdiction i receives ∆ with probability
             PN
θi , where     i=1 θi   = 1. Under SPOE, the jurisdiction that receives ∆ then makes a transfer of ∆/N to

each of the N − 1 remaining jurisdictions. The net expected transfer made by jurisdiction i under SPOE

is therefore given by 1 − p1 )(θi − N1 ∆. This transfer will be weighed against the benefit of joining the
                                      

                                                        ∆
N -country resolution area, which is given by           Nγ   + min[Fe − F, (1 − p1 + γ)(1 − λN )p2 V ]. The ex-ante IC

constraint for the N -jurisdiction resolution area is therefore

                                                         "                                 #

where λN captures the loss of value when the subsidiary in jurisdiction i is separated from the remaining

N − 1 subsidiaries. Extending (4) to the N -country setting, the ex-post IC constraint for the N -country

resolution area is given by
                                                   N −1
                                                        ∆ ≤ (1 − λN )p2 V.                                                 (16)
                                                    N

The N -country IC constraints (15) and (16) show that the main difference to the two-jurisdiction case is

that incentive compatibility of SPOE resolution requires larger cross-country complementarities λN to be

incentive compatible. From an ex-ante perspective, this is the case because the per-jurisdiction risk-sharing

benefit is decreasing in the number of jurisdictions, such that larger scale economy benefits are required

for incentive compatibility. From an ex-post perspective, larger complementarities are required because
  29
    In the Fed’s eyes, the objective of the long-term debt requirement is to ensure that if the holding company’s equity is
depleted and resolution is triggered, the long-term debt is sufficient to absorb losses and recapitalize the bank (see pp. 26-27
in Federal Reserve, 2015).




                                                               37
the realized transfer that needs to be supported is larger ( NN−1 ∆ instead of ∆/2). Larger resolution areas

are therefore harder to sustain, both from an ex-post and and ex-ante perspective. Moreover, as in the

two-jurisdiction case, asymmetries in the probability of receiving ∆ hamper ex-ante incentive compatibility,

whereas larger required transfers make the ex-post IC constraint harder to satisfy.30


6.4     The Legal Structure of Foreign Affiliates: Branches or Subsidiaries?

A number of papers have explored the question of the difference between establishing foreign branches or

subsidiaries. Our analysis adds an additional angle this question. When it comes to bank resolution, the

novel consideration is whether a branch structure can potentially relax the regulators’ incentive compati-

bility constraints. Under a branch structure, all of the bank’s assets are, at least in principal, located in

one jurisdiction, the home jurisdiction. This can potentially eliminate the possibility of ring-fencing.

      There are, however, two important caveats. The first is that the possibility of ring-fencing is only

eliminated in cases where the “unity and universality principle” of bankruptcy applies. This principle is

not universally applied in practice. Most prominently, instead of following the universality principle, US

bank insolvency law is territorial for a US branch of a foreign bank, allowing US authorities to ring-fence

the foreign entity even though the US operations of the foreign bank form a branch. Thus, a branch

structure by itself does not necessarily eliminate the possibility of ring-fencing.

      The second caveat is that, even if a branch structure can in principle protect against ring-fencing, it is

not clear that G-SIBs could freely adopt such a structure if they wanted to. The reason is that both home

and host regulators may prefer a subsidiary structure. As pointed out by Cerutti et al. (2007), both home

and host country regulators put restrictions on foreign branches.

      Host regulators are particularly worried that under a branch structure they cede supervision to the

home regulator. It is therefore likely that the host regulator will not allow the operation to be organized

as a branch or, alternatively, the host regulator may severely restrict the activities that can be performed
  30
     In the payoff specification above, the total risk sharing benefit of the resolution area is fixed, leading to a lower per-
jurisdiction benefit as N grows, so that incentive compatibility then requires larger complementarities. Another force that can
help sustain larger resolution areas is that the risk-sharing benefits themselves may be increasing in the number of jurisdictions
that participate.



                                                               38
in branches (e.g., exclusion from mortgage business, etc.). Home regulators, on the other hand, worry that

foreign branches are hard to supervise and may therefore also prefer foreign operations to be performed in

subsidiaries, shifting the regulatory responsibility to the (perhaps better informed) host regulator. These

considerations are particularly important for large, potentially systemic banks. In fact, Cerutti et al. (2007)

document that large banks are less likely to organize their foreign operations as branches.31


7        Conclusion


This paper studies the resolution of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Credible G-SIB reso-

lution is a key component to ending too-big-to-fail, and regulators around the world have been working on

proposals regarding the appropriate design of such resolution regimes. We contribute to this discussion by

providing a formal economic analysis of the trade-offs that arise when choosing between different resolution

models.

         Our analysis highlights that a key challenge in designing successful resolution regimes is that the banks

in question are global, whereas the regulators charged with carrying out the resolution are national. This

tension necessitates careful consideration of the incentives of national regulators, both before and during

resolution. Broadly speaking, our findings support the view that “[a]n effective resolution plan is not one-

size-fits all and is not designed in a vacuum. It must be tailored to the structure and business activities

of a firm [...]” (JPMorgan Chase, 2017). Our model shows that successful bank resolution regimes need

consider, in particular, the risk profile of a bank’s cash flows across jurisdictions and the operational

complementarities across banking units held in different jurisdictions. In other words, bank resolution and

the structure of global banks need to correspond.




    31
    The practical difficulty of moving to a branch structure, even when the regulators involved are well aligned, is illustrated
by Nordea’s change in legal structure: Nordea was able to eventually convert its Nordic banking subsidiaries, Nordea Bank
Danmark A/S, Nordea Bank Finland Plc, and Nordea Bank Norge ASA, from Danish, Finnish, and Norwegian subsidiary
banks to branches of the Swedish parent company, Nordea Bank AB (publ), but only after a decade-long struggle. Lastra and
Wihlborg (2007) point out that, as of 2007: “Nordea’s efforts have stalled, however, as a result of resistance from authorities
in all the four countries involved [...].”

A    Appendix: The Need for Minimum TLAC


This appendix contains the detailed derivation of the financing equilibrium under asymmetric information

presented in Section 2, in particular Proposition 1. Because the result in Proposition 1 does not depend

on the presence of multiple operating subsidiaries in different jurisdictions, we focus the analysis on one

operating subsidiary in isolation (and therefore abstract away from complementarities across jurisdictions

and redundant systems).

    Consider the financing choices of the owners of a single operating subsidiary. At date 0, the setup

cost F can be funded via a combination of (i) short-term debt of face value R1 due at date 1; (ii) long-

term subordinated debt with face value RLT due at date 2; and, (iii) an equity stake α0 issued to outside

investors at date 0. In addition, at date 1 the operating subsidiary can issue further claims against date 2

cash flows in order to roll over its (senior) short-term debt.

    Financing choices are made by the informed owners of the operating subsidiary in a pooling equilibrium,

as in Bolton and Freixas (2000, 2006). In this pooling equilibrium, the high type (pi2 = 1) makes financing

choices taking into account that it will be mimicked by the low type (pi2 = 0). The high type will therefore

seek to avoid issuing claims against the continuation value V , which are sold at a discount in the pooling

equilibrium. From the perspective of a high-type subsidiary, the true value of a unit claim on V is 1, but

uninformed investors are willing to pay only p2 < 1 for this claim.32

    The underpricing of claims issued against the continuation value V (from the perspective of the high

type) entails a pecking order in funding sources, by which the issuer strictly prefers to first sell short-term

claims on date 1 cash flows before considering issuing long-term claims. Up to the face value C1L such

short-term debt can always be repaid from the date 1 cash-flows and can therefore be issued without

incurring any informational dilution costs. Up to the face value C1L + p2 V , the optimal strategy for the

high type issuer is to issue short-term debt at date 0 and only issue claims against the continuation value
  32
     As in Bolton and Freixas (2000, 2006), separating equilibria do not exist because banks with low continuation values can
always costlessly mimic high types.




                                                             45
V at date 1 in the event that the realized date 1 cash flow is smaller than the promised face value of the

short-term debt. Such state-contingent issuance against V is optimal because it minimizes dilution costs.

   Taking into account the convenience yield of safe short-term debt γ, the owners of the operating

subsidiary can therefore raise up to (1 + γ)(C1L + p2 V ) without incurring any default risk at date 1. From

a bank resolution perspective, the interesting case is therefore F > (1 + γ)(C1L + p2 V ), because, in this

case, financing entirely by short-term debt exposes the banking subsidiary to default risk at the interim

date. In what follows, we therefore focus on this case.

Assumption 1. Financing exclusively with short-term debt exposes the operating subsidiary to default

risk. This requires that F > (1 + γ)(C1L + p2 V ).

   When F > (1 + γ)(C1L + p2 V ), there are two relevant funding structures to compare, one where default

is avoided at date 1 and one where it is not. To avoid default at date 1 the operating subsidiary must

issue no more than R1 = C1L + p2 V in short-term debt, the maximum amount of short-term debt that can

be always be repaid or rolled over at 1, after wiping out long-term claims in a resolution if necessary. The

remaining funds must be raised through a combination of subordinated long-term debt and equity, which

absorb losses during a resolution. Alternatively, the operating subsidiary may raise the entire amount F

via short-term debt, without any long-term subordinated debt or equity issued by the holding company.

Under this latter funding structure, the bank is exposed to default risk because in the low cash-flow state

it will be unable to roll over its short-term debt at date 1 (absent loss-absorbing capital, a resolution is

not possible). In this case, short-term creditors run on the bank and liquidate its assets for an amount L.

Liquidation is inefficient because it yields less than the expected cash flows from continuing the banking

franchise, L < p2 V .

   We first consider the funding structure in which the holding company issues sufficient TLAC that the

short-term debt issued by the subsidiary is safe. The composition of this TLAC is such that, up to a face

value of long-term subordinated debt of R̂LT ≡ C1H + ∆ − R1 , the holding company has a preference for

issuing long-term debt rather than equity. This is because it is in the bank’s interest to ensure that all cash

that may be carried forward within the firm from date 1 to date 2 is pledged to investors, as this ensures

                                                      46
that all fairly-priced cash flows are completely sold to investors.33 Once all fairly-priced cash flows have

been sold, the owners are indifferent between any combination of outside equity issuance α0 and additional

subordinated long-term debt RLT ≥ R̂LT as loss-absorbing capital. Intuitively, once all fairly-priced cash

flows have been sold, the total asymmetric information discount associated with long-term securities does

not depend on the mix between long-term debt and equity. Without loss of generality, we can therefore

calculate the payoff to equityholders assuming that all external loss-absorbing capital in the form of long-

term subordinated debt. To reduce the number of cases, we also assume that F is sufficiently large such

that, in order to raise F , the bank issues at least R̂LT in long-term debt.34

       Maximum issuance of safe short-term debt R1 = C1L + p2 V raises (1 + γ)(C1L + p2 V ) in funds at date 0.

The remaining amount F − (1 + γ)(C1L + p2 V ) is then raised via long-term subordinated debt, as explained

above. The face value of long-term subordinated debt RLT must then satisfy



           p p2 RLT          + p1 (1 − p2 )(C1H + θ∆ − R1 ) + (1 − p1 )θ∆ = F −              (1 + γ)(C1L + p2 V )         .   (A1)
           | 1 {z }            |             {z          } | {z }                            |       {z         }
         RLT repaid when          RLT partially repaid when      LT debt payoff          Funds raised with safe ST debt
       C1 = C1H and C2 = V          C1 = C1H and C2 = 0          when C1 = C1L



The first term in this breakeven condition reflects the fact that RLT is paid back in full at date 1 when

the high cash flow C1H is realized and the operating subsidiary has a positive continuation value V , which

occurs with probability p1 p2 (from the perspective of uninformed investors). The second term captures the

payoff when C1 = C1H and C2 = 0. In this case there are not enough resources to repay both short-term

and long-term creditors, so that long-term creditors, who are structurally subordinated, receive whatever

is left after short-term creditors have been paid their claim of R1 = C1L + p2 V . The third term captures

the payoff when C1 = C1L . The bank is resolved and long-term creditors receive an expected payoff of θ∆,
  33
      To see this, note that in the high state an operating subsidiary that also receives the cash flow ∆ carries forward C1H +∆−R1
in cash to date 2. To make sure that all the fairly-priced cash flows are sold, it is therefore optimal to issue at least this
amount in long-term debt. Of course, this long-term debt is exposed to the asymmetric information friction in states in which
the firm does not carry forward sufficient cash, but it is less informationally sensitive than equity because it maximizes the
fraction of fairly-priced cash flows that back the security.
   34
      This assumption implies that long-term debtholders are only repaid fully when C1 = C1H and C2 = V . Relaxing this
assumption would mean that long-term debtholders would also be fully repaid when C1 = C1H and C2 = 0. The expression
for the face value of long-term debt would then be slightly different from the one calculated below, but none of the results
would be affected.




                                                                47
which is what is left after short-term creditors have been fully repaid. Based on this breakeven condition,

the face value of long-term subordinated debt is given by


                    F − (1 + γ)(C1L − p2 V ) − p1 (1 − p2 )(C1H + θ∆ − C1L − p2 V ) − (1 − p1 )θ∆
            RLT =                                                                                 ,      (A2)

and the payoff to the owners of the high-type operating subsidiary is



                           = p1 C1H + θ∆ + V − R1 − RLT

                                 p2


The expression in the first line of equation (A3) captures that, under the maintained parameter assump-

tions, inside equityholders receive a payoff only if the high date 1 cash flow C1H is realized, in which case

their expected payoff is C1H + θ∆ + V − R1 − RLT . The second line substitutes in for R1 and RLT . The key

observation here is that dΠT LAC /dp2 is positive whenever having sufficient loss-absorbing capital requires

issuing claims against the continuation value V (this is the case when F > p1 C1H + (1 − p1 )C1L + γC1L + θ∆).

The expected profits to the owners of a high-type banking operation are lower when p2 is low because claims

against V are sold at a larger discount.

   We now consider the second funding structure, under which the entire setup cost F is funded with

short-term debt. In this case, the operating subsidiary defaults whenever the low cash flow C1L is realized,

irrespective of the realization of ∆, provided that ∆ is not too large. We will focus on this case, but the

alternate case (where receiving C1L + ∆ allows the operating subsidiary to service its short-term debt) can

be treated in similar fashion.


Assumption 2. If financing is exclusively in the form of short-term debt, the operating subsidiary defaults

whenever C1L is realized, irrespective of whether the additional cash flow ∆ is received. This requires that

R1 > C1L + ∆ + p2 V , which holds as long as ∆ is not too large.




                                                      48
       When the entire amount F is raised by issuing short-term debt, short-term debt is risky, and therefore

does not generate the banking benefit γ.35 The face value of short-term debt then has to satisfy the

breakeven condition

                                         p1 R1 + (1 − p1 )(C1L + θ∆ + L) = F.                                           (A4)


This breakeven captures that short-term creditor are repaid in full when the high cash flow occurs. If the

low cash flow is realized, they seize the available cash flow and liquidate the firm for a total expected payoff

of C1L + θ∆ + L. This breakeven condition yields a face value of short-term debt of


                                                 F − (1 − p1 )(C1L + θ∆ + L)
                                          R1 =                               .                                          (A5)
                                                              p1


       When financing is exclusively in the form of short-term debt, under Assumption 2 the owners of the

operating subsidiary receive a payoff only when the high cash flow is realized, in which case they receive

cash flows C1H + θ∆ + V net of the face value of short-term debt R1 . The expected profit of a high-type

operating subsidiary is then given by



                                     = p1 C1H + θ∆ − R1 + V
                                                           
                        ΠnoT LAC

                                     = p1 C1H + (1 − p1 )C1L + θ∆ + p1 V − (1 − p1 )L − F,                              (A6)



where the second line substitutes in for R1 .

       Comparing expected profits with and without sufficient loss-absorbing capital (equations (A3) and

(A6)) reveals that private incentives may be such that the owners of the banking operation do not issue

securities that provide sufficient TLAC and instead rely exclusively on short-term debt. To see this, note

first that financing with sufficient TLAC is privately optimal when claims against long-term cash flows

are fairly priced (p2 = 1). In this case, TLAC does not involve any dilution costs and generates a social

     Note that the entire liquidity benefit from short-term debt is lost when there is a risk of default on short-term debt.
We could extend the model to allow for two types of short-term debt with different seniority (e.g., by collateralizing some of
the short-term debt or issuing a covered bond), in which the safe senior short-term debt retains the liquidity benefit. The
bank’s decision to issue sufficient TLAC then purely depends on the trade-off between the asymmetric information discount
of long-term securities and the cost of inefficient liquidation, and the bank would be less likely to issue sufficient TLAC.


                                                             49
benefit of safe short-term debt of γ(C1L + p2 V ), which, in equilibrium, is appropriated by the bank. Risky

debt financing, on the other hand, is costly because it does not generate a convenience yield and it leads to

inefficient liquidation in the low cash flow state. In contrast, when dilution costs on long-term cash flows

are sufficiently high (when p2 lies below a cutoff p∗2 < 1), risky debt financing is privately optimal, even

though it leads to inefficient early liquidation and eliminates the social benefit of short-term debt.

   To derive the cutoff p∗2 below which short-term financing becomes optimal, we first note that dΠT LAC /dp2 >

0 whenever sufficient loss-absorbing capital requires issuing claims against the continuation value V (i.e.,

when F > p1 C1H + (1 − p1 )C1L + γC1L + θ∆). This can be seen directly from


                              dΠT LAC   F − p1 C1H − (1 − p1 )C1L − γC1L − θ∆
                                      =                                       .                          (A7)
                                dp2                     (p2 )2


Next, solving ΠT LAC = ΠnoT LAC for p2 yields the unique cutoff


                                             F − p1 C1H − (1 − p1 + γ)C1L − θ∆
            p∗2 (γ, L) =                                                                        .        (A8)
                           F − p1 C1H   − (1 − p1 + γ)C1L − θ∆ + (1 − p1 )(V − L) + γ(C1L + V )


   Given that dΠT LAC /dp2 > 0, risky short-term debt financing is then chosen whenever p2 < p∗2 (γ, L),

as stated in Proposition 1 . Therefore, SPOE and MPOE resolution schemes, both of which crucially rely

on sufficient TLAC, must in general be complemented by a minimum TLAC requirement.

not necessary. Part (iii) follows from the observation that asymmetry (θ1 6= θ2 ) reduces the inside equity

stake of the subsidiary for which θi < 1/2, thereby reducing incentives to produce ∆ for this subsidiary

under MPOE, while incentives under SPOE are not affected.




                                                                 51
C     Online Appendix


This online appendix contains a number of extensions and some additional discussion of the model presented

in the main paper.


C.1     More General Distributions for ∆

In the paper, we assume a particularly tractable distribution for the diversifiable cash flow ∆. In particular,

∆ is of known size and materializes for sure; the only risk is whether ∆ will be received by the operating

subsidiary in jurisdiction 1 or 2. In this section we briefly discuss the extension of the model to a setting in

which ∆ is random. We proceed in two steps. We first discuss a setting in which the size of ∆ is random,

but ∆ continues to be received by one operating subsidiary for sure. We then discuss a setting in which ∆

is uncertain, in the sense that there is a possibility that neither jurisdictions receives ∆.


C.1.1    Random ∆


Assume that ∆ is randomly distributed on the interval [∆, ∆]. In this case, the diversification of cash-flow

risk that results from a move from MPOE to SPOE resolution allows the global bank to issue an additional

amount of safe short-term debt of no more than ∆. This is because additional risk-free claims are governed

by the lower bound of the distribution of ∆. In other words, the additional liquidity services that can be

obtained under SPOE due to the diversification of cash-flow risk is given by γ∆. Rewriting equation (2)

then yields a net benefit of SPOE resolution under supranational regulation of



                                 γ∆                   +   2 min[Fe − F, (1 − p1 + γ)(1 − λ)p2 V ].         (B1)
                               | {z }                     |                 {z                 }
                      additional liquidity services                     benefits from
                          from diversification                         global banking


Note that the second term, the benefits from global banking, is unchanged relative to the case in which

∆ is not random. However, the first term is reduced by randomness in ∆, meaning that the benefits of

SPOE resolution are reduced relative to the benchmark model.




                                                              52
   Another change that would result from a change to random ∆ is that it would make it privately optimal

for the bank to issue a larger proportion of its TLAC as long-term debt rather than equity. The reason is

that high realizations of ∆ result in relatively large amounts of cash being carried forward by the bank to

date 2. As discussed in Section 3 (and in more detail in Appendix A), because of asymmetric information

the bank has a preference for long-term debt over equity until all fairly priced cash flows have been sold to

investors. Therefore, the possibility of high realizations of ∆ shifts the firm’s preferred TLAC composition

towards more long-term debt. In sum, a random ∆ leads to a funding structure with less short-term debt

and more long-term debt than in the benchmark model.

   Finally, random ∆ affects the incentive compatibility constraints of national regulators. First, in the

ex-ante incentive constraint (3), ∆ is replaced by the lower bound ∆. Effectively, the decrease in the net

benefits of SPOE over MPOE means that more symmetry between jurisdictions (i.e., a smaller |θ1 − θ2 |)

is required for SPOE to be incentive compatible from an ex-ante perspective. Second, in the ex-post

incentive compatibility constraint (4), the fact that the required transfer is now given by ∆/2 means that

SPOE becomes easier to sustain. Intuitively, the limit imposed on the transfer by the randomness of ∆

(only a transfer of ∆/2 can be made with probability one) is similar to a reduction in the transfer in the

constrained optimal resolution regime discussed in Section 4.4. In the extreme case, where ∆ = 0, no

transfers are possible under SPOE, and the ex-post incentive constraint is always satisfied.


C.1.2   Uncertain ∆


Another possibility is that each operating subsidiary receives ∆ (of known size) with independent probabil-

ity q < 1. In this case, neither operating subsidiary receives ∆ with probability (1 − q)2 . The two operating

subsidiaries then cannot rely on ∆ to issue additional short-term debt that is completely risk-free. If only

completely risk-free debt generates liquidity services, then, according to equation (2), the net benefit from

SPOE comes exclusively from the preservation of economies of scale and scope, amounting to a net benefit




                                                     53
across the two jurisdictions of



                                         2 min[Fe − F, (1 − p1 + γ)(1 − λ)p2 V ].                                        (B2)



On the other hand, if short-term debt only has to be sufficiently safe (but not completely safe) to generate

liquidity benefits, then the net benefits of SPOE are given by equation (2) as long as (1 − q)2 is sufficiently

small. For example, this could be the case if the additional amount ∆ of short-term debt is safe enough to

be rated AAA.


C.2     Incentives to increase non-diversifiable cash flows

In the benchmark model, we considered managerial incentives of the G-SIB’s operating subsidiaries to

increase the probability of receiving the diversifiable cash flow ∆. In this section, we consider instead a

setting where managers can increase the non-diversifiable cash-flow through effort. In particular, suppose

that each subsidiary manager can increase the high aggregate cash flow from C1H to C1H + π by exerting

effort e = 1. If the manager of subsidiary i does not exert effort (e = 0), this subsidiary receives C1H in the

high aggregate cash-flow state.36 Exerting effort is costly in the sense that it involves the loss of a private

benefit B > 0.


C.2.1    Incentives under MPOE Resolution


When the manager exerts effort (e = 1), with probability p1 high aggregate cash flow C1H + π is realized

and the payoff to inside equityholders is given by


                                          MPOE
                                    (1 − α0,i  )(C1H + π + θi ∆ − R1MPOE + pi2 V ).                                      (B3)
  36
    Strictly speaking, this cash-flow structure allows headquarters to perfectly infer effort ex post. To prevent this, one can
think of this setting as the limiting case where no effort (e = 0) leads to cash flow C1H with probability 1 − , C1H + π with
probability , and  → 0.




                                                              54
With probability (1 − p1 )(1 − θi ), C1L is realized and ∆ is not produced. In this case, equityholders are

completely wiped out in resolution and receive nothing. Finally, with probability (1 − p1 )θi , the subsidiary

receives C1L + ∆. In this case, because ∆ is available to reduce outstanding short-term debt, equityholders

are only partially wiped out in resolution. Specifically, the fraction x of equity that is wiped out must

satisfy xp2 λV = p2 λV − ∆, such that inside equityholders receive an expected date-2 payoff of


                                                                            pi2
                                             MPOE
                                (1 − x)(1 − α0,i  )pi2 λV = (1 − α0MPOE )       ∆.                        (B4)
                                                                            p2


When the manager does not exert effort (e = 0), inside equityholders’ payoffs are analogous, except that

the high aggregate cash-flow realization is reduced to C1H .

   Exerting effort is individually optimal for the manager of subsidiary i if producing C1H + π with prob-

ability p1 leads to a higher payoff for the manager than receiving C1H with probability p1 and enjoying the

private benefit B:


                                                                                             pi2

                                                                                         )       ∆≥
                                                                                             p2


                                                                                           pi2
                        MPOE
               p1 (1 − α0,i  )(C1H + θi ∆ − R1MPOE + pi2 V ) + (1 − p1 )θi (1 − α0MPOE )       ∆+B        (B5)
                                                                                           p2

Collecting terms and simplifying, exerting effort is optimal for the manager of subsidiary i if:


                                                   MPOE       B
                                              1 − α0,i  ≥         .                                       (B6)
                                                             p1 π


C.2.2   Incentives under SPOE Resolution


Analogously to above, the manager of operating subsidiary i will exert effort under SPOE resolution if:



   p1 (1 − α0SPOE ) C1H + π + θi ∆ − R1SPOE + pi2 V ≥ p1 (1 − α0SPOE ) C1H + θi ∆ − R1SPOE + pi2 V + B.
                                                                                               
                                                                                                          (B7)




                                                       55
Recall that under SPOE, the cash flow ∆ never accrues to inside equityholders in the low cash-flow state.

Instead, ∆ is used to repay short-term debt in each subsidiary. Simplifying the above expression, effort is

privately optimal under SPOE if
                                                                 B
                                                 1 − α0SPOE ≥        .                                (B8)
                                                                p1 π

   Comparing the incentive constraints (B6) and (B8) reveals that incentives to increase non-diversifiable

are determined solely by the size of the inside equity stake that can be retained under SPOE and MPOE.

   Equity stakes can be calculated from the breakeven conditions as in the main text. Under SPOE this

   We are now in a position to rewrite Proposition 8 for this alternative specification, in which effort

affects the size of the high cash-flow realization.


Proposition 8 (B). Incentives under MPOE and SPOE when effort increases the high cash-

flow realization.


  (i) Operating subsidiary i has stronger incentives to exert effort to increase the cash-flow in the high

      aggregate state under SPOE than under MPOE when the retained inside equity stake under SPOE is

      larger than inside equity stake that can be retained under MPOE,

                                                                        .                            (B11)

 (ii) When the probabilities of receiving the diversifiable cash flow ∆ are symmetric across jurisdictions

      (θ1 = θ2 = 21 ), then 1 − α0SPOE > 1 − α0,i
                                              MPOE
                                                   , such that incentives are better under SPOE.


(iii) When the probabilities of receiving the additional cash flow ∆ are asymmetric across jurisdictions

      (θ1 6= θ2 ), it becomes easier to sustain incentives for both operating subsidiaries under SPOE, because

      incentives are reduced for one of the two subsidiaries under MPOE.


   Proof of Proposition 8 (B). Part (i) follows directly from a comparison of the incentive constraints

(B6) and (B8). For part (ii) we need to show that that α0SPOE < α0MPOE when θ1 = θ2 . Consider first the

special case when λ = 1. In this case, α0SPOE < α0MPOE requires that


                        ∆ (1 + γ)((1 − p1 )C1L + p1 (C1H + π) + ∆/2 + p2 V ) − F
                                                                                

                             p1 (C1H + π − C1L ) p1 (C1H + π − C1L ) + ∆/2
                                                                          



which holds if and only if



                          (1 + γ) (1 − p1 )C1L + p1 (C1H + π) + ∆/2 + p2 V − F > 0.
                                                                         
                                                                                                         (B13)



For condition (B13) to be satisfied it is sufficient that the expected per jurisdiction cash flow given effort,

as perceived by the market, is larger than the ex-ante setup cost F . This must be the case if the operating
                                                        dαMPOE
subsidiaries are able to raise financing. Noting that     0
                                                          dλ     < 0, we see that α0SPOE < α0MPOE continues to
                                                                        MPOE
hold when λ < 1. Part (iii) follows directly from the observation that α0,i  increases for the subsidiary

that is less likely to receive ∆ (i.e., θi < 1/2).


C.3    Resolution Areas: Detailed Derivation

In this section we provide a step-by-step derivation for the ex-ante IC constraint for the N -country resolu-

tion area discussed in Section 6.3. Consider first the expected transfer made or received by jurisdiction i

under SPOE resolution. Resolution occurs with probability 1 − p1 . In the resolution state, the jurisdiction
                                        1
that receives ∆ makes a transfer of     N∆   to each of the N − 1 remaining jurisdictions, a total transfer of


                                                       57
N −1                                                                     1
 N ∆.   The jurisdictions that do not receive ∆ receive a transfer of    N∆   each. This results in an expected

net transfer of
                                                                          
                                     N −1              1                   1
                        (1 − p1 ) θi      ∆ − (1 − θi ) ∆ = (1 − p1 ) θi −     ∆.                        (B14)
                                      N                N                   N

The ex-ante benefit from participating in the N -country resolution area is given, analogously to the two-

country case, by
                                   ∆
                                     γ + min[Fe − F, (1 − p1 + γ)(1 − λN )p2 V ],                        (B15)
                                   N

where the first term captures the liquidity benefits arising from sharing the idiosyncratic cash-flow risk

and the second term the scale and scope benefits from global banking. This is analogous to the right-hand

side in equation (3), except that the liquidity benefits that arise from sharing the idiosyncratic cash-flow

risk are now spread across N jurisdictions. Combining (B14) and (B15), SPOE resolution is then ex-ante

incentive compatible if, for each jurisdiction i,

                                     
                                    1      ∆
                     (1 − p1 ) θi −     ∆ ≤ γ + min[Fe − F, (1 − p1 + γ)(1 − λN )p2 V ].                 (B16)
                                    N      N


Simplifying this expression und using the fact that the inequality is hardest to satisfy for the country with

the highest probability of receiving ∆ leads to the condition given in the text,
