                                                ABSTRACT

We use state repeals of blood test requirements for a marriage license that occurred between 1980
and 2005 to examine the impact of changes in the price of marriage on the marriage decision. Using
a within-group estimator that holds constant state and year effects and exploits variation in the repeal
dates of BTRs across states, we find that BTRs are associated with a 5.7% decrease in marriage licenses
issued by a state. Using individual-level marriage license data from 1981-1995, we find that about
half of this effect is due to couples seeking marriage licenses in other states, with the other half is due
to deterred marriages. We also examine the marital status of mothers using birth certificate and Current
Population Survey data, and find that blood test requirements reduce the fraction of first-time mothers
who are married at the time of birth. The marriage-deterrent effects of BTRs are larger for lower socio-economic
groups.

1. Introduction

         Marriage has been shown to be positively related to a number of important

outcomes such as higher earnings and productivity, (Ahituv and Lerman, 2007;

Korenman and Neumark, 1991), health (Clarka and Etileb, 2006; Duncan, Wilkerson, and

England, 2006; Frech and Williams, 2007; Kenney and McLanahan, 2006; Liu and

Umberson, 2008), better early child cognitive outcomes (Liu and Heiland, forthcoming),

longevity (Felder, 2006), and higher self-reported happiness (Blanchflower and Oswald,

2004; Zimmerman and Easterlin, 2006).1 As such, researchers have long been interested

in how individuals respond to changes in the cost of marriage, with some emphasis on the

effects of public policy on the decision to marry. Policies that have been shown to affect

the likelihood of marriage include those that relate to the marriage contract directly (such

as minimum age requirements and divorce laws) and those that affect couples’ economic

incentives to marry (such as income taxes or transfer programs).

         In this paper, we examine the decision to marry in response to a policy that has

not been previously studied—blood test requirements (BTRs) for obtaining a marriage

license. The BTRs we consider were enacted in the first half of the twentieth century as

part of public health campaigns to reduce the spread of communicable diseases and

prevent birth defects (Brandt 1985). The laws required couples applying for a marriage

license to be screened for certain conditions, commonly rubella or syphilis. However,

after penicillin proved to be a cheap and effective treatment for syphilis and vaccines

were developed for rubella, these screenings were no longer considered cost-effective. In

    Most studies find that marriage is correlated with positive outcomes. However, the

marriage wage penalty for white women is a notable exception (Waite 1995).



                                                                                             2
1980, thirty-four states required a blood test in order to receive a marriage license.

Nineteen states repealed their laws in the 1980s, and by 2006 only Mississippi, Montana,

and the District of Columbia still required premarital blood tests.2

         We investigate the effects of the repeals of the BTRs on the marriage decision.

This is an interesting case to consider for several reasons. First, the state law changes

occurred in thirty-one states over a wide window of time (1980-2005). This provides

significant variation and will allow us to separate the effect of the law change and overall

shifts in marriage rates. Second, while we will be interested in whether the effects of the

policy vary by socio-economic status or demographic group, the policy itself affected the

entire population eligible for marriage in the state. Thus, the “treated” population in our

study is much larger than in previous studies of minimum age requirements or tax and

transfer policies, for example. Third, the repeals provide an opportunity to study the

effects of a relatively small change in the cost of getting married. The results may be of

interest to policy makers considering other policies that directly (required premarital

counseling, waiting periods, and license fees) or indirectly (tax and transfer programs)

affect the cost of getting married.

         There are several ways that a BTR might increase the cost of getting married and

induce couples to either obtain their license in another state or decide not to marry at all.

First, the act of submitting to a blood test and waiting for results induces a waiting period

for a marriage license that might deter spur-of-the-moment marriages. Also, since blood

tests are usually paid for by the individual wishing to be married, the BTR increases the

dollar cost of marriage. There are also likely to be other non-pecuniary costs associated

2
    Montana went on to repeal its requirement in 2007.



                                                                                                3
with going to the doctor and having blood drawn or the potential cost of testing positive

for and having to reveal that condition to one’s partner. These costs might be a greater

financial burden for certain populations, including those with lower income and lower

education levels.

        We first examine panel data on state marriage rates (obtained from the CDC and

defined as marriage licenses issued per 1,000 state residents) over the 1980-2006 time

period. Using a within-group estimator that holds constant state and year effects and

exploits the variation in the repeal dates of BTRs across states, we find that BTRs are

associated with a 5.7% decrease in marriage licenses issued. The within-group model

would provide biased estimates of the BTR effect if repeals were correlated with trends in

marriage rates. In probit models, we demonstrate that the repeal of BTRs is not

correlated with changing rates of marriage or sexually transmitted diseases, suggesting

that we can treat the law repeals as exogenous within our model. Since couples can

obtain marriage licenses outside of their state of residence, we also use individual-level

marriage license data with information on state of residence. We find that about half of

the drop in marriage licenses is due to couples going out of state to get married with the

other half actually being deterred from marriage. We also use birth certificate data from

1980 to 2002 for first time mothers with information on whether the mother was married

at the time of birth and find that for this group, BTRs deter marriage, and the effect is

larger for blacks, for young women, and for mothers without a high school degree. The

marriage disincentive effect is also larger for women who are geographically further from

a state without a BTR. Finally, we use Current Population Survey data from 1980 to




                                                                                             4
2006 and look at young mothers. We again find that if there was a BTR in place at the

time of the birth, the mother is less likely to be currently married.

       In the next section, we discuss the literature on responses to changes in the cost of

marriage, and describe in detail the BTRs we study. Section 3 describes our data sources

and methods, and Section 4 presents our results. The last section concludes.



2. Background

2.1 Review of Literature on Changing the Cost of Marriage

       Economic theory suggests that changes in the costs or benefits of marriage can

affect marriage outcomes such as marriage rates and marriage timing (Alm, Dickert-

Conlin and Whittington, 1999; Becker, 1981). As the cost (benefit) of marriage rises, the

likelihood of marriage falls (rises). Costs or benefits could be pecuniary (such as a

marriage tax penalty) or non-pecuniary (security and stability). They could be one-time

(such as a marriage license fee) or faced continuously during the marriage (putting the

toilet seat down).   Much of the theoretical literature focuses on responses to changes in

the value of the marriage contract—to bargaining power (Lundberg and Pollack, 1996),

or to the division of labor (Becker, 1981).

       Empirically, studies generally do find a behavioral response to changes in the cost

or benefit of marriage. In particular, there is evidence that various public policies affect

(whether intentionally or not) couples’ incentives to marry. Moffitt (1998) provides a

review of the literature examining the impact of the “marriage penalty” in the U.S., in

which married couples who file jointly are taxed at a higher rate than they would be if

they were single and filed separately. He concludes that most research supports a




                                                                                               5
marriage disincentive effect. More recent research has focused on the interaction of the

income tax system and transfer systems such as the EITC and welfare (Dickert-Conlin

and Houser, 1998; Eissa and Hoynes, 2000; Bitler, et al. 2004). Finally, Rasul (2006)

finds that unilateral divorce laws decreased marriage rates, because the laws lower the

value of marriage by making it easier for one’s partner to leave.

       More related to this paper is the small body of work that has considered the

effects of public policies that change the cost or availability of the marriage license itself.

An example is the literature on the effects of minimum age requirements for a marriage

license. Blank, Charles, and Sallee (2007) find that when states have a higher minimum

age for marriage, some marriages are delayed. However, they also find that many young

people marry out of their home state to avoid restrictive laws. Dahl (forthcoming)

obtains similar results in his work using minimum age requirements as an instrument for

early marriage. These laws are similar to BTRs in that they make the process of obtaining

a marriage license more costly for couples who are not eligible to marry in their state but

could travel to another (with the cost being effectively infinite for couples too young to

marry in any state). We expect that BTRs may have similar effects—deterring marriage

for some individuals, and driving others to less restrictive states to obtain their licenses.

We explore both possibilities below.

2.2 Blood Test Requirements

       Historically, many states have required applicants for a marriage license to obtain

a blood test. These tests were for venereal diseases (most commonly syphilis), for

genetic disorders (such as sickle-cell anemia), or for rubella. The tests for syphilis were

part of a broad public health campaign enacted in the late 1930s by U.S. Surgeon General




                                                                                                6
Thomas Parran.3 Parran argued that premarital testing was necessary to inform the

potential marriage partner of the risk of contracting a communicable disease, and to

reduce the risk of birth defects associated with syphilis.4 According to Brandt (1985),

“by the end of 1938, twenty-six states had enacted provisions prohibiting the marriage of

infected individuals” (p. 147). Screenings for genetic disorders and for rubella were also

implemented in the interest of minimizing the risk of genetic disease or birth defects in

the couple’s offspring.5

          In the case of syphilis, however, it was soon recognized that premarital blood

testing was not a cost-effective way to screen for the disease. Despite reports that 10% of

Americans were infected, only 1.34% of applicants in New York City’s first year of

testing were found to have the disease. Brandt (1985) notes that a premarital exam was

“not the optimal locus for screening,” since couples seeking to marry were not likely to

be in the most at-risk groups, and individuals who knew they were infected could wait

until the infection cleared to apply for a license. The tests became even less valuable

over the 1950s, when penicillin emerged as a cheap and effective treatment for the

disease. Continuing with New York City’s example, early cases of syphilis dropped 90%

between 1946 and 1955, and in 1976 “only 39 cases of previously undetected syphilis

3
    Our discussion on venereal disease draws primarily from Brandt (1985).
4
    Congenital syphilis is strongly linked to blindness and paralysis, and most infants born

with the disease died shortly after birth (Brandt 1985).
5
    According to the National Network for Immunization Information, “up to 85% of

expectant mothers infected in the first trimester will have a miscarriage or a baby with

CRS [Congenital Rubella Syndrome]” (www.immunizationinfo.org).



                                                                                               7
were found in approximately 116,000 premarital venereal examinations . . . the cost of

uncovering these cases was almost $60,000 per case” (p 177). Nationwide, couples spent

over $80 million to reveal 456 cases. Similarly, the need for rubella screening lessened

after vaccines for rubella were licensed in 1969. “Today there are fewer than 1,000 cases

of rubella reported each year in the U.S. on average and less than 10 cases of congenital

rubella syndrome” (www.immunizationinfo.org). Figure 1 shows that incidence rates of

both syphilis and rubella had dropped dramatically by the late 1970s.

       These reductions in the prevalence of the diseases, largely due to improvements in

medical technology, led to the repeal of the requirements in many states. For example, an

article noting the repeal of Massachusetts’ law in 2005 reported that “there are so few

syphilis cases now among engaged couples that the test is outdated and an added

economic burden . . . The test is also designed to detect rubella, but people are now

vaccinated against that disease” (LeBlanc 2005). While we have found no systematic

explanation for why individual states repealed their laws when they did, in the next

section we test for possible endogeneity in the timing of the repeals. We find that the

repeals are not a function of state levels of marriage rates or rates of syphilis and

gonorrhea, or of trends in marriage rates.

       It is important to mention that even in the early days of BTRs, there is evidence

that couples took steps to avoid the tests (Brandt 1985):

       After Connecticut passed its law in 1935, and before the New York
       Legislature had taken action, weekend marriages in New York counties
       bordering Connecticut rose by 55 percent . . . the number of marriages in
       some states reportedly declined after premarital exams became legally
       required. (p. 149).

There was also the view that BTRs might discourage marriage altogether: “In New




                                                                                            8
Jersey some state legislators expressed concern that premarital laws that restricted

marriage to the healthy could lead to an increase of free love, illegitimacy, and common

law marriages” (p. 149). Thus, our hypothesis that BTRs might decrease marriage

licenses issued by a state and possibly deter marriages finds support in the historic record.

          Information on BTRs used in our analysis was obtained by searching state statute

volumes. In some cases, when a law was repealed, there was no record of the law in the

volumes. For this reason, we supplemented our research with searches of newspaper

records using Lexis-Nexis. In order to be counted as a repeal, we required that we find

two separate articles referring to the repeal. Using these criteria, we identified 34 states

that had a BTR in 1980. Of these 34, 19 states repealed their law in the 1980s, 7 repealed

in the 1990s, and 5 more repealed between 2000 and 2006, leaving only 3 with a BTR in

2006.6 For our results, a state-year observation is coded as having a BTR if a

requirement was in place for the entire calendar year. Figure 2 shows the timing of

changes in BTR laws in each of the US states.7

2.3 Blood Test Requirements and Marriage

6
    In all of our analysis we classify the District of Columbia as a state.
7
    Both Louisiana and Illinois passed a law requiring a blood test for the HIV virus in

1988. Because the tests were expensive and identified few cases of HIV, Louisiana

repealed the requirement in November of 1988 and Illinois did so in September of 1989.

Because Louisiana’s BTR was in place for less than six months and was enacted and

repealed in the same calendar year, we code the state as never having a BTR. Illinois,

however, had a BTR for syphilis in place in 1980, which was repealed along with the

HIV BTR in 1989. Thus, we code Illinois as having a BTR from 1980-1988.



                                                                                               9
         We utilize the within-state variation produced by the repeal of blood test laws to

examine the laws’ impact on marriage. The presence of requirements may increase the

price of obtaining a marriage license in several ways. First, in many cases there is a

waiting time of at least a few days between the admission of a blood test and the receipt

of the results. Calls to clinics in DC and Mississippi, the two states that still had a test in

2008, found that couples wait three to five days for the results of their tests. Additionally,

a couple may need to make an appointment with their physician or local clinic to be

tested. Thus, the BTRs introduce a waiting period that could prevent couples who decide

to marry on the “spur-of-the-moment” from doing so.8

         Further, the presence of a BTR may increase the price of obtaining a marriage

license. To comply with a requirement, individuals applying for a marriage license must

pay for the doctor’s visit and blood test in most cases, which “can cost couples hundreds

of dollars” (Leblanc 2005). Clinics in DC and Mississippi reported per-couple costs of

$40 and $26, respectively; in DC, tests from a doctor’s office were reported to cost as

much as $200 per couple. Additionally, the Mississippi clinic we called indicated that




8
    While we have no data on the prevalence of spur-of-the-moment marriages, we do

observe the day of the week and type of ceremony in our marriage license data. In 1980,

10.6% of marriages were civil ceremonies that took place between Monday and Thursday,

suggesting that a nontrivial portion of marriages are not of the (presumably planned)

weekend-church-wedding-variety. Also, in the 1984 Detroit Area Survey of 459 ever-

married women age 18-75, 10.9% of the women report that they were never engaged

before marrying (White 1990).



                                                                                              10
Medicaid could not be used to cover the cost of the test. There may be other financial

costs associated with obtaining the test, including the opportunity cost of the time spent.

          Finally, there may be psychic costs associated with a BTR. As Bowman (1977)

observes (referring to tests for sickle-cell anemia), “the mandatory testing for carriers of

genetically determined diseases at the time of marriage application can result in serious

psychological trauma, for the decision has already been made to marry.” Applicants may

wish to avoid learning about their disease status, or may want to keep this information

from their partners. There may also be non-negligible disutility from a visit to the doctor,

or from the procedure of having blood drawn. Taken together, we believe these costs

may have made a BTR a deterrent to obtaining a marriage license in states with the laws,

and may have also decreased couples’ likelihood of marrying at all.

          In Figure 3, we provide some graphical evidence of the impact of BTRs on

marriage rates. In this figure, we graph the number of marriage licenses issued per 1,000

state residents, before and after the repeal of a BTR. Data are from the CDC’s reports of

state marriage rates (described in more detail in the next section). The solid line plots the

average of the marriage rates for 25 states that had a requirement in place in 1980, but

who repealed their law by 2001. We center the figure at the year the law was repealed in

each state and report the marriage rates for the five years before and after the repeal of

the law. The dotted line represents a “control” group of 16 states that did not have a

blood test law at any time between 1980 and 2001.9 For this group, the mean marriage

rate t years from repeal is calculated using an average of marriage rates in years in which

a law was repealed in another state, following Ayers and Levitt (1998).

9
    Ten states are not included in the figure; see the data appendix.



                                                                                             11
        There are three notable results in Figure 3. First, there is a similar downward

trend in marriage rates in both the treatment and control states in the pre-treatment

period . In the differences-in-differences framework that we will use for our empirical

estimates, it is important that the trends for the treatment and control groups be the same

in the absence of the intervention, and this appears to be the case. Second, this

downward trend appears to be interrupted in the year that treated states repeal their BTRs.

Between the year before the test is repealed and the year after, an average increase in

marriage licenses of about 3% is observed. This increase persists in the years following

the repeal, and it appears that in the long run marriage rates remain above the pre-repeal

trend and are close to the rates for states with no BTR over this period. Third, the control

states show no break in the downward trend in marriage rates. In the next section, we

describe our empirical strategy for confirming these results and for examining the impact

of the requirements on marriages more generally.



3. Data and Methods

        We will be using within- state variation in whether states require a blood test for a

marriage license to examine the impact of the laws on marriage behavior. The general

specification is:

                    y st = β 0 + β 1 * bloodtest st + α s + δ t + τ s timet + ε st            (1)

where bloodtestst is a dummy variable equal to one if state s had a blood test for the

entire year in year t, αs represents state fixed-effects, δt are year dummies, timet is a

quadratic time trend, τs gives the state-specific coefficient on the time trend, and εst is

random error. The dependent variable will be a measure of marriage behavior in state s



                                                                                                12
and period t and will vary with the particular data set and specification. Because errors

may be serially correlated within state, we estimate heteroskedastic, robust standard

errors that are clustered at the state level.

          As with any identification strategy using variation in state laws, one must be

concerned with the exogeneity of the laws. Our results will be biased if the presence of a

law or timing of a repeal is correlated with unobserved state characteristics. To address

this, we include state fixed effects and state-specific quadratic trends in all of our

preferred specifications. We also include year dummies in all specifications, to allow for

any secular trends in marriage rates. As further checks on the exogeneity of the laws, we

test whether the timing of the repeals can be predicted by observed state characteristics,

and we consider the effects of adding a placebo law to our main results.

          We use four different panel data sets in our analysis.10 First, we use annual state

marriage rates obtained from the CDC’s Vital Statistics data for 1980-2006. Marriage

rates are defined as the number of marriage licenses issued per 1,000 state residents.

Thus, estimating equation (1) using these marriage rates as the dependent variable will

tell us whether the laws had any effect on the number of marriage licenses issued by

states. The advantage of this data set is that it is available for the entire time period we

are interested in studying, and for all states. States might also be interested in knowing

the effects of the laws on license applications, since marriage license fees are a source of

revenue for local and state governments. However, even if we see that the laws decrease

marriage licenses, we will not be able to identify decreases in actual marriages using this

data set—couples in states with requirements could still be marrying but obtaining their

licenses in another state. Furthermore, this data is not available at a more detailed level

(for example, subdivided into racial or education categories).

          For these reasons, we also use the Marriage and Divorce Detail Files from Vital

Statistics, which contain individual-level data from marriage licenses. The data are

available from 1981 to 1995, and not all states report their individual license data (see the

data appendix). However, the data is ideal for analyzing the impact of a change in blood

tests on marriage, as both the state of residence and state of marriage are reported. Thus,

we are able to examine the impact of BTRs on marriage licenses issued per 1,000 state

residents, even if the couple married in another state. This allows us to see if the laws

actually deterred marriage, as opposed to simply sending residents out of state for their

marriage licenses. Also, because these are micro data we are able to construct marriage

rates by racial group.11 Finally, we can use the data to see whether the laws affect

couples’ likelihood of marrying in their state of residence or in an adjoining state.

          We supplement our analysis using the Vital Statistics Natality Detail files for

1980-2002.      The data contain a virtual census of births to women in the United States,

with about four million births per year. For most states women are asked to report

whether or not they are married at the time of birth, and we use this data to obtain both

     We also constructed marriage rates by education, but because education is only

reported on the marriage license data through 1988, those results are not reported here.



                                                                                              14
marriage and birth information for women over 18.12,13 We choose this group because

first-time mothers are plausibly “at-risk” for marriage, so the BTRs might have a larger

effect on this population. These mothers are also important for policy makers interested

in rates of out-of-wedlock childbearing or in outcomes for children born in and out of

marriage.14 The model is similar to equation (1), but the dependent variable is a binary

variable equal to one if the mother is married at the time of birth. We include controls for

mother’s race and education, and we divide the sample to test the hypothesis that the

BTRs have a greater effect on low-SES women. We also present results using a distance

measure of women’s access to a marriage license without a blood test requirement.

          Finally, we turn to estimating the effect of the laws on respondents’ reported

relationship status in the Current Population Survey from 1980 to 2006. This allows us to

examine the effect of BTRs on marriage in a fourth data set, and to also consider the

effects of BTRs on women below the poverty line. For comparability with the birth

certificate results, we restrict our sample mothers aged 19-24, for a sample of 45,531

women.



4. Results

12
     In states where the mothers are not asked the marriage questions directly, marital status

is imputed by the NCHS. In 1980, marital status is imputed for seven states; by 2006,

only two states (MI and NY) still impute marital status.
13
     The age restriction is imposed to avoid the effects of states’ minimum age laws

child well-being” (www. Okmarriage.org).



                                                                                            15
4.1 Effect of Laws on Marriage Licenses Issued

       We first estimate the effect of states’ BTRs on the number of marriage licenses

issued by the state. The results in Table 1 are based on data from CDC reports of state

marriage rates from 1980-2006—the same data that were used to create Figure 3. Results

Each coefficient in the table is the estimate of the effect of the presence of a BTR on the

number of marriage licenses issued per 1,000 state residents (β1 in equation (1)). We

report our results with and without state-specific time trends, and we exclude Hawaii and

Nevada from all specifications because of high marriage rates. We exclude California

from some specifications because of a policy that allowed residents to obtain confidential

marriage licenses that did not require a blood test. We find that including California

weakens the impact of the BTR, as would be expected if California’s BTR was not

binding. Therefore, we will drop California in all other results. We also find that the

inclusion of state-specific time trends can significantly affect the coefficients. Many

states were experiencing dramatic declines in marriage rates over this period, largely due

to social and cultural forces. If these changes coincided with the repeal of the BTRs, we

might erroneously attribute decreases in marriage rates to those repeals. As such, for the

remainder of the paper we focus on results with state-specific time trends.

       We find that for the 1980-2006 period, BTRs decrease marriage licenses issued

by 0.502 per 1,000 state residents in our preferred specification with state-specific time

trends and with California omitted. This corresponds to a 5.7% decrease in response to a

BTR. In the bottom two panels of Table 1, the sample is split at 1995 to examine the

effect of the laws in the earlier and later years of the time period. We choose 1995 as the

dividing point for comparability with results using license data in Tables 3 and 4 (in




                                                                                             16
Section 4.2). We see that the negative effect of BTRs on marriage licenses issued is

larger post-1995, where the coefficient -0.5568 reflects a 6.8% decrease in marriage

licenses issued. We might expect BTRs to have a larger effect in later years for several

reasons. The stigma of cohabiting may have lessened in the later period, so that couples

are more likely to decide to live together rather than marry in response to a BTR.

Decreases in travel costs may have made it easier to travel to another state to obtain a

license. Finally, as more states repeal their laws, couples have more options when

looking to marry in a state that does not require a test.

          As mentioned in the discussion of our empirical strategy, the above results are

biased if the presence of a BTR or the timing of a repeal is correlated with unobserved

state characteristics. While we cannot test this directly, we perform two exercises that

suggest that the repeals can be treated as exogenous. First, we estimate a probit model to

test whether observed characteristics impact the probability that a state repeals its BTR,

conditional on having not yet repealed.15 The estimated equation is as follows:

                       repeal st = θ 0 + θ1 X st −1 + θ 2 Z st −1 + θ 3 X st −1 * timet + υ st   (2)

where repealst is equal to one if state s repealed a BTR in year t and zero otherwise. Xst-1

is the one-year lagged state marriage rate (defined as above), and Xst-1 * timet is the state-

specific quadratic marriage rate trend. Zst-1 is a vector of one-year lagged state rates of

gonorrhea and syphilis; rates of gonorrhea and syphilis are from the CDC and are defined

as the number of reported instances per 100,000 people. The random error is νst. The

15
     The specification is similar to that in Goldin and Rouse (2000), who use a probit model

to determine whether observable characteristics predict that an orchestra will adopt a

blind audition format.



                                                                                                 17
sample begins in 1981 with all states with a BTR in place (excluding Hawaii and

California), and states exit the sample once a law is repealed. The results are presented in

Table 2. We find that these variables are not predictors of the repeal of a law—the

coefficients are neither statistically nor practically significant.

        As a second test, we reproduce the results in Table 1 while adding a placebo law

that is repealed two years before each state’s actual repeal. We would expect these

placebos to have an effect if states repealed their BTRs in response to changes in

marriage rates (so that there is reverse causality in Equation 1). These results are in

Appendix Table 7. We find that the placebo law is never statistically significant, and that

the effects of the BTRs are virtually unchanged.

        The results in this section show that states’ repeals of their BTRs were plausibly

exogenous, and that BTRs had a large and statistically significant effect on marriage

licenses issued by a state. Policy makers might be interested in this finding, since

marriage license fees are a source of revenue for state and local governments. However,

while these results are consistent with the hypothesis that BTRs actually deter marriage,

we cannot test this directly with this data. It is possible that the observed decrease in

licenses issued is driven by couples who are still getting married, but are just doing so in

another state. To study the effect of BTRs on the likelihood of marriage, we turn to

results using individual marriage license data.

4.2 Effect of Laws on Marriages to State Residents

        The results in Table 3 are based on state marriage rates constructed from

individual-level marriage license data. This data includes information on the bride and

groom’s state of residence, and as long as the couple marries in a reporting state, we




                                                                                             18
observe the marriage. This allows us to approximate the number of marriages per 1,000

state residents, as opposed to the number of marriage licenses issued by the state (as in

Table 1). The actual number of marriages observed will be an underestimate, since not

all states report individual-level license data. The fact that not all states report will only

bias our results if couples that choose to marry out of state in response to BTRs are more

likely to marry in non-reporting states than other couples who marry out of state.16 The

individual level data also allow us to examine marriage rates by racial group.

         First, when state marriage rates are constructed using the groom’s state of

residence, we see a decrease of 0.2500 marriages per 1,000 residents in response to BTRs,

or a 2.8% decrease in the marriage rate. Compare this to the result in column (4) of Table

1, which finds a 6.1% decrease in marriage licenses issued between 1980 and 1995.

Taking these two results together, it appears that about half of the decrease in licenses is

due to couples marrying out of state, while about half choose not to marry at all. Also,

we can compare this result to that of Alm and Whittington (1999), who consider the

effects of the marriage tax penalty. They find a 2.3% decrease in the probability that a

woman marries in response to a 10% rise in the penalty, where the mean marriage penalty

for women in their sample is $2,620. Considering that the dollar cost of a BTR can be as

high as $200 (and keeping in mind that many of the costs of a BTR are non-pecuniary),

our estimate of a 2.8% decrease in the marriage rate in response to a BTR is quite close to

that of Alm and Whittington.

         Though the results for blacks are imprecise, the point estimates for racial groups

suggest that the BTRs may be more of a deterrent to marriage for blacks than for whites.

16
     The non-reporting states are AZ, AR, NV, NM, ND, OK, TX, and WA.



                                                                                              19
The coefficient -0.3419 represents a 4.4% decrease in marriage rates for blacks, while the

effect for whites is a 3.3% decrease. When the sample is restricted to marriages where

the groom is under age 30, the effect of the laws is generally greater in magnitude. These

results suggest that BTRs do have more of an impact on lower-SES groups, who might

find the economic or other costs of the tests to be a greater deterrent. The results are

similar when state marriage rates are constructed using the bride’s state of residence. 17

          To further explore the issue of couples marrying in other states in response to a

BTR, we use data on state of residence and state of marriage to examine the laws’ impact

on couples’ likelihood of marrying in their state of residence or in an adjoining state.

These results are reported in Table 4. In Panel A, the dependent variable is constructed

by taking the total number of marriages to a state’s residents as the denominator, and the

number of those marriages that took place in the state as the numerator. We see that the

percent of couples marrying in the groom’s state of residence was 1.5% lower when the

groom’s state had a BTR in place. For grooms under 30, we also see lower in-state

marriage rates, though the coefficients are generally smaller. The fact that older grooms

are less likely to marry in-state in response to the requirements may be due to their ability

17
     Appendix Table 8 replicates the exercise in Table 3 but with a measure of distance

from the state population centroid to the nearest state line where a blood test can be

obtained without a license as the policy variable. Results are shown for the full

population using groom’s state of residence. While these results are less precise, they

suggest that residents with further to go to a no-requirement state are less likely to be

married. The coefficient for whites is -0.1158 (se=0.0519), indicating that a 100-mile

increase in this distance decreases the marriage rate for whites in the state by 1.21%.



                                                                                              20
to bear the costs of an out-of-state marriage. Results are very similar when the bride’s

state of residence is used.

          The results in Panel B show the effect of BTRs on couples’ likelihood of

marrying in an adjoining state. We see that the percent of couples marrying in an

adjoining state is 9.4% higher when a requirement is in place. The magnitude of the

coefficients in Panel B is slightly less than the corresponding coefficients in Panel A—

suggesting that when couples are driven out of state for their marriage licenses, most

marry in an adjoining state, while a few travel even further away. 18

          The estimates using the Vital Statistics Marriage License data show that BTRs

send residents out of state for marriage licenses and in some cases deter marriage

altogether. We now look to confirm the marriage-deterrent effect of BTRs using two

alternative data sets.

4.3 Effect of Laws on Marital Status of First-Time Moms

          Using the Vital Statistics Natality Detail data, we measure the effect of the laws

on the fraction of first-time mothers who are married. Data are collapsed to the state-year

level and results are reported in Table 5. First, consider the results in Panel A, for which

the specification is again as in Equation 1. For all mothers over 18, the coefficient for the

18
     Appendix Table 9 replicates the exercise in Table 4 using our distance measure as the

policy variable, for the full population using groom’s state of residence. Also, the sample

is restricted to states with a BTR in place. These results are imprecise, but accord with

intuition—among couples who did marry, when the distance to a state without a BTR

was greater, they were more likely to marry in-state and less likely to marry in an

adjoining state.



                                                                                               21
presence of a BTR in the year of the birth is negative, though not statistically significant.

However, for women of lower socioeconomic status, the effect is both statistically and

economically meaningful. BTRs decrease the likelihood of marriage by 2.8% for black

women, by 3.5% for women without a high school degree, and by 1.3% for women under

25. The effect for blacks is comparable to but slightly smaller than the 4.4% effect

observed using marriage license data (perhaps because the marriage decisions of new

mothers are less likely to be affected along this margin).19 Again, we find that the laws

have a greater effect on low-SES groups.

         In Panel B of Table 5, we consider an alternative measure of our policy variable.

The variable “distance” is the distance, in hundreds of miles, from the state’s population

centroid to the nearest state without a BTR. For state-years with a blood test requirement

for this period, the mean distance in miles is 111, the median is 95, and the range is 4 to

466. Arguably, a BTR in one’s home state should be less of a barrier to marriage if a

state without a BTR is nearby. While we have generated results for our other estimates

using this variable (see Appendix Tables), we believe the effect of distance may be

particularly important for pregnant women, for whom travel may be especially difficult.

         The results in Panel B confirm this. For all first-time mothers, a 100-mile

increase in the distance to a no-BTR state decreases the likelihood of being married by

0.23%. Again the effect is larger for blacks (-1.36%), for young women (-0.75%), and

for women without a high school degree (-3.53%).

4.4 Effect of Laws on Young Mothers in the CPS

19
     When studying the effects of EITC payments on marriage, Eissa and Hoynes (2000)

suggest that couples with children are less likely to be affected.



                                                                                              22
          Finally, we use a fourth data set to confirm the marriage-deterrent effect of BTRs.

The Current Population Survey from 1980 to 2006 contains information on marital status

and several other demographic measures, including poverty status (which was not

available in the birth certificate data). For comparability with the birth certificate results,

we limit the sample to young women with children. We use women who are age 19 to

24, since the birth certificate results suggest that these women are most likely to be

affected by a BTR.

          Table 6 shows the results from a linear probability model that controls for

race/ethnicity, age, and education. The results are imprecise, but again suggest that a

BTR reduces the likelihood that a young mother is married. The percent effects are quite

close to those for the birth certificate results, particularly for women without a high

school degree. The results for blacks are an exception; in the CPS we observe a much

larger percent effect of a BTR on the probability of marriage. The imprecision of these

results leads us to prefer the birth certificate estimates (which have 2000 times more

observations), but we take the CPS results as further evidence of a negative effect of

BTRs on marriage.20




20
     Results using distance as the policy variable are in Appendix Table 10. Again, greater

distance to a state without a BTR is associated with decreased rates of marriage, though

the effects are small and generally statistically insignificant. We have also produced

results for all women (not just mothers) using the CPS data; we find a small and

statistically insignificant negative effect of a BTR on marriage rates for women with low-

socioeconomic status.



                                                                                             23
5. Conclusion

       In this paper, we consider the effect of the repeal of states’ blood test

requirements for marriage licenses on marriage. We use a within-group estimator that

holds constant state and year effects and exploits the variation in the dates of BTRs

across states. We begin with panel data on state marriage rates between 1980 and 2006,

and show that blood test requirements decrease marriage licenses issued by a state by

5.7%. We also show that the repeals are not correlated with state marriage or STD rates,

or in trends in marriage rates, suggesting that we can treat the law repeals as exogenous

within our models. We then use individual-level marriage license data from 1981 to

1995 to confirm that for this period, about half of the decrease in licenses issued by the

states was due to couples going out of state for their licenses, while the rest was due to

couples deciding not to marry at all.   We also use birth certificate data and Current

Population Survey data to show that for young mothers, the likelihood of being married

was lower in states with a blood test requirement. This result is stronger for individuals

who are black, young, or without a high school degree.

       Policy makers who are interested in promoting marriage may find these results

useful when predicting the impact of policies that change the cost of marriage. While the

issue of blood tests themselves is no longer relevant in most cases (Missouri and D.C.

being exceptions), other policies that change the cost of marriage include required

premarital counseling, waiting periods, and license fees. For example, in 2008, Texas

initiated a “Twogether in Texas” program that requires premarital counseling to avoid a

waiting period and $60 fee for a marriage license (www.twogetherintexas.com). We

have shown that even small changes in the cost of marriage can have significant effects,




                                                                                             24
particularly for certain populations. This result might also generalize to policies such as

tax and transfer programs, where previous research has had difficulty in isolating the

disincentive effects of changing costs.

       These results may also be important for social scientists studying the effects of

marriage on other outcomes, including health, labor force participation, economic well-

being, and fertility. Establishing causality in this literature has been a significant

challenge, as researchers have had difficulty finding an appropriate instrumental variable

for marriage (Ribar 2004). One instrument that has been used is exogenous changes in

sex ratios produced by immigration waves (Angrist 2002) or male incarceration rates

(Charles and Luoh 2007). Also, a recent study by Dahl and Moretti (2008) uses child’s

gender to show that women pregnant with males are more likely to get married. However,

use of these instruments to estimate the causal impacts of marriage can be limited by the

somewhat narrowly defined treated population (e.g. immigrant populations in the early

20th century, pregnant women).

       Our results indicate that blood test requirements provide plausibly exogenous

within- and across-state variation in the cost of marriage, and thus might be used to

identify the causal effects of marriage. Because the tests were originally enacted in the

interest of public health but were repealed after they became obsolete, the effects of the

policy change should not directly affect other outcomes such as labor force participation,

earnings, or fertility. Further, the BTRs were repealed over a long and recent period in

U.S. history and potentially affect the entire population of couples considering marriage

in the affected states—though the fact that the laws have the greatest impact for low-SES

groups suggests that this strategy might be particularly helpful to researchers studying the




                                                                                             25
effects of marriage for these groups. Along this line, Buckles and Price (2009) use BTRs

as an instrument for marriage to study the effect of marriage on infant health for low-SES

women.

DATA APPENDIX

1. Information on state blood test requirements was obtained from state statute volumes.
A complete list of volumes used is available upon request. We supplemented our
research with searches of newspaper records using Lexis-Nexis. In order to be counted
as a repeal, we required that we find two separate articles referring to the repeal.

2. The distance variable used in Table 5 and Appendix Tables 8, 9, and 10 was
constructed using 2000 population centroids, from the United States Census Bureau:
http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt. We then used Google Maps to
estimate the driving distance from the centroid (given by latitude and longitude) to the
nearest state line without a BTR.

2. CDC-Reported Marriage Rates from 1975-2006 were obtained from the website of
the Center for Disease Control’s National Center for Health Statistics:
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/#.

In Figure 3, using this data, ten states are not included. Hawaii and Nevada are omitted
because of high marriage rates; California and Oklahoma are omitted for missing data;
Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, the District of Columbia, Mississippi, and Montana
are omitted because each still had a law in place as of 2002.

3. Marriage License Data from 1981-1995 are from the Vital Statistics Marriage and
Divorce Detail Files and are available at http://www.nber.org/data/marrdivo.html. States
that do not report marriage license data include Arizona, Arkansas, Nevada, New
Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, and Washington.

Marriage rates, including those by race, are created using population estimates from the
United States Census Bureau: http://www.census.gov/popest/states/. These population
estimates are also used when weighting the data by state population.

4. Birth Certificate Data (the Natality Detail Files) for 1980-2002 are from the Center for
Disease Control’s National Center for Health Statistics. They are available for download
at http://www.nber.org/data/vital-statistics-natality-data.html.

5. Current Population Survey data for 1980 to 2006 were obtained from IPUMS:
http://www.census.gov/cps/.

6. Gonorrhea and syphilis rates used in Table 1 and Figure 1 were constructed using
disease prevalence data from the Center for Disease Control (see references) and state
population data from the Census Bureau.

Source: CDC reports of state marriage rates, 1975-2005. The solid line is the average
marriage rate for 25 states that had a blood test requirement in place in 1980 but who
repealed the law by 2000. The data for each state is centered at the year the law was
repealed. The dotted line corresponds to the 16 states that did not have a blood test
requirement in 1980, where the mean marriage rate t years from repeal is calculated using
an average of marriage rates in years in which a law was repealed in another state,
following Ayers and Levitt (1998). Ten states are not included in the figure for reasons
addressed in the data appendix.

* Indicates significance at 10%; ** indicates significance at 5%. Each coefficient is from
a separate regression, where the coefficient is on a dummy indicating whether the state
had a blood test requirement in place for the entire year. Standard errors are clustered at
the state level and are in parenthesis. Observations are at the state-year level and data are
from CDC reports of state marriage rates, defined as the number of marriage licenses
issued per 1,000 people. Regressions are weighted by state population. Nevada and
Hawaii are dropped from all specifications because of high marriage rates (52.8 and 22.3
respectively in 2006). California is dropped from the second and fourth specifications
because of a policy that allowed residents to obtain confidential marriage licenses that did
not require a blood test.

reporting states, from 1981-1995. Regressions are weighted by population. For the
regressions done by race, states are also omitted if race is not reported on the license.
Maine is omitted in 1995 due to data errors. California is omitted because of a policy
that allowed residents to obtain confidential marriage licenses that did not require a
blood test. State-specific time trends are quadratic.

  Marriage License Records for reporting states, from 1981-1995. Regressions are weighted by population.
  For the regressions done by race, states are also omitted if race is not reported on the license. Maine is
  omitted in 1995 due to data errors. California is omitted because of a policy that allowed residents to
  obtain confidential marriage licenses that did not require a blood test. State-specific time trends are

are for the independent variable “distance”, which is the distance in hundreds of miles
from the state population centroid to the nearest state line where a blood test is not
required. Sample is constructed using groom’s state of residence, for all ages.
Additionally, Hawaii and Alaska are omitted because they do not border other states.
