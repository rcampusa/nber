                   Worker Knowledge of Pension Provisions




                                 ABSTRACT



     This paper evaluates the quality of workers' information regarding

pension offerings using both administrative records and worker reports
of pension provisions. Missing and misinformation proves to be

widespread. Unionized employees, higher income workers and those in
large firms, the better educated, and those with greater seniority are
better informed about their pensions. There are also demographic

differences: nonwhites have less pension knowledge than whites, but
women are better informed than men along several pension dimensions.

     Myopia about pension incentive structures is troubling since

workers may save or consume suboptimally, change jobs, or retire
earlier than they would have if equipped with better pension

information. The prevalence of missing data should also be troubling to

empirical pension analysts using data sets reporting workers'
assessments of pension provisions.

              Worker now1ede of Pension Provisions'
      This paper explores the topic of what workers know about their

company—sponsored pension plans, and the factors associated with

misinformation and/or missing information about pension features. The
issue is of interest for at least three reasons. First, private-sector

firms providing pensions are legally obliged to prepare and disburse

more than a dozen documents disclosing pension provisions,2 yet some

urge the mandating of yet additional plan documentation on grounds that

workers remain ignorant of their pension plan provisions. There is
little systematic evidence on this matter, or on whether lack of
knowledge is associated with firm—side or worker—side characteristics

making the information gaps more or less costly to correct. A second
reason the question is of interest is that policymakers are concerned

with the problem of economic hardship during retirement. If low wage,
uneducated or otherwise disadvantaged workers have undue difficulty in

obtaining pension information, they may make myopic and perhaps
suboptimal decisions regarding how much to save for retirement, or when
to change jobs and retire. Hence labor market disadvantage may be

translated into poverty during retirement. A third group interested in
the question of worker pension knowledge is labor economists. Recent

research posits that pensions spur productivity by tying workers to

firms (Mitchell, 1982), discouraging shirking (Lazear, 1979), and
ensuring optimal retirement flows (Lazear, 1983). Significant gaps in
worker knowledge of pension characteristics would cast doubt on these
roles for company—sponsored pensions.

     Previous studies have compared worker knowledge of non—pension job
characteristics with administrative data and discern some important

biases in worker knowledge, but pensions have not been the subject of

careful scrutiny despite their overwhelming importance in the
                                                                   2


compensation package.3      The objective of the present paper is to

determine how workers' understanding of their pension plans differs

from descriptions provided by firms, and the extent to which pension
misinformation (or lack of information) is systematically associated

with company and worker characteristics. Data are taken from the 1983

Survey of Consumer Finances which reports pension information gathered

from both workers and administrative records. Section I of the paper
describes the data set and response errors. Section II considers
systematic response errors when data are not missing, and then goes on

to examine the pattern of missing data. Section III offers concluding

remarks.

I. Procedures
     In a world of perfect and costless information, worker and company

reports regarding specific pension provisions would be identical.
However reports may diverge if providing and gathering pension
information is costly, and if costs vary systematically across people
and firms. Focusing first on workers, those who do invest effort will

probably be more accurate about their firm's pension offerings. It is
surmised that such investment will be greater, the more likely the

employee is to receive benefits and the greater he expects them to be

 [Ee(B)], and the more readily he can process often complex and

technical pension plan documents (a):

       [Worker Investment
        in Information] =    f   (   Ee(B), I) where f1, f2 >0.
      In the dataset to be described below, Ee(B) is proxied empirically

 by a worker's tenure which is expected to be positively associated with
 pension eligiblity, and with benefit levels at retirement (Mitchell and

 Luzadis, 1986). Unionized and higher income workers are also more

 likely to anticipate higher benefits (Allen and Clark, 1986). One
                                                                           3

 would expect that females and nonwhites would be relatively less well
 informed, since benefits are lower for these workers than for white

 male employees (Lazear and Rosen, 1987).
        The   term represents an information—processing efficiency factor,
 acknowledging that specialized legal, actuarial and benefit expertise
are often required to understand pension plan documents.4              Worker
efficiency of this type should be positively associated with four sets
of employee characteristics: education, income, whether production
employees are prevalent, and inion status. The first three should be

positively associated with general (versus specific) human capital;
union workers may benefit from scale economies in the production and
dissemination of pension information. Workers with more tenure will

presumably embody more firm—specific capital of use in understanding
their firm's pension provisions.

        An alternative explanation for erroneous or deficient worker
pension information is that firms may differ in the pension information
provided to workers. Such information is probably more plentiful when

the plan's expected benefits are relatively generous [Er(B)], and the
plan relatively inexpensive to operate ()
        [Firm Production
        of Information) =   g   (   Er(B),   j.t   ) where g>O, g>O.
Empirical evidence on plan generosity and cost parameters is difficult

to obtain. One possibility is that profitable firms are more likely to

provide better benefits (profitability is proxied below by return on
investment, ROl), and hence more accurate worker knowledge regarding

pension provisions. Scale economies in pension administrative costs,
as well as economies in providing pension information, suggest that
workers in         firms may be better informed (Mitchell and Andrews,
1981)
                                                                   4

     Combining the equations above into a model suitable for empirical
analysis produces the following reduced form equation:

     Prob. (Disagree)       h ( Ee(B), Er(B), ,   x ).
where the dependent variable "Disagree" is equal to one if employer and
employee answers regarding pension provisions are in conflict, and zero
otherwise. Two—way models of this type are estimated below using
maximum likelihood multinomial Logit. In addition, a three-way
extended model addresses the probability of observing missing data,

versus disagreement or agreement between workers and their firms.
Missing data arises when workers are unable to offer answers to

questions regarding their pension provisions.
     Data from the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finance (SCF) are employed
to assess employee misinformation and lack of information regarding

pension provisions. Created by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors
and the US Department of Health and Human Services, this dataset

consists of two parts (Avery et al. 1984a, b; Curtin, 1985) .    The first

component, the Respondent File, is a nationally representative survey
of 3,826 randomly selected households. This file contains information
collected by personal interview on each respondent's current employment

status and labor market history, socio—demographiC characteristics, and
other attributes (spouses, if any, were queried as well).     In addition,

individuals with work experience were questioned about their pension

coverage status. Those so covered were asked to identify the provider

of that plan ——   usually   their current employer -— and were surveyed

about that plan's key features. From this file is extracted a sample
of 750 private sector nonagricultural workers covered by an employer—

provided pension on their current job, of whom 637 individuals have

non-missing data on key explanatory variables. Missing values on
                                                                   5

dependent variables are not grounds for sample exclusion in the three-
way extended models as explained below.

     The second and unique component of the SCF data set is the Pension
File. This contains information from administrative records (Summary

Plan Descriptions, or SPDs) for each pension plan identified by covered

individuals in the Respondent file. Since the Employee Retirement

Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) specifies that this SPD is a
legally binding document, Pension File data are expected to accurately

depict pension plan features. The SCF Pension File is the source of
administrative information used in the present analysis. The Pension
File extract used here consisted of 551 different plans pertaining to
the 637 workers identified previously.

     The SCF dataset does not report information on firms' benefit

accrual data to compare with workers' assessments of likely retirement

benefits. Nevertheless, even if they were available, such data would
probably be useless. Worker reports about expected benefits will
incorporate a myriad of assumptions about future wage growth, seniority
and age at retirement, inflation, and mortality (among others). In
contrast, current law states that a firm's legal pension obligation

consists only of benefits owed to vested employees based on accrued
service and salary to date if the firm were to cease operation ("shut-
down liability") .   When the two sides compute benefits using

underlying assumptions which differ and are unknown to the researcher,
a comparison of benefit amounts is rendered virtually impossible.

      Of more interest are three sets of pension plan provisions highly

associated with workers' eventual pension claims. They are interesting
in their own right and also because they have been used as proxies for

pension benefits by other researchers.6 They are:   (1) pension plan
type; (2) pension plan contribution data; and (3) pension plan
                                                                 b

requirements for early and normal retirement. "Type" refers to whether
the pension is a defined contribution or a defined benefit plan. In

defined benefit (DB) plans, employers promise that benefits payable at
retirement will conform to a prespecified function of the worker's pay

and/or service. In contrast, companies offering a defined contribution

(DC) plan do not specify the retirement formula or payment; rather

they indicate yearly contributions on a worker's behalf, usually a

function of employee pay. "Contribution" provisions refer to whether
employees and employers contribute to the pension fund, and whether

contributions are linked to workers' pay. "Retirement requirements"

pertain to rules regarding benefit eligiblity and the age and/or
service requirements workers must satisfy in order to draw retirement

benefits. Means and standard deviations of pension provision variables

are reported in Table 1, as well as the pattern of missing observations

 (which arise when workers do not provide answers to pension provision

questions)
Plan Type
      Table 1 shows that most workers are quite well informed about what

type of plan they have (TYPE) :   employer and employee responses agree

 (are identical) almost 90% of the time.7 However, the agreement rate

on plan type differs among pension types (measured against company

 reports) :workers having a DB plan know that they do more often than

 employees covered by DC plans. Since most private sector covered

 employees have DE plans (Kotlikoff and Smith, 1983), some of those in

 DC plans may surmise their plan type from crude knowledge of pensions
 in the labor market as a whole.8 Interestingly, the missing data rate

 for this question also differs by type of plan: many fewer DC—covered
 workers know what type of plan they have as compared to DB-covered
 workers. Both findings suggest that workers in DC plans tend to be
                                                                   7

less well—informed about their pensions than are their counterparts in
DB plans.
Contribution Information

     Pension plan contributions derive from two sources: employee

payments and employer contributions. Employer contributions, and
earnings on these contributions, are not taxable to a plan participant

until retirement at which point the retiree is usually in a lower tax
bracket. Hence tax—deferral on employer contributions generates

significant tax savings to higher income workers. In contrast,
employee contributions are payable out of after—tax income. This
difference in tax treatment would lead one to expect that higher income
workers would be better informed regarding their own and their

employers' pension contributions.
     Worker reports differ considerably from company records regarding
both employee and employer pension contributions. When asked whether
workers themselves are required to contribute (ECONTREQ), a little over
half as many people respond in the affirmative as compared to

employers' files (disagreement is slightly higher in DC plans) .       This
high error rate is troubling since pension benefits have been

demonstrated to be higher in plans where employees contribute (Gustman
and Steinmeier, 1987). A high error rate on this variable hence

undermines the expected positive link between anticipated benefit

levels and accuracy of worker information. Missing data on this

question turns not to be widespread; most workers offer opinions about

whether they contribute directly to their pension plans, though many
are incorrect. Those who say they contribute prove relatively well
informed about the association between their contributions and pay

(ECONTPAY), with match rates in the high 90%ts.10 Greater accuracy

among contributing employees confirms practitioners' longstanding claim
                                                                   8


that   "sharing in the cost will increase the employees' awareness" of

the pension benefit (Beam and McFadden, 1985: p. 479)
                                             contributions are addressed
       Survey questions regarding employer
only to DC plan participants. Though over 90% of the companies report
making pension contributions, only half as many workers believe that
their employers contribute (RCONT). As with employee contributions,

most workers answer questions about the nature of employer

contributions though many are incorrect.11     Those who do know their

firms contribute are frequently in error about the basis for the
contribution (RCONTPAY). Only 3% of covered workers recognize that

employer contributions depend on employee pay, whereas in actuality
firms report that pay is used as a determinant of contributions almost

60% of the time. In addition to low match rates on this question
 (30%), another 16% of the workers do not answer the question at all.

The prevalence of missing data here calls into question the notion that
employees place a high value on the provision of DC pensions, and

further casts doubt on the productivity_enhancing role of such

pensions. That is, linking pension promises to employee performance
measures like pay will probably have little impact on productivity if
workers do not perceive this critical link.
 Requirements for early and normal retirement.
        Several questions are available to compare worker and firm views

 on retirement formulas among DB plan participants. Early and normal
 retirement provisions are summarized separately using eligibility

 variables and variables indicating the degree of agreement regarding

 retirement ages.

 Early retirerneflt
        All but a handful of pension plans state that early retirement is

 permitted, but only about three-quarters of the respondents believe
                                                                    9

 that they will be eligible to retire early (EARLYPOS) 12 These

 differences are not surprising given that particular workers may well

have insufficient seniority to retire early even when a plan permits
 some to leave early. However the fact that 17% of the respondents
cannot provide any answer to the early retirement eligibility question

suggests that worker information regarding early retirement rules is
far from complete. This degree of ignorance is especially disturbing
since a majority of workers now retires quite early; the average

retirement age is about age 63.5 for married men, and 62 for married
women (Fields and Mitchell, 1984; Pozzebon and Mitchell, 1987)

     Further evidence on knowledge of retirement rules is available for
the subset of workers who believe they will eventually be eligible for
early retirement.13     Eligibility is typically a function of a worker's
age, service, or age plus service; these functions are apparently so
complex that fully 39% of the respondents cannot answer the eligibility
question at all, and those who do respond can estimate early

eligibility requirements accurately only about one—third of the time
(EARLYREQ) .   Workers' assessments of their plan's early age are
similarly erroneous. About one-third of the workers do not venture any

guess regarding the plan's early retirement age, and about two—thirds
of those workers who offer answers to early retirement questions are
inaccurate (EARLYAGE)
Normal Retirement:

     One would expect that employee information on normal retirement

would be superior to early retirement data, since not all workers are

eligible to retire early but many will eventually qualify for normal
retirement benefits. This surmise is confirmed in the data: virtually
all workers can answer the normal retirement questions and the answers

are fairly accurate. Normal eligibility requirements (NORMREQ) and
                                                                   10

normal retirement ages (NORMAGE) are known by workers at least twice as
often as compared to the early retirement questions.      Despite the fact

that rules vary from one plan to the next regarding eligibility for and

the age of normal retirement, workers appear to have far better
information than they do for early retirement provisions.     This finding

is reassuring insofar as normal retirement provisions are the single

most important plan provision predicting benefit generosity (Gustman

and Steinmeier, 1987)

II. Mu].tivariate Ana1ysiS
     A multivariate Logit approach is used to judge whether

disagreement on pension type,   contribution   rules, and retirement

variables is systematic. Explanatory variables sketched above are drawn
from the SCF, which contains information on individual worker

responses, and industry-level averages, used to proxy key firm—level
variables because individual firms are not identified in the dataset.

The latter are merged with the micro datafile using 2— and 3-digit SIC

industry codes. An Appendix Table summarizes descriptive statistics for
all explanatory variables along with data sources and definitions.

Response Differences
        Table 2 reports estimated multinomnial Logit coefficients from a

model relating a vector of worker and firm-side characteristics to two—

 way (disagree/agree) outcomes. Here a positive coefficient indicates a

 higher probability of worker/plan disagreement regarding a pension
 provision, while a negative coefficient indicates a greater probability

 of agreement. Supplemental models are also estimated to determine
 whether whether vested workers or older workers are in possession of

 better pension information (complete results are not reported in full
 because of space constraints, but are available on request). Table 3

 extends the analysis to a three—way formulation which includes
                                                                   11

observations with missing data for the dependent variables where

missing data is widespread. Here two columns of results appear for
each dependent variable. n the first column, a positive (negative)
coefficient indicates the variable increases (decreases) the

probability of a missing data reports versus agreement between the
worker and the employer; and in the second column a positive (negative)

coefficient indicates a higher (lower) probability of disagreement

versus agreement. In addition both tables display Chi-square statistics

testing the hypothesis that a constant term summarizes the data as well
as the vector of coefficients appearing in the column directly above.

Pension Type (TYPE) : Many workers are wrong about their pension type

and many cannot answer the question at all. Nevertheless, few

explanatory variables are systematically associated with disagreement
error in the multivariate analysis.14 No firm—side factor is

statistically significant at conventional levels. The statistically
signficant findings for worker—side variables are consistent with

predictions: unionized employees are less likely to disagree with their

companies regarding type (Tables 2 & 3), a finding compatible with
scale economies; and workers with longer job tenure are less likely to

have missing data (Table 3) suggesting more investment among those
closer to retirement. There are also race differences: Table 3

indicates that nonwhites reveal less pension knowledge than do whites

with regard to pension type. Adding age and tenure interactions
(results not shown) confirms the strong effect unions have on this form

of pension knowledge, particularly among those nearest retirement, but
weakens the statistical significance of the race effect.

Pension Contributions: Tabulations above demonstrated that worker
information regarding contributions is not particularly accurate vis a
vis administrative records. Multivariate analysis of both employee
                                                                     12

contribution variables in Table 2 shows that the inaccuracy is

systematic with regard to firm size, and in the predicted direction.15

Employees in large firms are generally more knowledgeable both about
their own contributory status (ECONTREQ) and the links between their

contributions and their pay (ECONTPAY), perhaps because of scale
economies in the production of pension information. The data are not

completely in accord with predictions however; for instance, missing
data is more prevalent regarding ECONTPAY for union workers (Table 3),

which contradicts the scale economies view just enunciated.16 Another
surprising outcome is the result that women are more likely, rather

than less likely, to know about how employee pension contributions are
determined ——    contrary   to the notion that those expecting less will

invest less in pension information (see Tables 2 & 3; this finding is
also especially robust to the inclusion of age and tenure

interactions.)
     While few worker and firm—side variables explain disagreement

patterns on employee's required pension contributions, the evidence is

even weaker for questions regarding employer contributions (RCONT,
RCONTPAY). Employees' views are quite inaccurate, but the errors are
apparently not systematically associated with any of the variables

included in the empirical analysis (including age and seniority
interactions); this is confirmed by the small Chi—square values.

Separate analysis on missing data is precluded by small sample sizes.

Retirement Requirements:
Early retirement (EARLYPOS, EARLYAGE): Response accuracy on early
retirement questions is strongly linked to several worker—side and
afew firm—side variables. Educated workers tend to know whether their

plan has an early retirement option (Table 2), while education and
tenure improve worker accuracy in estimating a plan's early retirement
                                                                    13
 age and further reduce the likelihood that a worker cannot offer any

 opinion regarding early retirement provisions (Tables 2 & 3). Both
 sets of findings support the view that those who have more to gain will
 be more likely to invest in the information.   However Table 3 also
 indicates that educated and senior workers are more rather than less

 likely to have missing data when it comes to knowledge of early

 retirement requirements, and this perverse education effect is robust
 to the inclusion of age and tenure interactions. it appears as though
this group focuses merely on the age requirements for early retirement

because they have already fulfilled the plan's seniority conditions,
which explains why they know the age provision but do not know the

combination of age plus service. Reporting patterns differ across sex
and race in the ways discerned previously: women are better informed

regarding whether early retirement is possible, but nonwhites are less
well informed about early retirement provisions. Models allowing

interactive terms for age and seniority show that there are fewer
systematic error patterns among older and more senior workers, as
compared to younger ones. Low income turns out to be a predictor of
missing data for both the early retirement age and for early retirement
requirements.   In general, the findings support the hypothesis that
employees more likely to receive benefits do invest more in pension
information, at least insofar as early retirement benefits are
concerned.

      Only one firm—side variable, ROl, is a significant predictor of
one outcome, EARLYPOS, in both the two- and three—way models. This

implies, consistent with predictions, that profitable firms offer

better information regarding the possibility of early retirement,
insofar as their workers are less likely to have missing answers to

pension questions and the answers offered are on target more often.
                                                                 14

Patterns for other firm-side variables are less clearcut in all the

models examined.
Normal Retirement (NORMREQ, NORAGE): Virtually all SCF workers are
able to provide accurate answers to the normal retirement questions

making it unnecessary to analyze missing data patterns. Worker/firm
disagreement over normal retirement provisions is not very systematic.

With regard to both NORMAGE and NORMREQ, family income is the only
significant worker—side variable and not in the anticipated direction:

higher income workers are less rather than more accurate. It may be

that they report their own anticipated retirement ages rather than the

plan's normal retirement age, though why this would be more prevalent
for upper income workers is not clear. The sole firm—side factor which

enters significantly, ROl, is associated with more agreement regarding
normal retirement ages, as anticipated. These patterns do alter when

age and seniority interactions are controlled. As a whole, then,
misinformation regarding normal retirement provisions is both less

prevalent and less systematic than for early retirement provisions

 studied.17

 iii.     Discussion and ConclusiOnS
        Comparing administrative records with worker knowledge of pension

 provisions yields some informative insights regarding worker knowledge
                                                    misinformation and
 of their pension plan provisions. First, pension
 missing information are quite widespread, with information deficiencies

 being the most severe for provisions relating to the requirements for

 early retirement. Specifically, about one—third of workers queried
 cannot answer questions about early retirement requirements at all, and
 about two-thirds of those workers who offer answers to early retirement

 questions are wrong. This is disturbing in light of the widespread

 popularity of early retirement. Workers' answers are more accurate for
                                                                    15
 questions   about normal eligibility and retirement ages. Since benefit
 levels are closely tied to normal retirement provisions, it is

 reassuring to observe better information about these provisions.

      Having pointed out where workers are informed, the question
 remains as to what is associated with good information.
                                                           Generally
 speaking, good information appears more prevalent among unionized

 employees, workers in large firms, the better educated, the higher
income, and those with greater seniority. These findings support the
hypotheses that information is more accurate when benefits are expected

to be more generous, and when there are technical efficiencies in

producing and processing pension information. There are also some
surprising demographic differences: nonwhites reveal less pension
knowledge than do whites with regard to pension type and early
retirement provisions, but women appear better informed along several
pension dimensions.

     These findings clearly show that regulations currently on the
books have not resolved the problem of worker ignorance regarding key

pension plan features. More research is needed on the best and least—

cost mechanisms of generating more pension information, but it seems
clear that better pension data would, to some degree, benefit less

advantaged workers.18 A related point is that policymakers are
concerned with the problem of economic hardship during retirement.       Low
wage, nonunion workers in small firms apparently find it difficult to

obtain and process pension information, and hence will also be more

likely to make myopic and perhaps suboptimal decisions regarding when
to change jobs or retire, or how much to save for retirement. This may

be one method by which disadvantage during the worklife tends to carry
over to the retirement period.
                                                                   16

     Finally,   the results are relevant for pension researchers. On the

one hand it is reassuring to find that workers most likely to receive
pensions are, in fact, most aware of key plan provisions.   After all,

pension plans are costly to maintain and would presumably not be
offered (in the private sector at least) unless some subset of workers

perceived them as providing valuable benefits. On the other hand, data
sets which report workers' assessments of pension provisions contain a

great deal of error and some serious understatements regarding
contributions and retirement eligibility. Consequently researchers
using worker—side reports of benefit provisions will underestimate the

generosity of pension plans covering these workers, and overstate the
degree of eventual retirement income inequality.   Measurement error

also appears to be correlated with variables commonly included in

economic models involving pensions (e.g. unions, firmsize), so that
studies relying on worker—side provision information will generate
biased coefficient estimates.19 In addition, it should be recognized

that employee misperception of pension incentive structures may induce
workers to save (or consume) suboptimally, change jobs, or retire
earlier or later, than they would have done had they been equipped with

better pension information.20 Further research on how pension

 expectations are formed may help explain why worker behavior frequently
 deviates from fully optimal labor market and savings paths.

2 Allen, Melone and Rosenbloom (1984) describe pension reporting

requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)

of 1974.
3 Mellow and Sider (1983) compare firm and worker reports of wages,

hours worked, union status, industry and occupation. Duncan & Hill

(1985) mention pension coverage in passing but concentrate in their
study on comparisons between employee and firm—side reports of
earnings, unemployment and job tenure. Bernheim (1987b) examines the
association between anticipated and actual Social Security benefits but

does not evaluate company—provided pensions. Gustman and Steinmeier
(1987) refer to differences between worker and company reports of

pension provisions but do not investigate whether these discrepancies

are systematic.
  Pension plan documents which must legally be made available to plan

participants under the law, they are often difficult to obtain and even
more difficult to understand (MG Associates, 1982)

  Ippolito (1986) and Kotlikoff and Wise (1984) theorize that workers

trade off wages for expected retirement benefits rather than shut—down
liabilities. Mitchell and Pozzebon (1987) survey and extend the recent

literature on wage/pension tradeoff.
                                                                         21

     For example, pension type and contributory status are used by
Ippolito (1986) as proxies for benefit levels in a wage—pension

tradeoff equation. Normal and early retirement ages and pension
contributory status are used by Ehrenberg (1980) in a similar context.
     The SCF Respondent File terminology in this instance differs slightly
from that used to code administrative records in the Pension File.

Workers with pensions were asked whether they have a "money

accumulation plan" (which most would probably take to mean a DC plan),

or a "plan based on service" (which most would probably equate with a
DB plan), or, in a few cases, a third option —-      "both".   Initial

examination of the "both" category indicated that these are probably DB
plans, and they are coded as DE's in the analysis below. In contrast,
the Pension File indicates whether a pension's documents were those of

a DC plan, a DB plan, or whether both kinds of documents were forwarded

to the surveyors. Preliminary analysis of the "both" group in this
case suggested that these are firms offering both a primary DB plan

with a secondary DC plan (probably benefiting primarily high—wage
workers) .   In   the few cases where a firm reported offering plans with

both a DB and a DC component, these were combined with the DB plans

since their DC components appeared to have been later, and minor,

additions. Therefore for the purpose of the plan "type" analysis,
plans with two documents are coded as DB.

8 Various measures of association are available (Goodman and Kruskal,

1979) .   A referee suggested using the following measure:
 £     log {prob(yes,yes)prob(no,no)/prob(yes,no)prob(no,yes)},
which takes account of the fact that the ease of finding matching

answers depends on the simple probabilities. The value of £ ranges

from plus to minus infinity, with independence indicated by a value of
zero. For TYPE, £ = +2.47, indicating that errors are not independent;
                                                                   22

workers exaggerate the probability of being in a DB plan relative to

employers' reports of DB coverage. Systematic error patterns are
examined in more depth in the next section.

 The value of £ is +1.26 for ECONTREQ (see note 8), indicating that

errors are not independent: many more workers believed they were not
required to contribute than actually was the case.

10 In 2—3% of the cases, pension documents did not indicate whether or

not employee contributions were proportionate to pay. This is the only
case where administrative records contain missing data.

11 Though other factors are not held constant, the errors do not appear

systematic since £ =   0.1 (where 0 implies independence; see note 8)
12 Here £ =   +1.46 implying that errors are not independent; workers'
answers are more often negative than are employers'.

13 In some cases plans have more than one set of early retirement

requirements or ages. A worker's answer to the early retirement
question was judged a "match" if his answer agreed with any of the

formulas given in his pension plan document. A similar approach was
followed for the normal retirement variables. This method provides a

conservative estimate of the degree of worker inaccuracy regarding

pension provisions; greater inaccuracy results from narrower
definitions of retirement eligibility rules.
14 Though many individual coefficients are not statistically

significant, at the 10% significance level the Chi—square statistic on
TYPE in Table 2 implies rejection of the null hypothesis that the
entire vector of coefficients except for the constant term is equal to

zero. On the other had the null cannot be rejected for the TYPE
equation in Table 3.
                                                                  23
15
     Chi—square values for the ECONTREQ and ECONTPAY models in both

Tables imply rejection of the null hupothesis that all coefficients but
the constant term are zero at least at the 10% level.

16 There are too few missing observations for ECONTREQ to analyze this

dependent variable in a three—way model.

17 Chi—square values for all but one of the normal and early retirement

variables imply rejection of the null hupothesis that all coefficients
but the constant term are zero at least at the 10% level; the exception
is EARLYREQ in Table 2 alone.

18Obviously it is necessary to assess whether increases in labor costs

as a result of providing additional pension information would be offset
by lost jobs or other benefits. This task is beyond the scope of the
present paper.
19 Examples of studies using worker—side assessments of pension

variables include Mellow (1981) and Clark and McDermed (1986)

20This may explain why, for example, Fields and Mitchell (1984) find

that economic factors explain only about a quarter of the variance in

retirement behavior, and why Bernheim (l987a) reports that the economic

life cycle savings hypothesis is found to be only partly borne out by
savings data.
