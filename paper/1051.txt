      Do Asset—Demand Functions Optimize Over the Mean and Variance
                  of Real Returns? A Six—Currency Test

                              ABSTRACT


     International asset demands are functions of expected returns.

Optimal portfolio theory tells us that the coefficients in this relation-

ship depend on the variance—covariance matrix of real returns.   But

previous estimates of the optimal portfolio (1) assume expected returns

constant and (2) are not set up to test the hypothesis of mean—variance

optimization. We use maximum likelihood estimation to impose a constraint

between the coefficients and the error variance—covariance matri::. For a

portfolio of six currencies, we are able statistically to reject the con-

straint. Evidently investors are either not sophisticated enough to

maximize a function of the mean and variance of end—of—period wealth, or

else are too sophisticated to do so.

       Much progress has been made lately in the application of finance

theory to the problem of developing international asset—demand functions

that are useful in macroeconomics. Investors balance their portfolios

among the assets of various countries as a function of the expected

rates of return. The contribution of finance theory is to show what the

parameters in these functions are. Under the assumption that investors

optimize with respect to the mean and variance of end—of—period wealth,

the parameters are seen to depend in a simple way on the variance—

covariance matrix of returns and on the degree of risk aversion.1

       We believe it is fair to say that the empirical literature in

this area has lagged behind the theoretical literature. Solnik (1977,

p. 511) concludes, "international asset pricing seems to be a very

fruitful area for theoretical research, not empirical." A number of

studies have taken the techniques for estimating the Capital Asset Pric-

ing Model (CAPM) that have been developed for other financial markets

and have extended them to foreign currencies.2 But, as noted by Dumas

(1982), few of these studies are set up as explicit tests of the hypoth-

esis that actual asset—demand functions are in fact of the mean—variance

optimizing form. Indeed, many of the studies would not hold up under

such testing. Kouri and de Macedo (1978, p. 129), for example, find

that the optimal portfolio would assign negative shares to assets denom-

inated in French francs and yen; yet we know that there are positive net

supplies of these assets held in the world market (the cumulated




                                  —1—
                                   —2—



government debts of France and Japan, corrected for foreign exchange in-

tervention).

       By making use of data on net asset supplies, the present paper is

able to test explicitly thehypothesis that asset—demand functions are

of the mean—variance optimizing form.

       Another problem with most previous empirical finance studies is

that they make the assumption that the expected returns perceived by in-

vestors are constant over time.3 This assumption is made, often implic-

itly, in order to be able to estimate the expected returns from the un-

conditional ex post sample mean. In the case of the variances and

covariances, the stationarity assumption is appropriate. It is neces-

sary if the parameters of the asset—demand functions are to be consid-

ered unchanging over time. But in the case of the expected returns, the

stationarity assumption is not appropriate for a macro model. It would

imply that the arguments of the asset—demand functions, as opposed to

the parameters of the functions, are constant over time. It is an es-

sential element of most macro models that expected returns be allowed to

vary. This problem with the previous studies is related to the fact

that they make no use of asset supply data: fluctuations in asset sup-

plies (the values of the functions) are what allows fluctuations in the

rates of return (the arguments).

       In the present paper the rates of return are related to the asset

supplies by an equation in which the error term is identified as the

market's expectational error.4 The hypothesis that the functions are

optimizing can be implemented by imposing the constraint that the
                                  —3—



coefficient matrix is proportionate to the variance—covariance matrix of

the error term, and estimating by maximum likelihood (MLE). If the op-

timizing hypothesis were true, the constrained MLE estimates would be

the most efficient estimates of the parameters. Moreover, one can test

the hypothesis by comparing the likelihood when the parameters are esti-

mated subject to this constraint to the likelihood when they are esti—

mated unconstrained. Our finding is that a likelihood ratio test

rejects the constraint of mean—variance optimization. This evidence

suggests that market agents are either not sophisticated enough to rnaxi—

mize their end—of—period wealth with regard to mean and variance, or

else perhaps are more sophisticated than this, maximizing instead a more

complicated intertemporal function.

       This paper continues past work by the authors. There are two

important new features. First, we extend the test of mean—variance

optimization to a portfolio of six nominal assets: marks, pounds, yen,

French francs, Canadian dollars, and U.S. dollars. Dumas (1982, p. 5)

and many other authors, have emphasized the importance of looking at "a

reasonably complete list of individual assets available across the

world." Of course it would be desirable to include equities and all

other assets, but data difficulties inevitably put a limit on the number

of assets we can consider.

       Second, we use price data to measure real returns explicitly,

thus allowing for inflation risk, rather than treating the exchange rate

as the only stochastic variable.5 As Kourl and de Macedo (1978, p. 118)

have emphasized, "rational lenders and borrowers are presumably
                                        —4—




concerned   with the real values of their assets and liabilities, and

hence the purchasing power of a currency over goods and services avail-

able in the world economy is the appropriate standard of its value."

The price for allowing stochastic inflation rates is that we are not

able to allow consumption preferences to differ among investors residing

in different countries. We assume, rather, that all investors have the

same preferences and thus can be aggregated together.6

         Section 2 of this paper shows how asset—demand functions can be

estimated, without imposing the constraint of mean—variance optimiza-

tion. Section 3 derives theoretically the optimizing form of the func-

tions. Section 4 estimates the asset—demand functions subject to the

constraint that they are indeed of this form, and does the likelihood

ratio test. Section 5 draws conclusions. Details of the data calcula-

tions are available in an appendix to Frankel (1982b).



            2.   ESTIMATION OF UNCONSTRAINED ASSET—DEMAND FUNCTIONS


          In this paper we assume that investors allocate their portfolio
among    assets denominated in six currencies. We define a column vector
of   five portfolio shares:

                                 r DM
                            x =- Lx
                             t        tt t t t
                                        x£ x xF xC$

                                                             —
The residual is the share allocated to U.S. dollars: (1          xl),
 where       is a column vector of five ones. The asset—demand function

 gives us the demands as a function of the expected rates of return on
                                       —5—



 the assets relative to the numeraire asset, the dollar:


                         x = a   +   SEr+1 — lEr+1),                          (1)


 where Er+1 is the expected real return on dollar assets, Er+i is a

 column vector of the expected real returns on the other five assets,           S

 is a matrix of coefficients, and a is a vector of intercepts. We will

 show in the next section that the linear form (1) is correct if agents

are mean—variance optimizing. But the important point is that at this

stage we are not constraining the parameters in a and          S   to be any-

thing in particular. They could be based on investors' arbitrary

"tastes" for assets as easily as on mean—variance optimization. Of

course we have already restricted the function somewhat; for example

many macroeconomic models include real income levels, representing a

transactions demand for the assets.

         In the past, the stumbling block in econometric estimation of

portfolio—balance equations has been the measurement of expected re-

turns. The solutIon adopted here is to invert equation (1), so that

expected returns are viewed as depending on asset supplIes:


                     Er+1 - lErS1 =     - 51a    +
                                                     51x.                    (2)


To deal with the unobservability of expectations, we make the assumption

that investors form them rationally. The ex post relative return

(r+i —   lr+1),   which is observable, is assumed equal to the expected

return plus a random error term              By "random," we mean uncorre—

lated with all information available at the beginning of the period over
                                         —6—



which the return is measured:


        r+1 —    r+1 = Er+i         Er+1 +                 E(c+iJI) = 0.    (3)


Substituting (2) into (3),


                   r+1 —
                              $
                             lr+1
                                    =   ——la   ÷
                                                   —1
                                                     x +                   (4)


The parameters of equation (4) can now be estimated by regression. The

regression error is simply the expectational error                which we know

to be uncorrelated with the right—hand—side variables by the assumption

of rational expectations.7

       Table 1 reports regressions of the system of equations (4). The

low R2s are not in themselves a problem; there is widespread agreement

that the market is able to forecast no more than a small proportion of

the changes in exchange rates.8 But the high sums of squared residuals

extend to high standard errors of the parameter estimates. Only one or

two in each equation are s1gnficantly different from zero. Of those,

the two diagonal elements, which are the only ones on which we have a

priori information, are of the incorrect sign: an increase in the sup-

ply of Canadian dollars or marks appears to induce a decline, rather

than an increase, in the expected future returns on those two assets.

On the other hand, we are able to reject with a likelihood ratio test

the constraint that all coefficients are zero. The log likelihood for

the five unconstrained equations taken together is 1086.49, whereas the

constrained log likelihood is only 1057.11. (Twice the difference is

distributed x2    with   25 degrees of freedom.)

        One assumption that we have already made is borne out. The ab-

sence of serial correlation in the error term supports the hypothesis of

rational expectations.

        The main lesson to be drawn from table 1 is the low degree of

precision that plagues estimation of general portfolio—balance equa-

tions, and the need to bring additional information to bear. This pro-

vides the motivation for considering the constraints placed on the

parameters by the hypothesis, developed in the following section, that

they are derived from mean—variance optimization by investors, If one

believes this hypothesis, then the resulting estimates will be more pre-

cise.



               3. DERIVATION OF ASSET-DEMAND FUNCTIONS FROM
                         MEAN—VARIANCE OPTIMIZATION


         In this section we derive the     correct form for the asset—demands

of   an investor who maximizes a function of the mean    and variance of his

end—of—period real wealth.9 The reader familiar with Kouri (1977) or

Dornbusch (1982), or with the general approach, which is standard in the

CAPM literature, is urged to skip to the next section.

         Let      be real wealth. The investor must choose the vector of

portfolio shares x that he wishes to allocate to the various assets.

End—of—period real wealth will be given by:


                               +
                         =
                                   W   x r+1 + Wt(l_xl)r+i
                         =
                             W[x z1 + 1 + r+1],
                                             —9-.




where we have defined the vector of returns on the five assets relative

to the dollar: z+1E r+i —

         The expected value and variance of end—of—period wealth (5), con-

ditional on current information, are as follows:



                                     Ez+1 ÷ 1 + Er+i]
               EW+l =   W[x'

              vw÷1 =    w[x'         c2x + Vr÷1 + 2x' Cov(z+i, r+1)],


where we have defined the variance—covariance matrix of relative re-

turns:


                    2 —      Ez t+i   — Ez
                                             t+1
                                                   Iz t+l   — Ez
                                                                   t+l

         The hypothesis is that investors maximize a function of the ex-

pected value and variance:


                                     .2. vw .21.
                                FEW ti_i.

                               = Cov(z1, r+i) + Pc2x.


        This expression for the expected relative return is analogous to

the unconstrained system (2), which was estimated in the previous sec-

tion, with          pQ and          = p   Cov(z+1, r+i). For economic in-

tuition, we invert (6) to solve for the portfolio shares, the form anal-

ogous to (1):


                     =   l—l   Cov(zt÷1, r+i) + (pc2)1Ez+1.

The asset demands consist of two parts. The first term represents the

'minimum—variaflCe" portfolio. If an investor is extremely risk—averse

(p =   ), the   investor will hold the minimum—variance portfolio. For

example, suppose he views the dollar as a safe asset, which requires not

only that he consume only U.S. goods but also that U.S. prices are non—

stochastic when expressed in terms of dollars. Then his minimum—

variance portfolio is zero in each of the other five assets. The second

term represents the "speculative" portfolio. A higher expected return

on a given asset induces investors to hold more of that asset than is in

the minimum—variance portfolio, to an extent limited only by the degree

of risk—aversion and the uncertainty of the return.



             4. ESTIMATION OF ASSET—DEMAND FUNCTIONS CONSTRAINED
                               TO BE OPTIMIZING


        In this section we estimate the system (4) subject to the con-

straint that we found in the last section to be an implication of
                                      —11—



mean—variance optimization:11' 12 1 =        p.   The key insight is that

   is precisely the variance—covariance matrix of the error term:

    E€;lc'. Imposition of a constraint between coefficients and

variances, as opposed to a constraint among coefficients, is unusual in

econometrics, and requires maximum likelihood estimation.'3 The Appen-

dix derives the first—order conditions for the maximization of the like-

lihood function and describes the program used.

          If the aim, under the a priori constraint of mean—variaace opti-

mization, is to use the information to get the most efficient possible

estimates of the parameters, then one might wish to impose not only the

constraint that the coefficient matrix is proportional to the variance—

covariance matrix 1, but to impose as well an a priori value for the

constant of proportionality, which is the constant of relative risk

aversion p. Dc Macedo (1980) and Krugman (1981) refer to the "Samuel—

son presumption" that p =     2.0.   Table 2 reports the estimated param-

eters for the case p =     2.0.   The results look quite different from

those in table 1. If one believes in the constraints, then the differ-

ence is simply the result of more efficient estimates. One would have

to invert the coefficient matrix in order to recover the original 8

matrix and see which assets are close substitutes for which other

assets.

          But we have chosen in this paper to emphasize the use of our

technique to test the hypothesis of mean—variance optimization, rather

than the use of the technique to impose the hypothesis. The log like-

lihood for the estimates in table 2 is 1057.05, a decrease from the un-

constrained log likelihood 1086.49. In other words, the fit has

worsened. Twice the difference is 59.0, which is above the 5 percent

critical level of 37.7. This constitutes a clear rejection of the

optimization hypothesis.

       Perhaps 2.0 is not the correct value for the constant of risk—

aversion p. We used the MLE program to find simultaneously the values

of p and 2 that maximize the likelihood. The log likelihood at this

point is 1057.96. (The MLE estimate of p is —67.0!)      The value of

p makes almost no difference; we are still able to reject the hypothe-

sis easily.



                            5. C0NCLUS10S


       The theory of expected utility maximization, and in particular

the simple framework of mean—variance optimization, is a very attractisle

way to bring more structure to the problem of asset—demand functions.

The reader who is a priori inclined to accept that framework can view

the numbers reported in table 2 as efficient estImates of the parameters

in an international asset—demand function. The estimates are efficient

because they use the information that, if investors are indeed optimiz-

ing, the coefficient matrix should be proportional to the error

variance—covariance matrix. At the same time, the estimates can be

argued to be superior to those in'previous studies of the optimal port-

folio because they use data on asset supplies and thus allow expected

real returns to change from period to period.

       However the primary aim of this paper is to test explicitly the

validity of the hypothesis of mean—variance optimization. The
                                        —14—



likelihood ratio test rejects the constraints imposed by the hypothesis.

Thus, if we are to believe these results, the unconstrained parameter

estimates reported in table 1, as imprecise as they are, are the best we

can do.

             How could investors fail to optimize with respect to the mean and

variance of their real wealth? It is possible that they are simply not

sophisticated enough. The literature on equity markets, for example,

cannot be said to have found good empirical evidence for the CAPM theo-

ry.14 Of course it is possible that agents are rational, but are opti-

mizing subject to constraints such as imperfect capital markets. A cor-

poration may use as its measure of risk the variance of its own dollar

profits, as opposed to the covariance with the market portfolio that the

finance theory says It should use; and yet this may be rational if the

corporation finances its projects internally and has to pay a penalty

whenever an unexpected fall in earnings forces it to borrow external-

ly. The same could be true of an Indlvidual)5

             On the other hand, investors nay be too sophisticated to optimize

(merely) with respect to the mean and variance of their real end—of—

period wealth. Stulz (1981), Hodrick (1981), and Hansen and 1-lodrick

(1982) argue that investors maximize a more complicated intertetnporal

utility function. Unfortunately their theoretical results are not as

conducive to empirical testing as is the one—period mean—variance frame—

work.

             The theory tested in this paper is one commonly discussed in the

literature. The theory requires many assumptions: one—period expected
                                  —15—



utility maximization, a normal distribution for underlying returns, a

constant variance—covarjance matrix, constant relative risk—aversion,

homogenous investors, rational expectations, asset supplies that are

properly measured from variables like government debt and foreign

exchange interventLon, and perfect capital markets. The failure of any

one of these assumptions would explain the test result, the rejection of

the theory.

        The parameters of the model were estimated by a maximum likeli-

hood routine based on Berndt, Hall, Hall and Hausman's (1974) maximizing

algorithm for nonlinear models. The program makes use of the likelihood

function, and its first derivatives. The log of the likelihood, under

the normality assumption, is

and C is the number of equations (five) and T is the number of

observations (eighty—seven).

        In standard econometric problems the symmetry of the variance

covariance matrix           can safely be ignored in deriving the first—order

conditions, because the               element and the th element of 2 enter

the likelihood function symmetrically. In our problem, this is not true

because of the restriction that c be proportional to the coefficient

matrix, so care must be taken to properly allow for the symmetry.

First, we derive aL/32         for    an arbitrary (nonsymmetric) .

          :LThe field was pioneered by Kouri (1976, 1977), Solnik (1973),

and Grauer, Litzenberger, and Stehie (1976). The results have recently

been reformulated in a manner simple enough for direct use in macroeco-

nomic models by Dornbusch (1982), with an amendment by Krugman (1981).

Other recent contributions include Adler and Dumas (1976, 1981), Frankel

(1979), Faina and Farber (1979), Garman and Kohihagen (1980), Stulz

(1981), and Hodrick (1981).

          2Examples are Roll and Solnik (1977), Cornell and Dietrich

(1978), Kouri and de Macedo (1978), de Macedo (1980), and Dornbusch

(1980).

          3Two recent studies of the optimal portfolio, von Furstenberg

(1981) and de Macedo, Goldstein, and Meerschwain (1982), do allow ex-

pected returns to vary over time, but only gradually: they are esti-

mated from the time series of actual returns as in the technique of

"rolling regressions." The present study allows expected returns to

change from period to period, for example in response to new information

not contained in the past time series of the returns themselves or even

of other obvious macroeconomic variables.

          4Examples of studies that attempt to relate returns to asset

supplies without imposing all constraints of mean—variance optimization

are Dooley and Isard (1979), Frankel (1982a), and Kasliwal (1982). The

last does impose symmetry on the coefficient matrix.

         5Frankel (1981) and Frankel (1982b) treat only the exchange rates

as stochastic. The former paper differs further from the present one by

restricting the assets to two: marks and dollars. The latter paper

differs from the present one by imposing the optimization hypothesis,

and thus obtaining more efficient estimates of the parameters, rather

than testing the hypothesis. Among previous studies of the optimal

portfolio, Kouri and de Macedo (1978), de Macedo (1980), and de Macedo,

Goldstein, and Meerschwam (1982) have allowed for stochastic price

levels. Among joint tests of market efficiency and risk—neutrality,

Frenkel and Razln (1980) and Engel (1982) have allowed for stochastic

price levels.

         6Among theoretical models, some like Grauer, Litzenberger, and

Stehie (1976), Fama and Farber (1979), and Frankel (1979), assume that

all investors consume a common basket of goods; others like Solnik

(1973) assume that investors of each country consume only their own

goods while still others like Kouri (1976) and Dornbusch (1982) allow

investors of each country to consume baskets that include foreign goods

but that are more heavily weighted toward their own goods. The last

framework is adopted in Frankel (1981, 1982b). Since data on asset sup-

plies are available only In aggregate form, not broken down by holder,

differing asset—demand functions have to be aggregated before they can

be estimated. When all investors share the same source of uncertainty,

the exchange rate, this can be done, using data on the distribution of

wealth, as In those two papers. When prices of national goods are sto-

chastic as well, as in the present paper, the aggregation is not pos-

sible.
                                    —20—



       7The validity of the technique depends on the assumption that the

asset—demand function (1) holds exactly and that asset supplies are cor-

rectly measured. As always, omitted variables or measurement errors

would render the estimates biased and Inconsistent. These consider-

ations justify, at a minimum, special care In the calculation of the

asset supply variables, described in the data appendix available in

Frankel (1982b). Very briefly, the net supply of assets denominated in

a country's currency is calculated as the cumulation of that country's

government debt, corrected for three factors: (1) debt issued in

foreign currency, (2) foreign exchange intervention by the country's

central bank (Inferred from data on international reserve holdings by

correcting for valuation changes), and (3) foreign exchange intervention

in the domestic currency by other countries' central banks (a factor

often neglected in empirical studies). It might seem that standard CAPM

tests have fewer measurement error problems since only data on rates of

returns are used. But, we argue, the assumption that expected returns

can be measured by sample means may present a far greater measurement

problem.

           8See, for example, Mussa (1979).

           9The assumption that returns are normally distributed is suffi-

cient to imply that investors look only at the mean and variance. The

normality assumption might be justified by an appeal to a continuous—

time diffusion process observed at discrete intervals, and is necessary

for the maximum likelihood estimation in any case.

        10The Arrow—Pratt measure of risk aversion is defined as

p   —U'W/U', where U(W) is the utility function, the expectation of

which is to be maximized. One can take a Taylor—series approximation

to EU(W) and differentiate it with respect to E(W) and V(W) to

show that the two definitions of p are equivalent.

        The utility function will have a constant coefficient of relative

risk—aversion if it is exponential in form:

                     U(W) =          where p =   1 —   y.
(The solution to the one—period maximization problem considered here

will be the correct solution to the general interteinporal maximization

problem, if the utility function is further restricted to the logarith-

mic form, the limiting case as       goes to zero, which implies p = 1,

or if events occurring during the period are independent of the expected

returns that prevail in the following period. See Merton (1973, pp.

877—78) or Fama (1970.))

        We do not impose the other constraint,
                        —l a =       t      $
                               p   Covz÷1, r+1,
because the absolute expected return on dollars Er+1 does not fall

Out of the regression as the relative expected returns Ez÷i do. The

constraint offers only five overidentifying restrictions anyway, whereas

we already have twenty—five from our constraint on the coefficient ma-

trix.

        12An alternative approach would be to derive the maximizing sys-

tem in terms of six absolute returns, rather than five relative returns:
                                          —22—

                 r+l


where E is the variance—covariance matrix of the errors                u1 made in
predicting the absolute returns r+1, as opposed to the errors

made in predicting the relative returns                     The advantage would be

that because E is six—by—six, we would have more overidentifying re-

strictions. The disadvantage is that the intercept term (r°

where X   is the Lagrangian shadow—price of wealth), though constant
                                                                                  0
across equations, is not constant across time. A separate value of r

could be estimated for each point in time, but the large—sample proper-

ties of such an estimator are unclear. Subtracting the last row from

each of the others eliminates r, and restores us to equation (6).

The lost row of :     seems a small price to pay.

             Idea of estimating assetdemand equations by drawing the

link between the matrIx of coefficIents of the expected returns and the

variance—covariance matrix of the actual returns Is not entirely new.

See, for example, Parkin (1970) and Wills (1979).

       14See, for example, Roll (1977) and the references cited there.

       151f optimizing residents of different countries consume differ-

ent baskets of goods, then they will use the variances of different

quantities to measure risk, and the aggregation in this paper will be

invalid. As in Frankel (1982b), we can disaggregate according to seven
                                    —23—




areas of residence: the six countries whose currencies are used here,

and the rest of the world. Residents of each area are assumed to evalu-

ate returns in terms of a weighted average of the six countries' prices,

with prices assumed nonstochastic when denominated in the currency of

the producing country and weights determined by that area's consumption

shares. A likelihood ratio test then again rejects the constraint of

mean—variance optimization. The likelihoods are 1043 unconstrained and

987 constrained with p =   2.0.   We are indebted to Tony Rodrigues for

these calculations.

       16Eowever, if the coefficient of risk—aversion   p   is   close to

1.0, then the intertemporal complications vanish, as mentioned in foot-

note 10. As a further bonus, the need to distinguish among investors

according to their consumption basket, discussed in footnotes 6 and 15,

also vanishes. (See Adler and Dumas (1981) or Krugman (1981).) Our

likelihood ratio test, of course, also rejects the mean—variance optimi-
