                                           ABSTRACT

Recent evidence suggests that Medicare Part D has increased prescription drug use among the elderly,
and earlier studies have indicated that increasing market size induces pharmaceutical innovation. This
paper assesses the impact of Medicare Part D on pharmaceutical research and development (R&D),
using time-series data on (a) the number of drugs in clinical development by therapeutic class, and
(b) R&D expenditures by firm. We demonstrate that the passage of Medicare Part D was associated
with significantly higher pharmaceutical R&D for drug classes with higher Medicare market share,
and for firms specializing in higher-Medicare-share drugs.

1. INTRODUCTION

Medicare Part D is a voluntary federal prescription drug program that provides subsidized

outpatient prescription drug coverage for the elderly and disabled. This program was enacted as

part of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA),

and coverage began in January 2006.

       Prior to the implementation of Medicare Part D in 2006, with only a few exceptions1

Medicare covered only prescription medicines “incident to” physician services, i.e., drugs

provided in physician offices and hospitals. Recent evidence indicates that Medicare Part D has

expanded drug coverage and increased prescription drug use by the elderly (Lichtenberg and Sun

2007; Duggan and Scott Morton 2008; Ketcham and Simon 2008; Yin et al. 2008). Prices

received by the pharmaceutical companies for many drugs may also have increased, in part due

to dual eligibles’ loss of lower Medicaid-negotiated prices (Frank and Newhouse 2008).2 Before

Part D, dual eligibles (i.e., those receiving both Medicare and Medicaid) had prescription drug

coverage under Medicaid, and Medicaid programs were legally entitled to receive the best price

offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to any private payer. In 2006, dual eligibles were

automatically enrolled in private Part D plans, comprising some 29% of total enrollees. Because

the MMA forbade federal price negotiation for Part D, pharmaceutical manufacturers could

expect higher revenues for drugs used by the dual-eligible population, as well as increased

utilization by newly-covered elderly individuals. This expectation of higher revenues most

likely contributed to the pharmaceutical industry’s switch from opposition towards advocacy for

the Part D legislation in 1999 (Oliver et al. 2004).

       Previous studies have shown that such increases in market size are significant drivers of

pharmaceutical innovation (Kremer 2002; Acemoglu and Linn 2004). In addition, (Finkelstein
                                                                                      Page 3 of 24


2004) found that increasing government payment (e.g., the 1993 decision for Medicare to cover

influenza vaccination) induced greater investment in pharmaceutical R&D for vaccines. Finally,

the pharmaceutical industry trade group PhRMA itself drew a connection between passage of a

Medicare prescription drug benefit and increased R&D:

       “Successfully expanding prescription drug coverage for seniors and disabled
       persons will ensure that breakthroughs in basic scientific knowledge become safe
       and effective medicines for patients. If we fail, pharmaceutical innovation—
       especially with respect to medicines designed to treat the illnesses of aging—may
       suffer, thereby reducing hope for Medicare beneficiaries and their families.
       Modernizing Medicare is our best hope that today’s and tomorrow’s beneficiaries
       will reap the rewards of innovation: longer, happier, healthier, and more fulfilling
       lives.” (Holmer, 1999)

        Taken together, this evidence naturally raises the question: will expansion in the market

for prescription drugs due to Medicare Part D induce increased pharmaceutical R&D? In this

paper, we employ time-series data on (a) the number of drugs in clinical development by

therapeutic class, and (b) R&D expenditures by firm to assess the impact of Medicare Part D on

pharmaceutical R&D. We find that the passage of Medicare Part D was associated with

significant increases, as compared with expected trends, in the number of drugs entering clinical

development for drug classes most likely to be affected by Medicare Part D. Furthermore,

although growth in R&D expenditures appears to have slowed overall since 2003, we find a

significant positive correlation between the Medicare share of firms’ R&D portfolios and firms’

R&D expenditures since passage of Medicare Part D.

2. DATA AND METHODS

Data on Pharmaceutical R&D. Time-series data on the number of drugs by therapeutic class at

each stage of the pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) pipeline were derived from

the Pharmaprojects trend data “snapshot” published each May from 1998 through 2007.

Pharmaprojects data are collected from a variety of public sources including press releases,

patent filings, conference proceedings, regulatory agencies, and the medical literature, as well as

through direct contacts with pharmaceutical companies and researchers. As noted by (Adams

and Brantner 2006), this collection process may miss some drugs in early stage development.

For this reason, we exclude preclinical R&D data from our analysis. However, commercial

databases like Pharmaprojects are generally considered fairly complete for Phase II & III clinical

trials—existence of a recruiting clinical trial is more difficult to hide than proprietary work in a

firm laboratory. Even if some underreporting remains, we are less concerned about potential

omissions for two reasons: (1) because our analyses estimate percent changes in R&D, rather

than quantity or level changes after the introduction of Part D; and (2) because we have no

reason to expect systematic bias in reporting across therapeutic classes that both (a) coincides

with the introduction of Part D and (b) is correlated with Medicare market share. Unless both

conditions (a) and (b) are met, underreporting will not bias our estimates.

       Figure 1 shows the trends over time in the number of drugs entering each phase of

clinical development for our panel of therapeutic classes. We observe the following notable

features in our data. The number of drugs entering Phase I was steady, on average, through

2002, but increased markedly in 2003, and continued at that higher rate until another major

increase in 2007. With the exception of an anomalous increase in 2001, the number of drugs

entering Phase II clinical trials was steady through 2003, increased markedly in 2004, and then
                                                                                         Page 5 of 24


like Phase I continued at a higher rate until another major increase in 2007. Finally, the number

of drugs entering Phase III trials trended slightly downwards through 2003, then like Phase II

increased markedly in 2004 and continued at that higher rate until another increase in 2007.

<FIGURE 1>

Data on Medicare share by therapeutic class. We estimated the share of total prescriptions

filled by Medicare-covered individuals in each therapeutic class, using data from the 2004

Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a nationally representative survey of the US civilian

non-institutionalized population. Because MEPS explicitly excludes drugs received while in

hospital, it is particularly well-suited to estimating the Medicare-eligibles’ share of outpatient

prescription drugs newly covered under Part D. Approximately 42% of outpatient prescriptions

were filled by Medicare-covered individuals. Therapeutic classes from Pharmaprojects were

matched to therapeutic subclasses from the MEPS 2004 Prescribed Medicines file. Therapeutic

classes were then grouped into a panel of 27 therapeutic categories based on common indications

or biological system, and on similar elderly market share. Over 96% of the weighted total

prescriptions in MEPS were assigned to one of these therapeutic categories. Figure 2 shows the

resulting categories, ranked by Medicare market share.

<FIGURE 2>

Data on R&D expenditures and Medicare shares by firm. Pharmaceutical firms were

identified in Compustat by SIC codes 2830-2836, and NAICS codes 325412-325414.3 Firms

were then hand-matched by name with originator firms in Pharmaprojects. Due to our focus on

R&D decisions, we only included firms with non-zero, non-missing R&D expenditure data for

all years 1997-2006, and for which at least one drug was reported in clinical development (Phase

I trials through FDA registration) during our five-year baseline period, 1998-2002. We then
                                                                                      Page 6 of 24


calculated for each firm the weighted average Medicare share of the firm’s baseline clinical

portfolio, as the sum of the MEPS-estimated Medicare share for each drug in the firm’s portfolio

divided by the total number of drugs in the portfolio.4 This process resulted in a panel of 108

publicly-traded pharmaceutical firms, with an average baseline portfolio Medicare share of

41.4% (standard deviation 9.8%). For the US, at least, this panel appears to be fairly complete:

for example, in 2006 the US-incorporated firms in our panel reported spending $56.2 billion on

R&D; Burrill and Company estimated total US pharmaceutical industry R&D expenditures at

$56.1 billion that year, for a difference within 1% (Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers

of America 2007). Finally, firms’ R&D expenditures were inflated using the Biomedical

Research and Development Price Index (BRDPI)5 to constant 2006 dollars. Figure 3 shows that,

for our panel of 108 firms, real R&D expenditure growth overall slowed after 2003, then

increased again in 2006.

<FIGURE 3>

Estimating the impact of Part D on R&D. We use two outcome variables for our analysis: (1)

the number of drugs entering a given R&D stage, in a given therapeutic class and year; and (2)

R&D expenditures by firm and year. If pharmaceutical companies respond to the increased

market size as predicted, then all else equal we would expect to see an increase in the flow of

drugs entering clinical development. We would also expect to see an increase in R&D

expenditures at firms specializing in drugs for the Medicare market.

       For each stage of R&D, we estimated difference-in-difference Poisson regression models.

All our models include year fixed effects and therapeutic category fixed effects. These fixed

effects provide a completely non-parametric approach to control both for underlying year-on-

year differences in total R&D and time-invariant differences in the levels of R&D across drug
                                                                                      Page 7 of 24


classes. In addition to these fixed effects, in each model we also include separate linear time

trends for each therapeutic class. 6 These allow us to accommodate differences across classes in

year-on-year R&D growth not only due to predictable changes in market size (e.g., due to

demographics), but also differences in relative market saturation, existing marketed drugs’

remaining patent life, and scientific understanding and technological advances for each disease

category. Identification of the Part D effect, then, relies on changes in R&D versus expected

trends, controlling for year-on-year variation, across therapeutic classes with different Medicare

market shares. We estimate this effect via interaction of Medicare market share with a Part D

dummy variable (Year > 2003). Intuitively, since the absolute change in the number of drugs

entering clinical development following Part D should be proportional to the size of the Medicare

market, the percent change in the number of drugs entering clinical development following Part

D should be proportional to the Medicare share for the market.

       Next, we investigated whether therapeutic classes which were previously heavily covered

under Medicare Part B had lower R&D growth than one might otherwise expect, given their

Medicare market share, by interacting those individual drug classes with the Medicare market

share * Part D variable. We then considered possible dynamic effects of Part D over three time

periods: (1) anticipatory effects in 2003, while the legislation was under debate in Congress; (2)

transitional effects in 2004-2005, after passage but before Part D was implemented;7 and (3)

post-implementation effects in 2006-2007.

       Finally, we investigated whether firms with higher average Medicare market share in

their baseline R&D portfolios also had relatively greater investment in R&D after passage of Part

D. For each firm we estimated the Medicare market share of their R&D portfolio, based on the

average Medicare share of the drugs in their R&D pipeline (Phase I through FDA registration)
                                                                                       Page 8 of 24


during a 5-year base period prior to Part D, 1998-2002. We then used these data to estimate

ordinary least squares difference-in-difference models, for which the dependent variable was

log(R&D expenditures). These models include time fixed effects to account for secular year-on-

year variation in R&D that might be unrelated to Medicare Part D, firm fixed effects to account

for time invariant differences in R&D levels across firms, and a firm-year operating income

covariate to improve model fit. The key independent variables are the interaction of each firm’s

baseline Medicare share with one or more dummy variables for the passage of Part D.

        Although the Poisson regression used with our first outcome variable is relatively robust

to misspecification, over-dispersion in the data can create problems for estimating effect size.

One measure of dispersion is the ratio of the deviance to the degrees of freedom, which for a

good-fitting model should approach 1. Some of our models evidenced modest over-dispersion

(dispersion is reported for each model in Tables 1-3), so we repeated our analyses using both

zero-inflated Poisson and negative binomial regression (a generalization of Poisson), and

obtained very similar results for our coefficients of interest.8 Finally, we report confidence

intervals and p-values for the coefficients using robust standard errors, clustered on therapeutic

class to allow for serial correlation in the errors over time.



3. STUDY FINDINGS

        First, we evaluated whether Part D differentially affected drug classes with higher

Medicare market share. We find significant positive correlation after passage of Part D between

the number of drugs entering Phase I (p<.10), Phase II (p<.10), and all clinical trials (p<.05), and

therapeutic class Medicare share. That is, drug classes with higher Medicare share experienced

significantly greater percentage growth in R&D post-2003 than classes with lower Medicare
                                                                                          Page 9 of 24


share, versus the classes' expected trends. For the average Medicare share class (Medicare share

= 42%), these results translate to an estimated 31% increase in Phase I trials, a 44% increase in

Phase II trials, a 60% increase in Phase III trials, and a 40% increase in all clinical trials versus

expected trends.

<TABLE 1>

       Prior to the passage of Medicare Part D, certain drugs (e.g., IV cancer drugs, insulin for

patients using pumps, COPD medications for patients using nebulizers, etc.) were already

covered under Medicare Part B. For example, 12 of the top 20 medications covered by Part B,

representing over 40% of Part B expenditures in 2001, were for cancer treatment, and 2 of the

top 5 medications, representing over 12% of expenditures in 2001, were for COPD (Medicare

Payment Advisory Commission 2003). Because a significant fraction of cancer and COPD drugs

did not experience a change in insurance coverage with Part D, we would expect relatively lower

effects of Part D on R&D for these classes. We tested this hypothesis by interacting the

Medicare share*Part D variable with indicator variables for cancer and COPD, and as expected,

nearly all of the coefficient estimates are significant (p<.001) and negative (see Table 2).

       Finally, we looked for differential effects of Part D, over three different time periods: (1)

anticipatory effects in 2003; (2) transitional effects in 2004-2005, after passage but before Part D

was implemented; and (3) post-implementation effects in 2006-2007. We expected some

ambiguity in 2003, due to two competing effects. On the one hand, the pharmaceutical industry

was well aware of the progress of the MMA through Congress, and could have anticipated its

passage by ramping up R&D. On the other hand, uncertainty about the bill’s passage,

provisions, or implementation might have deterred investment. For Phase I, we see no

significant relationship between Medicare share and the percentage change in clinical trials in
                                                                                         Page 10 of 24


2003. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that this year’s marked increase in Phase I trials

(per Figure 1) was due either to secular changes in R&D or to improvement in the

Pharmaprojects data collection process. However, despite our observation that overall the

number of drugs entering Phase III trials decreased in 2003, we do find strong positive

correlation in 2003 between the percentage change in number of Phase III trials by class and

Medicare market share. Thus, in the uncertain political climate of 2003, the pharmaceutical

industry appears to have cut back the most expensive, late-stage trials, but predominantly for

classes with lower Medicare share.

        We expected to see increased impact of Medicare Part D in 2006-2007 versus 2004-2005

for two reasons. First, over time there was less uncertainty and more information available about

the implementation and probable impact of Part D for the pharmaceutical industry. Second, the

generally linear progression of drugs through the R&D phases seemed likely to yield lagged

effects, especially for later-stage clinical trials. That is, while the number of drugs in preclinical

development might respond rapidly, it would take time for those new drugs to proceed through

the R&D pipeline. In Table 3, we observe evidence of one or both of these effects. First, we

observe a significant positive relationship (p<.10) between Medicare share and the number of

clinical trials, for all phases of R&D in both 2004-2005 and 2006-2007. Furthermore, this

relationship becomes more pronounced over time: for all models except Phase II, the coefficient

on Medicare Share * Part D is significantly larger (p<.02) in 2006-2007 versus 2004-2005.

Thus, after controlling for anticipatory changes in 2003, we find that for the average drug class

(with Medicare share 42%), Medicare Part D is associated with 37% more drugs entering Phase I

trials in 2004-2005 (p=.02), and 52% more entering in 2006-2007 (p=.01) than would have been

expected based on prior trends. Phase II clinical trials for the average drug class also appear to
                                                                                        Page 11 of 24


have increased versus expectation, by 44% in 2004-2005 (p=.09) and 60% in 2006-2007 (p=.03),

though as noted above this apparent increase over time is not significant (p>.10). Finally,

compared with expected trends, Medicare Part D is associated with doubling the number of

Phase III clinical trials for drug classes with average Medicare share in 2004-2005 (p=.04), and

nearly tripling the number of Phase III trials (p<.001) in 2006-2007. These apparently dramatic

effects in Phase III can be explained, in part, by the following observation: the median number of

drugs entering Phase III trials in any given class and year is 3, with range 0 to 20 (i.e., these large

percentage increases are occurring over a small denominator). In addition, because the

confidence intervals for our point estimates are fairly wide, the Phase III results are not

statistically different from those for Phase I and Phase II. Finally, due to inclusion of year fixed

effects in our models, these coefficients should not be interpreted to indicate that all classes

experienced positive R&D growth after 2003. In particular, in a separate analysis we found that

after 2003, Phase III clinical trials significantly decreased versus prior year trends for drug

classes with Medicare share of 20% and lower.

       Given our results above, we expected that firms with more exposure to the Medicare

market would have greater percentage increases in R&D expenditures after the passage of Part

D. To test this, we investigated whether firms that had higher (weighted average) Medicare

market share R&D portfolios prior to Medicare Part D also had greater percentage change in

investment in R&D after passage of the Part D legislation. As shown in Table 4, consistent with

our results above, even after controlling for year-to-year variations in overall R&D expenditures

(e.g., there was essentially no growth in real R&D expenditures from 2003-2005, but growth

resumed in 2006), we find that percentage change in R&D expenditures was not only positively

correlated with Medicare share (p<.10) after passage of Part D, but that Medicare share became
                                                                                      Page 12 of 24


significantly more important (p<.05) as a determinant of R&D expenditures over time.

Interestingly, we also looked for anticipatory effects in 2003, but found no significant

relationship between Medicare share and R&D expenditures prior to the legislation's passage.



4. DISCUSSION

Our results indicate that the increased outpatient prescription drug coverage provided through

Medicare Part D has had substantial short-run impact on pharmaceutical R&D. We observe

clear evidence of a break in established R&D trends beginning in 2004, just months after the

Medicare Part D legislation was enacted, with greater percentage increases in R&D versus prior

trends for drug classes that are most used by Medicare beneficiaries, and were not previously

covered under Medicare Part B. Although we cannot completely rule out exogenous changes in

R&D trends both coincident with Medicare Part D and correlated with Medicare share, this

evidence does seem to suggest a causal relationship. As Finkelstein (2004) suggests, the

relatively rapid response we observe may be due to “a substantial reservoir of technologically

feasible products on the shelf for whom the decision to begin clinical trials is responsive, on the

margin, to increases in the expected economic return to the clinical trial.” These changes not

only persist for the three years following the change in policy, but in fact become more

pronounced over time. However, given that the total number of drugs entering clinical trials

post-2003 did not significantly increase versus prior trends, this pronounced post-2003 shift

towards clinical trials for drugs with higher Medicare market share may have come at the

expense of new drugs for diseases which predominantly affect younger people. So, while

Medicare Part D is associated with dramatic increases in R&D for high-Medicare-share classes,
                                                                                       Page 13 of 24


this effect is being tempered either by contemporaneous decreases in overall R&D, or by

targeted substitution away from low-Medicare-share classes.

       The magnitude of our estimates appears reasonable, given the prior literature. Acemoglu

and Linn (2004) found that the elasticity of innovation with respect to market size ranged from

3.5 for new molecular entities to 6 for all drug approvals. Duggan and Scott Morton (2008)

predict that Medicare Part D increased pharmaceutical revenues by roughly 33% for drugs with

Medicare market share of 100%. For a drug class with the average Medicare market share in our

sample (42%), Duggan and Scott Morton's result translates to a 14% change in pharmaceutical

revenues following Medicare Part D. Combining these results, we would expect an increase of

between 49% and 83% in new drug development for the average drug class. Nearly all of our

estimates are well within this range, and in many cases they are on the more conservative end.

One surprising finding is the relatively rapid increase in number of Phase III clinical trails

following Part D. Given the relatively short time elapsed since passage of Part D, we suspect

that much of the observed increase in Phase III trials may be for drugs that were 'on the shelf',

already marketed, and/or combination therapies that had already been tested in humans. These

drugs could simply bypass Phases I & II. Anecdotally, this phenomenon is exactly what we're

seeing in the market for cholesterol drugs—a significant increase in the number of Phase III

trials mainly driven by new trials for combinations of drugs already on market9.

       These results should be viewed in light of our study’s limitations. First, analysis of the

overall effect of Part D on innovation is limited both by the relatively short time-series available

post-2003, and by the fact that R&D is an imperfect predictor of the number and quality of new

drugs ultimately developed. Given the long lag between drug discovery and development and

new drug approvals, we cannot yet determine whether Medicare Part D will result in more (or
                                                                                     Page 14 of 24


better) drugs entering the market. For example, the drugs added to the pipeline in response to

Part D could be riskier investments, with potentially lower expected benefits. Finally, these

relatively short-run effects on R&D may not result in increased innovation if the government

implements aggressive price negotiations.

       Medicare Part D not only reduces financial risk for elderly individuals today, but also has

the potential to benefit the future elderly through increased flows of new drugs. If the flow of

new and more expensive brand-name drugs increases, the federal cost of the Medicare Part D

program may be higher than anticipated. On the other hand, these relatively short-run effects on

R&D may not result in increased innovation if federal price negotiation is introduced, curtailing

the expected market. Future research will be needed to determine whether these observed

increases in R&D have any effect on new drug introductions and ultimately on health outcomes.

Notes: Authors' calculations based on BRDPI-inflated
Compustat R&D expenditure data, 1997-2006, and
Pharmaprojects 1998-2002 firm pipeline data. Both models are
ordinary least squares, with outcome variable log(R&D
expenditures), and include separate linear time trends and fixed
effects for each firm, as well as time fixed effects. Robust 95%
confidence intervals for the coefficient t-statistics are presented
in square brackets below each coefficient estimate. Standard
errors are clustered by firm.

    Some exceptions to this rule included oral cancer drugs with IV equivalents, oral anti-emetics

    used within 48 hours of chemotherapy, immunosuppressants for recipients of Medicare-

    covered organ transplants, erythropoietin (EPO) for end-stage renal failure, and drugs

    administered via covered durable medical equipment, such as albuterol sulfate or ipratropium

    bromide used with a nebulizer or insulin used with an insulin pump.

    NAICS codes 325412-325414 include manufacturing of pharmaceutical preparations,

diagnostic substances, and non-diagnostic biological products. Standard Industrial Classification

(SIC) codes 283X include manufacturers of medicinal chemicals and botanical products,

pharmaceutical preparations, diagnostic substances, and other non-diagnostic biological

substances under the header category “Drugs”.

    We exclude from this calculation any drugs not in one of the 27 therapeutic categories matched

    in MEPS and Pharmaprojects.

    The BRDPI is generated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Department of Commerce, and

    was downloaded from: http://officeofbudget.od.nih.gov/UI/GDP_FromGenBudget.htm

    We also tested quadratic therapeutic-class time trends, but found little qualitative difference in

the coefficient estimates, and model fit was not sufficiently improved by addition of these

parameters to justify their inclusion.

    Beginning in June 2004, discount cards were issued to Medicare beneficiaries, providing a 15-

    20% discount on out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs.

    binomial results were identical to those reported here, because when the overdispersion

    parameter in a negative binomial regression is not statistically different from zero, the negative

    binomial distribution is equivalent to a Poisson distribution.

    For example, in 2007, a record six cholesterol drugs entered Phase III trials compared to an

average of 2 to 3 drugs in prior years. Several of these drugs were combinations of already

marketed drugs: fenofibrate + simvastatin combination (both components already on the market);

a new micronized formulation of fenofibrate; niacin + simvastatin (both on the market); niacin

alone (again already on the market); ezetimibe + atorvastatin (both on the market); and finally

JTT-705, the only novel compound entering Phase III that year. Thus, the total number of

cholesterol drugs entering Phase III trials saw a two- or three-fold increase in 2007 versus prior

years, and this growth was led mainly by new combination drugs.
