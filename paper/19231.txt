                                            ABSTRACT

Many organizations provide retirement planning seminars to their employees as a benefit to help them
make better informed retirement decisions. This study examines the participants in 85 seminars conducted
by five companies in 2008 and 2009 to determine how much learning takes place and whether employees
adjust retirement plans. Using surveys conducted before and after the seminars, we find that financial
literacy and knowledge of retirement program parameters are significantly higher after the seminar.
 Employees with the largest increases in knowledge were most likely to change their planned retirement
age and planned age of claiming Social Security benefits.

I. Introduction

       As retirement approaches, an older worker faces a series of important and irreversible

choices including when to retire from her current job and when to start collecting Social

Security. These decisions have become much more complicated as defined contribution plans

largely replaced defined benefit plans and as financial options facing investors become more

complex. These actions will strongly affect individuals’ income levels in retirement, the

sensitivity of income to economic fluctuations, and the ability to maintain consumption

throughout retirement.

       To make the transition into retirement successfully, workers must rely on their financial

knowledge and obtain information about retirement programs offered by employers and the

government. Without accurate information and sufficient financial literacy, some older workers

will make suboptimal employment and investment choices that will have adverse consequences.

Most lifecycle models of economic behavior assume that individuals have basic financial literacy

and make resource allocation decisions to develop saving/consumption plans along with

work/retirement choices to maximize lifetime utility.

       Economists and other social science researchers have recently examined the level of

financial literacy and its role in economic decision making. The general conclusion of this

research, recently surveyed by Hastings, Madrian and Skimmyhorn (2012), is that individuals

have quite low levels of financial literacy. This would make them more likely to make sub-

optimal resource allocation decisions. Individuals with low levels of financial literacy have

difficulty with paying bills on time, saving, and diversifying, as shown in the many research

studies cited by Hastings et al. Low levels of financial literacy are also associated with lower




                                                 2
wealth (see Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007, 2011; Gustman, Steinmeir and Tabatabai, 2012; van

Rooij, Lusardi and Alessie, 2012).

        This paper addresses two key questions. First, can financial literacy programs increase

knowledge? And second, if steps are taken to increase financial literacy and pension

understanding, will there be changes in retirement plans? While it is interesting to see an

association between low literacy levels and certain types of decisions, this does not necessarily

imply that improving financial literacy will lead to a revision in retirement plans. Low literacy

levels could reflect other variables (such as intelligence, attitudes, or preferences) that do not

show up in household surveys but more truly determine choices. A few studies have attempted

to determine whether changes in knowledge base can lead to changes in decisions. For instance,

Liebman and Luttmer (2011) conducted a field experiment where a sample of older workers

received information about Social Security provisions in the mail; these workers were 4

percentage points more likely than the control group to be in the labor force one year later.

        Financial literacy programs can take many forms and can occur in many different

settings. This study focuses on financial education and retirement planning programs in the

workplace. Since individuals spend substantial time at work and since much of what they need

to know to develop retirement plans is related to employer-provided benefits, the workplace is

well-suited for financial education programs. The programs that we have studied are provided

by the employer at no cost to the employee and are conducted during the workday on company

time.

        In this study, we examine the retirement planning programs offered by employers to their

older employees and assess their impact on financial literacy and retirement plans. There is a

sizable literature on retirement planning (recent examples include Benitez-Silva and Dwyer,



                                                  3
2005, and Chan and Stevens, 2008) and the choice of when to claim Social Security benefits (see

Behaghel and Blau, 2012, and references therein), but the role of financial literacy is

underexplored. A related literature finds that those with access to seminars save more and have

higher wealth (e.g., Bayer, Bernheim, and Scholz, 2009; Bernheim and Garrett, 2003; Lusardi,

2005), but does not explicitly consider how seminars alter retirement plans.

       We study how worker knowledge changes after completion of a retirement seminar and

whether the changes in knowledge actually lead to changes in retirement plans. We build upon

previous work by Clark, Morrill and Allen (2012a, 2012b) that examined retirement plans of

workers in three companies that did not have retirement planning seminars. That study finds

employees who mistakenly think that Social Security or pension eligibility is later than it really

is plan to retire later than well informed workers. The results are more mixed for those who

mistakenly thought they were eligible earlier than they really were; this type of mistake on full

Social Security benefit eligibility is associated with earlier retirement whereas mistakes

regarding early Social Security eligibility and private pension eligibility were unrelated to

planned retirement age.

       This paper demonstrates an increase in employees’ knowledge about pension plan

parameters and financial matters resulting from attending a pre-retirement planning workshop.

We then explore whether attendees make changes in their plans for retirement and receipt of

Social Security benefits. Our findings indicate that participants increase their financial and

pension literacy, and on the basis of new knowledge many alter their retirement plans.

II. Financial Literacy and Retirement Decisions

       When individuals enter the labor force, they immediately begin making important choices

about their lifetime consumption and saving profiles. Lifecycle theory suggests that individuals



                                                 4
set retirement goals and targets early in their careers. In order to achieve these retirement goals,

workers select labor supply, saving and investment behavior consistent with their goals. As new

information becomes available, people will re-optimize their consumption and saving patterns,

and they may alter their retirement expectations using this new knowledge. The primary

retirement goals that workers must set include the age of retirement and their levels of retirement

income. A fundamental principle in retirement planning is that younger retirement ages and

higher retirement incomes require more saving and less consumption throughout one’s working

life. Younger retirement ages may require more risk-taking as well.

       While considerable attention has been paid to the undersaving of American workers,

much less attention has been focused on how older workers make decisions concerning the

allocation of their resources as they enter into retirement. Workers must decide when and how to

enter into retirement, and how to best use the resources available to them. Limited available

evidence suggests that older workers do not have sufficient financial literacy needed to make the

many choices that must be made as they transition from work to retirement (Bernheim 1995,

1998; Hilgert and Hogarth 2002; Lusardi and Mitchell 2006, 2007). Incorrect or insufficient

knowledge can lead to suboptimal choices. For this reason, programs that increase financial

literacy and retirement program knowledge have the potential to improve retirement decisions

and produce better retirement outcomes (Clark and d’Ambrosio 2003; Clark, et al., 2006; Lusardi

2008). Pre-retirement planning seminars held in the workplace can efficiently address the

numerous questions that individuals approaching retirement share, thereby reducing human

resources costs.

       Some of the most important decisions older workers must make include: (1) What age to

retire from a career jobs? (2) When retiring from a career job, whether to request a lump sum



                                                  5
distribution from a defined benefit plan or accept a life annuity from the plan? (3) What age to

start receiving Social Security benefits? (4) Whether to annuitize the account balances in a

401(k) plan? In making these important decisions, individuals must rely on their own financial

literacy and understanding of financial mathematics and have accurate knowledge about their

employers’ and national retirement programs. Workers can acquire the needed knowledge to

make these key decisions in various ways, and one resource often available is employer-

sponsored pre-retirement planning programs.

       Many large employers offer some type of planning seminar for retirement eligible

employees. Sabelhaus, Brogdan, and Holden (2008) report that 46 percent of pension

participants covered by defined contribution plans work for companies that provide resources to

assist participants in retirement choices. Thirty percent of participants have the opportunity to

attend employer seminars and workshops, and almost 85 percent of these attendees rely on this

information to ‘some’ or a ‘great’ extent in making their retirement decisions. In a plan sponsor

survey, Wray (2008) finds that 31 percent of employers offer seminars focusing on retirement

assets and income planning. While not universal, employer-provided retirement planning

programs are common, accessible to perhaps one-third of the labor force.

       Although many business leaders and analysts believe these programs are beneficial to

employees and increase their financial knowledge, relatively little formal analysis of employer

programs has been conducted. Thus, not much is known about the effectiveness of workplace

education and its ability to alter the retirement decisions of employees. To address these

important issues, we examined the pre-retirement programs of five large national employers.

The principal objective of the research is to assess whether these programs are successful in




                                                 6
improving workers’ knowledge as they approach retirement. We also examine whether, on the

basis of participating in a workplace educational event, employees alter their retirement plans.

III. Research Methodology
       To evaluate employer-provided pre-retirement planning programs, we assembled a team

of five large employers ranging in size from 8,000 to 40,000 employees. Four of the firms have

sites throughout the United States; their home offices are in New Jersey, North Carolina,

Oklahoma, and Washington. Each of the employers offers defined benefit plans (three

employers have cash balance plans), each offers health insurance to active and retired workers,

and each offers supplemental defined contribution plans (all but one have an employer match).

The employee populations of these companies vary by gender, education, earnings, and

geographic location.

       We worked with each employer in the spring of 2008 to develop an evaluation process

for their pre-retirement planning programs. Our methodology included the development of two

surveys. The first survey was to be completed by each participant prior to the start of the

program. The objective was to obtain baseline socioeconomic data about the individual and

his/her household, as well as information concerning retirement plans and investment strategies.

Employees also answered questions about their financial literacy and their knowledge of

employer and national retirement programs, described in detail in Section IV.

       At the conclusion of the seminar, participants were asked to complete a second survey.

This time, participants answered additional questions concerning the program, the employee’s

assessment of the seminar, and its value. The knowledge and literacy questions were repeated, to

see if the participants’ overall knowledge of retirement programs and financial markets had

improved. Seminar participants were also again asked about their retirement plans, so we can

observe any changes in plans that individuals made due to the seminar. Three of the employers

                                                 7
used hard-copy surveys. The program leaders at each of these companies extended the length of

their programs to allow participants 15 to 20 minutes prior to the start of the seminar to complete

Survey One and similar time at the end of the program to complete Survey Two. The other two

employers used electronic surveys; in this case, a link to the electronic Survey One was sent via

email to participants about a week prior to the seminar and a link to Survey Two was e-mailed to

the participants immediately following the seminar. Attendees were given approximately two

weeks to complete Survey Two. This research is based on participant surveys from 85 seminars

that incorporated our surveys into their programs between June 2008 and December 2009. We

merged the responses from the five employers into a single data set which we call Participants

Attending Retirement Seminars (PARS). Table 1 presents basic statistics about each employer,

their retirement planning seminars, and the sample size in PARS.1

                                                      [Table 1]

          Seminars varied in scope and duration across the employers. During the research period,

Employer A held 31 seminars that were 4 hours long with approximately 500 total attendees.

Employer B and Employer E both had all day seminars. Employer D had 12 seminars that were

two and half days in duration and covered 281 employees. In 2008, the Employer C seminars

were a full day, but in 2009 the seminars were reduced to a half day. Thus, we were able to


1
    We do not conduct analysis at the employer-level and have kept the identities of the employers masked.
Although it is interesting to note the similarities and differences among the seminars presented by the
employers, with such a small sample of employers one should be cautious about attributing differences
observed to differing seminar characteristics with only a limited set of employee control variables.
Similarly, although our data do span the start of The Great Recession, because the employers held
seminars at different times and the population of attendees may have been affected by the macroeconomic
conditions at the time of the seminar, the data are not well suited to a study of the effects of the recent
recession on retirement planning.


                                                       8
develop a unique data set that included seminars ranging in length from one half day to two and

half days. Some seminars took place during a significant economic decline and some in the

early stages of the economic recovery.2 One should therefore be cautious in interpreting any

aggregate differences observed between the outcomes at each employer, since many aspects of

the seminar, time period, survey, and sample differ. All regression estimates include employer

fixed effects, but those are not reported or interpreted as part of the analysis.

          During the 18 month data collection period, over 1,500 individuals attended the seminars

of these five employers. We received completed responses from 1,182 for a response rate of

approximately 76 percent. In the analysis, we restrict the sample to participants with valid

responses for age, gender, education, and tenure (dropping 13, 11, 8, and 9 observations,

respectively. The sample was restricted to those born between 1943 and 1959, thus participants

were approximately age 50 to 65 at the time of the seminars (dropping an additional 39

observations).3 We also restrict the sample to those respondents that had a valid response for at

least five out of the ten knowledge questions (dropping 34 observations) and who had a valid

response for planned retirement age (dropping 228 observations).4 The final sample size for our



2
    Goda, Shoven, and Slavov (2012) find a weak negative correlation between the stock market decline in
2008 and planned retirement age, but suggest that the relationship is not driven by wealth shocks.
3
    The age-50 restriction was applied to limit the sample to individuals approaching retirement decisions.
Most of the employers only invite retirement eligible employees to these programs so, in fact, this results
in only a small number of observations being deleted from the sample. The upper age limit was applied to
limit the sample to those who had not yet attained the normal retirement age for Social Security. In
addition, we felt that workers over age 65 had already made the decision to delay retirement and that they
would most likely have very different responses to these programs than workers age 50 to 65.
4
    Item non-response for retirement age was high because “don’t know” was an allowable response in
several versions of the survey.


                                                       9
analysis is 840, as shown in Table 1.

          We examine the impact of pre-retirement planning programs offered between June 2008

and December 2009.5 The usual process followed by the employers is that retirement-eligible

employees are invited individually to participate in these programs by their employer: invitations

are issued, attendance is tracked, and there are high participation rates. Because of the high

demand by employees to participate in the programs, several employers limit participation to

once every five years or so. These programs are on-going and the employers expect that over a

number of years, most eligible employees will attend one of these programs. Thus, the

participants in the programs we observe should roughly reflect the population of older workers at

these employers on average.

          While our results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of financial education at the five

employers studied, there are two important caveats to the external generalizability of our

findings. First, there always is a possibility of selection issues associated with participation in

various types of educational events. For example, only workers with certain characteristics

might attend these programs. Thus, attendance only by persons who desired to participate could

suggest that statistical analysis might overstate the impact of financial education seminars for the

population at large. In contrast to past studies of voluntary seminars or benefit fairs, the

programs we examine are more structured. While attendance is voluntary, employees receive

specific invitations from their employers and attendance is recorded. When questioned, the

leaders of the various programs in our study reported to us that nearly all workers invited to

participate actually attend the programs and, over time, all retirement eligible workers are invited

to attend one of these programs. Therefore, this type of selection bias should be minimal in our


5
    At least one of the authors attended a seminar offered by each of the five employers.


                                                      10
study.6 Nevertheless, we only observed seminars offered between June 2008 and December

2009, so it is possible that these programs may have attracted a non-representative sample of the

workforce during the 18 months of our project. The leaders of the various employer-provided

programs did not report any obvious selection bias among the participants during the study

period. The second reason our results may not be generalizable to the full population of workers

is that our sample necessarily is employed at larger firms that offer formal pre-retirement

planning seminars and have generous pension and retirement benefits. Appendix Table A-1

presents a comparison of our sample (described below) to the nationally representative Health

and Retirement Study (HRS) data. As expected our sample has higher levels of education, more

years of service, higher earnings, and more financial literacy than the HRS sample.

IV. Survey Design and the PARS Sample
          The basic framework of each of the surveys was similar across the firms; however, some

components of the surveys were customized for each employer. The surveys mentioned the

specific employer by name, where appropriate, and people were asked about their own

employer-specific retirement benefits by name. Questions concerning retirement saving accounts

differed somewhat between private-sector versus public/nonprofit employers (i.e., questions

concerned 401(k) plans in the private sector and 403(b) and 457 plans in the public sector). In

addition, several employers requested that specific questions be added to the survey to help them

better understand how their employees were using the human resource programs and accessing

the help lines offered by their 401(k) and 403(b) providers.



6
    The programs offered by three of the employers have been presented over a number of years. In
contrast, the programs by two of the employers were implemented during our study period and thus a full
cycle of retirees has not had a chance to attend one of the programs.


                                                    11
       The objectives of Survey One were to determine employee understanding levels

regarding their employer’s pension and health benefits, their knowledge of national retirement

plans such as Social Security and Medicare, their financial literacy, and their current retirement

plans. To assess the current level of knowledge regarding national retirement plans, the survey

asked about Social Security early and normal retirement ages as well as early retirement

penalties, cost of living increases, and the age of eligibility for Medicare. In addition, participants

were asked benefit and eligibility questions concerning their employer defined benefit plans and

their own 401(k) or 403(b) accounts.

       This survey also included several questions related to basic financial literacy. Survey One

also asked participants the age that they expected to retire, when they expected to start Social

Security benefits, what the expected level of benefits would be, and what benefits they expected

to receive from their employer-provided retirement plans. Questions probed employee intentions

concerning annuitization of pension assets and work plans after they retired from their current

employer. Finally, Survey One contained a series of economic and demographic questions

concerning current income, wealth, age, marital status, and the work, income, and retirement

benefits of any spouse or partner.

       The primary objectives of Survey Two were to determine how participants evaluated the

seminar, whether they enhanced their knowledge of retirement programs, and whether the new

information changed their retirement plans. To assess the employees’ impression of the seminars,

the first section of Survey Two asked respondents if the program provided useful information, if

the information was presented at the right level for them, if the presenters were of high caliber, if

they felt better able to make retirement decisions after completing the program, and whether they

valued the program as an employee benefit. The next two sections of Survey Two repeated many



                                                  12
Survey One questions concerning retirement intentions and knowledge. By comparing the

answers given across both surveys, we assess the change in the respondent’s knowledge about

retirement programs, financial literacy, and whether participants changed their retirement plans.

       Means of various demographic, economic, and retirement plans characteristics are shown

in Table 2. The sample is composed of 840 workers age 50-65 with a mean age of 57.8 years.

Males represented 54 percent of the employees, while 76 percent of respondents are married, and

they have an average of 25 years of service with their current employer. In general, these are

relatively high earners with above-average wealth.

                                                [Table 2]

V. Did Participant Financial Literacy Rise?

       The primary objectives of our research were to answer two key questions concerning

workplace financial education programs. First, do employer-provided retirement planning

programs increase financial literacy and knowledge about company and national retirement

programs? Second, if financial literacy is increased, how does this enhanced knowledge affect

workers’ retirement plans? To examine the impact of financial education programs, we use the

PARS data described above, which includes merged survey responses from the five employers.

       To examine the level of financial literacy and knowledge of retirement programs prior to

the seminar, the participants were asked a series of financial literacy and retirement program

questions. The following analysis is based on 10 of these questions. The questions, along with a

summary of correct answers and percent answering correctly are reported in Table 3. As

reported in the bottom row of Table 3, the average number of correct responses prior to the

seminar is 6.2; afterwards the average number of correct answers rose to 7.5, indicating a

substantial level of learning among program participants. In general, the questions on which the



                                                13
lowest percentage of respondents gave the correct answers (P2 to P5) are those questions that

relate to Social Security eligibility ages and how Social Security benefits vary with age and over

time.7

                                                       [Table 3]

           The average knowledge score after the seminar for the entire sample is significantly

higher than the average score prior to the seminar. Figure 1 shows the distribution of

participants’ knowledge scores (the number of correct answers) before and after the seminar.

Prior to the seminar, 39 participants score a perfect 10 while 431 participants have scores of six

or lower. After the seminar, 125 participants have correct answers for all 10 questions and only

204 have a score of six or fewer.8

                                                      [Figure 1]

           Figure 2 shows the change in knowledge achieved during the seminar. Overall, 565

participants (67 percent of the sample) improved their knowledge scores. The knowledge score is

unaffected for 174 individuals (21 percent of the sample), while 101 respondents (12 percent of

7
    It should not be surprising that many older workers do not know the basic eligibility and plan
characteristics of national retirement programs. Key parameters of Social Security, Medicare, and pension
regulations are based on legislation passed at different points in time and have different objectives. As a
result, many alternative ages are specified in these programs that determine access to retirement income.
A recent study (US GAO 2007) summarized these many different retirement age-related rules ranging
from age 55, the age of eligibility for drawing certain pensions without penalties if leaving an employer,
to age 70 ½ which is the age for mandatory withdrawals from pension plans to avoid tax penalties. While
confusion over these ages is understandable, the retirement income of workers depends on their
knowledge of these ages and the timing of their retirement decisions.

    Some critical variables in the index changed between Survey One and Survey Two. In results not
shown, 31 percent of the responses in Survey One on the age at which one can begin receiving normal
Social Security benefits were too low and 20 percent were too high. Both of these percentages dropped
considerably in Survey Two; 20 percent were too low and 10 percent were too high.

the sample) show a slight decrease in their financial knowledge. Panel B illustrates the

knowledge gain sorted by the base level of financial knowledge from Survey One. Most

importantly, those with initial low scores achieve substantial increases in their knowledge of

retirement plans. Of the 431 individuals with low pre-seminar knowledge scores (6 or fewer

correct answers), 357 (83 percent) improve their knowledge scores with 40 percent achieving

increases of 3 or more additional correct answers. For this reason, we conclude that the pre-

retirement planning seminars did increase financial literacy for almost all participants, with large

gains among those with relatively little knowledge prior to the event.

                                                 [Figure 2]

       It should be emphasized that the gains in knowledge are observed across all economic

and demographic characteristics of the participants. Table 4 shows the knowledge index by

subsets of the sample based on various employee characteristics. There is a 1.3 point gain on a

10 point scale in the mean score of the entire population. Younger participants, those aged 50-61,

have a greater increase in their knowledge scores than the older participants, a gain so large that

it eliminates the age difference in knowledge observed prior to the program. Knowledge gains

also are slightly larger for those with 20 or fewer years of service than those with more than 20

years of service. Women have larger gains in knowledge than men but still have a lower

knowledge score than men after the program.

                                             [Table 4]

       Interestingly, people with lower self-assessed knowledge scores prior to the seminar have

a much larger gain in mean scores than those with a higher initial self-assessed level of

knowledge (1.50 compared to 1.06). This is another indication that the programs are beneficial to

those with relatively little knowledge of their retirement plans. There also is evidence that those



                                                 15
with some college learn more from the seminars than those with no more than a high school

education. Workers with some college start with a higher initial level of knowledge than those

who have less education (6.44 to 5.01) and the gap widens even further (7.81 to 6.16) after the

workshops. This implies that education and retirement planning programs have complementary

effects on learning. Overall, these data provide important statistical support for the conclusion

that workplace education is effective in increasing financial literacy for older workers and the

gains are often greater for those that enter the event with the lowest levels of financial literacy.

       Table 4 also shows how knowledge scores changed in each of the five companies.

Employer E had the largest increase in knowledge scores (1.75 points). This employer

introduced the seminars during our study period and invited all employees age 50 and older to

attend. Scores increased by 1.35 points or more at employers A, B, and D. The score increase

was lowest at Employer C (0.59 points), but that may be partly attributable to a relatively high

score in Survey One.

VI. Did Greater Knowledge Change Retirement Plans?

       After participating in the workplace educational event and increasing their financial

literacy, how do workers respond? Does enhanced knowledge result in changes to planned

retirement behavior and the management of retirement wealth? Table 5 compares responses

between Survey One and Survey Two for four key variables: planned retirement age, planned

age to begin receiving Social Security benefits, plans for working after retirement, and the

decision to annuitize. Although mean planned retirement age increases only slightly due to

movements in both directions, 31.1 percent of seminar participants changed planned retirement

age (as measured by their expected age of retirement on Survey Two in comparison to their

expected age of retirement as indicated on Survey One). Figure 3 demonstrates graphically how



                                                  16
planned retirement age changed between Survey One and Survey Two. There is a tendency

toward later planned retirement after Survey Two among those who initially had planned to retire

before age 65.9

                                                      [Table 5]

                                                      [Figure 3]

          Mean planned Social Security claiming age was also influenced; 36.7 percent of

respondents indicated a change in the age they plan to start receiving Social Security benefits, of

which 67.6 percent indicate plans to postpone benefit receipt.10 This variation is reasonable as

individuals are constrained in the front end (i.e., it is not possible to claim Social Security earlier

than at age 62) while one can theoretically postpone retirement indefinitely.11 Figure 4

9
    Appendix Table A-2 details the change in planned retirement age between Survey One and Survey Two.
Among those who initially planned to retire at age 62 to 64 in Survey One, 21 percent reported a later
planned retirement date in Survey Two whereas only 8 percent report an earlier date. Among those who
planned to retire at age 65 in Survey One, we find that 14 percent plan to retire earlier and 25 percent plan
to retire later after Survey Two. At an initial planned retirement age 66 and higher there is slightly more
movement toward an earlier retirement (14 percent) than there is movement toward later retirement (11
percent).
10
     Of the 89 individuals that report in Survey Two an earlier planned claiming age than stated in Survey
One, the average decline 2.34 years, with the largest change being a drop of 6 years. Of the 186
individuals which reported plans to postpone claiming Social Security, the largest change was by 11
years, with a mean of 2.31 years.
11
     There is some tendency for retirement and Social Security claiming decisions to be made in tandem as
presented in Appendix Table A-3. Among the 163 employees who decided to delay retirement, 53
percent also said that they planned to delay Social Security claiming. Most of the remaining respondents
reported no change in planned Social Security claiming, and nine percent reported earlier planned Social
Security claiming ages. Among the 66 respondents who said they planned to retire earlier, 36 percent
said they would claim Social Security earlier and 18 percent said they would delay Social Security
claiming.

                                                      17
graphically depicts how the age at which the individual plans to begin drawing on Social

Security changed between Survey One and Survey Two. There was over an 10 percentage point

increase in the number of attendees indicating plans to work after retirement, while the number

indicating uncertainty regarding plans to work after retirement dropped by 10 percentage point.

These changes in age at which to draw on retirement benefits and plans to work after retirement

may be due to a better understanding of retirement income needs and total expected retirement

wealth.

                                                 [Figure 4]

          Table 5 highlights other changes which include a shift in plans regarding pension and

supplemental retirement saving account distributions. Prior to the seminar, there was

considerable uncertainty regarding whether to annuitize account balances in supplemental

retirement plans and whether to take lump sum distributions from the defined benefit plans. Post

seminar, fewer respondents indicate uncertainty regarding these important decisions. Before the

seminar, approximately 19 percent of the sample planned to annuitize some or all of their

supplement plan funds. This increased to 26 percent after the seminar, with the proportion that

had not decided declining by 10 percentage points. However, almost half of the participants were

still undecided in regards to annuitization. Pre-seminar, approximately 27 percent of the

employees were certain that they want to take a lump sum distribution of their defined pension

benefit while 62 percent were uncertain. Responses to this set of questions post-seminar indicate

little change. These results suggest that deciding whether to take a lump sum distribution from

one’s pension or to annuitize one’s 401(k) balance are complicated decisions that require

substantial consideration.




                                                 18
       Are these changes in retirement plans associated with improved financial knowledge and

better understanding of pension plan parameters? To address this question, we use the following

framework. Before attending the retirement planning seminar, each worker has a planned

retirement age based on a host of factors including expected longevity, wealth, expected future

earnings potential, features of public and private pensions, and spousal retirement plans. During

the seminar, the employee obtains information from the various presentations, has a chance to

ask questions, and discusses retirement issues informally with other attendees. In response to

this expanded set of information, the worker will either confirm his or her original choice of

retirement age or make an adjustment toward earlier or delayed retirement.

       Formally, we model this thought process with a linear equation where the planned

retirement age (R) is a function of knowledge (Info) at a given point in time and personal

characteristics (X) related to retirement decision making (e.g., age, gender, earnings and marital

status will be reasonable proxy variables for longevity, future earnings, wealth and household

decision making). Before the seminar (t = 1), we write that the planned retirement age in period

1, R1, is a linear function of demographic characteristics, X, and the information set, Info.

                                                                      (1)

The planned retirement age after the seminar, R2, is the planned retirement age in period 1 plus

any revision to the retirement plan that is made as a function of demographic characteristics, X,

and the change in knowledge.

                                                                      (2)

In the short time between Survey One and Survey Two, we assume that Xi2=Xi1=Xi. Rearranging

equation (2), we find that the change in planned retirement age is a function of demographic




                                                 19
characteristics and the change in the information set. Equation (3) is our main regression

equation:

         Δ                                                                    (3)

The change in planned retirement age, R, will depend on: (a) how people with given values of X

reevaluate their retirement decisions (α2 and β2); (b) the effect of changes in the information set,

(γ2 ∆Info); and (3) random noise that we cannot capture in our model or data (ε2).

         In practice, workers have a probability density function for expected retirement age

instead of a 100 percent probability at a single age. We assume that workers report the age that

has the highest p-value of occurring. Changes in the probability density function would still be a

function of X and changes in Info. Empirically we estimated three closely related probit models:

the probability that R2 does not equal R1, the probability that R2>R1, and the probability that

R1>R2.

         To estimate the impact of the learning that took place at the seminar on planned

retirement age, this study focuses on the participant knowledge scores in the PARS data. We

start with an aggregate index of knowledge based on the 10 items in Table 3; this variable is

scaled to be between zero and ten. Because our focus is on planned retirement age, we also

break down this index into its four major components: (1) knowledge about Social Security and

Medicare eligibility, (2) general knowledge of public programs, (3) overall financial knowledge,

and (3) company-specific knowledge. Finally, we examine the role of each individual variable in

the knowledge score index as an independent variable. In effect this means that each knowledge

variable can have its own coefficient, whereas the aggregate index constrains the coefficients of

all 10 variables to be the same.




                                                 20
       Table 5 and Figure 3 suggest that information received during the pre-retirement seminar

did have an effect on the participant’s planned retirement age. In Table 6, we explore the effect

of this increase in financial literacy on planned retirement age by estimating the probability of a

change in planned retirement age based on the three different measures of learning. Panel A

explores the effects of an increase of financial literacy using an aggregate measure of the change

in financial knowledge (based on responses to knowledge questions before and after the seminar)

while controlling for demographics, wealth, and the individual’s employer. The change in

knowledge score variable indicates the change in the total number of correct responses for the 10

knowledge score questions. Column (1) presents the average marginal effects from a probit

regression on the probability of a change expected retirement age. Results indicate that an

increase in the aggregate knowledge score is associated with an increase in the probability of a

change in expected retirement age.

                                                 [Table 6]

       Columns (2) and (3) further define the change by presenting the average marginal effects

of a regression on the probability of a delay in expected retirement and the probability of an

earlier expected retirement, respectively. In Column (2), the change in the knowledge score

variable is positive and statistically significant which indicates that a change in knowledge score

is associated with increased probability of delaying retirement. In Column (3), the change in

knowledge score is small and statistically insignificant, indicating that a change in the aggregate

knowledge score did not lead to an increase in the probability of an earlier planned retirement.

       Table 6, Panel B presents a similar analysis, but disaggregates the change in knowledge

score to four distinct groups to better understand which areas of learning impact retirement plans.

Results presented in Table 6, Column (1) indicate that both learning about public program



                                                 21
eligibility and company-specific retirement plans lead to an increase in the probability of a

change in planned retirement age. Knowledge about the age at which an individual is eligible to

receive Social Security may have a significant impact on retirement plans if one’s prior

understanding of the eligibility for these programs was incorrect. Accordingly, a better

understanding of company specific retirement guidelines including pension plan distributions

and retiree health benefits may also influence retirement plans.

          In Table 6, Column (2), Panel B, we see that learning about public program eligibility is

associated with an increase in the probability of a delay in planned retirement. In the

specification presented in Table 6, Column (3), we see that learning about investment

diversification and inflation is associated with decrease in the probability of earlier retirement. A

better understanding of inflation could influence the employee’s perception of retirement wealth

which might make it less likely he would move up his planned retirement age.

          Table 6, Panel C further disaggregates the change in knowledge score by presenting the

change in response to each of the 10 questions. By doing so, we can determine how learning

about each individual item influenced retirement plans. In Column (1), we see that the effect of

leaning about public program eligibility is driven by learning about the age at which the

individual can receive full Social Security benefits and the age at which an individual will be

eligible for Medicare. As Social Security provides a significant source of retirement income for

the individual and health insurance is costly, a better understanding of eligibility for these two

important programs is likely to influence retirement plans.12 The results in Column (1) also

show that learning about employer pension eligibility is positively associated with a greater

12
     Supporting the claim that Medicare eligibility influences planned retirement behavior, Kopczuk and
Song (2008) use administrative files from the Master Beneficiary File to show that there are a relatively
large number of individuals who claim retirement benefits around their 65th birthday.


                                                     22
probability of a change in planned retirement age. The Social Security eligibility coefficients

for the delayed retirement probit in Column (2) are similar to those in Column (1). They have

the same sign as in Column (1), but are of smaller magnitude. The similarity between the results

presented in these two columns is due to the fact that of those that do change expected retirement

age, they tend to do so by delaying retirement.

       In Column (3), Table 6, Panel C, we see that two of the three questions included in the

“Public Program – General” index are independently statistically significant at the ten percent

level but of opposite sign. Learning that the reduction in Social Security benefits due to claiming

early retirement is permanent is, paradoxically, associated with an increase in the probability of

earlier retirement. Learning that Social Security benefits are increased by the rate of inflation is

associated with a decrease in the probability of earlier retirement. For those who thought that

benefits increased more rapidly than inflation, this information would have a negative impact on

the individual’s perceived retirement wealth which could entice him to consider an earlier date of

retirement than currently planned. This is somewhat consistent with the results for the financial

knowledge question on inflation and retirement income. Those who learned how inflation can

erode real income were less likely to change their planned retirement age to be earlier. The

relationship between knowledge and retirement plans is complex and depends on the direction of

knowledge errors. By disaggregating the knowledge score index and exploring each component

individually, we see how each piece of knowledge influences the individual’s planned retirement

age.

       Another key decision facing individuals is when to take up Social Security benefits.

Although the life-cycle framework can be used to model retirement decision making, some

behaviors are inconsistent with this approach. One such example is the spike in Social Security



                                                  23
claiming which occurs at the full retirement age (NRA). Behaghel and Blau (2012) explore the

reasons for the spike in benefits claiming that occurs at age 65 by examining the increase in the

full retirement age.13 They note that the spike may be due to an endorsement effect. As full

retirement age had been 65 since the program began and has only recently been changed,14

individuals may interpret this age as the “recommended” retirement age. It may also be that

individuals are loss adverse and are unwilling to move away from the full retirement age.

           Both of these behavioral explanations for the spike at age 65 highlight the potential

impact of learning on planned Social Security claiming behavior. Table 7 replicates the models

of Table 6 for a different retirement decision – the age at which one begins receiving Social

Security benefits. In Table 7, Panel A, we see that changes in the aggregate knowledge score are

associated with higher probability of changing one’s Social Security claiming age, higher

probability of delaying that age and higher probability of an earlier claiming age. When the

aggregate index is broken down into four major components, it is clear that Social Security

knowledge is driving the Panel A results. Table 7, Panel C confirms the role of two key Social

Security parameters: the age at which one is eligible for full or unreduced Social Security

benefits and the Medicare eligibility age. Improved knowledge for the “normal retirement age”

for Social Security is associated with greater probability of changing the Social Security

claiming.15 Improved knowledge in Medicare eligibility is associated with greater probability of


13
     In 1983, Social Security reform increased the full retirement age from 65 to 66, in two month
increments, for cohorts born from 1943-1954.
14
     The first cohort to experience the increase in full retirement age resulting for the 1983 Social Security
were those reaching their full retirement age in 2004-2009.
15
     This is consistent with findings by Song and Manchester (2007) showing that changes in the full
retirement age resulted in a shift of the spike to the new full retirement age among affected cohorts.


                                                        24
changing Social Security claiming age and greater probability of planning to claim Social

Security at an earlier age.

                                                 [Table 7]

       Looking across Tables 6 and 7, misperceptions about the ages of eligibility for normal

Social Security and Medicare are strongly related to changes in retirement plans. Appendix

Table A-4 details the planned retirement and Social Security claiming ages associated with

learning about normal Social Security eligibility. There were 113 people in the sample who

underestimated the eligibility age for normal Social Security in Survey One but correctly

reported the age in Survey Two. Within this group, 12 percent changed their planned retirement

age, 27 percent changed their planned Social Security claiming age and 26 percent changed both.

Of the 83 who overestimated this eligibility age in Survey One, 8 percent changed their planned

retirement age, 28 percent changed their planned Social Security claiming age, and 30 percent

changed both. In other words, over half of those who corrected misperceptions about normal

Social Security eligibility changed their retirement plans.

       The means presented in Table 5 indicated that plans for working after retirement and

plans for annuitizing pension wealth also shifted in response to the seminar. However, for both

of these categories the major shift was in a reduction of those reporting “have not yet decided.”

In fact, for the choice of whether to annuitize one’s pension, in Survey Two the modal response

is “have not yet decided.” We did examine how changes in financial literacy and pension

knowledge affected plans to work after retirement. In results not reported (available upon

request), we find again that changes in knowledge are related to changes in retirement plans, but

the patterns are somewhat mixed. While an increase in the aggregate knowledge score reduced




                                                 25
the probability of planning not to work after retirement by a very small 0.8 percentage points,

when disaggregating there is no consistent pattern.

VII. Conclusions

       Many older workers have a rather low level of financial literacy and understanding of

their retirement programs. Limited or inaccurate information may lead them to make poor

retirement decisions, undermining their ability to achieve retirement income adequacy. We show

how pre-retirement planning programs offered by five large employers improved financial and

pension literacy and how this changed employees’ reported retirement plans.

       Employers who offer pre-retirement planning seminars as an employee benefit are

naturally seeking to ensure that these programs are effective and valued by employees. The

feedback we received in Survey Two, conducted immediately after attending a seminar,

indicated participants had a very positive experience and believed that the seminars are helpful.

Some 95 percent of respondents state that the programs provided all or most of the information

needed for them to make important retirement decisions. Eighty-six percent of respondents rate

the programs very good or excellent, and 93 percent find the presenters and program leaders to

be very good or excellent. Eighty-seven percent of respondents report believing that they will be

able to make better retirement choices after participating in the seminar. Importantly, for

companies considering whether to provide such programs to their employees, 72 percent of

individuals report that the programs raised their awareness of the benefits provided by their

employers. Accordingly, participants give high marks to the quality of the programs, believing

that the programs provide the information they needed, and give their employers credit for

offering these programs.




                                                26
       The seminars also may be creating value for employers by reducing the transaction costs

of managing pension plans. Many employees will have the same questions which can be

answered more efficiently in a seminar environment than in one-on-one meetings with human

resource staff. Consequently, employers can facilitate the transition into retirement by providing

the means for workers to increase their understanding of key retirement concepts. The results of

this study should provide encouragement to employers considering whether to adopt pre-

retirement planning programs. Based on our assessment of these initial data, employer provided

financial education programs can increase employee knowledge of retirement programs and

assist them in making better retirement choices. This enables their employees to achieve a more

desirable retirement. Also, to the extent that the firm has designed its pension plan to optimize

employee retention and the age structure of its workforce, the seminars enhance the probability

that these corporate goals will be achieved.

at least five out of ten knowledge questions, gender, age, tenure, education, and planned retirement age.

*We were not able to obtain an exact count of seminar attendees for several of the Employer A seminars. The estimated number of
attendees reported here is based on discussions with seminar leaders and from projecting the response rate for seminars where
attendance was reported.

Notes: The PARS dataset is described in the text and in Table 1. The Health and Retirement Study
sample is from the 2008 RAND HRS Data File. The financial literacy questions were asked in
2004 financial planning module of the HRS. This table presents the mean values for participant
response for those that participated in the HRS 2008 survey for comparison to the PARS sample.
Some rows vary in sample size due to missing data. Survey weights were used to account for
complex survey design.

Notes: The numbers in each cell represent the total number of respondents that had that before/after
planned retirement age combination. “Before” ages (Survey One) are by row; “After” ages (Survey Two)
are presented in columns. The shaded boxes indicate no change in planned retirement age. The sample is
840 respondents from the PARS dataset, see the text and Table 1 for a description.

Notes: The sample is the PARS data (see Table 1 for a description) further limited to those observations
with valid Social Security age responses in both Survey One and Survey Two (N= 728). The numbers in
each cell represent the total number of respondents that had that planned retirement age and planned
Social Security claiming age combination. The shaded boxes indicate movement in sync between Social
Security claiming age and planned retirement age. “Earlier” indicates a change to an earlier age (i.e.,
where age as stated on Survey Two is less than the age stated on Survey One). “Same” indicates that the
age on Survey One is the same as age on Survey Two. “Later” indicates a change to a later age (i.e.,
where the age on Survey Two is greater than the age stated on Survey One).
