U.S.-Based Private Voluntary Organizations: Religious and Secular PVOs Engaged in
International Relief & Development

                                            ABSTRACT

We have constructed a new and substantial data set from 1939 to 2004 on U.S.-based private
voluntary organizations (PVOs) engaged in international relief and development. The universe
comprises PVOs registered with the federal government (U.S. Agency for International Development
since the early 1960s). PVOs are classified by type among secular and 14 types of religious
categories. Classifications were made for the date of founding and in 2004 (or last date of existence).
We can therefore examine shifts in classification over time—among religion types and between
religious and secular. The data set has information on revenue and expenditure for each year. We
distinguish revenue by source: federal, international organization, and private. We distinguish within
these sources by grants, contracts, in-kind and cash donations, and so on. We break down
expenditure into categories, including a division between international and domestic programs. This
data set allows us to track trends in the overall universe of PVOs and by type of PVO in terms of
numbers registered, income, expenditure, and sub-categories of income and expenditure. Analysis
can now be conducted at the individual agency and aggregate levels for PVOs engaged in
international relief and development and registered with the U.S. federal government from 1939 to
2004.

        Much of U.S. international relief and development work is carried out by private

voluntary organizations or PVOs.1 In the United States, an estimated 41% of overseas

development funds are channeled through PVOs, whereas in Japan only 2% and in the

United Kingdom 12% of development funds are estimated to flow through non-profits

(USAID [2002]). Many U.S- based PVOs are religious but a larger number in 2004 are

secular. In some cases, PVOs founded on religious principles evolved over time to

secular status. There is only one case in which a secular PVO became religious.

        Parts of our PVO study fit with our broader project on religion and political

economy, as summarized in McCleary and Barro (2006). In the PVO project, we will

assess the changing patterns among organizations of secular versus religious and among

types of religions. The present paper describes the data to be used for this analysis.

        Recent data on agencies that register with the U.S. Agency for International

Development (USAID) have been distributed by USAID. However, longer-term

information—especially before the 1980s—is difficult to locate. This omission is

significant because of the important role that U.S. based PVOs have played in

international relief and development. The difficulties in finding data reflect the ways in

which information was requested, collected, and archived by federal agencies.




1
  The term “private voluntary organization” or “PVO” refers to a non-profit (tax-exempt status)
organization that provides charitable social services, such as humanitarian assistance. The term was coined
in the early 1970s by John Yulinski, director of the Private and Voluntary Agencies Office of the U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID). Probably because of this origin, the term is usually
applied to non-profit organizations engaged in international relief and development. For example, USAID
describes PVOs as “voluntary agencies engaged in overseas relief and development.” In its reporting,
USAID treats universities as a separate form of non-profit organization. The term PVO is also used by
InterAction, which is the largest association of U.S.-based international relief and development
organizations. InterAction’s membership, which overlaps to a large extent with USAID’s registry,
includes more than 160 PVOs. We prefer the term PVO to “NGO” (non-governmental agency), which can
be construed to include for-profit corporations.

           We have been working for several years on the construction of a panel data set on

revenue and expenditure since 1939 for U.S.-based PVOs engaged in international relief

and development. This paper focuses on the description of this data set.

           Our universe consists of PVOs registered with USAID and predecessor

government agencies—the President’s Committee on War Relief Agencies (1939-42), the

War Relief Control Board (1942-46), the Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid

(1946-51), and the Foreign Operations Administration/International Cooperation

Administration (1953-61). Using these sources, we have assembled data for fiscal years

going from 1939 to 2004, excluding a few years for which USAID reports were not

prepared: 1975-1977, 1979, and 1982.2 The months applicable to fiscal years vary

across PVOs; hence, the assignments of numbers to particular calendar years involve

some degree of approximation.

           Sources of data, aside from reports of the government agencies, include PVO

annual reports, U.S. State Department documents, and Internal Revenue Service

documents. PVO revenue break down into federal, other governmental (including

international organizations), and private. When the information is available, federal

receipts are distinguished by type of program—grants, contracts, freight, food, and

property. Dollar values given for in-kind programs, such as freight and surplus food, are

based on market values estimated by USAID and other governmental agencies. Private

revenue divides among in-kind donations, cash donations, and other revenue. On the

expenditure side, program outlays break down into foreign and U.S. programs. Two

other categories of spending are administration and fundraising. Table 1, based on the

system used in recent USAID reports, shows the categories of revenue and expenditure in
2
    These years refer to budget periods, not dates of publication.

which the data have been compiled. In earlier years, less disaggregation by category is

available.

        During the 65 years covered in this study, 1693 US-based PVOs registered with

the U.S. federal government. The label “U.S.-based” means that an agency has received

501(c)(3) tax-exempt charitable status with the U.S. government. The organization might

have been founded in another country; for example, Save the Children Federation

originated in England. Each PVO is classified by date of establishment. When this date

could not be ascertained, we classified by the legal ruling year, which tends to be a few

years after establishment.

        We have established a classification scheme with 16 categories of PVOs—

secular, 14 forms of religious, and unclassified. The setup is shown in Table 2. After

extensive research—using PVO annual reports, InterAction membership data, and other

information—we have been able to assign almost all PVOs to one of the 15 classified

categories. The remaining unclassified organizations constitute a negligible part of total

PVO revenue and expenditure.

        We classified each agency by type at founding and in 2004 (or at the agency’s

final year of existence). These designations give some basis for tracking changes over

time in the nature of each organization. Overall, we identified 60 cases of changed

classification. (Often these changes involve a gradual transition; hence, we do not isolate

the particular year of change.) Among the 60 changes, 42 constitute shifts from religious

to secular, 17 among religion types, and 1 from secular to religious.3 The largest PVOs

to undergo a change are World Vision (shift from Evangelical to Faith-Founded

3
 This PVO is Conservation Foundation, set up in England to preserve ancient yew trees. Many of these
trees were on Anglican owned land, and this fact likely motivated the foundation to switch from secular to
Ecumenical Christian.

Christian, with 2004 real revenue of $388 million), Food for the Poor (Catholic to Faith-

Founded Christian, 2004 revenue of $338 million), Christian Children’s Fund (Protestant

to Secular, 2004 revenue of $85 million), Northwest Medical Teams International

(Evangelical to Faith-Founded Christian, 2004 revenue of $78 million), and Mercy Corps

International (Ecumenical Christian to Faith-Founded Christian, 2004 revenue of $74

million).

       For the numbers discussed in this paper, we classified PVOs by type in 2004 or at

the agency’s final year of existence. Thus, for example, World Vision is included with

Faith-Founded Christian, rather than Evangelical, and Food for the Poor is classed as

Faith-Founded Christian, rather than Catholic.

       To classify registered PVOs, we used information from PVO annual reports,

InterAction documents, and publications from other umbrella organizations and

independent “watch-dog” groups. However, many of these organizations rely on self-

reporting by the PVOs. For example, InterAction—the largest umbrella organization for

U.S.-based PVOs working in international relief and development—does not verify

information submitted by member PVOs. Three websites—Guidestar, Charity Navigator,

and Ministry Watch—check information submitted to them and have a rating scheme for

PVOs. In addition, most PVOs have their own website. We also used the annual

membership directories of the National Council of Churches of Christ, USA. When

information could not be obtained from these sources, we relied on written histories of

PVOs, as well as telephone interviews and e-mail correspondence. In every case, we

sought to cross-check the information provided on each PVO.




                                            6
        Financial data collection took place on several levels. For the purposes of

determining sources of funds and goods (e.g., gifts-in-kind, federal surplus goods), data

were gathered from U.S. government reports, including USAID Voluntary Agencies

reports (VolAgs)4 and data contained in the U.S. National Archives and the Bureau of

Population, Refugees, and Migration. InterAction annual membership directories

contain financial data reported by PVOs. We used the archives of the American Council

of Voluntary Agencies for Foreign Service (ACVAFS), kept at the Rutgers University

Special Collections Department. Private individuals generously provided copies of

documents from Private Agencies in International Development (PAID), ACVAFS, and

InterAction. Financial data were also obtained from the Evangelical Council for

Financial Accountability (ECFA), PVO annual reports, and IRS Form 990 tax-exemption

filings. Recent information is available online for most PVOs at www.guidestar.org and

on organizational websites.

        Table 2 shows that we identified seven types of Christian PVOs: Mainline

Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, Evangelical, Christian Faith-Founded, Christian

Ecumenical, and Christian Other. We followed Steensland, et al. (2000) in their

classification of Protestant religions in the United States. In the case of the Unitarian

Universal Association, we broke with Steensland, et al and coded the denomination as

mainline Protestant (following Shibley [1996] and Ammerman [2005]).

        With regard to Catholic PVOs, we relied on the Catholic Network of Volunteer

Service and the U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops, The Official Catholic Directory.

Catholic Relief Services is the only Catholic PVO in our sample that received a portion

of its funding directly from the U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops through an annual

national collection in the parishes.

        Coding Christian Faith-Founded organizations proved more complicated. We

define “faith-founded” as an organization based on religious principles or values but with

no formal affiliation with an organized religion. For organizations that identified their

religious values as drawn from a particular organized religion, we classified by the type

of organized religion; for example, mainline Protestant. For Christian organizations that

held that their religious values came from no particular organized religion, we identified

them as Christian Faith-Founded. Christian agencies based on at least two specific

Christian religions or denominations are classified as Christian Ecumenical. PVOs

classified as “inter-faith” are formed by at least two distinct major religious or spiritual

traditions; in particular, not all Christian.

        Evangelical PVOs are characterized by their doctrine, which emphasizes

evangelicalism. As a group, they accept basic tenets—the inerrancy of the Bible and its

authority as the sole source of God’s word, the deity of Jesus as Christ and personal

salvation through him, and the sharing of the conversion experience with others (Shibley

[1996, p 10], Hunter [1983, pp. 32, 35], Quebedeaux [1978, p. 7]). Evangelical PVOs

can be humanitarian agencies of denominations (e.g. Adventist Development and Relief

Agency), agencies of para-churches (e.g. International Association of Missions and

Vineyard Churches), or independent faith-founded evangelical agencies (e.g. World

Vision in its initial form). In classifying evangelical PVOs, we referred to membership

directories of the Association of Evangelical Relief and Development Organizations

(AERDO), the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE), the Evangelical Fellowship

Evangelical Alliance, and the Evangelism and Missions Information Service’s Mission

        Our research focuses on U.S. based PVOs that are involved in international relief

and development. In order to appear in our sample, PVOs must register with the relevant

federal agency, USAID since the early 1960s.5 Since a key criterion for registration is

orientation toward international relief and development, there is some correspondence

between the sample universe and our research focus. However, PVOs differ greatly in

the extent of their activities geared toward international programs. Most purely domestic

PVOs do not register with USAID—and are, therefore, not in our sample—but some

registered PVOs have international activities that comprise only a small part of their

overall programs. For example, international program expenditure of the American

National Red Cross is less than 1% of total program outlay in many years.

        To gauge the extent of international orientation of each PVO, we use data on

international and domestic program expenditure. At present, we have these data for

1946-1952 and 1967-2004 (excluding the years of missing USAID reports: 1975-77,

1979, and 1982). We calculated the international fraction of activity (international

program outlay divided by total program outlay) for each PVO and year with available

data. We estimated international fractions for years of missing data (1939-1945 and

1953-1966) by interpolating or extrapolating the data for each individual PVO.6 We then

adjusted each dollar item—for example, total revenue—by multiplying by the

  The American National Red Cross is an exception because we included this PVO in our sample (based on
its own reporting) even before its registration with USAID in the mid 1980s. We made this exception
because the Red Cross was so large in terms of overall revenue and expenditure. However, in terms of
international programs, the Red Cross is not one of the larger PVOs in most years.

international fraction. This procedure gives estimates of the internationally oriented part

of each dollar item, such as total revenue. Thereby, we can include in our data set on a

consistent basis PVOs with very different degrees of international orientation. We divide

each dollar item by the consumer price index (with a base of 1983-84 = 1.0) to measure

real values.



Overview of the Data

         Figures 1-7 display some important features of the data. We consider first a

breakdown of total PVOs by secular, religious, and unclassified. Then we assess the

breakdown of religious PVOs (14 types) in terms of the 8 groups that comprise most

PVO activity by numbers and dollars: Mainline Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, Christian

Faith-Founded, Christian Ecumenical, Evangelical, Jewish, and Muslim.

         Figure 1 shows numbers for all PVOs and for the breakdown between secular and

religious. (Unclassified numbers are comparatively small.) The total number of PVOs

rose early in World War II from 239 in 1939 to 386 in 1940 and 422 in 1941. Then the

number plunged during the war because of the government’s efforts to eliminate

duplication of programs.7 This consolidation reduced the total number of PVOs to 102 in

1946 and 59 in 1948. Subsequently, the number rose in most years, reaching 510 in




7
 The Neutrality Act of 1939 prohibited certain types of economic relations with countries designated as
“belligerent” by the President. As a consequence, all PVOs (except for the American National Red Cross,
which had its own charter with Congress) were required to register with the Department of State if they
were engaged in relief efforts in the belligerent countries. In 1942, by executive order, the President’s War
Relief Board was set up to coordinate overseas shipments of relief supplies by PVOs. Registration with the
War Relief Board became mandatory for PVOs seeking to operate overseas and to assist refugees. The
combination of the Neutrality Act and the War Relief Board gave the U.S. government great power over
PVOs. Thus, the government could readily achieve its objective when it wished to reduce the number of
PVOs (to eliminate duplication of effort).


                                                     10
2004. Growth was particularly rapid in the late 1980s/early 1990s, when the number

increased from 178 in 1986 to 417 in 1993.

       The number of religious PVOs was 42 in 1939 (18% of the total), 67 in 1940

(17%), and 61 in 1941 (14%). The number fell during World War II but at a slower rate

than for secular PVOs. Hence, the religious fraction increased—the 33 in 1946 and 22 in

1948 were 32% and 37%, respectively, of the total. Through the early 1960s, the relative

number of religious PVOs continued to grow—the 29 religious PVOs in 1962 comprised

52% of the total. Then the pattern reversed, with the number of secular PVOs growing

faster—in 1983, the 46 religious PVOs were 27% of the total. After a recovery to 34% in

1988, the proportion of religious PVOs declined again to 26% in 1994. Since then, the

number of religious PVOs has grown faster than the secular number. In 2004, the 171

religious PVOs were 34% of the total.

       Figures 2 and 3 show the breakdown of numbers of religious PVOs into eight

main types. In 1940, the composition was 39% Catholic, 22% Jewish, 16% Mainline

Protestant, 10% Evangelical, and 6% Faith-Founded Christian. During the war, the

biggest change in the relative numbers was the decline in Catholic. In 1946, the

distribution was 36% Jewish, 24% Mainline Protestant, 15% Evangelical, 12% Faith-

Founded Christian, and only 3% Catholic (with the single agency being the predecessor

to Catholic Relief Services). In the post-World War II period, the most striking changes

were the rise in Evangelical and Faith-Founded Christian numbers and the relative

decline in Jewish numbers. In 2004, the breakdown was 48% Evangelical, 14% Faith-

Founded Christian, 9% Mainline Protestant, 8% Catholic, 6% Ecumenical Christian, 5%

Jewish, and 2% Muslim.




                                             11
       Figure 4 shows the evolution of total real revenue for all PVOs and for secular

versus religious. (The unclassified category is negligible throughout.) During World

War II, the pattern of real revenue for all PVOs differed from that for numbers of PVOs

because—after 1941—rising real revenue was concentrated among a sharply diminishing

number of agencies. For all PVOs, real revenue (1983-84 dollars) increased from $162

million in 1940 to $1.4 billion in 1945, fell to $1.1 billion in 1946 and a low point of

$263 million in 1952, then advanced to $6.8 billion in 2004. The average growth rate

over 65 years (1939-2004) was 5.8% per year.

       For religious PVOs, real revenue rose from $30 million in 1940 (18% of the total)

to $387 million in 1945 (27%), then peaked at $571 million in 1946 (50%).

Subsequently, revenue of religious PVOs fell at a slower rate than secular, so the low

point of religious revenue of $205 million in 1952 represented 78% of the total.

Thereafter, religious and secular revenue both tended to increase, but religious revenue

typically grew at a slower rate. Therefore, the religious share of total revenue fell to 41%

in 1995. Subsequently, this share recovered to 50% in 2004. (Since religious PVOs in

2004 were only 34% by number, the size in terms of revenue of the typical religious PVO

was larger than that of the typical secular PVO.) An important part of our future research

will be to relate the time patterns of religious and secular PVOs—revenue and numbers—

to the U.S. political climate, changes in U.S. and world religious participation, world

events such as wars and other disasters, and additional variables.

       Figures 5 and 6 break down the real revenue of religious PVOs among eight

major denominations. The fraction of total revenue accounted for by Jewish agencies

was a remarkable 72% in 1940 (although Jewish PVOs were then only 22% by number).




                                             12
In 1946, the revenue shares were 60% Jewish, 15% Catholic, 10% Mainline Protestant,

6% Ecumenical Christian, 4% Evangelical, and 3% Faith-Founded Christian. The most

striking changes thereafter were the declines in the Jewish and Mainline Protestant shares

and the rises in the Evangelical and Faith-Founded Christian shares. In 2004, the

percentages of total revenue for religious PVOs were 43% Evangelical, 31% Faith-

Founded Christian, 12% Catholic, 6% Jewish, 3% Ecumenical Christian, 3% Mainline

Protestant, and 1% Muslim. Other religions (Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Inter-Faith, and other

religions) accounted for less than 1%. Another part of our work will attempt to relate the

changes in the religious composition of PVO activity—revenue and numbers of

agencies—to changing religion preferences in the United States and the world and to

other variables. For example, the relative decline of Jewish PVO revenue relates to the

fall in Jewish refugee numbers and the success of the state of Israel.

       Reported federal funding for PVOs became significant only in 1950. For all

PVOs, the shares of federal funding in total PVO revenue averaged 23% from 1950 to

1954, 58% from 1955 to 1966, 37% from 1967 to 1986, 31% from 1987 to 1995, and

26% from 1996 to 2004. Thus, the high point for the federal share of PVO dollars was

reached during the Eisenhower-Kennedy-Johnson years (1955-1966) and has since

declined sharply.

       Figure 7 shows the evolution of the federal share of total revenue for all PVOs

and for secular versus religious. For a few years in the 1950s, federal support favored

religious PVOs, in the sense that their share of revenue from federal sources was greater

than that for secular PVOs. However, from 1955 to 1966, the federal shares for secular

and religious PVOs were similar, with both averaging 58%. The federal share for




                                             13
religious PVOs fell sharply in 1967 and, thereby, became much smaller than that for

secular PVOs. From 1967 to 1985, the federal share averaged 54% for secular PVOs,

compared to 29% for religious. The federal share for secular PVOs fell starting in the

mid 1980s, and the share for religious PVOs continued to decline. Thus, for 1986 to

1995, the shares averaged 39% for secular and 24% for religious, and from 1996 to 2004,

the shares averaged 36% for secular and 15% for religious.

       Another way to look at federal support is to consider the number of PVOs that

received zero federal dollars. From 1953 to 2004, 38% of PVO-year observations (3638

out of 9652) showed zero federal revenue. The overall percentage breaks down into 34%

for secular PVOs versus 45% for religious. In 2004, 41% of all PVOs (207 out of 510)

reported zero federal support. The breakdown here was 34% for secular and 54% for

religious. These comparisons of federal support for secular versus religious PVOs in

recent years may help to explain the Bush administration’s efforts to channel more

federal welfare dollars through religiously based organizations.

       Among religious PVOs, the shares of federal funding in total revenue varied a

great deal over time and by type of religion. Catholic usually had the largest share

coming from federal sources, averaging 70% from 1955 to 1988 and 49% from 1989 to

2004. (The federal share for Catholic Relief Services averaged 69% from 1955 to 2004.)

Ecumenical Christian averaged 65% of its revenue from federal sources from 1955 to

1967 but only 19% from 1968 to 2004. Mainline Protestant was also high early on in its

federal share—averaging 52% from 1955 to 1965 but only 18% from 1966 to 2004.

Evangelical averaged 34% from 1955 to 1967 but only 11% from 1968 to 2004. The

federal share for Faith-Founded Christian was 19% from 1961 to 2004, not counting the




                                            14
77% average for 1985-86 (reflecting assistance for the famine in Ethiopia). The federal

share for Jewish PVOs averaged only 7% from 1955 to 2004. In 2004, there was a broad

range in shares of revenue coming from federal sources: 51% for Catholic, 31% for

Muslim, 23% for Faith-Founded Christian, 13% for Ecumenical Christian, 7% for

Mainline Protestant, 5% for Evangelical, and 1% for Jewish.

         We will study in our research how federal funding influences the growth of PVO

real revenues—some preliminary results are reported in the next section. We will also

distinguish the type of federal funding, such as grants versus contracts and in-kind versus

cash. We will similarly assess the role of support received from international

organizations.

         Table 3, Panels A-I shows the largest PVOs in selected years. The rankings are

based on total real revenue, adjusted, as discussed before, for the share of program

outlays in international programs.8 The years covered are 2004, 2000, 1990, 1980, 1970,

1960, 1950, 1945, and 1940. Each panel shows the 10 largest religious PVOs and 10

largest secular PVOs in the indicated year. The revenues of these top-10 organizations

can be compared with the totals for all religious and all secular PVOs—these totals are

also shown in the panels.

         Figures 8 and 9 use histograms to show the distribution of PVO real revenue by

size in two selected years: 2004 and 1980. When related to real revenue on a

proportionate scale (the horizontal axis), the size distribution has a familiar bell-shaped

appearance that seems to approximate a normal distribution.9 If one plots instead the size

  Without this adjustment, the American National Red Cross would be the largest PVO in our data set in
most years.

  That is, since the log of real revenue appears on the horizontal axis, real revenue may be roughly log-
normally distributed.

distribution of real federal revenue, the main difference is that many organizations

receive zero federal dollars. As noted before, in the years since 1953 (where reported

federal revenue first appears), 38% of the PVO-year observations are zeroes. We will use

these data to study how the extent of concentration of total and federal revenue has

evolved over time.



Some statistical findings

           Growth of PVOs

           We have assessed growth of the sizes of individual PVOs, gauged by real

revenue. We have examined how this growth depends on the current size of a PVO (the

log of the level of real revenue) and on prior shares of PVO revenue generated from

federal sources and from international organizations.

           A regression for the annual growth rate of real revenue is10

           DREVt = -1.55*log(REVt-1) + 0.0448*[log(REVt-1)]2 + 0.116*FEDSHAREt-1
                   (0.14)             (0.0048)                (0.058)

                            + 0.091*IOSHAREt-1 ,
                             (0.108)

where standard errors of coefficients are in parentheses. The dependent variable—the

growth rate of real revenue, DREVt—is computed as the log of year t’s real revenue,

REVt, less the log of the previous year’s real revenue, REVt-1. The regression has 7407

observations between 1941 and 2004 on 974 distinct PVOs. The regression includes

fixed effects; that is, separate constant terms for each PVO. Since the estimation uses

second lags of levels of real revenue, REVt-2, the sample includes only PVO-year

observations for PVOs that reported non-zero revenue in the current and at least the
10
     This panel regression was run with the STATA program.


                                                   16
previous two years; that is, for three consecutive years.11 (The full sample of

observations on real revenue is 11524 and on the growth rate of real revenue is 8931.)

The mean of the dependent variable for the sample of 7407 observations included in the

regression is -0.011; that is, a growth rate of -1.1% per year. The full sample of growth

rates—which comprises the 8931 observations with positive revenue in at least two

consecutive years—has a positive mean, 0.023.

         The variable FEDSHARE is the ratio of revenue coming from federal sources to

total revenue, and the variable IOSHARE is the ratio of revenue coming from

international organizations (and other governments) to total revenue. The regression

shows that the estimated coefficient on the one-year-lag of the federal-share variable is

positive and significantly different from zero. An increase in this share by 10 percentage

points predicts that a PVO’s real revenue growth would rise by 1.2% per year. (The

sample mean of the federal-share variable is 0.19, with a standard deviation of 0.27.)

Thus, there is some evidence that greater generosity from the federal government tends to

promote growth in a PVO’s overall activity.

         The estimated coefficient of the IO-share variable in the regression is similar in

magnitude to that for the federal share. However, the estimated coefficient of IOSHARE

differs insignificantly from zero. (The sample mean of the IO-share variable is 0.04, with

a standard deviation of 0.12.) Thus, we do not have much evidence about the impact of

funding from international organizations on the growth of a PVO’s overall activity.




11
  The dependent variable, the growth rate of real revenue, depends on the lagged level of real revenue,
log(REVt-1). Consequently, the estimated coefficients of log(REVt-1) and its square can be biased; for
example, if there is measurement error in real revenue. As an attempt to correct for this problem, the
estimation uses the second lag, log(REVt-2), and the square of this second lag as instruments.


                                                    17
           The level of real revenue enters on the right-hand side of the regression as the log

of the previous year’s real revenue, log(REVt-1). The squared value of this variable,

[log(REVt-1)]2, also enters into the regression. The estimated coefficient of each variable

is statistically significantly different from zero. The pattern of a negative linear term and

positive squared term means that the estimated effect of greater scale (higher real

revenue) on the growth rate is negative when the level of real revenue is small. Thus, at

low levels, smaller real revenue predicts higher growth of real revenue. This pattern

constitutes “convergence,” in the sense that smaller scale tends to generate higher growth

and, thereby, larger scale in the future.

           Because of the positive coefficient on the square term, [log(REVt-1)]2, the

magnitude of the effect of the level of real revenue on the growth rate diminishes as the

level of real revenue rises. At the sample mean for the log of real revenue (a value of

14.2), the net effect is -0.27; that is, an increase in the level of real revenue by 10% tends

to reduce the growth rate by 2.7% per year. At still higher real revenue, the net effect

eventually changes sign and becomes positive. For example, at the maximum real

revenue in the sample (where the log of real revenue is 20.7, corresponding to almost $1

billion12), the net effect is 0.31. This pattern implies that, for the largest PVOs, there is

no tendency for increases in size (level of real revenue) to retard the growth rate of real

revenue. In fact, there may be a range of very large PVOs where increases in scale tend

to generate higher subsequent growth—a divergence pattern that contrasts with the

convergence relation found for small PVOs.



           Composition of PVO revenue

     The value of $967 million is for United Israel Appeal in 1973, the year of the Yom Kippur War.


                                                      18
        A key empirical pattern among religious PVOs (Figures 5 and 6) is the dramatic

growth of real revenue for Evangelical PVOs, especially since the mid 1980s. The Faith-

Founded Christian group also increases sharply over this period, whereas Jewish

organizations show substantial decline. Our preliminary examination of GSS (General

Social Survey) data suggests that these patterns cannot be readily explained from shifts

over time in the composition of religion denominations or from shifts in religiosity.



        The Rise of Evangelical PVOs. Although the GSS data begin in 1972, data that

can be used to assess the extent of Evangelical growth start in 1984. Evangelicals appear

in the GSS data mainly within the broad group designated as “Protestant” and, to a minor

extent, in “other” categories. The fraction of the overall population in the GSS Protestant

group declined from 0.64 in 1984 to 0.53 in 2002. (The increases were in no religion—

from 0.07 to 0.13—and in religions other than Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish—from

0.014 to 0.067.)

        Within the Protestant group, it is difficult to use the GSS data to gauge the extent

of Evangelicals from the available numbers on adherence to specific denominations

(along with classifications from other sources on which denominations are Evangelical).

However, the GSS reports in most years since 1984 the extent to which respondents

regard the Bible as the literal word of God—a key belief of Evangelicals. Within the

Protestant group, the fraction of respondents with this Evangelical view of the Bible fell

from 0.49 in 1984 and 0.47 in 1985 to 0.45 in 2000 and 0.41 in 2002. This pattern

suggests stable or falling belief in literal interpretation of the Bible; surely not increasing

belief. Thus, the GSS data on numbers of Protestants and beliefs within the Protestant




                                              19
group do not suggest that the share of Evangelicals in the population rose strongly since

the mid 1980s—the period where real revenue of Evangelical PVOs soared (Figure 6).

        Part of the increase in the size of Evangelical PVOs, compared especially to

Mainline Protestant PVOs, may reflect differences in organizational structures. In terms

of fundraising, denominational PVOs are not permitted to solicit funds from

congregations. Instead, relief and development offices of denominations raise funds from

local congregations and contribute a portion of these funds to the denomination’s

humanitarian agencies. Thus, the hierarchical structure of mainline Protestant

denominations defines the nature of fundraising and the designation of funds (Vallet

1995: 93-95). Several studies conducted on congregational giving found that the decline

in denominational tithing was due to congregants viewing the required apportionment as

a tax rather than a ministry (Olson and Caddell 1993) and resenting denominational

control over funding priorities (Hoge et al 1996; Dykstra and Hudnut-Beumler 1992).

        Traditional Evangelical PVOs—such as Mennonite Central Committee, Brethren

Service Commission, World Relief, and Adventist Development and Relief Agency—are

similar to Mainline Protestant PVOs in denominational structure. In contrast, recently

formed Evangelical PVOs—such as Feed the Children, MAP International, World

Concern Development Organization, and World Vision (which we classified as shifting

later from Evangelical to Faith-Founded Christian)—tend to have a flat structure,

involving relations with para-churches.13 This structure cuts across denominational

loyalties and allows for fund-raising from a broad base of adherents (Quebedeaux 1978:

110-111; Stafford 1997: 22-23). In effect, these new organizational forms may have been

13
   A para-church is defined by J.A. Youngren (1981: 39-40) as a “not-for-profit, organized Christian
ministry to spiritual, mental and physical needs, working outside denominational control.” For a broader
discussion of the term, see Wesley K. Willmer and J. David Schmidt, with Martyn Smith (1998: 12-28).


                                                   20
a technological innovation that facilitated PVO fund-raising. This change may account

for the growth of revenue for Evangelical PVOs (and also some Faith-Founded Christian

PVOs), compared to revenue of PVOs affiliated with the traditional faiths (Mainline

Protestant, Catholic, Ecumenical Christian, and Jewish).



       The Decline of Jewish PVOs. Real revenue of Jewish PVOs declined in absolute

terms and especially in relative terms since the mid 1970s. The GSS numbers indicate

reasonable stability in the share of the U.S. population that self-identifies as Jewish—

around 2%—from 1984 to 2002. Thus, changes in numbers of U.S. Jews are likely not

the key to changes in Jewish PVO revenue.

       It is apparent from Figure 6 that some of the variations in the revenue of Jewish

PVOs relate to conditions that affect Jewish refugees and the state of Israel. During and

after World War II, giving for refugees and the new Israeli state were critical. Later,

there were sharp peaks in Jewish PVO revenue associated with the Six-Day War in 1967

(revenue jumped from $92 million in 1966 to $786 million in 1967), the Yom Kippur

War in 1973 (revenue rose from $601 million in 1972 to $1.12 billion in 1973), and the

Gulf War in 1991 (revenue increased from $475 million in 1990 to $717 million in 1991).

After each of these crises, real revenue of Jewish PVOs declined.

       The longer-term decline in revenue of Jewish PVOs also relates to changes in the

type of giving by U.S. Jews. The United Jewish Communities reported in 2004 that 62%

of American Jews engaged in philanthropy donated more to non-Jewish causes than to

Jewish federations and causes (Chronicle of Philanthropy 2004). Attributing the decline

in Jewish philanthropy to assimilation and its impact on Jewish identity is too simplistic




                                            21
(Gal and Gottschalk, 2001). However, the political and philanthropic choices of a

younger generation of Jews that grew up with the existence of the Israeli state are a

relevant issue (Tobin 2001). As the Israeli state became economically developed,

donations from American Jewry waned. Although the 1991 Gulf War and the beginning

of peace negotiations with the Palestinians (Madrid Conference in 1991) spurred a spike

in private giving, contributions fell off subsequently. Moreover, in response to the

changed international scene, Jewish federations allocated a smaller percentage of their

funds to overseas activities.

       Another shift in Jewish charitable giving is from established federations to a more

individualistic style of donating. (Jewish Funders Network has a membership of over

850 donors with combined assets of $30 billion.) Rimor and Tobin (1990) found a

pattern of “generalized giving” among Jews that explains their giving to non-Jewish

causes. Jews tend to be generous as a group and value philanthropic activity. Linking all

three explanations—the maturity of the state of Israel, the shift to individualistic

donating, and generalized giving—Rimor and Tobin (1990; Tobin 2001: 5-6) find that

private charitable giving by U.S. Jews has not declined but has shifted away from

federations and become more diluted (spread out among Jewish and non-Jewish causes).



Conclusions

       This paper describes a new and substantial data set on U.S. based private

voluntary organizations engaged in international relief and development. The universe

consists of private voluntary organizations (PVOs) registered with the federal

government from 1939 to 2004.




                                             22
       We observed that the lower federal revenue shares for religious PVOs versus

secular ones in recent years may help to explain the Bush administration’s efforts to

channel more federal welfare dollars through religiously based organizations. Even with

lower federal revenue, the size of total revenue for the average religious PVO was larger

than that for the typical secular PVO. This means that religious PVOs are attracting

private funding a higher rate than secular ones. Our future research will assess changing

PVO dependence on federal assistance and the evolution of private sources of support.

We will also analyze the extent to which PVO programs dovetail with U.S. foreign policy

objectives and the extent to which federal assistance influences the PVOs’ missions and

operations.

       In terms of data collection, we plan substantial additional work on the expenditure

side. As far as the data permit, we will classify PVO program expenditure by type of

activity and geographical location. We are also looking further into the period of missing

data (1939-45 and 1953-66) for the breakdown of program outlay into international and

domestic components.

Notes: Total revenue is the dollar value in millions divided by the consumer price index
(1983-84=1.0) and then multiplied by the fraction of international program outlay in total
program expenditure. The international fraction comes from data for 1946-1952 and
1967-2004 (excluding missing years of 1975-77, 1979, 1982) and is estimated for other
years. Grand totals include unclassified PVOs. Classifications of PVOs in these tables
are based on the status in 2004 or the final year of existence.
