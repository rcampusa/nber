                                            ABSTRACT

Using nationally representative data on consumption, we show that Blacks and Hispanics devote larger
shares of their expenditure bundles to visible goods (clothing, jewelry, and cars) than do comparable
Whites. We demonstrate that these differences exist among virtually all sub-populations, that they
are relatively constant over time, and that they are economically large. While racial differences in
utility preference parameters might account for a portion of these consumption differences, we emphasize
instead a model of status seeking in which conspicuous consumption is used to reflect a household's
economic position relative to a reference group. Using merged data on race and state level income,
we demonstrate that a key prediction of our model -- that visible consumption should be declining
in mean reference group income -- is strongly borne out in the data separately for each racial group.
Moreover, we show that accounting for differences in reference group income characteristics explains
most of the racial difference in visible consumption. We conclude with an assessment of the role of
conspicuous consumption in explaining lower spending by racial minorities on items likes health and
education, as well as their lower rates of wealth accumulation.

1.       Introduction

         In his famous study of consumption during the Gilded Age, Veblen (1899) speculated

that, for the particular individuals he studied, “Consumption is evidence of wealth, and thus

becomes honorific, and …failure to consume a mark of demerit.”                         This notion that an aim of

consumption was to demonstrate one’s economic position to observers Veblen dubbed

“conspicuous consumption”. Veblen’s focus was on the very wealthy, but nothing in the main

thrust of his argument requires that the phenomenon he identified apply to these households

exclusively.1     In this paper, we study households’ consumption of items which are readily

observable in social interactions, and which are portable across interactions. We call these goods

“visible consumption”. Prompted by Veblen’s insight that the consumption and display of these

items communicates information about economic status, and by the fact that few easily

observable variables are as strongly correlated with economic status as is an individual’s race, we

investigate a series of questions about visible consumption and race.

         A large body of anecdotal evidence suggests that Blacks devote a larger share of their

overall expenditure to consumption items that are readily visible to outside observers than do

Whites. Automobiles, clothing, and jewelry are examples of these forms of "visible"

consumption. There has to date, however, been little formal analysis by economists of the degree

to which these racial differences in consumption patterns actually exist in the data, what accounts

for them if they do, and what the consequences of any such differential expenditure might be.2, 3

We address these questions in this paper.

         The first part of our paper documents differences by race in expenditures devoted to

visible consumption items. Using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) from the

1
  In fact, predating Veblen’s analysis by a hundred and forty years, Adam Smith argued that the desire for rank, and the
display of wealth associated with it, is nearly a universal feature of human behavior (Smith (1759)).
2
  One exception is an early piece by Alexis (1970) who examined racial differences in consumption patterns between
1935 and 1960 using data from The Consumer Purchases Survey: 1935-36 and early waves of the Federal Reserve’s
Survey of Consumer Finances. Similar to the findings we present below, Alexis found that Blacks were much more
likely to spend on clothing (as a share of total expenditure) than similar Whites.
3
  Outside of economics, there is also limited work on the consumption patterns of Blacks. Examples include Mullins
(1999), Lamont and Molnar (2001), and Chambers (2006).


                                                                                                                      1
period of 1986-2002, we show that although, unconditionally, racial minorities and Whites spend

approximately the same fraction of their resources on visible consumption, Blacks and Hispanics

spend about thirty percent more on visible goods, after accounting for differences in permanent

income. These expenditure differences are found within all sub-groups, except older households.

We find that these racial gaps have been relatively constant over the past seventeen years. And,

we show that spending on housing or differential treatment in the housing market cannot explain

these patterns. Finally, the gaps are economically large: the absolute level annual dollar

differential for visible consumption is on the order of $2300, which is a non-trivial quantity given

Black and Hispanic average income.

          Because household spending must satisfy an inter-temporal budget constraint, spending

devoted to visible consumption must be diverted from some alternative use. Reduced spending

on specific types of current consumption on the one hand and lower savings (future consumption)

on the other are the two possibilities. We show that the higher visible spending of racial

minorities seems to come out of both future consumption and all other categories of current

consumption: Blacks consume less than Whites in essentially every other expenditure category

(aside from housing) to maintain higher visible consumption.4

          What theoretical explanation accounts for these facts? One argument is that racial

differences in expenditure on visible items derives simply from racial differences in preferences -

that minorities spend more on jewelry, cars and apparel because they like these items more than

Whites.     This argument is consistent with the basic facts, but it essentially tautological.

Moreover, an argument centered on racial differences in preferences yields no prediction that is

falsifiable in the data. An alternative explanation presumes that utility functions are the same

across race, but that some external consideration makes people from different races place


4
  As discussed below, housing may be considered a visible good. In fact, we do find that Blacks and Hispanics spend
more on housing than do comparable Whites. Our results (in terms of dollar magnitudes) get slightly stronger if we
include housing as a component of visible consumption. But, given the large literature on racial differences in housing
(which can explain the housing expenditure differences), we err on the side of caution by excluding housing from our
base measure of visible goods.


                                                                                                                     2
different marginal valuations on visible consumption items. Apart from the fact that it does not

simply assume that Blacks behave differently from Whites because they have different

preferences, an argument of this form yields additional predictions beyond the basic facts

described above which should hold within a racial group, and which can also be empirically

tested.

          The alternative explanation we emphasize borrows from the extensive theoretical

literature on the demand for social status.          The key assumption of these models is that

individuals care about how their income, consumption or wealth compares (or is thought to

compare) to that of others in their reference group.      In a signaling version of the status model,

individuals’ incomes or wealth is not observed but costly indicators of income, in the form of

visible consumption, are. We show that under an intuitively appealing and simple formulation of

a status function, visible consumption in such a model should be rising in own income, and

decreasing in average reference group income.

          Applying these insights, we argue that a status model of this form might predict racial

differences in visible consumption even if Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics all have the same utility

preference parameters. If otherwise identical racial minorities and Whites belong to communities

with different average income, their incentives to consume visibility to satisfy a conspicuous

status motive will be different. Interestingly, if the relative status model is correct, its predictions

about the negative relationship between visible expenditure and higher reference group income

should apply not only across races but among Whites who live in communities with lower

average incomes.

          To assess empirical support for the status argument, we combine data about expenditures

from the CEX with income data from the Current Population Survey (CPS). Given the high

levels of racial segregation in the data, we define an individual’s reference group as being persons




                                                                                                      3
of the individual’s race, living in his state.5 The basic idea is that visible consumption should be

declining as the income of one’s reference group goes up – holding constant their own income.

Strikingly, we find that, consistent with the status argument, there is a strong negative association

between visible spending and the mean income of one’s reference group within all races. That is,

separate analysis performed on a sample of White households finds the same thing as separate

analyses done for racial minorities: increases in mean income of one’s own race in the state are

associated with reduced visible spending. As a falsification test of the status and reference group

notion, we related household visible spending to mean incomes of other groups in the state and

find either no effect or very modest positive effects. Additionally, we relate household non-

visible spending to reference average income and find no systematic relationship.

         We then turn to the obvious next step: Do differences in reference group income explain

the racial expenditure gaps that are our main focus? In a series of regressions, we show that

accounting for the mean level of a household’s reference group in the state explains most of the

racial gap in visible spending. This conclusion is robust to a variety to sample modification and

specification tests. Importantly, it is also robust to the addition of state fixed effects, which

account for regional differences across all groups in the propensity to visibly consume.

         In the last part of the paper, we discuss some potential implications of differential

spending on conspicuous goods between the races. Holding lifetime resources constant, an

increased propensity to spend on visible goods must necessarily mean lower consumption on

other goods.       We show that the Black-White gaps in education and health care spending

(conditional on permanent income and other demographics) decline by 25 and 8 percentage

points, respectively, after controlling for the share of spending allocated to visible goods. Given

that the racial gap in visible spending falls with age, there is reason to believe that wealth

accumulation could be affected by spending on visible goods. To this end, we show that wealth


5
 As we discuss below, state is the lowest level of location available in the CEX and thus is the finest spatial level at
which we can test for the importance of reference group income.


                                                                                                                      4
gap between Blacks and Whites, conditional on permanent income, declines by 50 percent after

controlling for visible spending. Importantly, the decompositions in this final portion of the paper

are not contingent on any particular theoretical account of why conspicuous consumption

differences arise.     Irrespective of why Blacks spend more on visible goods than comparable

Whites there will be implications for other well-studied “racial gaps” in economic outcomes.

         On the whole, the paper’s results point to an important role for consumption items, apart

from their direct consumption value. Although this exhibitionistic component has been long

talked about in economics, we are aware of very little formal evidence brought to bear on the

question, especially in terms of the racial differences that are our focus.6 Over the last decade,

economists and sociologists have provided considerable empirical support for the notion that

individuals care about their relative position in their community, often using evidence about

subjective well being.7 Our work complements this literature in that we are able to link

consumption patterns to social concerns by analyzing economic behavior directly. Perhaps more

importantly, our specific focus on racial differences in consumption, and our results about the

potential role played by the use and display of visible items, suggests that a deeper understanding

of the racial gaps in wealth, savings and consumption that have long bedeviled economists and

others will require further exploration of the issues raised in this paper.



2.       Data

         To examine racial differences in consumption patterns, we use data from the 1986–2002

CEX, collected by the United States Department of Labor.               The CEX is an on-going rotating

panel dataset, in which participating households are interviewed up to five times at three month

intervals. In any given calendar quarter there are approximately 5,000 households in the survey,

with some households entering the survey and others exiting the survey.               The initial interview

6
  Notable recent exceptions include Ravina (2005) and Kapteyn et al (2006).

  Recent examples include Luttmer (2005), Clark and Oswald (1996), McBride (2001) and Dynan and Ravina (2007).

                                                                                                            5
collects household demographic information, which is updated during subsequent interviews to

reflect any changes in household composition.       Information on annual income (during the

previous twelve months) is collected during the second and fifth interviews. Additionally, the

second through fifth interviews each collects detailed household expenditure information for the

three calendar months immediately preceding the interview.            The detailed expenditure

information can be aggregated up to a broader set of consumption categories for the household.

        Like previous users of CEX data, we aggregate to the consumption categories proposed

by Sabelhaus and Harris (2000). We use the CEX family level extracts made available from the

National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). The Data Appendix discusses in detail the

NBER CEX family extracts, the details of our sample selection criteria, and the 47 specific

expenditure categories included in the Sabelhaus and Harris consumption classification.

Appendix Table A1 lists the 15 broad consumption categories we explore in this paper and how

they relate to the 47 categories in summarized in the Sabelhaus and Harris files. All data are

deflated to 2005 dollars using the June CPI-U.

        To summarize the sample selection criteria described in the Data Appendix, our primary

analysis sample consists of Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics households, with heads between 18

and 49 years old. In some specifications, we explore the robustness of our results by examining

the consumption patterns of older households and the sensitivity of our results to excluding

younger households.    Also, below, we look at the spending patterns of Asians, but because of

small sample sizes Asians are not part of the main analysis sample.

        To mitigate the effects of measurement error in the expenditure categories, the unit of

analysis is the average quarterly expenditure within a consumption category over the period that

the household is in the sample. In total, our primary analysis sample includes 48,758 households,

comprised of 36,706 White households, 6,760 Black households, and 5,292 Hispanic households.

        Descriptive statistics for the sample by race are shown in Table 1.       There are two

noteworthy things in Table 1. First, 27 percent of the sample has missing total family annual


                                                                                                 6
income where total annual income is defined to include labor, asset and transfer income. Over a

similarly defined sample, less than one percent of households in the March Current Population

Survey (CPS) (which is designed to measure labor market outcomes) have zero or negative

reported annual total family income. It is well documented that the CEX has many more missing

income observations compared to surveys designed to measure income like the CPS. The second

noteworthy point in the table is that among those reporting positive income, White households

have sixty-seven percent higher total income than Black households and sixty-one percent more

than Hispanic households. The comparable numbers from the CPS are fifty-one and thirty-seven

percent, respectively. The racial total expenditure differences from the CEX, however, line up

nearly exactly with the income numbers from the CPS. Specifically, as seen in Table 1, Whites

consume fifty percent more and thirty-eight percent more than Blacks and Hispanics,

respectively.8

         Our focus in the paper is on visible consumption expenditures – items for which

expenditure is readily observable and which are highly portable, so that they are observed across

a variety of interactions. Also, we want to identify goods with the characteristic that individual

who consumer more of such goods are believed to be of better economic circumstances, on

average, than individuals who consumers less of such goods. Simple introspection suggests what

these items are likely to be, but rather than simply asserting what those items are, we conducted a

simple survey designed to assess people’s views about what expenditures are visible.9



8
  As discussed below, concern about the quality of current income data in the CEX is mitigated by our use of total
expenditure as a permanent income proxy.
9
   We are not the first to assess the visibility of different consumption goods using a survey. Heffetz (2007) sampled
480 individuals and asked them how long it would take them to observe whether an individual consumes an above
average amount of particular consumption goods. Our survey was very much inspired by Heffetz work, but we
conducted our own survey for three main reasons. First, given our focus on interactions with relatively unfamiliar
individuals, we were more interested in the familiarity an individual needs to determine someone’s above average
consumption rather than the length of time it would take him to observe this. Second, we needed to ask individuals
about the perceived income gradient associated with higher amounts of consumption for particular categories. In other
words, is above average spending on a particular good a signal of higher income or wealth. Finally, Heffetz’s survey,
like ours, included a relatively small number of respondents and we were unsure if the results would extend to a
broader population. It is encouraging, however, that our classification of visible goods is very similar to the
classification proposed by Heffetz.


                                                                                                                    7
         We surveyed over 320 graduate students in the University of Chicago’s Harris School of

Public Policy and the University of Chicago’s Graduate School of Business via an anonymous

online survey. 213 students responded to the survey. The survey consisted of three parts. The

first part asked about background information including age, sex, race and marital status. In the

second part, respondents were asked the following question (Q2): “Consider a person who lives

in a household and community roughly similar to yours. How closely would you have to interact

with this person in order to observe that they consistently spend more than average on each of the

following categories?”      Their answers ranged from 1 (indicating that higher than average

spending could be observed if the respondent did not interact socially with the person at all) to 5

(indicating that spending would never be observed). Appendix Table A2 details the survey

questions and potential responses.     The consumption categories asked of survey respondents

were designed to approximate the CEX consumption categories outlined in Appendix Table A1.

        In Q3 of the survey, we asked respondents the following: “Consider a randomly chosen

individual in society. Imagine that this person’s lifetime income suddenly increased by 20%. For

each item below, tell us how you would expect the person’s spending on each of the following

items to change”. The answers again ranged from 1 to 5 with 1 being spending would fall, 2

being spending would stay the same, and 3-5 being spending increased by less than, exactly, or

more than 20%, respectively.      The consumption categories for which this question was asked

were the same as those in Q2.

        Appendix Table A3 presents the survey results. The first column shows the proportion

of survey respondents who thought they would be able to observe above-average spending on an

item even if relatively unfamiliar with the consumer (responses “1” or “2” to Q2). We call these

goods visible. The statistic in column 2 is the proportion of survey respondents who reported that

the consumption item has at least an income elasticity of at least 1.

        Respondents thought that the type of spending they would most readily observe is that on

clothing, jewelry and vehicles (excluding maintenance).         For example, nearly two-thirds of


                                                                                                 8
respondents reported that they would be able to ascertain above average spending on clothing and

jewelry for individuals they hardly know. Other spending thought to be highly observable

includes (in decreasing order) expenditures on tobacco products, shelter expenditures, alcohol and

personal care expenditures. Spending on all other goods was thought to be hard to observe

compared to these seven goods. The second column shows that only five items were thought to

be both highly observable and also thought to have income elasticities greater than 1. On one

hand, an item like entertainment durables, which includes such things as televisions, was thought

to have a high income elasticity but not to be especially observable. On the other hand, tobacco

and alcohol spending are thought to be easily observable but have quite low expected income

elasticities. Consistent with this survey evidence, in the cross-section CEX data, the combined

alcohol/tobacco category was the only consumption category with a negative cross sectional

income elasticity.

         As will be made clear below, we wish to treat as “visible” goods which are easily

observable and which have the characteristic that higher consumption of the good is generally

associated with higher income. Given the results of the survey (and consistent with common-

sense), we define visible consumption in our analysis as consisting of expenditures on apparel

(including accessories such as jewelry), expenditures on personal care, and outlays on vehicles

excluding maintenance.

         One especially important item is housing. The survey evidence suggests that housing is

both reasonably observable and that it has a high expected income elasticity. Our concern is that

racial differences in housing expenditure might derive from differential treatment in the housing

market – a phenomenon that has been the focus of a large literature.10 Differential treatment in

the housing market could, by itself, cause minorities to have very different housing expenditures



10
  There is evidence that minorities face significantly higher rejection rates for mortgages which serves to limit their
access to owner occupied housing (see Munnell et al. (1996) and Charles and Hurst (2002)). Moral hazard
considerations cause rental prices to exceed the flow cost from owning an otherwise identical unit, so households who
rent will pay more for housing services, all else equal, than those who own.


                                                                                                                     9
than Whites, even if there were no conspicuous or exhibitionistic consideration informed housing

expenditure. Previewing our later results, we find that minorities spend more for a unit of

housing than do Whites, implying that if housing were lumped together with other visible

spending, the overall difference in visible expenditure we estimate would be slightly larger.

However, given the concerns about differential treatment in this particular market, we adopt the

conservative policy of excluding housing from the measure of total spending in most of our main

results. For the most part, we always treat housing separately, except for some robustness

specifications in which we assess how the results are affected when housing expenditure is

lumped in with overall visible spending.

         Appendix Tables A4 summarizes expenditures in our CEX sample on visible and other

goods. Overall, visible consumption expenditures comprise roughly 12 percent of household total

expenditures, while spending on food and shelter represent roughly 20 percent and 25 percent,

respectively, of total expenditures. The table shows that some CEX households spend nothing on

some expenditure categories over their time in the survey. Thus, whereas nearly all households

spend on food, housing, entertainment services, and visible goods, 57% of households spent

nothing on education, and around 20% spent nothing on alcohol and tobacco.11


3.       Racial Differences in Conspicuous Consumption

         To document the basic facts about consumption patterns by race in the CEX, we estimate

the following specification on a pooled sample of Black, White, and Hispanic household heads:

      ln(visiblei ) = β 0 + β1 Blacki + β 2 Hispanici + γ Incomei + ϕ Expenditurei + θ X i + ηi             (1)

where Blacki is a dummy variable if household head i is Black, Hispanici is a dummy variable if

household head i is Hispanic, and Incomei is a vector of income controls for household i including

the log of total family income, a cubic in the level of total family income, and a dummy variable

equal to one if total family income is zero or missing. Total family income includes the sum of

11
   In later analysis, we use Tobit analysis to deal with the large prevalence of zeros in particular consumption
categories.


                                                                                                            10
all labor and non-labor income earned by all members of the household. We set the log of total

family income equal to zero if total family income was zero.                     Expenditurei is a vector of total

expenditure variables for household i including the log of total expenditures and a cubic in the

level of total expenditure.           We include expenditure controls to proxy for the household’s

permanent income.           According to the permanent income hypothesis, the level of current

consumption should depend on lifetime (permanent) income and not simply current income. In

essence, we are using total expenditures as our control for permanent income.12 Alternatively, by

controlling for total expenditure, we are estimating the share of expenditure allocated to visible

goods among people who spend the same amount in total. This approach yields exactly the

estimate we want since we are interested in explaining how expenditures are allocated across

consumption categories rather than the level of total expenditures.

          Xi is a vector of demographic controls including a quadratic in age, education controls,

household wealth controls, year effects and indicator variables for the number of adults in the

household, the number of total family members in the household, marital status, whether the

household head is male, urbanicity, MSA residence, and Census region.13

          Only 1 percent of the sample reports having no expenditures on visible goods over their

time in the survey. Given the small occurrence of zeros in visible expenditures in our sample, it

makes no difference if we estimate (1) via OLS setting the log visible expenditures to zero for

those with zero visible expenditure or via a Tobit estimator which explicitly accounts for the

censoring at zero. Table 2 presents the OLS estimates of (1).

          If (1) is estimated including only the race dummies and excluding all of the other

controls, Blacks and Hispanics are found to spend less on visible items than comparable Whites


12
   Implicit in this identification is that the mapping of permanent income to total expenditures is constant across races.
However, a large literature suggests that Blacks save less out of permanent income than do similar Whites (e.g., Hurst,
Luoh and Stafford 1998). If Blacks do save less than comparable Whites, the estimated Black effect in (1) is
downwards biased, making the estimate a lower bound on the racial difference in visible consumption.
13
    For household wealth, we use the log of liquid assets if liquid assets are positive and a dummy for whether the
household has positive liquid assets as controls. Liquid assets are defined as checking, saving, stock, and bond
holdings.


                                                                                                                      11
by 38 and 24 percent, respectively (Row 1 of Table 2). This is not surprising, since spending on

visible goods increases with income as we show below, and since Blacks and Hispanics have

much lower incomes than Whites. As expected, Row 2 shows that including the CEX controls for

current income lowers both of the estimated minority race effects. However, as discussed above,

current income is measured very poorly in the CEX. Moreover, consumption theory predicts that

consumption decisions are based on permanent rather than current income. Row 3 shows that

when both controls for current income and total expenditure (which proxies for permanent

income) are added to the regression, the estimated effects indicate that Black and Hispanics

consume 29 percent and 25 percent more visible goods than Whites with similar permanent

income. The estimates in the fourth row show that it is the permanent income controls that drive

the entire change in coefficient between the specifications in first and third rows. Excluding the

current income controls from specification 3 leaves the racial dummies essentially unchanged.

         Row 5-7 of the table show that including a full set of demographic controls does little to

change the racial difference in visible consumption patterns after controlling for income and

expenditure.14       For example, adding education controls in Row 5 leaves the race effects

essentially unchanged. With the full set of demographic controls in Row 7, the estimated racial

effects increase only slightly relative to the results with just the income and expenditure controls.

In summary, Blacks and Hispanics consume 32 percent and 31 percent more visible goods,

respectively, than comparable Whites.15

         The racial difference in visible expenditures is large in absolute dollars. Appendix Table

A4 shows that, on average, Whites spend about $7,204 on visible items per year. The finding

that Blacks and Hispanics spend 32 percent more than comparable Whites on visible goods

therefore implies that Blacks and Hispanics spend on average roughly $2,300 per year more on


14
   The results are nearly identical if instead of pooling Whites, Blacks and Hispanics together we estimate the Black
coefficient on a sample of only Whites and Blacks, and the Hispanic coefficient in a sample of only includes Whites
and Hispanics.
15
   The coefficients on the Black and Hispanic dummies from a median regression (otherwise analogous to the
specification shown in row 7 of Table 2) were 0.36 and 0.38 respectively.


                                                                                                                 12
visible goods than their White counterparts. This estimate is likely a lower bound given that the

CEX has been found to under report total household consumption relative to data from the

National Income and Product Accounts. To put these magnitudes in perspective, data from the

March CPS shows that, for the 1990-2002 period, Black and Hispanic households had average

incomes, respectively, of $42,500 and $48,300 in 2005 dollars. Outlays on visible goods thus

represent a substantial fraction of the overall budget of minorities.16

         Although to conserve space we do not report them in Table 2, we find some interesting

patterns between individual level demographics and visible spending, net of the effect of current

and permanent income. We find, first, that the propensity to purchase visible goods declines

sharply with age. For example, relative to households with heads between 18 and 30 years old,

households with heads between 26 and 29 are twenty-three percent less likely to spend on visible

goods. The comparable coefficients on the age dummies for 30-33 year olds, 34-37 year olds, 38-

41 year olds, 42 to 45 year olds, and 46-49 year olds are, respectively, -37 percent, -44 percent, -

55 percent, -56 percent and -62 percent. Second, we find that female-headed households are 15

percent more likely to spend on visible goods than their male headed counterparts.                    Lastly, the

college educated, spend about 13 percent less on visible expenditures than their high school

educated counterparts.

         Figure 1 plots the visible expenditure Engel curves for Black and White households. To

estimate these equations we regress, separately for Blacks and Whites, the log of visible

expenditures on the log of current household income, instrumenting current household income

with the total expenditure controls discussed above. This regression relates the log of visible

expenditure to the portion of current income that is systematically related to total expenditure –




16
   We present results for Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites. We also explored but do not present because of sample size
concerns differences in spending patterns between Asians and Whites. Asians, on average, spend 9 percent less on
visible goods than Whites with similar permanent income and demographics.


                                                                                                               13
what theory suggests is permanent income.17 The figure shows that, for both Blacks and Whites,

visible expenditures are luxury goods. The coefficient on log income in the IV regressions for

Blacks and Whites, respectively, were 1.4 and 1.6. Second, Blacks, at every level of permanent

income, spend more on visible goods then their White counterparts, with a 30% difference at the

median income for the sample.18 Third, notice that the two Engle curves are essentially parallel,

mitigating concerns that the main results derive in some way from a fundamental difference in the

shapes of these relationships across race.

          The finding that racial minorities exhibit a greater propensity to consume visible goods is

robust to a variety of alternative specifications and restrictions, including restricting the sample to

households with positive current income, excluding households with less than $23,200 a year in

total expenditures (which was the 25th percentile of the expenditure distribution), excluding

households under the age of 24, including log expenditures on housing shelter as an additional

control, restricting the sample to include only those who completed all four CEX surveys,

including occupation dummies, and including city size controls. The results of these alternative

specifications are shown in Appendix Table A5.

          Table 3 reports the race coefficient from (1) for a variety of different population sub-

samples. These results include the same set of controls as used in row 7 of Table 2. The results

indicate that the racial difference in visible consumption remains large among the sub samples of

single men, single women, and married households. For example, Black (Hispanic) single men

consume 32 percent (40 percent) more visible goods than similar White single men.                                   The




17
   When estimating this equation, we restrict the sample to those with positive current household income. We then
truncated current income for both samples at 99th percentile of black distribution (which was roughly $100,000). Engel
curves for both Blacks and Whites in Figure 1 are thus up through $100,000.
18
   One question that we will continue to address throughout the paper is whether there are differences in “price” effects
which cause Blacks to spend more on visible goods than comparable Whites. For example, if Blacks were
discriminated against in the market for visible goods, Blacks with a given income would pay more for those items than
comparable Whites. General discrimination cannot explain the results in Table 2 which control for total expenditures
directly. As a result, the correct interpretation of our results should be why Blacks and Hispanics allocate a greater
share of their expenditures to visible goods. There is no evidence that, relative to other goods, Blacks and Hispanics
pay higher prices for clothing, jewelry, and personal care items than similar Whites.


                                                                                                                     14
comparable differences for Black and Hispanic single women, relative to White single women,

were 29 percent and 24 percent, respectively.

           Rows 4-7 of Table 3 show the racial gap in visible consumption within different

educational groups.      We find racial differences in visible consumption within all educational

groups, although the magnitudes of the differences vary slightly for different education levels.

Black households headed by someone with only a high school degree consume 38 percent more

visible goods than a comparable White household, conditional on income, total expenditure and

demographics. The comparable Black-White gap in visible expenditures for households headed

by someone with at least a college degree is 28 percent. The gradient in the racial gap in visible

consumption with respect to education is steeper between Whites and Hispanics.              Among

households headed by a person with only a high school degree, Hispanics consume 32 percent

more visible goods than comparable Whites.          Among college graduates, the gap falls to 12

percent.

           In Rows 8–10 of Table 3, we explore how the racial gap in visible expenditures changes

with age.       On average, the gap in visible expenditures found among 18-34 years is nearly

identical – for both Blacks and Hispanics – to the racial gap found among 35–49 year olds.

Using fine age ranges up through the age of 49, the same patterns hold.        However, as seen in

Row 10, for Black households older than 49, the racial gap starts to diminish sharply.

Specifically, for households between 50 and 69, Blacks consume only 22 percent more visible

goods than comparable Whites. As noted earlier, all households spend less on visible goods as

they age.      The racial gap in visible consumption in absolute dollars therefore declines

monotonically with age.

           Although we do not present the results in Table 3, we find that the racial gap in visible

consumption has been consistently present during the period between 1986 and 2002. For

example, the racial gap in visible consumption between Blacks and Whites for our main analysis

sample, conditional on income, expenditure, and demographics, was 31 percent for the sub-period


                                                                                                 15
of 1990-1993 and was 29 percent for the sub-period of 1999-2002.19 Additionally, we found no

difference in the estimated race coefficients within a sample of renters and a sample of home

owners. Black renters (home owners) consumed roughly 30 percent more visible goods than

White renters (home owners), all else equal.                     Lastly, the racial differences were robust to

splitting the sample on the head’s current employment status.

          Table 4 shows that Blacks and Hispanics spend much more than their White counterparts

on each of the visible consumption categories – vehicles, clothing, and personal care. Panel A

shows results for the full sample, while Panel B is for a sample of households who own a vehicle.

In both of the samples, Blacks and Hispanics spend significantly more on both personal care and

clothing and jewelry than comparable Whites. Vehicle spending differences, however, only

occur among vehicle owners. Moreover, the vehicle differences are only statistically significant

with the expanded measure of vehicle spending which includes both only spending on the vehicle

itself at the time of purchase (the limited vehicle measure), and also spending on customization

and monthly principle payments on the vehicle loan. The data appendix outlines the categories

in the limited and expanded vehicle measures.

          The fact that Blacks and Hispanics, all else equal, have a lower probably of vehicle

ownership explains why the racial difference in vehicle spending is not found for the full sample.

The lower vehicle ownership among Blacks and Hispanics is likely the result of two factors.

First, Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to live in city centers and, as a result, have lower

vehicle needs. Second, liquidity constraints may prevent Blacks and Hispanics from making a

sufficient down payment to purchase a vehicle. Among, vehicle owners, however, Blacks spend

15 percent more on vehicles (including customization) than comparable Whites.20



19
   Also, while our analysis focuses on the period since 1990, we used the 1960-61 CEX survey to examine historical
racial differences in visible expenditure. Our results cannot reject the hypothesis that the Black/White difference in that
earlier period is identical to the gap in the period we study.
20
    We have also conducted a similar analysis using PSID data to explore differences in vehicle wealth holdings
between Blacks and Whites. The PSID tracks the value of the household vehicle wealth (cars, trucks, motorcycles,
etc.) at their re-sale value. This measure includes the value of all car accessories (tires, rims, etc.). Blacks, conditional


                                                                                                                         16
         If minority households spend more on visible goods relative to White households with

similar income, total expenditures, and demographics, on what expenditures are they spending

less? The inter-temporal budget constraint implies that this higher spending must come either

from another component of current consumption or from future consumption (i.e. current

savings).     Table 5 looks at the conditional differences in spending on other consumption

categories. These consumption categories – along with visible consumption – comprise the

universe of consumption expenditures in the CEX and are described in Appendix Table A1. The

coefficients in Table 5 come from a regression similar to (1) where the dependent variable of log

visible expenditures is replaced by the log of other different consumption categories. Otherwise,

the regression is exactly the same as the one reported in row 7 of Table 2. As indicated in the

notes to Table 5, for expenditure categories for which there was a high incidence of zero

expenditure, we estimate Tobit regressions.

         The first striking fact from Table 5 is that there is no evidence that Blacks and Hispanic

consume a higher percentage of their spending than Whites on any other consumption category

except for visible goods and housing. In fact, aside from housing, Blacks spend less than similar

Whites on all other consumption categories. Some of the differences are small. For example,

there only appears to be very small differences between Blacks and Whites in food expenditures.

However, Blacks spend 17 percent less on education, approximately 50 percent less on

entertainment, and 56 percent less on health spending. Similar patterns emerge for Hispanics.

         Both Blacks and Hispanics spend slightly more on housing expenditures for shelter and

utilities than their White counterparts, while at the same time spending much less on home

furnishings.21 As we have noted, housing may itself be a visible good which would explain why

it is associated with similar expenditure patterns to those for jewelry, clothing and vehicles.



on five year average income, demographics, and total wealth, have roughly 15 percent more vehicle wealth than
Whites. These results are consistent with the results shown in Table 5.
21
   The utility category is driven to a large extent by differences in telephone expenditures (including cell phones and
pagers).


                                                                                                                   17
However, as discussed above, it is also possible that there is differential treatment by race in the

housing market. To provide conservative estimates of conspicuous spending differences, we

exclude housing from our measure of visible goods.

        The results presented thus far are from the CEX, the primary source of information on

consumption expenditure. Despite its excellent coverage of consumption behavior over a long

time, it is not designed to measure household income. To confirm the basic patterns presented

above, we have also examined racial consumption expenditure differences using data from the

PSID. This finding increased our confidence that total expenditure in the CEX is a good proxy

for permanent income. Although the PSID is not designed to measure consumption and has

historically had information on only a limited set of consumption measures, the survey has

recently (in 2005) added an expanded set of expenditure questions, including questions about the

visible items we study. The PSID expenditure measures are available for only one or two years,

and are obviously not as complete as the CEX measures. On the other hand, the PSID does have

much more detailed information on income than the CEX.         We do not present the results here,

but the basic patterns about racial differences in visible expenditure documented above are also

found in the PSID.

        In summary, we show in this section that Blacks and Hispanics spend roughly 30 percent

more on visible expenditures (cars, clothing, jewelry, and personal care items) than otherwise

similar Whites. These patterns are similar across all sub groups of the population, with the

notable exception that the differential racial propensity to consume visibly declines sharply with

age. Finally, while minority households consume much more visible goods than comparable

Whites, they consume less than or the same amount as Whites of all other consumption categories

aside from housing.

4.      Theories of Conspicuous Consumption

        What explains the differences in visible spending between races presented above? One

possible answer is that Blacks and Hispanics simply like to consume the kinds of goods we


                                                                                                 18
classify as visible more than their White counterparts. Given the fact that racial groups exhibit

such different tastes with respect to matters as diverse as cuisine, music, and even popular

entertainment, it is likely that the conspicuous consumption differences documented above

reflect, in part, differences across cultures in the their tastes for these different types of goods.

Unfortunately, a “cultural difference” explanation has the drawbacks that it is essentially

tautological and that it does not provide additional predictions that can be tested in the data.

         We believe that existing theory points to an alternative explanation for observed

consumption which does not rely on Blacks and Hispanics having stronger preferences for visible

goods. Following Veblen (1899) and Smith (1759), a large theoretical literature in the social

sciences has focused on the idea that individuals care about their status in society. Conspicuous

consumption in these models affects status by communicating information about unobserved

economic position within the particular group. Different types of status models have been

proposed in the literature, but we focus here on a signaling framework.22 This type of model is

straightforward and familiar, and its key predictions are, in most cases, very similar to other status

models such as those that focus on relative consumption. 23

         To see the main insights from a signaling representation of status, consider a relatively

general and simple static framework of a social group G consisting of households with incomes

y i distributed continuously over some range with mean μG . Suppose that all individuals in group

G have identical preferences defined over two consumption goods and over status, given by

                                             (        )       ( )
                                           u y i − c + α u c i + s,                                             (2)

where u is an increasing and concave function; c is conspicuous (visible) consumption; y-c

represents consumption which is not (easily) visible or conspicuous to outsiders such as food,


22
   Signaling formulations of status have been presented by, among others, Ireland (1994), Cole et al (1995), Bagwell
and Bernheim (1996), Glazer and Konrad (1996), and Corneo and Jeanne (1998).
23
   Duesenberry (1949), Pollack (1976) and Frank (1985) developed early models of the relative consumption class.
Most recently Hopkins and Kornienko (2004) and Becker and Rayo (2006) analyze the welfare implications of this
type of preference specifications.


                                                                                                                19
health, or saving; and s represents status.

          In a signaling framework, it is natural to represent individual i ' s status as reflecting how

a given trait of his compares to some standard. Assume that this unobserved trait is income. In

assigning status to an individual, outsiders have two bits of information: the person’s visible

consumption, and what is known about the income of the group from which the person is drawn –

in the most simple case, the mean of group income μG . In equilibrium, the inferences made

about a person’s income are correct, so that observed levels of visible consumption are associated

with particular income levels.           The status a person receives in equilibrium is, in general, given

by24

                                                    s i = s ( c i , μG ) .

Since, in equilibrium, more visible consumption is associated with higher levels of inferred

income and thus with higher status, the partial derivative of status with respect to visible

consumption expenditure c is positive, or sc > 0. The partial derivative of status with respect to

mean group income, sμ , is less clear, and depends on the specific formulation of status assumed

and the nature of the equilibrium status assignment. 25

                   (         )
          Let c * y i , μG be person i 's equilibrium level of visible consumption, where y i is his

income. Equilibrium consumption is determined by maximizing (2) subject to a budget set and

thus is the solution to the first order condition:

                                      sc ( c* , μG ) = u ' ( y i − c* ) − α u ' ( c* ) .                          (3)




24
   In general, equilibrium status can also depend on higher moments of the income distribution, such as the variance.
For example, this will be the case when status is proportional to income or consumption rank. In addition, variance of
group income will matter in a pure signaling model, but its contribution is hard to disentangle from that of the mean.
25
   In general, the relationship between status and average group income hinges on the specific assumption made about
status formation in the model. It is most often assumed that individuals care about how their income is thought to
compare to others in their group, implying that sμ < 0. However, Ireland (1994)) presents a model in which simply

belonging to a richer reference group confers higher status, so that    sμ > 0.


                                                                                                                  20
Two implications are immediately forthcoming from this condition. First, conspicuous

consumption is greater than would be true if there were no status concerns. Second, and of

important predictive value, is that conspicuous consumption should be increasing in own

income.26

            Differentiating both sides of the first order condition (3) with respect to μG yields


                        (         )           (         ) (              )         ( )
                   scμ c∗ , μG = −cμ∗ G y i , μG ⎡u′′ y i − c∗ + α u′′ c∗ + scc c∗ , μ ⎤
                                                 ⎣                                     ⎦        (       )               (4)


The second order condition for c * implies that the expression in the square brackets is negative

in (4). Thus, the partial effect of mean group income on equilibrium visible consumption, cμ∗ ,
                                                                                                                        G


is of the same sign as the second derivative of status function, scμ : holding own income

constant, conspicuous consumption is decreasing in mean group income if                                 scμ < 0 , and is

increasing if the inequality is reversed.

            What, intuitively, does the second derivative scμ mean and what is its likely sign?

Technically, scμ measures whether the positive increment to his status that an individual receives

by engaging in marginally more visible expenditure is bigger or smaller when his group has

slightly higher average income. It should be clear that the sign of scμ will depend on how

specifically status is modeled. Notice, however, that in perhaps the most simple type of status

representation possible, in which the status conferred upon an individual is simply how his

income compares (or is thought to compare) to the average income of the group, then scμ < 0 ,

and equilibrium consumption will be decreasing in average group income. Intuitively, in this

most simple case, the richer the group is on average, the less an individual gains relative to the

     These are standard predictions of signaling models. See Ireland (!994) or Cole et. al. (1995) for a formal discussion.

mean from a one dollar increase in visible consumption. The marginal return to status “spending”

in the form of higher visible spending falls as the average group income rises.

            The condition that scμ < 0 holds for many representations of relative status and concave

utility functions, u. Indeed, some empirical tests in the literature find that subjective well being,

which is presumably positively related to status, falls when average reference group income rises.

Conspicuous consumption is not directly the focus of these papers, but if their results were put

into a conspicuous consumption context, their findings would imply that scμ < 0 .27 In the Theory

Appendix, we briefly work through a specific parametric example of log linear utility with status

defined as the ratio of expected income (given consumption) to average reference group income.

            Although we have focused on the signaling version of the relative status model, the

results above are consistent with a model where status is explicitly based on conspicuous

consumption. For example, Becker and Rayo (2006) study a model in which status is given by the

individual’s position in the distribution of durable good expenditures and show that in

equilibrium this position corresponds to the position in the income distribution. As with the

signaling model, equilibrium status depends on the moments of the reference group income

distribution (especially the mean), and on the individual choice of conspicuous consumption.

We do not attempt to distinguish between these theoretical formulations of status in this paper,

especially in light of their similar predictions.

            If a relative status consideration of the sort outlined above partly determines consumption

decisions, it follows that persons with exactly the same preferences and with the same income but

who belong to different social groups will consume different amounts of visible goods if the

mean incomes of their groups are different. In particular, visible spending should be lower for

individuals in the group with higher mean income.                      Can a simple model of conspicuous

group reconcile the results presented above? We turn to this in the next section.



5:      Empirical Tests of Conspicuous Consumption Model

Explaining Within Race Conspicuous Consumption Differences

        The foregoing discussion said nothing about race specifically, but we argue that the long-

standing cultural separation of races in the U.S, combined with high levels of residential

segregation, suggest that race partly determines a person’s reference group, G . In addition, there

is likely a spatial dimension to reference groups: it seems quite unlikely that the consumption

patterns of individuals on one coast of the country should be informed by considerations about

persons living on the opposite coast, even if those others are of the same race. In all that follows,

we therefore suppose that reference groups are the interaction of race and space: persons of an

individual’s own race, living is his own state. We define reference groups with respect to state

because the state is lowest level of spatial aggregation available in our data.

        One interesting implication of acknowledging the likely spatial component of reference

groups is that we can assess the validity of the status model’s main predictions not only across

different races, but also with data on individuals of the same race. That is, we ask: Among

persons of a given race, are those from areas with higher average income less likely to engage in

conspicuous consumption, as the simple relative status model would suggest?

        We focus first on visible consumption among White households. On a sample of Whites

we estimate the regression:

              ln(visiblei ) = β 0 + Γ j State j + γ Incomei + ϕ Expenditurei + θ X i + ηi         (5)


where Statej is a vector of state dummies and Γ j is the vector of coefficients on those state

dummies. Otherwise, the controls are identical to those used in Row 7 of Table 2, and the sample

restrictions are the same as discussed above.



                                                                                                  23
                                                                              ( )
          Figure 2a plots the coefficients on the state dummies Γ j from a regression such as (5)

against the mean income of White males from state j. We use data from the 1990 through the

2002 March Current Population Surveys (CPS) to compute the mean labor income of White

males by state. 28 We use the CPS to compute our measure of the mean income of the reference

group within each state as opposed to the CEX data because of both the large sample sizes

available in the CPS and the better quality income data.

          Figure 2a shows that there is a strong negative relationship between the propensity of

White households to consume visible goods and the mean income of White men in the state.

Alabama was the omitted state in the estimation of (5).                      Figure 2a shows that, holding own

income, total expenditure, and demographics constant, White Texans consume 20 percentage

points less visible goods than White Alabamans. The mean income of households headed by

White men in Texas is nearly $10,000 a year higher than the mean income of households headed

by White men in Alabama.                The regression line in the figure is from a regression which is

weighted by the number of CPS observations from the state.                             The negative and strongly

statistically significant regression coefficient implies that, on average, increasing mean state

income by $10,000 reduces the amount of visible consumption by 17 percentage points, all else

equal. Lastly, the R-squared of the regression of the state visible expenditure fixed effect against

mean state income among Whites is 0.35.

          One concern about the results in the Figure 2a is that there may be some factor which is

correlated with average state income, which mechanically causes reduced spending on visible

goods. Differences across states in housing prices represent one main concern here. Consider a

state where the price of housing is high, all else equal. Individuals with a given level of income

in that state will spend more for the same amount of housing, and less on other consumption

28
  The labor income of adult men of a person’s state*race cell is our main measure of average reference group income.
However, we tried several alternative measures for reference group income, including total family income and total
family labor of all persons of the individual’s race*state cell. In all that follows, the results are essentially unchanged
under these alternative income specifications.


                                                                                                                       24
items including perhaps visible items. To examine the relationship between housing expenditures

and mean state income, we re-estimate (5) with the household’s housing outlays as the dependent

variable. Figure 2b, which plots the estimated state effects from this regression, shows that

household housing outlays are indeed much higher in states with high mean state income.

        Are the results in Figure 2a driven by differences in housing expenditures across states?

We re-estimated (5) for visible spending but add the household’s housing expenditures as an

additional regressor. The estimated state fixed effects are then plotted against state income in

Figure 2c. The figure shows that housing expenditure differences explain no more than twenty

percent of the negative relationship between visible expenditures and mean state income

documented in Figure 2a. We find that a $10,000 increase in mean state income reduces visible

expenditure purchases by a strongly statistically significant 13 percent. There is thus a strong

negative relationship between visible spending and mean state income among Whites even after

controlling for differences in housing expenditures.

        Apart from the concern that state level differences in housing cost could account for the

patterns we observe for visible goods, there is still the possibility that a state’s level of income

might be related to the menu of prices its residents pay for different consumption items.       For

example, the presence or generosity of transfer programs or of other consumption insurance

schemes might vary with a state’s average level of income. If this were so, persons with the same

level of income in different states would effectively pay different prices for and consume

different amounts of various consumption items in the different states. In particular, we would

expect to find a negative pattern between state income and levels of expenditures for other items.

        Figures 2d-2f depict patterns analogous to those in Figure 2c for expenditures on food,

entertainment and all non-housing/non-visible expenditures, respectively, after controlling for

differences in housing expenses. In stark contrast to the results for visible goods, we find no

evidence of a negative relationship between state income and these expenditures among Whites.




                                                                                                 25
Indeed, food expenditures increase slightly with state income for Whites. For entertainment

service and all non-housing/non-visible expenditures there is no difference in Whites’ propensity

to spend on these items across states with different levels of income. Overall, for Whites, the

negative relationship between visible expenditures and mean state income does not exist for any

other category of expenditures. These results provide strong support for our model’s conjecture

that visible spending is negatively related to the economic status of one’s peers, holding

individual characteristics constant.

        The regression analog of (5) is:

              ln(visiblei ) = β 0 + δ ln( μG ) + γ Incomei + ϕ Expenditurei + θ X i + ηi          (6)

where the state dummies are replaced by the mean labor income of White men in the state, μG .

Table 6 shows the results from this regression. Column 1 of Table 6 shows that the base estimate

of δ is a strongly statistically significant -0.94. This implies that doubling mean state income of

White men reduces visible expenditures of Whites by 94 percent, all else equal. This coefficient

roughly translates to the relationship between the state fixed effect and mean state income

estimated in Figure 2a.

        In column 2 of Table 6, we include housing expenditures as an additional control and the

coefficient still remains large and statistically different from zero. In column 3, we include the

mean income of all men in the state (not just Whites) as an additional control. The discussion in

the preceding section suggests that households’ visible spending should respond negatively to the

mean income level of their reference group. If reference groups are defined along racial lines,

households’ visible consumption should not be related to the mean income of other racial groups

within their state. The evidence in column 3 weakly supports this. White men do respond

statistically to the mean income of White men, but there is no statistical relationship between their

consumption and the mean income of other racial groups in the state. The standard errors are

such that we cannot rule out that the coefficient on the income of White men (row 1) is



                                                                                                  26
statistically different from the coefficient on the income of all men (row 3) – an unsurprising

result since white Men constitute the over-whelming majority of men in all states.

            In column 4 of Table 6 we also include measures of the log of the standard deviation of

the income of White men in state j relative to the mean income of White men in state j as an

additional control. In this specification, the estimate on the variance is negative, which implies

that a more disperse population weakens the propensity to consume visibly, all else equal.29

Notice, all the other coefficients remain constant between the specifications shown in columns 2

and 4.

            Table 7 shows that the same patterns hold within samples of Blacks and Hispanics.

Specifically, we re-estimate an equation similar to (6), in turn, on samples of only Blacks

(column 1 of Table 7); only Hispanics (column 2 of Table 7); and a a pooled sample of Blacks

and Hispanics (column 3-6 of Table 7). In column 1 (2), our measure of μG is the mean income

of Black (Hispanic) males in state j.                 In the pooled regression in column 3, μG is the mean

income of either Black men in state j if the household head is Black or the mean income of

Hispanic men in state j if the household head is Hispanic. The results show that for both the

Black and the Hispanic samples, the estimated effect of μG is negative and large.                      The

coefficients on μG for Blacks (Hispanics) imply that a doubling of mean state income of the race

based reference group leads to a 48 (76) percent decline in the propensity to spend on visible

goods, all else equal.            The results are nearly identical in the pooled regression, although the

coefficients are much more precisely estimated. A doubling of the mean income of a person’s

reference group within their state results in a 56 percent reduction in visible spending (p-value <

0.01).

            In column 4, we include log housing expenditures as an additional control. The results

are robust to this inclusion. A doubling of mean income of the reference group within the state

29
     This is consistent with some versions of the status signaling model (e.g. Cole et. al. (1995)).


                                                                                                       27
results in a 37 percent reduction in visible spending. Notice, that this number is not too different

from the corresponding estimate among White men (Table 6 column 3). In column 5 of Table 7,

we also include the mean income of all men in the state as an additional regressor. We find that

Blacks and Hispanics have lower visible expenditures when the mean income of their race-based

reference group is higher. However, if the mean income of all men in the state increases holding

the mean income of men from the person’s own race constant, visible expenditures increase.

          In column 6, we also add a measure of the standard deviation of income within the state

relative to mean income within the state (by race). The relative standard deviation measure is

positive, but not statistically different from zero.                 Although not shown, we also find no

relationship between food and entertainment spending and mean own group state income among

Blacks and Hispanics.30

          Overall, the within-race results are strongly consistent with the status model of

conspicuous consumption outlined above.                 If the mean income of those of a person’s own race

within their state increases, the person’s spends less on visible expenditures, all else equal. This

fact is found among Whites, among Blacks and among Hispanics and persists even after

controlling for differences in housing expenditures across states.



5B.       Explaining Racial Differences in Visible Expenditures

          We analyze next whether the racial differences in visible consumption presented earlier

in the paper can be reconciled by a status model with the key features described in the previous

section. We estimate:

30
   One implementation of our notion of reference groups is that it is defined as one’s neighborhood. The use of mean
Black income within the state as a reference group for Blacks and mean White income within the state a reference
group for Whites, under this interpretation, assumes that Blacks live around Blacks and Whites live around Whites.
While it is has been shown that there is substantial segregation by race in residential living patterns (see, for example,
Cutler et al. (1999)), residential sorting by race is far from perfect. As a result, actual sorting patterns pose another
interesting question: Do Blacks who live in “blacker” communities respond more to mean Black income than Blacks
who live in “whiter” communities? We tested this prediction by aggregating up to the state level the metropolitan
measures of segregation compiled by Culter et al. (1999) and interacting measures of segregation with mean state
income of Blacks in the estimation shown in Table 7 (for a sample that only included Blacks and Whites). The
segregation interactions came with the predicted sign (Blacks in more segregated states responded more to mean Black
income), but the standard errors were much too large to say anything definitive.


                                                                                                                      28
                     ln(visiblei ) = β 0 + β1 Blacki + β 2 Hispanici + δ ln( μG )
                                                                                                   (7)
                                    γ Incomei + ϕ Expenditurei + θ X i + ηi

Equation (7) is identical to (1) except for the inclusion of ln(μG) as an additional regressor where

μG is the mean level of the individual’s racial group in state j. This regression assesses whether

Blacks or Hispanics, holding their own income and the mean income of the racial peer group

constant, have the same visible expenditures as Whites, all else equal. The results are shown in

Table 8. Column 1 re-displays the results from row 7 of Table 2 (without including ln(μ) as a

control). As shown earlier, without reference group income controls, observationally equivalent

Blacks and Hispanics male-headed households consume 32 and 31 percent more on visible goods,

respectively, than Whites.

        The regression presented in column 2 continues to exclude reference group income but

now adds state fixed effects. The estimated effects of around 0.35 show that the state fixed effects

have essentially no influence on the estimated racial gaps in visible expenditures. In the third

column we add the measure of average reference group income and exclude the state fixed

effects. Recall, μG measures the average income of the household’s race/state group. This

regression shows dramatically that our control for reference group income explains nearly the

entire gap in spending across races. The estimated Black coefficient falls from a strongly

significant 0.32 to a statistically insignificant -0.09, once reference group mean income is

accounted for. Similarly the Hispanic dummy, which was originally from 0.31, essentially

vanishes statistically. Column 4 adds state fixed effects to the regression in the third column, and

the fifth column adds both state fixed effects and the standard deviation of the income of the

reference group. In both of these regressions, the results are qualitatively the same as the results

in column 3. In summary, these results show dramatically that the visible expenditure between

Blacks and Hispanics versus Whites vanishes once we account for reference group

characteristics. Importantly, the results also indicate that it is not some generic trait of the state




                                                                                                   29
that explains the conspicuous consumption gap, but rather the incomes of individuals’ racial

reference groups specifically.

        On the whole, these results are strongly consistent with the predictions of the class of

models of status and conspicuous consumption discussed in section 4. The key point is that a

very simple status model appears to explain differences in individual visible consumption within

and across races, and does so without requiring that there be systematic differences in preferences

by race. The only role plaid by race is in determining one’s reference group.



6.      Conspicuous Consumption Implications

        In this section, we empirically explore the implications of conspicuous consumption for

explaining racial differences in educational spending, health care spending, and savings. By the

definition of the inter-temporal budget constraints, higher current spending on conspicuous items

must be associated with lower current spending on other consumption items and/or in lower

savings and, consequently, lower consumption in the future.

        To begin, we explore how much of the racial differences in other consumption categories

can be explained by racial differences in spending on visible goods. To do this, we re-estimate

the regressions in Table 5 with two additional controls: the share of total spending allocated to

housing and the share of spending allocated to visible goods. We use the share variables so as

not to confound the fact that the levels of spending within almost all broad consumption

categories increase with income. Given that income and total expenditure controls were already

included in our estimation of the results in Table 5, adding the share variables answers the

thought experiment: holding income and total expenditure constant, what happens to spending on

other consumption categories if the share of expenditure to either housing or visible goods

increases?

        These regression results are shown in Table 9. Panels A, B, and C present results for

spending on education spending, health care, and food, respectively. Our baselines specifications


                                                                                                30
are regressions of the log of spending within the consumption category (e.g., education, health,

food) on the full set of income, expenditure, and demographic controls used in the estimate

presented in Table 5, along with a Black and Hispanic dummy variable. The table presents only

the coefficients on the Black and Hispanic dummies. For ease of comparison, we re-display our

baseline results in Rows “1” of Table 9.

        Rows 2 of Table 9 include the housing share of expenditures as an additional control.

We include the housing share of expenditure to account for potential differences in housing costs

between races of similar income and demographics because of potential discrimination in housing

markets.   For the most part, including differences in housing expenditures explains little of the

racial gaps in education, health care, and food spending. Specifically, after controlling for

housing expenditures, Blacks still spend 20 percent less on education and 56 percent less on

health care than comparable Whites. And as in Table 5, there still remains a 7 percent difference

in food spending between similar Blacks and Whites once conditioning on housing expenditures.

        By contrast, including controls for the share of spending on visible goods explains a

significant amount of the racial spending gap in health care and education for both Blacks and

Hispanics. The Black-White gap in education gap falls to zero (nearly 25 percentage points) and

the Black-White gap in health care falls by 14 percent (nearly 8 percentage points) after

controlling for differences in spending on conspicuous goods.

        We also explore racial differences in food and housing spending after controlling for

differences in spending on visible goods. Controlling for differences in the share of expenditures

allocated to visible goods, we find that the Black propensity to consume food and housing,

relative to similar Whites, increases by 4 and 6 percentage points respectively. The comparable

increases for Hispanics were 3 and 5 percentage points.

        Appendix Table A4 shows that the average quarterly spending on education, health care,

food and housing for Whites in our sample were, respectively, $288, $464, $1,733, and $2,670.

The estimates in Table 9 imply that the increased spending on visible consumption results in


                                                                                               31
about $72 less spending per quarter on education by Blacks (0.25 * 288), about $37 less spending

per quarter on health care by Blacks (0.08 * $464), about $69 less spending per quarter on food

by Blacks (0.04 * $1,733), and about $160 less spending per quarter on housing by Blacks (0.06 *

$2,670), compared to otherwise similar Whites.

        In total, our estimates imply that minorities spend about $1,350 less per year on these

four consumption categories. In the previous section, we found that Blacks spent an additional

$2,300 on visible goods compared to similar Whites. The results in Table 9 suggest that nearly

sixty percent of this increased spending on visible goods represents resources diverted from

spending on education, health care, food and housing compared to similar Whites. This implies

that policies that try to eradicate the racial gaps in spending on these categories must recognize

that the differences exist partly because of households’ (potentially optimal) decision to consume

conspicuously.

        Finally, we examine how conspicuous consumption affects differences in savings

behaviors across races. It is not obvious that there should be an effect of conspicuous spending

on savings. For there to be such an effect it would have to be the case that the importance of

status considerations diminishes with age, so that households would want to borrow against their

future income to engage in more of it when young.31      Recall our earlier results indicated that, for

all households, visible goods consumption does indeed fall with age. To explore the effect on

savings, we use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) – a survey with detailed

information on household wealth holdings, very accurate information about household income

over multiple periods, and easily accessible identifiers for the households’ state of residence.

        Row 1 of Table 10 shows the raw mean difference in wealth holdings between Blacks

and Whites in the 1999 wave of the PSID. This wealth measure is total net worth which includes

   Corneo and Jeanne (1998) and Becker and Rayo (2006) discuss the conditions under which conspicuous
consumption lowers saving.


                                                                                                    32
housing wealth but not private or public pension wealth.32 The unconditional wealth gap of

nearly $100,000 is in line with previous estimates.                  Controlling for permanent income using a

cubic in five year average income, education and a rich set of demographics explains roughly 60

percent of the unconditional racial gap in wealth holdings. This estimate of how much of the gap

permanent income and demographics explain is consistent with results in the literature (Bound et

al. (2002)).

            The regression in the third row adds state fixed effects. Adding these controls leaves the

measured wealth gap essentially unchanged. In row 4, we add the log of reference group income

μG .        Controlling for the mean income of one’s reference group at the state/race level

dramatically reduces the measured difference in wealth holdings between similar Blacks and

Whites.        Specifically, roughly 60% of the unexplained racial gap in wealth holdings after

controlling for permanent income and demographics is accounted for by average differences in

reference group income. We do not wish to make a strong causal claim about the results in Table

10, however it does appear that the mechanism that leads Blacks to consume more conspicuous

goods than their White counter parts could also explain some of the well documented Black-

White wealth gap.



7.          Conclusion

            This paper contributes to the study of household consumption on several levels. We have

documented the divergent patterns of expenditure on visible consumption goods across races.

Consistent with popular perception, we find that minorities spend more on conspicuous items

than Whites, controlling for differences in income. A variety of estimates show that these visible

expenditure differences are relatively large and are associated with substantial diversion of

        We argue that one does not need to appeal to cultural differences or racial differences in

preferences to understand this evidence. We present a theoretical treatment of status-seeking and

conspicuous consumption. A large subset of such models shares the prediction that visible

consumption should vary negatively with the mean income of the individual’s reference group.

We show that visible consumption patterns both within and across races are consistent with this

prediction. It is important to note, however, that there may yet be racial differences in utility

parameters which act in combination with the effects we have identified.

        The visible consumption items we study are almost surely not the only mechanism that

individuals use to signal their economic position or which they like to consume as much others in

their reference group. The items we study are probably most important for random, anonymous

interactions in society and not for status forthcoming from interaction with friends, family

members or colleagues. If consumption communicates information to these intimates it is likely

to be consumption in the form of things like home furnishings, gas grills and entertainment

durables, or spending on children’s education which only intimates have the opportunity to

observe. If would be interesting in future work to study which specific types of conspicuous

consumption matter in which contexts.

        Our analysis treats reference groups as being the interaction of race and state cells. This

is partially justified on the grounds that there remains significant residential segregation in the

U.S. At the same time, the presence of that segregation may mean that, contrary to our implicit

assumption throughout, people’s reference groups consist merely of those of who live around

them, and that social networks are truly color blind. This is an interesting question for future

work. Also interesting is the issue of the degree to which people choose their neighbors with an

eye to satisfying the status considerations that we have identified.




                                                                                                34
        We believe that there are many implications of our results. For one thing, we show in the

theoretical discussion that the prediction that conspicuous spending varies negatively with

reference group income depends on a specific assumption about how the marginal status return

varies with group income. Our results lend support for this way of representing status in future

analyses. In addition, the finding that reference-group considerations matter for consumption

behavior suggests that other aspects of household financial behavior beyond consumption and

saving decisions may be similarly affected. For example, there may be different attitudes towards

idiosyncratic risks and risks that are common to the individual’s reference group, with

implications for gambling behavior and under-diversification of investment portfolios, as

explored in Roussanov (2007).

        Also, the support that our results yield to the status-based view of conspicuous

consumption has implication for welfare and policy design. Status-signaling models imply

equilibrium over-consumption of visible goods at the expense of possibly inefficient reduction in

other outlays, such as those financing education, health, and saving. One consequence is that the

provision of certain benefits in kind (such as those associated with health care and education

expenditures) might lead to a superior outcome than that attained through monetary transfers. At

the same time, participation in means-tested social programs, if observable, is a signal associated

with being a poor type, giving rise to a stigma attached to such programs. Ireland (1994) provides

a careful analysis of these issues. Combining these theoretical insights with the empirical

understanding of status seeking is a promising area of future research that should help to provide

quantitative evaluation of various social programs.

        Finally, the hypothesis that the desire for social status can explain various economic

behaviors is found frequently within the social sciences. For example, Bloch et al. (2003) argue

that the desire to signal social status can explain differences across households in their spending

on wedding celebrations in rural India. Chung and Fisher (2001) explore the conspicuous

spending patterns of recent immigrants into Canada. Frank (2000) makes a forceful argument that


                                                                                                35
conspicuous consumption is a key driver of household expenditures and (under-) saving in the

U.S. We believe that the mechanism we have highlighted may yield valuable insights about

behavior of individuals within a variety of social and economic settings.

         For our primary analysis, we use the extracts of the Consumer Expenditure Survey
(CEX), compiled by Harris and Sabelhaus and posted online by the National Bureau of Economic
Research (NBER).33 The NBER CEX files are available from 1980Q1 – 2003Q1, and we use
data from 1986 to 2002. 1986 is the first year that the CEX data included unique family
identifiers, which we need to merge key additional information from the BLS’s raw CEX data
files. The NBER CEX extracts were intended to provide a condensed version of original data
which was consistent over time. The extracts include information from the CEX family files,
member files, the detailed expenditure files, and the detailed income files. The extracts aggregate
spending over 500 detailed items in the raw data into 47 spending categories. Our analysis
further aggregates spending into 15 categories, summarized in Appendix Table A1. The 15
categories we use in this paper is the universe of all expenditure categories in the NBER CEX
files. We restricted the NBER-CEX data to include only household heads (ensuring that there
was only one observation per household in our data). After deletions, our analysis sample
included 48,758 households, comprised of 36,706 White households, 6,760 Black households,
and 5,292 Hispanic households.


We briefly summarize any modification and restrictions we imposed on the data.

• The NBER CEX files do not include state of residence, Hispanic origin, city size, the number
  of adults in the household, and the number of quarters that the household participated in the
  survey. We downloaded these key variables from the CEX raw files and merged them in
  manually to the analysis sample.

• As is standard in the literature, we compute a measure of housing service flows. For renters,
  this is the rent for their home/apartment; for homeowners it is home owner’s report of the
  rental equivalence of their home. In the analysis, we experimented with other measures of
  housing flow services, such as setting it to 6% of homeowner’s housing value. The results
  were unaffected.

• The analysis uses two measures of vehicle spending: a “limited” measure which includes only
  net outlays (mostly down-payments) associated with the initial purchase of vehicle; and an
  “expanded” measure which includes the repayment of principle on vehicle loans, spending on
  maintenance, leasing, repairs, storage and rental, and spending on spending on tires, tubes,
  accessories and other parts.

• Our measure of housing services spending includes spending on the rental of household
  furniture and spending on home maintenance (such as paint, roof repair and replacement),
  home remodeling (adding an addition) and home decorating (wall to wall carpeting,
  replacement of hard wood floors). The inclusion of these categories is an artifact of the NBER
  CEX files. The measure of rent paid for tenant-occupied dwellings in the NBER CEX files
  combines a broad set of housing expenditures aside from rent paid and as a result, it is
  impossible to disaggregate the data at a finer level.



33
 See http://www.nber.org/data/ces_cbo.html for the data files. See http://www.nber.org/ces_cbo/Cexfam.doc for
corresponding documentation.
• The NBER CEX files report the sum of spending in a variety of categories across all quarters
  that the household participated in the survey. Households surveyed for two quarters will
  therefore have only half the total expenditure of otherwise identical households participating
  for all four quarters. The NBER CEX files do not include an indicator variable for the
  number of quarters that the household participated in the survey, although a summary variable
  indicates that less than 50% of the sample completes all fours surveys. After manually
  merging in the exact number of quarters that the household participated in the survey, we re-
  expressed the spending data on a per-quarter basis where per-quarter spending in a given
  category was computed as the NBER-CEX data spending in a given category divided by the
  number of quarters that the household participated in the survey.


We made the following restrictions to the CEX sample:

• We included only households reporting themselves as Black, White or Hispanic. We treat
  mixed race heads as Hispanics in our analysis. This has no effect on results, as results are the
  same if we exclude these households.

• We excluded households with total expenditures of over $400,000 per year (in $2005). These
  98 households are the top 0.1% percent of the total expenditure distribution.

• We excluded households that changed their state of residence during the year; in which the
  head’s education was missing (4,134 households); where the household’s region was missing
  (617 households); and from states with fewer than 30 minorities in the CEX over the entire
  sample period. Excluded states were: ID, MT, NH, ND, RI, SD, VT, WV, WY. The reason
  for this restriction is that in the second half of the paper we compare racial consumption
  patterns conditional on the mean income of Blacks, Whites and Hispanics in their state
  residence.
                                                  Theory Appendix

          We provide the solution to a particular parametric utility specification, and a formulation

of   status    given     as    own     income,      relative      to      average   community      group     income.

We study a signaling equilibrium, similar in spirit the models of labor market signaling of Spence

(1973).

          Consider a situation where individuals belong to a group with mean income μG . Let

consumers’ preferences be given by:

                                          log ( y i − c ) + α log ( c ) + s i ,

Following Duesenberry (1949), suppose that if personal income were known, status would simply

be “relative income” and given by y i μG . 34 However, because income is not observed, status

will depend not on own income but on society’s inference about income, given the person’s

                                                                           ( )
observable consumption. Let this inference function be g c i . An individual’s status is thus:


                                                           g ( ci )
                                                    s =
                                                      i
                                                                      .
                                                             μG

A utility maximizing agent chooses consumption to satisfy the first order condition:

                                           α      1      g ' ( ci )
                                             −         +            = 0.
                                           ci y i − ci     μG

                                                                                    ( )
Since inferences about income are correct in equilibrium, g c i = y i and equilibrium35

conspicuous consumption satisfies the ordinary differential equation:

                                                        ⎛       1        α⎞
                                         g ' ( ci ) = μ ⎜              −   ⎟
                                                        ⎜ g ( ci ) − ci ci ⎟
                                                        ⎝                  ⎠

34
   The relationship between status and relative income (or wealth) has long been explored in economic theory. See Cole
et al (1992) and Becker et al (2005) for examples.
35
   Following Ireland (1994), it can be shown that given the preferences both the monotonicity and the initial value
condition are satisfied. The monotonicity (single crossing condition) states that conspicuous consumption is increasing
in income. The initial value condition is that the poorest individuals do not signal, i.e. their consumption of visible
goods is the same as it would be without signaling.
Via a change of variables ci = xi y i where xi is the expenditure share of conspicuous goods and


             ( )       ( ( )) = y
redefining w x i = y i c i x i       i
                                         we have


                                                  ⎛ 1      α⎞
                                         ( )
                                     w ' x i = μG ⎜       − i⎟
                                                  ⎝ 1− x x ⎠
                                                        i



Solving this by integration yields

                              ⎛ 1      α⎞
               wi ( x ) = μ ∫ ⎜                                (      )
                                      − i ⎟ dx + K = − μG ln 1 − x i − μGα lnx i + K ,
                              ⎝ 1− x x ⎠
                                    i



where the integration constant K is pinned down by the initial condition:

                                                              α
                                     w−1 ( ymin ) = xmin =        .
                                                             1+ α

In summary, in this signaling model where status depends on relative income, the share of

expenditure devoted to conspicuous consumption, or xi , is increasing in individual income and

decreasing in the mean income of the social group, μG (holding the minimum income in the

community constant).

are average over all quarters that the household remained in the survey. Sample includes all individuals
between the ages of 18 and 49 (inclusive) where the head reported their race as being either White, Black
or Hispanic over all quarters in the sample. We also restricted the data to households that did not change
their state during their sample period and who had non-missing values for their educational attainment,

Notes: See note to Table 1 for sample description and relevant sample sizes. The table reports the coefficient on the race dummies from a regression of the log
of visible consumption on a race dummies and other controls. Specification 2 includes the log of current income, if income is positive, a cubic in the level of
current income, and a dummy for whether current income was positive. Specification 3 also includes the log of total expenditure, and a cubic in the level of total
expenditure. Specification 4 is the same as specification 3 without the income controls. Specification 5 is the same as specification 3 but also includes three
education dummies (exactly high school, some college, or college or more). Specification 6 includes year dummies. Specification 7 also includes a quadratic in
age, a male dummy, a married dummy, census regions dummies, a MSA dummy, an urban dummy, wealth controls, and a series of separate dummies for the
number of adults and children in the household. Robust standard errors (clustered at the state level) are reported in parentheses.

Note: For panel I, sample and specification are the same sample and specification used in Row 7 of Table 2 except for the fact that the dependent variable is a
sub component of visible consumption (cars, clothing and jewelry, or personal care). The sample for panel II are the same for panel I except for the further
restriction that the household must report owning at least one automobile. The limited measure of car spending includes only initial outlays for new or used cars.
The expanded car spending measure includes the initial outlays plus car services and the principal component of the vehicle loan payment. See the Data
Appendix for the complete discussion of the two car measures. Our primary measure of visible consumption only includes the limited measure of car spending.
Robust standard errors (clustered at the state level) are in parentheses.

specification was estimated via OLS.

Notes: Sample and specification for the results in this table are the same as the sample and specification
shown in Row 7 of Table 2 except that the dependent variable of log visible consumption is replaced with
the log of another expenditure category. Robust standard errors (clustered at the state level) are in
parentheses for the OLS regressions. Bootstrapped standard errors are in parenthesis for the Tobit
regressions.

Men vs. Log of Mean Income of All Men in State


Notes: Sample in the table is the same as used in Tables 2 except for the additional restriction that it only includes White households (n = 36,706). For column
(1), the specification is the same as in row 7 of Table 2 except for the following two changes: the race dummies are dropped as regressors and the log of mean
total household labor income of White men in the household’s state of residence is included as a regressor. In column (2), we add in log housing shelter
expenditures as an additional control. In Column (3), we add both log housing shelter expenditures and log mean income of all men in the household’s state of
residence as an additional control. The p-value indicating whether the coefficient on log of mean White male income within the state and the coefficient on log
mean income for all males within the state is shown in the fifth row of the table. In column (4), we add the log relative standard deviation of White male total
household labor income to the specification in Column (2). Log relative standard deviation is computed as the log standard deviation of income for White men in
a state divided by the log of mean income of White men in a state. See the text for a discussion of how we used CPS data to compute the mean income statistics
by state of residence. Robust standard errors (clustered at the state level) are shown in parentheses.

Men vs. Log of Mean Income of All Men in State

Notes: This table shows the coefficients from regressions similar to those estimated in Table 6. However, unlike Table 6, this table includes only Black men in
the sample (column 1; n = 6,760), hispanic men in the sample (column 2; n = 5,292), or pooled Black and hispanic men in the sample (columns 3 – 6; n =
12,052). The log of mean household labor income of Black men or hispanic men are computed using data from the CPS and then matched to households in the
CEX using state identifiers. Log of mean own group income in the state is the Black mean if the respondent is Black and is the hispanic mean if the household is
hispanic. Robust standard errors (clustered at the state level) are in parentheses.

table replicates the results shown in Row 7 of Table 2. In the second column, we include state fixed effects. In the third column, we add the log of mean own
group income as an additional control (but exclude state fixed effects). In the fourth column, we include both state fixed effects and the log of mean own group
income within the state of residence. The log of mean own group income in the state is defined in the note to Table 6. In column 5, we include the log of relative
standard deviation of income for one’s own group within their state of residence. This variable is also defined in the not to Table 6. Robust standard errors

Notes: Row 1 of this table estimates racial differences in spending on education (panel A), health care
(panel B), food (panel C) and housing (panel D) analogous to the regressions shown in Table 5. See notes
to Table 5 for details. In row 2 of Panels A-C, we add the share of expenditures allocated to housing as an
additional control. In the last row of each panel, we added the share of expenditure allocated to visible
goods as an additional control.

Notes: Data come from the 1994 – 1999 Waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Table reports the coefficient on a Black dummy from a
regression of total net worth less vehicle wealth in 1999 on a Black dummy and a series of additional controls. In Row 1, the only control in the regression is the
Black dummy. In Row 2, we also include permanent income and demographic controls. Our permanent income measure is total family labor income averaged
over all years the household was in the sample between 1994 and 1999. We include a quartic in permanent income in the regression. Our demographic controls
include a quadratic in age, education dummies, family size dummies, dummies for the number of children in the household, marital status dummies, and a male
dummy. The log of mean own group income in the state is the same as defined in the previous tables. The sample is restricted to all Black and White households
in the 1999 PSID between the ages of 18 and 49 (inclusive). The top/bottom five percent of the wealth distribution is truncated.

                            Appendix Table A2: Survey Questions

Q1:     Background Information

Sex (male or female) ; Age ; Race (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, or other) ; Current
Marital Status (single ; married)

Q2:      Beliefs About the Visibility of Consumption Categories

In this set of questions, we are attempting to gauge how easy it is to observe the amount someone spends on
a broad set of consumption categories.

Consider a person who lives in a household and community roughly similar to yours. How closely would
you have to interact with this person in order to observe that they consistently spend more than average on
each of the following consumption categories?

Your answers should range from 1 to 5 with:

1=      I would observe their above average spending even if I did not interact with them socially at all.
2=      I would observe their above average spending if they were a casual acquaintance and I only
        occasionally interacted with them socially.
3=      I would observe their above average spending only if they were a friend.
4=      I would observe their above average spending only if they were a close friend.
5=      I would never observe their above average spending no matter how much I interacted with them
        socially.

Q3:      Response of Spending to Income Changes

In this set of questions, we are trying to understand one's perceptions about the relationship between
income and consumption for a variety of consumption categories.

Consider a randomly chosen individual in society. Imagine that this person's lifetime income suddenly
increased by 20%. For each item below, tell us how you would expect the person's spending on each of the
following items to change.

1=      Spending would fall
2=      Spending would stay the same
3=      Spending would increase by less than 20%
4=      Spending would increase by exactly 20%
5=      Spending would increase by more than 20%

Categories respondents asked about (exact wording): Grocery Expenditures (food purchased at grocery
stores excluding spending on tobacco products and alcohol); Non Grocery Food Expenditures (restaurants,
cafeterias, etc.); Alcohol; Tobacco Products (cigarettes, cigars, etc.); Clothing, Shoes, and Clothing
Accessories; Jewelry and Watches; Personal Care and Grooming Expenditures (including hair care, make-
up, perfume, and gym memberships); Shelter Expenditures (monthly rent payment, house value, etc.),
Household Utilities (expenditures for telephone service, home heating, home electricity, etc.); Value of
Owned and Leased Vehicles (excluding expenditures on maintenance and repair); Vehicle Maintenance
and Repair (oil changes, car repairs, other car maintenance); Other Transportation Expenses (gasoline,
public transportation, parking fees, rental cars, etc.); Home Furnishings (furniture, linens, dishes, etc.);
Entertainment Durables (television sets, stereos, sports equipment, other entertainment equipment); Other
Entertainment Expenditures (DVDs, cads, movie tickets, golf fees, books, periodicals, cable television fees,
vacation travel); Children’s Education (tuition, books, other school related expenses); Health Expenses
(health insurance, out of pocket medical expenses, prescription drugs); and Charitable Giving (including
religious giving).

Notes: This table summarizes the results of our survey of 213 graduate students about their beliefs about
what goods are visible. Appendix Table A2 outlines the exact wording of the survey questions. Column 1
reports the fraction of households who answered 1 or 2 to survey question Q2. Answers 1 or 2 indicated
that the survey respondents would be able to ascertain above average spending on the consumption
category for individuals with which the respondent was relatively unfamiliar. Column 2 reports the
fraction of households who answered 4 or 5 to survey question Q3. Answers of 4 and 5 indicate that the
survey respondent believed there was a unitary income elasticity or greater with respect to spending on the
consumption category.

consumption categories. For each consumption category, the first row shows the average spending per
quarter in that category (in 2005 dollars), the second row shows the fraction of households with positive
spending in the consumption category, and the third row shows the share of expenditures in the
consumption category out of total expenditures. Columns 1-4, respectively, show the relevant statistics for
the total population, a sample with White heads, a sample with Black heads, and a sample of Hispanic
heads.

              Visible Good Engel Curves Separately for Blacks and Whites




Notes: Figure shows the Engle Curve estimates of log visible expenditures on log family income
separately for Blacks (solid line) and Whites (dotted line) using expenditure and income data from the
CEX. CEX family income was instrumented using log total expenditures and a cubic in the level of total
expenditures. The respective Black and White samples only included those households who reported
positive family income. The regressions were estimated over a similar range populated by both Black and
White households. Specifically, the regression was only estimated for households with annual total family
income less than $100,000 (in 2005 dollars). This income cutoff was approximately the 99th percentile of
the Black income distribution. The estimated coefficient from the White Engle curve and the Black Engel
curve, respectively, were 1.59 (standard error = 0.02) and 1.40 (standard error = 0.04). The corresponding
intercepts, respectively, were -10.20 (standard error = 0.24) and -7.76 (standard error = 0.39).

Note: This figure plots the coefficients on state fixed effect from a regression of log total expenditure in a
given expenditure category on state fixed effects and income, expenditure, demographic controls, and log
housing shelter expenditures for White households against mean total family labor income of White males
in the corresponding state. The sample and controls used in the regression to estimate the state fixed effects
are otherwise identical to the one used in Row 7 of Table 2. Alabama was the omitted state fixed effect.
All state fixed effect coefficients (vertical axis) are percentage differences from an otherwise identical
household from Alabama. A regression line is fitted through the data weighting each point by the number
of observations from each state from the regression sample. Only 38 states were included in the regression
due to the fact that some states are not sample in the CEX. See text for a complete discussion. The only
differences between figures 2a-2f are 1) the dependent variable in the regression to get the state fixed
effects and 2) whether or not log housing expenditures were included as a control. The title to the figures
identifies the dependent variable and whether or not housing expenditures were included as a control.
