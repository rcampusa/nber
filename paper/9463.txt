                                            ABSTRACT

       America’s most innovative firms participate in the U.S. Commerce Department’s Advanced
Technology Program (ATP) – those that participated at least once accounted for over 40 percent of
U.S. patents to U.S. entities during 1988-1996. Many firms are repeat participants. ATP participation
has significant and robust effects on innovation in firms, generally increasing firms’ patenting during
the time they are receiving ATP support, when compared to patenting by the same firms prior to and
after the ATP award. ATP participation increases firms’ patenting on average by between 5 and 30
patents per year during the period of ATP participation. This represents a 4 to 25 percent increase
in firms’ patenting compared to the period before ATP participation. Furthermore, joint-venture (JV)
project participation and university participation in a project both appear to have a positive impact
on firm patenting. The amount of funding received by the firm is crucial for single participants, with
the positive impact concentrated in those firms with large grants. Single participants are more likely
than JV members to be small startups for which ATP funding is large relative to the total R&D
budget. For JV participants, participation is more important than the level of funding.

                                          I. Introduction

       The Advanced Technology Program (ATP), at the National Institute for Standards and

Technology (NIST), aims to fund enabling technologies which firms are not likely to pursue in a

timely way without the ATP. The role of the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) is to

“bridge” the gap from demonstrating a promising but risky idea to garnering the organizational

resources to commercialize a product. In doing so, the ATP increases the prospect of commercial

capture of advanced technology. NIST made its first awards in 1990, based on peer-reviewed

proposals submitted by either individual firms or joint ventures of two or more collaborating

firms. Over its ten-year history, ATP has managed over 1000 participants and subcontractors.

       A necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the success of the Advanced Technology

Program is that it contributes to the success of participant firms: If the participant firms do not

benefit from the new technology, others are unlikely to adopt it. Hence, as a first step, we search

for evidence of ATP’s overall impact on firm success. Our second step is to investigate what

might explain any impact on firm success that we may discover. We consider the effect of

program design. ATP makes two types of awards — for projects that explicitly involve

collaboration between two or more firms (and also possibly other organizations such as

universities and federal laboratories); and for projects proposed by individual firms, with no

formal collaborative framework. The former we term joint venture or JV projects, and the latter

we call single participant or SP projects. Our study examines the effects on firms related to these

project structure differences, and also related to participation by universities (as a full member in

a JV, or as a subcontractor in either an SP or JV project).

       We evaluate ATP’s effects in terms of overall change in successful patent applications

during the period of ATP support. Patents are a useful measure of innovation for all ATP

                                                 1
participants: small, privately held firms; larger public firms; universities; and other research

organizations. During the period 1988 to 1996, firms and organizations that participated in ATP

accounted for over 40% of all patents granted to U.S. entities by the U.S. Patent and Trademark

Office (USPTO). Firms comprise 88% of the total number of all ATP participants, and account

for over 80% of all patents awarded to ATP participants. Innovation in “advanced technology”

and patenting appear to go hand-in-hand for nearly all of the firms and organizations

participating in ATP. This concentration of technological progress in relatively few firms is the

stressed by Harberger (1998) and Darby and Zucker (2003).

       In our view, ATP not only provides funding awards to participants, but also promotes

“institution-building” in the process, encouraging applicants to establish new organizational

structures that facilitate innovation and the capture of inventions in technologically advanced

commercial products. Institution-building takes place in ATP in a number of ways. First, ATP

supports firms willing to experiment and develop approaches that are novel and at the

technological frontier. ATP stimulates industry to initiate projects that are higher in risk, with

greater potential for broader economic impact. Second, ATP encourages cooperation and

collaboration in R&D activities, among JV partners, and also through subcontracting

relationships with universities, firms, and other organizations. Linkages that are important to

innovation and to technology transfer among firms/organizations are emphasized by ATP in

selecting projects initially, and then also in project review and monitoring activities.

       In social science terminology, the ATP project changes participants’ “social

embeddedness” in networks of relations with other firms and organizations. While this effect

may be especially prominent for Joint Venture participants, firms in Single Participant projects

also note the importance of R&D subcontractors and relationships for achieving project

objectives. To the extent that ATP project participation enhances firms’ social network for R&D,

we expect that the impact on innovation outcomes will extend beyond the project level to the

firm level. Therefore, we assess the impact of ATP at the firm level in a ‘before’ and ‘after’



                                                  2
comparison of firm-level innovation outcomes.

       The next section develops the analysis of ATP program design as institution building.

Section III lays out the methodology of our empirical analysis, focusing particularly on panel

design and sampling criteria and variable construction. The main empirical results are reported

in Section IV where we estimate the overall and separate effects of participation and funding

amount on the rate of patenting by program participants. Conclusions are drawn in Section V.

Beginning at page 32 after the main body of the paper is a technical appendix which elaborates

on methodology, data, and estimates.

                       II. ATP Program Design as Institution-Building

       The “social embeddedness” perspective on economic behavior of individuals and firms

emphasizes the social context and interactions of economic actors. In traditional economic

theory, economic behavior is analyzed in terms of rational choice and utility-maximizing

individuals or profit-maximizing firms, and relatively little emphasis is placed on specific

historical and social context. Sociologists on the other hand have emphasized the importance of

understanding how specific social relationships shape economic behavior and economic

outcomes. Economic behavior is embedded in a social context, and the characteristics of

particular social relations affect economic behavior and determine economic outcomes.

Granovetter (1985) provides a number of useful examples. When disputes arise in business, they

are “frequently settled without reference to the contract or potential or actual legal sanctions.”

Instead, personal relationships based on cooperation and trust are important to solving problems

and reaching agreements. Or when firms subcontract, or make sales or purchasing decisions,

long-term sustained relationships between firms are often built on ongoing social interactions or

networks.

       When ATP makes an award and funds a project, the participating firms and other

organizations establish R&D and business ties, thus extending and enhancing their social

network for innovation. By fostering organizational interactions, ATP builds the institutional



                                                3
basis for innovation. From their networks, firms gain access to knowledge and complementary

expertise of R&D partners, as well as business and marketing resources of partner firms. The

social embeddedness perspective on R&D and innovation emphasizes that ATP project

participation is a conscious institution-building process — firms partner under the ATP to

establish R&D structures that are favorable to high-risk research, and conducive to socially

beneficial behaviors such as research cooperation and information sharing, in joint ventures and

in university collaborations for example.

       We highlight a few types of social embeddedness — social relations that alter economic

behavior and outcomes — that are particularly important aspects of ATP’s institution-building:

•   Close contact among researchers in collaborative R&D work. Such relationships are most

    likely to transmit novel knowledge that is close to the knowledge frontier and hence often

    tacit in nature (Zucker, Darby, and Armstrong 1998).

•   Relaxation of boundaries around the firm, permitted because information gains are expected

    to be sufficiently valuable to the firm to offset any losses (Zucker et al. 1996). The boundary

    permeability allows more flow of information and hence more learning across organizations

    than would otherwise be the case. Boundary design is often part of the strategic arsenal of a

    firm (Helper, MacDuffie, and Sabel 2000).

•   Development of institution-based trust that rests on institutional structures rather than

    interpersonal or specific characteristics of the other party (Zucker 1986). Two examples of

    institution-based trust provided for by ATP include: (a) Third-party (ATP) monitoring of

    participants’ behavior in Joint Ventures to ensure cooperation (see Zucker et al. 1996); and

    (b) Administrative structures and agreements (e.g., intellectual property agreements, JV

    administrative structures) to increase confidence in successful coordination (see Das and

    Teng 1998).

       We believe that the implicit design of ATP encourages firms to relax their boundaries

and share knowledge. Actors will contribute more to a collective good when they believe their



                                                 4
action is likely to have efficacy, and when there are norms of fairness that encourage them to

match the contributions of others (Gould 1993). ATP provides an institutional structure and

mechanisms that makes efficacy and “fairness” more likely. The gains from research

collaboration derive from resource exchange in complementary capabilities, information,

financial resources, and access to particular technologies or science base. ATP provides

opportunities for firms (and other organizations) to collaborate and realize these potential gains.

Firms participating in ATP gain from the project, learn from each other, and become better at

innovating.

       ATP institution-building is also evident in ATP guidelines for design of projects and

structuring of partners to produce greater research synergy. For example, ATP encourages a mix

of JV partners in order to further prospects for R&D success and technology commercialization

and diffusion: “Joint ventures should aim to include companies of diverse size, including smaller

companies, and possibly other organizations, such as universities and national laboratories”

(ATP 1999: 34). And many ATP projects involve universities. Since universities are often at the

center of new discoveries and their application, particularly discoveries that involve radical change

from prior knowledge (see Zucker and Darby 1996; Zucker, Darby and Brewer 1998; Liebeskind et

al. 1996; also Jaffe 1989), university relationships may be a key source of information for many

ATP projects.

       ATP has a goal of encouraging collaborations among firms, and between firms and

universities and other organizations (federal labs, independent research institutes) in the U.S.

innovation system. ATP encourages formation of JVs, providing potentially higher award levels

and more years of funding, and encourages JV members to establish governance structures for

internal management of JVs. ATP’s suggestions for design of JVs tends to relax the boundaries of

participants’ organizations. ATP in effect opens up boundaries where the ATP project impinges,

encouraging joint governance and reasonable access by all JV members to intellectual property

created within the JV. “Spillovers” or transfers of knowledge to other JV members occur within this



                                                 5
enlarged “information envelope” that protects information dissemination (Zucker et al. 1996). In

particular, internal task routines that are difficult to understand from outside of organizations may be

transferred (see Nelson and Winter 1982: 123-124).

       Enlarging effective organizational boundaries to encompass new research collaborations has

two main effects that cause more information sharing to occur: (1) JVs make knowledge created by

one participant organization more observable to the other participants, since internal task routines

that are often unobservable across organizational boundaries become transparent through joint work

among scientists, engineers, and other technically trained workers; and (2) boundary enlargement

may define a new “commons,” an area of mutual benefit around the shared ATP project, which may

draw in additional shared resources as research effort progresses or shows promise.

       Our argument is that JV participants, because of ATP’s institution-building process and

reinforcing project management oversight, operate in — are “embedded in” — a different social

context or new social structure when they enter a new JV through an ATP award. By becoming

embedded in the new structure, JV participants derive an informational or knowledge benefit.

The firms not only have more financial resources through ATP funding, but also have changed

social relationships (more collaborators and different collaborators, and more intense

collaborations). These relationships provide intellectual capital, and social contacts that add value

through learning processes that result in information or knowledge transfer (Hamel 1991; Doz

1996). Many JVs, for example, come together specifically to apply for ATP funding, and bring

together firms that have not worked together before.

       Comments by ATP participants in JVs support our argument. As one JV member notes:

“Excellent collaborative environment and complementary technical capabilities have improved

the quality of technical output and effectiveness of the team. There has been tremendous synergy

between the companies that are collaborating on this project. Each company brings a particular

expertise that the others don’t have and which would be difficult to develop. Each party is an

enabler for the others” (Powell and Lellock 2000: 23). Another JV participant states: “Exposed



                                                   6
to new ideas, technologies that would otherwise not have been exposed to. Enabled us to leap

forward with newer approaches into our architectural design.” For projects that involve

collaboration, 97% of participants report that the collaboration stimulated creative thinking, and

86% report that the collaboration allowed them to obtain R&D expertise (Powell and Lellock

2000: 20). (See Appendix Figure A2 for additional detail on intellectual property strategies.)

       The new JV learning context also includes firms, universities, federal labs, and

organizations outside of the JV, organizations which JV partners collaborate with or are linked to

in some way. These connections multiply access to other kinds of knowledge, which provides

additional expanded information advantage (see Granovetter 1973, on the strength of weak ties

in social networks). As one JV member explains: “In general, the collaboration has allowed us to

contact new potential collaborators and markets. Some of these markets are for new equipment

using our technology in ways we had not considered. Due to the success of the JV, the various

members are investigating projects outside the ATP” (Powell and Lellock 2000: 25).

                                          III. Methods

       Institution-building by ATP and the resulting organizational and informational

advantages held by ATP participants are factors that enter into the innovation process in ATP

projects. How do we best measure the impact? To assess changes in organizational learning and

knowledge through ATP projects, we will study change in innovation outcomes, comparing

‘before’ and ‘after’ ATP. A major purpose of ATP is to increase commercial capture of advanced

technology. Patents are arguably the single best measure of commercial capture of invention,

conveying intellectual property rights. Patents are in fact commonly used to protect intellectual

property created under ATP support: 76% of organizations report that patenting is a primary or

secondary strategy for intellectual property, with only 12% reporting that patenting is unlikely

(Powell and Lellock 2000: 43).

       In the analysis to follow, we assess whether ATP projects have a general effect on

formation of new intellectual property within the firm. While an ATP project may represent only



                                                7
one R&D effort among many at a firm, to the extent that ATP changes firm behavior,

institutional setting, or social embeddedness, the impact of the ATP project may extend beyond

the project to affect the firm more generally. Our key indicator of impact on firm innovation is

whether the overall rate of patenting by a firm increases after participation in ATP begins. We

focus on project structure (Joint Venture vs. Single Participant), and university participation

(university partner in a JV project, and university subcontractor in a JV or SP project). We use a

patent count measure based on archival data assembled by Hall, Jaffe, and Tratjenberg (2001) and

significantly augmented by the Center for International Science, Technology, and Cultural

Policy (CISTCP) at UCLA.

       Our first step is to set the unit of analysis. Archival data on patents are generally

available only for the firm or organization as a whole, and not for specific locations of multi-

location firms. Our analysis of whether participation in ATP has a positive effect on firms is

therefore centered on the firm/organization as the basic unit of analysis. Figure 1 shows the

number of ATP projects and firm participants from ATP award years 1990-1998. Figure 2 shows

the distribution by SP or JV type for projects and all participants, from ATP award years 1990-

1998. The number of single firm projects is about twice the number of joint venture projects. But

because joint ventures involve multiple participants, the number of JV participants is more than

twice the number of SP participants. Some firms/organizations have participated in more than

one ATP project, and some have been in both JV and SP projects. More detailed description of

the data is included in the Technical Appendix.

       Many ATP participants work with university scientists. Figure 3 shows that nearly three

quarters of unique ATP firm participants have had university partners or subcontractors. Figure 4

shows the distribution of firms by technology area and type of university participation. We

establish a hierarchy to define firm participants as JV or SP, with or without university partner. If

a firm has been a full partner in a JV project from ATP award years 1990-1998, then it is

considered to be a “JV firm.” JV firms that have had a university as a JV partner or sub-



                                                  8
contractor in this period are defined as “JV firm – university partner and subcontractor.” JV

firms that have had only a university JV partner or only a university subcontractor are defined as

“JV firm – university partner” or “JV firm – university subcontractor.” The remaining JV firms

are “JV firm – no university.” Single participant firms are classified as either “SP firm –

university subcontractor” or “SP firm – no university.”

A. Sampling Criteria and Panel Design

       Patenting by ATP-awardee firms is tracked before, during, and after they become ATP

participants, allowing us to assess patenting performance for periods with and without ATP support.

ATP participant firms can therefore serve as their own comparison group.

       For our analysis we include all firms involved in R&D in projects that started by the end

of 1995. (We exclude some participants involved only in administrative functions, and

participants involved only in projects cancelled before completion.) Firms enter our analysis

panel in the year the firm was founded, or in the first year of our panel, 1988, if the firm was

founded before 1988. We chose 1988 as the first year for the panel to allow for pre-ATP

observation years even for firms entering in the first ATP cohort (1991). The panel ends in 1996

because number of patents dated by year of application is our key variable of interest, and by

1997 the count of patents by year of application becomes truncated because many patent

applications from 1997 have yet to emerge from the patent process, given that our patents

granted data ends June 30, 1999.

       Table 1 presents the panel structure for the two samples of firms. In order to match patent

data, multiple establishments of the same firm are counted as one unit, even though different

locations of a firm may be participating at different times in ATP. The first sample (panel A) is all

firms that have participated in ATP, and the second sample (panel B) is publicly traded firms that

have participated in ATP. New entrants to the panel, in years other than the first year of the panel,

are due to founding of a new firm. Table 2 shows the distribution of firms by size category.




                                                 9
B. Variable Construction

        Our analysis of ATP impact is based on measurement of changes in patenting success by

firms during and after participation in ATP. The overall rate of patenting depends on the

“propensity to patent,” which is affected by the value of getting a patent and the ease of

obtaining a patent (Griliches, 1990). In recent years, Congress and the courts have strengthened

patent rights, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has hired more patent examiners. As a

result, both the rate of patent application and the speed with which patents are granted have

increased. A simple before and after comparison of patenting is therefore subject to criticism as

reflecting trend increases in patenting rather than identifying real program impact. Accordingly,

we develop a “deflated” patent-count measure, which adjusts for year to year changes in the

average rate of patenting, measured by average number of “patents per assignee” for all U.S.

assignees of U.S. patents.

        All dollar amounts (i.e., ATP award amounts and company cost-share amounts, as well as

R&D expenditures for public firms) are deflated to 1996 dollars using the Chain-Type Price Index

for Gross Domestic Product. We construct an R&D stock variable to measure the cumulated “R&D

capital” of the firm. Annual R&D expenditures are available for public firms from the Compustat

database. Annual R&D expenditures are cumulated and discounted to produce the R&D stock

variable.

        Table 3 provides descriptive statistics for the variables used in the empirical analysis for

three groups of ATP participants: (1) All firm participants; (2) Public firm participants, defined as

firms appearing in the Compustat database; and (3) All organization participants, including

universities and other non-profits in JV projects.

        The firm size categories used are based on ATP definitions of firm size. The industry sector

categories are based on ATP definitions of the technology area of the ATP project. These industry

categories refer to the technology area of the ATP project, and are not comparable to the more

typical SIC codes.

                      IV. Empirical Results: ATP’s Effects on Firm Success

A. Effects of ATP Participation on Patenting

        Our basic hypotheses concern the effects of ATP participation on patenting. First, we

hypothesize that participation in ATP projects has a positive effect on patenting at the firm level, that

is, that the benefit of ATP project participation extends beyond the project to the firm level. Second,

we hypothesize that participation in JV projects provides greater benefit to firms than participation

in Single Participant projects, so we expect the ATP participation effect on firm patenting to be

greater for firms in JVs. The argument is that JV membership expands and deepens connections

among organizations, which is “social capital” for firm innovation. Third, we hypothesize that the

effect of ATP participation on innovation, as measured by firm patenting, is greater if the firm

has a university partner or subcontractor. This hypothesis derives from studies that have shown

the importance of academe to science-driven industries (Zucker and Darby 1996, 1998; Zucker,

Darby, and Brewer 1998; Zucker, Darby, and Armstrong 1998; Jensen and Thursby 2001;

Thursby and Thursby 2002).

        We now turn to our main analysis of the panel of all firms that began participation in

ATP by the end of 1995. In Table 4, we control for firm size and project technology area, and

then include dummy variables which describe firms’ type of ATP participation in each year. In

regression 4.1, we see that ATP participation is associated with an increase by 29 in number of

patents awarded to the firm. An increase of 29 patents represents close to a 75% increase in

patenting relative to the mean number of patents per year for firms in the sample. In regression

4.2, we see that ATP Joint Venture project participation has a positive effect relative to Single

Participant project participation. In regression 4.3, we see that Joint Ventures with a university

partner receive an additional positive effect on patenting, and in regression 4.4, we see that

university subcontractors have a positive effect on firm patenting. We conclude that Joint

Venture participation and university participation are important to higher rates of patenting by

firms in ATP projects.



                                                   11
B. Separate Effects of Participation and Funding Amount

       We can extend our analysis by taking into account the total amount of ATP award funds

received, and also the amount received through JV project awards. In this case, the degree or

extent of ATP participation (or the intensity of the ATP “treatment effect”) is indicated by the

amount of ATP award funding received by the firm. Following typical practice, we cumulate

these funds over time, incorporating a 20% per year depreciation rate, to create an ATP award

stock variable. For firms that have participated only in JV projects, the total award stock and JV

award stock variables will be equal, while for firms that have participated in both SP and JV

projects, the total award stock variable will sometimes be greater than the JV award stock

variable. The measured effect on patenting of an additional dollar of SP award funding is equal

to the coefficient on the total award stock variable, while the measured effect on patenting of an

additional dollar of JV award funding is equal to the sum of the coefficients on the total award

stock and JV award stock variables.

       Table 5 reports results for regressions that include size and industry controls, ATP

participation and JV participation variables, ATP award stock and JV award stock variables, and

several university involvement variables. Interpreting the regression results is somewhat

complicated. First, estimates for the effect of ATP participation on patenting must be presented

by specific category of participant (e.g. JV with university partner) at the sample mean for the

category. Second, because the ATP award stock variable is a stock variable, the effect of

participation persists beyond the period of active participation. In Figures 5 and 6, the left bar in

each pair in Figures 5 and 6 presents a conservative interpretation of regression 5.4 by showing

the estimated increase in patenting during the sample period for the indicated groups. (The

estimates of patenting increases per year of participation are computed by multiplying the

relevant coefficients for ATP participation and award stocks by the sample means for each of the

specified groups, summing the results, and dividing by the mean number of years of

participation.) The estimate is conservative in that only about one third of the full effect from the



                                                 12
award-stock variables occurs within the sample period. Even under this conservative approach,

we estimate that the average ATP participant firm increases its patenting by 34 patents per year

of ATP participation during the sample period. Thus, even without allowing for the future effects

of the knowledge created under the ATP program, we find a very substantial effect on patenting

with one quarter of these firms’ patents during 1988-1996 attributable to ATP participation.

There is also evidence that the effect on patenting is greater for those firms that partner with

universities during their ATP participation.

       Table 6 and the right bar in each pair in Figures 5 and 6 present results from similar

regressions with fixed effects for each firm instead of industry and size dummies to control for

unobserved heterogeneity. We find an average increase in patenting by 6 patents per year of ATP

participation during the sample period. This amounts to 4% of these firms’ patenting over the

entire sample period including all the years from 1988 until they began participating in ATP.

       Tables 7 and 8 and the corresponding Figures 7 and 8 present results from similar

regressions for the subsample of firms that are publicly traded. For these firms we have data to

compute a cumulative R&D stock variable in the same way as the ATP award stock variable. For

these publicly traded firms, the regular and fixed-effect regressions produce estimates of increase

in patents by 19 patents and 5 patents per year of ATP participation during the sample period.

                                V. Conclusions and Implications

       We find that patenting generally increases after ATP participation under a number of

different program and participant variations. ATP participation increases patenting on average by

between 5 and 30 patents per firm per year of participation, which represents a 4 to 25 percent

increase in firms’ patenting compared to the period before ATP participation. These estimates

are conservative since future effects from the ATP project participation are not included, even

though they are implied in our regression models. Also, joint-venture project participation and

university participation in a project both appear to have a positive impact on firm patenting. The

findings of this study support the idea that joint ventures and university collaboration have a



                                                13
positive impact on innovation.

       Positive effects of ATP on innovation in participating companies are significant and robust

in the analyses we report in this paper. Our measure of innovation—firm patents—suggests that the

effect of the ATP project spreads beyond the project and has impact on the entire firm. We may

interpret this result as evidence that ATP project participation supports firm-wide behavioral or

organizational changes which foster an increased rate innovation. Alternatively, “internal spillovers”

of knowledge or other benefits from one project to other projects may also help explain the broad

firm-wide effects of ATP participation.

       This study considers the effect of program design—project structure and university

participation—on the innovation success of firm participants. The findings indicate that joint

venture collaboration and university participation have positive effect on innovation outcomes as

measured by patents. These results are interpreted from a sociological perspective that

emphasizes institution-building and social relations as essential to the innovation process. From

this perspective, ATP as a public-private partnership program fills a role in fostering the

institutions and social processes that facilitate innovation.

           We elaborate on five topics: (1) Criteria for inclusion in sample and technology areas; (2)

Technical details on construction of the panel, including an overview of the panel construction

process; (3) Variable construction; (4) Outline of data sources; and (5) Additional empirical

results.



       A.1. Criteria for Inclusion in Sample and Construction of Industry Categories

Criteria for Inclusion in Sample

           Table A1 summarizes the criteria we used to select eligible participants. For our main

analysis we selected firms only, because of the heterogeneity among non-profit ATP participants

and the fact that all are in JVs. In Appendix A.5 below, we briefly examine all organizations

that are ATP participants to check for potential bias in our results. Second, the ATP participant

must be involved in research and development, excluding joint venture participants that served

only administrative functions. Third, we exclude participants involved in projects that were

cancelled before completion. Fourth, the project must have started by the end of 1996, in order

to have multiple years of ATP participation for participants entering late in the period. Fifth, we

determined year of founding for each firm (universities and other non-profits were assumed to be

“born” by 1988 since there is no reliable data available). Firms enter the panel when founded or

in 1988 if founded before that date in order to be able to distinguish whether no patenting in a

given year meant that the organization did not yet exist or was in fact not patenting that year.

           Sixth, still referring to Table A1, we selected 1988 as the starting observation year for

firms already founded to provide some pre-ATP observations even for firms entering in the first

ATP cohort (1991) and end the panel in 1996 because we use the number of patents, by year of

                                                   34
application, for patents already granted (the US Patent and Trademark office releases no

information on patents applied for but not yet granted).          By 1997, the count of patent

applications becomes truncated because many have yet to emerge from the process given that

our patents granted data ends June 30, 1999.

       Table A2 presents the number of organizations in the panel and whether or not they are

active in ATP by year. This table corresponds to panel A of Table 1, with the difference between the

two accounted for by universities and other non-profit organizations.

Construction of Industry Categories: Technology Area of ATP Project

       As discussed in the text, when examining both public and privately held firms it is

difficult to develop an industry code for the privately-held firms that will match, or even

integrate well, with those customarily used for public firms. High technology industry codes,

developed and used in the venture capital industry, do not mesh sufficiently well with SIC codes;

industry categories available in data bases on public firms are not available for privately-held

companies and have the additional problem of not sufficiently identifying sub-industry

specialization across the firm. Further, universities do not have industry coding, though as

partners in ATP JV projects or as subcontractors to either JV or SP projects universities play a

significant role in firm success, as our results show. Accordingly, we used a common “work-

around” by selecting the technology areas of the ATP projects as an industry proxy. The

detailed categories are presented in Figure A1. We used the major bolded categories, except

Z0000-Other which never appeared in the source data.

ATP Participants: Intellectual Property Strategies Planned

       Figure A2 presents additional detail on the distribution of intellectual property strategies

planned by ATP participants.

A.2. Panel: Construction of the Panel and Integration of Merger/Acquisition & Founding

       Our initial problem was to identify the “patenting entity” and organize the ATP

information around that unit of analysis--not necessarily the same as the ATP participant name.

If we found no patents for a particular ATP participant, we were challenged to determine

whether it was a true zero or resulted from not tracing the appropriate patenting entity. In

practice, we found corporate lineage sometimes quite difficult to trace; further, merger activity

alters that relationship over time. Panel construction followed these steps:

Step 1: Identify the Unique Parent Organizations and Link to Patent Assignees

       This step involved name cleaning and careful tracing of parent entities. We developed

and implemented code to filter names and do fuzzy matching with U.S. patent assignees,

followed by hand cleaning of the match results. We create a “variant to preferred” name list for

each ATP participant, locating for example "Regents of the University of California" for the

various UC campuses and associated federal laboratories.

Step 2: Link the ATP Organizations to Archival Firm Data and Refine “Patenting Entity”

       Our refined list of “variant to preferred” names were then matched in to a very large data

set of archival business information about US firms, including venture capital and new issues to

cover both privately-held and public firms. These matches helped to identify additional variant

names, leading to better selection of the preferred name for the firm.

Step 3: Determine the Birth Year for ATP “Patenting Entity”

       An organization doesn’t patent before it is founded, except under very unusual

circumstances (working in a garage with a “virtual firm”). A firm enters the panel after it is

founded. We used firm web sites or resources such as CorpTech and other archival listings of

firms. For firms where we could not find a birth date (less than 10% of the total, and only small

firms), we make the uniform assumption that the firm was born two years prior to its first ATP
                                                36
participation (see Tables 1 and A2 for births post-1988 entry/birth data). It would be ideal to

also clean for firm death, but we did not have sufficient information.           We assumed that

universities and other non-profits existed throughout the period; once again, our information was

too sparse to check this except for universities (and all existed throughout the panel).

Step 4: Determine “Patenting Entities” that Changed Identity With Merger/Acquisition

       We used the SDC merger and acquisitions database, coupled with firms’ web sites, to

determine the date of acquisition 1988 to 1997, and then determined if the “patenting entity”

remained the same after the acquisition/merger or changed. Those that did not change required

no adjustment, but those that did meant that we merged the two company patenting records from

the beginning of the panel or founding (if later) in order to track the same entity over time. We

cannot determine exactly which patents published after the purchase or attributable to the

acquired firm, and which patents are attributable to the acquiring firm. In some cases this means

we also modify the birth year for this ATP parent. Table A3 presents these data, showing the

total number of mergers and acquisitions and then breaking out the number that still patent under

their “old” name and the number that do not—but patent under the new parent name. Among

new “patenting entity” parents, it is interesting to note that a sizeable proportion were also ATP

recipients, suggesting an interesting question for further research.

Deflated Patents

       Our framework for analysis of ATP effects rests on measurement of changes in patent

applications made by companies (for patents that are later granted) during the period they are active

ATP participants and are receiving ATP funding.

       The overall rate of patenting is affected by the value of patents and the ease of obtaining

them (Griliches, 1992). In recent years Congress and the courts have strengthened patent rights

and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has hired more patent examiners. As a result, both the
                                                  37
rate of patent application and the speed with which patents are granted have increased. Thus, a

simple before and after comparison is subject to criticism as reflecting trend increases rather than

any real effect.

        Accordingly, we developed a “deflated” patent-count measure, which corrects for year-

to-year changes in the average number of patents issued to all U.S. assignees of U.S. patents.

We use 1996 as our base year. If there were 2.0 patents per assignee in 1996 and 2.4 patents per

assignee in some other year, firms in our sample that increased by 20% in that year compared to

the base year would show no change in deflated patents. A firm would have to have 1.32 times

as many patents to be credited with a 10% increase (1.32/1.2 = 1.1) and a firm that increased

patenting by 10% would be credited with an 8.3% decrease in deflated patents (1.1/1.2 = 0.917).

. Figure A3 reports data by application year on the total number of U.S. patents granted (up to

June 30, 1999) with a U.S. assignee at issue and the corresponding deflated patents. Note that

the values for 1996 and 1997 show that our procedure also corrects for truncation problems.

Zucker, and Darby (2003) discuss the deflation procedure in detail and examine several

alternative deflators.

        Figure A4 shows that our method of deflation does not alter the basic comparison of

patenting rates before and after ATP participation. Deflation is preferred to including year

dummies in our regression analysis because the logged form of the equation (required to use year

dummies for widely different sized firms) requires us to make the implausible assumption that a

$2 million ATP award has the same percentage effect on patenting in a 10-person startup firm

and large technology firms with hundreds of patents per year.



                                  A.3. Variable Construction

        To construct panel data, all of the ATP program variables were divided into monthly
                                                38
proportions, and then summed for the given year. For continuous variables, such as firm ATP

award, this entailed first dividing the money that the firm is awarded into monthly allocations

based on the duration of the project. If a firm is in more than one project in any given month,

then the firm's amount for that the month is the sum of the monthly allocation for these separate

projects. For ratio variables, such as ATP participation, we started by creating dummy variables

for each month. For instance, if a firm is in the ATP in March 1994 we give it a value of one for

ATP participation for that month. This value is always zero or one, regardless of how many

projects the firm is in simultaneously. We then sum these monthly dummy variables for each

year, and divide by 12, thus getting the fraction of the year that the firm is an ATP participant.

        More generally: Some ATP organizations are in multiple projects, which means all the

organization’s separate involvements are consolidated when they overlap within the same year.

For example, the award amount variable in 1995 for a firm in two simultaneous projects in that

year is the sum of the money given to the firm in both projects that year. This also means, for

instance, that a single observation can be both a single applicant and a JV member in any given

year.

        The unit of observation in the panels is the firm/year, but we construct those variables

from monthly observations because ATP projects are started throughout the year. With this

method, therefore, we do not overvalue ATP variables for a firm in 1995 whose project did not

start until November. For example, the values of ATP variables for this firm would be one sixth

(2 months/12) of their value if the firm were involved in the program all 12 months in the year.

        We convert dollar amounts (i.e., the ATP and JV award dollars, as well as R&D

expenditures for public firms) to 1996 dollars by dividing by the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s

Chain-type Price Index for Gross Domestic Product (1996 = 1.000) downloaded from the BEA

site on July 17, 2000.

       The data used in this paper come from a variety of sources, all of which except the NIST

web site are “limited use” data licensed specifically to UCLA or to Zucker and Darby as

Principal Investigators. Data about Advanced Technology Program (ATP) participants and

projects was provided by Jeanne W. Powell at ATP (limited use data) and from our own data

collection from the NIST web site. We used COMPUSTAT data for firm R&D expenditures.

Our patent data (patent applications for eventually granted patents) come from two different

sources: Hall, Jaffe, and Tratjenberg (2001) patent database through 1996 and from the UCLA-

CISTCUP patent files for 1997-June 1999. To track individual companies over time, we used

data on year of founding and identity of corporate parent, as well as dates of mergers and

acquisitions, from three major data series under separate license to UCLA from the Securities

Data Corporation (SDC), two supported by UC and CISTCP at UCLA and one supported by

ATP/NIST.



                               A.5. Additional Empirical Results
Chi-squared Tests for Constrained Coefficients in Tables 5-8

       Table A4 presents the χ2 tests for the hypothesis that both the coefficient of the ATP

award and the coefficient of the ATP participant are simultaneously equal to zero in the

regressions reported in Tables 5-8.     In every case this hypothesis is rejected at the 0.001

confidence level providing evidence that even where the signs are in opposite directions the net

impact of involvement in ATP is significantly different from 0.

       Table A4 also presents the χ2 tests for the hypothesis that the coefficient of the ATP

award, the coefficient of the ATP participant, the coefficient of the JV award, and the coefficient

                                                40
of the JV participant variables are all four simultaneously equal to zero in the regressions

reported in Tables 5-8 which contain all 4 variables. Here the results are mixed: In the

structural equations the joint hypothesis is again rejected at the 0.001 confidence level. In the

Fixed effects models, dropping all four variables does not increase the sum of squared residuals

by a statistically significant amount.

Estimates for Patenting by All Participants including Non-profit Organizations

        Table A5 compares the descriptive statistics for the panel including all organizations

participating in ATP with those for the all firms and public firm panels (compare Table 3).

Table A6 estimates the results for the full sample (including university and non-profit

participants) and suggests that the full sample is rather like that for all firms.

Tobit Regressions

        We experimented with Tobit regressions as a way to deal with truncation at zero so that

firms either patent so many times or not at all. The results in Table A7 are similar to the panel

and fixed effects regressions reported in the text and more difficult to interpret. Regressions

A7.1 and A7.2 are the controls only and full Tobit regressions for the all firms sample.

Regressions A7.3 and A7.4 and regressions A7.5 and A7.6 are the corresponding regressions for

the public firms and all organizations samples, respectively.

         ATP participants selected for analysis meet the following criteria:
         1. Companies only first, then add Universities & non-profits.
         2. Involved in ATP sponsored research and development.
         3. Not involved in projects cancelled before completion.
         4. Involved in a project that started work by 12/31/1995.
         5. Observation years are from 1988 or the birth year of the organization, whichever is
             greatest, to 1996.
         6. Patent data has a one-year lead, so patent observations are from 1989 to 1997.
