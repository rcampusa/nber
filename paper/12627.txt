Individual Teacher Incentives And Student Performance

                                               ABSTRACT

This paper is the first to systematically document the relationship between individual teacher performance
incentives and student achievement using United States data. We combine data from the National
Education Longitudinal Survey on schools, students, and their families with our own survey conducted
in 2000 regarding the use of teacher incentives. This survey on teacher incentives has unique data
on frequency and magnitude of merit raises and bonuses, teacher evaluation, and teacher termination.
We find that test scores are higher in schools that offer individual financial incentives for good performance.
Moreover, the estimated relationship between the presence of merit pay in teacher compensation and
student test scores is strongest in schools that may have the least parental oversight. The association
between teacher incentives and student performance could be due to better schools adopting teacher
incentives or to teacher incentives eliciting more effort from teachers; it is impossible to rule out the
former explanation with our cross sectional data.

I.      Introduction

        Education reform advocates in the United States and elsewhere frequently argue that, other

than the intrinsic rewards of teaching, there exists little or no incentive for teachers to do a good job.

It is very difficult to fire a poorly performing teacher after that teacher has been in a typical public

school for a brief probationary period. And most public school teachers are paid on a salary scale,

in which a district’s salaries are determined entirely by teachers’ educational attainment and

experience.

        The practice of uniform pay for teachers of similar educational and experience levels,

however, has not always been the norm in the United States. A century ago, incentive systems for

teachers were much more common, but the percent of U.S. school districts using merit pay fell from

48 percent in 1918 to 20 percent in 1939 and just 4 percent in 1953 (Murnane and Cohen 1986).

Amid recent calls for greater use of incentives in government, merit pay plans have spread again.

Ballou (2001) reports that they were found in 10 percent of school districts in 1984 and in 12 percent

in 1993. In recent years, some states have begun to mandate some notion of merit pay. For example,

Florida now requires school districts to earmark a minimum of five percent of the total salary pool

to be used for teacher performance awards, and its state board of education recently approved a

statewide system of student performance-based merit pay. And recently the Denver school district

overhauled their salary schedule to incorporate a large merit pay system.

        While there exists considerable research on the factors underlying schools’ decisions to

implement teacher merit pay plans (e.g., Ballou and Podgursky, 1997; Ballou, 2001) and the stability

of these plans (e.g., Johnson, 1986; Murnane and Cohen, 1986; Hatry, Greiner, and Ashford, 1994),

this increased use of teacher merit pay in American education is occurring with virtually no evidence

on its potential effectiveness. The closest the empirical literature has come to evaluating the
                                                                                                         2

effectiveness of teacher performance incentives in the United States involves school-based incentive

systems. Clotfelter and Ladd (1996) and Ladd (1999) studied Dallas’s school-based program by

comparing the gain in student pass rates in Dallas with those in five other large Texas cities. They

found that pass rates increased in Dallas relative to other cities. But the fact that a positive difference

for Dallas was estimated for the year before the scheme was initiated raises questions about these

findings. Lavy (2002) carefully matched Israeli schools eligible for a school-based incentive

program with schools in similar small communities and found that this program was associated with

higher test scores. Glewwe, Ilias and Kremer (2003) studied the effects of a school-based teacher

incentive experiment in rural Kenya, where every teacher in grades 4 to 8 in a winning school got

the same bonus. The authors show that the specific teacher incentive program introduced in this

experiment led to the manipulation of short-run test scores, but no long-term achievement gains

among students, suggesting that participating teachers may have attempted to “game the system.”

        Although the literature has focused on school-based incentives, most classroom settings

involve one teacher, which makes it possible to reward more effective teachers. We know of just one

published paper that studied incentive programs for individual teachers. Eberts, Hollenbeck, and

Stone (2002), comparing means across two schools, found that individual incentive programs for

teachers were associated with a significant fall in drop out rates but were unrelated to student

achievement. The only evidence of a correlation between individual incentive programs and student

learning is reported in a working paper by Lavy (2003), who found that large teacher incentives in

Israel were associated with increases in the tests directly rewarded by the program. In summary,

there is no U.S. evidence of a positive correlation between individual incentive systems for teachers

and student achievement, and there has been no research at all on the program features and school
                                                                                                         3

settings in which this association is strongest.

        The major reason why we know so little about the relation between teacher performance

incentives in the United States and student performance is that the large micro education data sets

have gathered very little information about schools’ personnel practices. Typically, large data sets

survey schools about union status, and acquire one or two points on the salary schedule. But these

types of questions provide no direct information about the use of teacher incentives. To remedy this

problem, we conducted our own survey of personnel practices in 2000 of the schools represented in

the National Education Longitudinal Survey (NELS), first administered nationally in 1988 to a set

of eighth-graders (with follow-ups in 1990 and 1992) in 1,052 schools. Because there is an eight-

year gap between the NELS data and our own survey data, we also match NELS data to

contemporaneous but less detailed information on the use of merit pay in the 1993 Schools and

Staffing Survey (SASS).

        We find a positive association between the use of individual teacher incentives and student

achievement. We recognize, however, that there are two interpretations of this finding. Under the

first, teacher incentives elicit more effort from teachers, resulting in higher test scores. Alternatively,

schools that are more effective in other difficult-to-measure ways are more likely to adopt individual

teacher incentives, implying that the result is spurious. While we conduct several analyses in an

attempt not to confound our estimated relationship between salary incentives and student

performance with other phenomena, our use of a cross-sectional identification strategy means that

we cannot be certain whether the positive relationship that we report is due to the incentives

themselves or to unobserved school quality. Ultimately an experiment will be needed to reach a

definitive conclusion about whether teacher incentive programs cause teachers, and thus schools,
                                                                                                                   4

to be more effective.



II.     Description of Data

        The NELS, with its rich set of student, family and school attributes, provides an excellent

opportunity for studying many educational policies and practices in a nationally-representative

context. However, as mentioned above, NELS does not include any meaningful variables on teacher

incentives. To remedy this situation, we conducted a survey of the high schools included in the

NELS twelfth grade sample. While our survey data were collected eight years after the last wave

of NELS, they still go a long way toward filling a substantial gap in the existing data.1

        In the summer of 2000, we mailed our Survey of School Teacher Personnel Practices to the

1,319 public and private schools in the United States that were included in the twelfth grade round

of the NELS.2 We mailed a second copy of the survey to those who did not respond two weeks

following the initial survey. Eventually 534 schools returned a survey, representing a 40 percent

response rate. Around eighty percent of these schools (390) completely filled out the survey and had

students who continued through twelfth grade in the NELS.

        Since teacher financial incentives are common to all the schools in a public school district,

we applied the responding schools’ financial incentive measures to non-responding schools in the

same district. This raised our sample size by about twenty percent to 502 eligible schools in total.



        1
           The Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) of 1993, also collected by the U.S. Department of Education, asks
one question about teacher merit pay. Because the SASS is a large national survey, district respondents overlap with
the NELS in 526 schools. We utilize the SASS as a cross-check of our findings as well as to investigate the potential
effects of sample selection bias.
        2
         The number of schools is greater than the initial school count because students from sampled middle schools
went to multiple followed high schools in the NELS.
                                                                                                    5

In the handful of school districts where two or more schools completed our survey, there is high

correlation between schools’ responses to our basic questions, suggesting that this approach is

appropriate. However, we have also estimated models in which we only use information from the

specific schools that responded; the results are very similar and are, in fact, slightly stronger than

those reported herein. These results are available on request.

       Because we still received fewer than half of the surveys we mailed out, one might be

concerned about sample selectivity. It turns out that the respondents to our survey differ in some

important respects from non-respondent NELS high schools. Private schools were more likely to

respond than public schools, perhaps because private school administrators were more interested in

teacher performance incentives. Twenty percent of the students in responding schools attend some

private school, in contrast to 14 percent for the complete NELS sample. As a result of the

differential public-private response rates, we find in Table 1 that responding schools tended to have

significantly (at the ten percent level) higher test scores, and better educated parents than did non-

responding schools. In addition, responding schools tended to be larger and to have students who

took more high school mathematics courses. None of the other variables included in our regressions

(and described below) significantly differ between our survey respondents and non-respondents. All

but one of these differences between respondents and non-respondents disappear when we control

for public/private school sector in Table 1; responding public schools are larger than non-responding

public schools. To allay concerns about sample selectivity, regressions based only on public schools,

where sample selectivity is much less an issue, are reported later in the paper in Table 5. However,

despite the fact that within the public sector respondents and non-respondents are observationally

equivalent across many dimensions, one might still be concerned about sample selectivity. We also
                                                                                                     6

will report in Table 5 another specification in which we use weaker, but contemporaneous, merit pay

measures from the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) of 1993, with a better than 80 percent

response rate. The SASS in both rounds asked a sample of teachers whether they had received a

merit bonus or some other performance pay in the previous year. A public school district or a

private school is counted as having a merit pay plan if at least one of its teachers in this sample

reported having received a merit bonus, and otherwise is counted as not having a merit pay plan. As

shown below, we find that the results from the merged SASS-NELS analysis are very similar to

those presented based on our survey. In addition, we can compare the SASS-NELS results for the

set of schools that responded to our survey and the set of schools that did not respond; the results

the results are quite similar. Taken together, these results indicate that our estimates of the

correlation between test scores and merit pay are not driven by differential non-response of schools.

       Another potentially significant concern with the use of our survey data is that our survey was

conducted eight years after the students were tested in the NELS. It is certainly possible that teacher

compensation practices changed dramatically in the schools considered during this period. We use

the SASS, conducted in successive rounds at almost the identical time as the 1992 round of the

NELS (1993/94) and our 2000 survey (1999/2000), both to help gauge the stability of the merit pay

system as well as to provide a contemporaneous measure of merit pay in the NELS analysis.

       We take two alternative tacks to gauge the stability of merit pay programs. Under the first,

we match SASS schools in 1993/94 and 1999/2000, and compare the use of merit pay programs in

these two years. We find that private schools with a merit pay program in the 1993/94 round of the

SASS were twice as likely as those that did not have such a program to have one in the 1999/2000

round of the SASS (a difference that is statistically significant at the one percent level) and that
                                                                                                                        7

public school districts with a merit pay plan in 1993/94 were 80 percent more likely to have such a

program in 1999/2000. Therefore, while having a merit pay program in 1993/94 is no guarantee that

such a program will have persisted to 1999/2000, there does appear to be substantial persistence in

these programs.

         The second source of information about the stability of merit pay programs comes from

approximately fifty public schools that were in the 1993/94 round of the SASS and that answered

a broad question about the use of merit pay in our 2000 survey.3 Our question asked “Does this

school use [a monetary reward] to reward teacher performance?” The correlation between the

1993/94 SASS measure of the presence of merit pay and the measure of merit pay based on our 2000

survey is high–about 0.4–and statistically significant at the one percent level. This evidence, in

conjunction with that presented in the previous paragraph, suggests that the eight-year time lag

between our survey collection and the NELS study administration is not a major flaw in the research

design. In addition, we will present evidence in Table 5 that the estimated relationship between test

scores and merit pay policies is similar regardless of whether one measures merit pay using our

survey conducted in 2000 or using the SASS measure collected in 1993.

         Non-Incentive Variables Included in Estimation

         The NELS data set has twelfth grade student test scores for reading, mathematics, science,

and history. We report education production functions for the sum of scores on all four tests because

measurement error is smaller with the sum than with the component tests.

         We include a rich set of variables to control for other influences on learning, and thus to



         3
            There was an insufficient number of private schools that overlapped these two surveys to permit any reasonable
statistical analysis.
                                                                                                     8

minimize the omitted variable bias in the estimated relation between the use of teacher incentives

and test scores. We control for the student’s eighth grade test score to account for unmeasured

ability. To the degree to which teacher incentive programs are time invariant, some of the relation

between student performance and the use of merit pay could be absorbed in the prior test score

coefficient. The number of mathematics courses taken in high school and the average number of

days absent per year in high school also capture student ability and motivation. We recognize that

these last two control variables also may be endogenous; when these variables are excluded from the

model, our estimated teacher incentives coefficients are larger in magnitude and statistical

significance than those reported in the paper. Those reported herein are more conservative estimates

of the relation between teacher incentives and student achievement.

       We control for other student background characteristics as well. The student’s sex, race, and

ethnic background, as well as an indicator for whether the student speaks a language other than

English at home, are included in the model. We also control for number of siblings, maternal and

paternal education (using dummies that indicate whether the parent has attained a GED, high school

degree, four year college degree, master’s degree, or a Ph.D. or other terminal degree), and whether

parents provide weekly or daily homework help to their students.

       In addition, we control for various school inputs. Specifically, we include measures of the

average length of the school year (in days) and school day (in instructional minutes) over the

student’s high school career, the school’s pupil-teacher ratio, the average school enrollment per grade

in the student’s school, the percent of teachers with master’s degrees in the school, and the minimum

teacher’s salary. Because teacher incentive variables could influence the attributes of teachers in a

school as well as these other school inputs, we have estimated models that exclude these variables
                                                                                                    9

from the regression analysis, and our teacher incentive coefficients are unchanged in terms of

magnitudes and statistical significance levels.

       Finally, we control for the school’s sector (Catholic, non-Catholic private, or public) and

whether the student’s school in eighth grade (the only year this information is known) was covered

by a collective bargaining agreement. Teacher unionization and school sector could influence the

likelihood that a school employs teacher incentive measures; therefore, these factors are included to

reduce the likelihood that productivity differences across these types of schools are influencing our

policy estimates.

       Incentive Variables

       We created several indicators to capture key elements of the financial incentives that a school

provides its teachers. For one, the use of financial incentives should result in some salary variation

for those who otherwise would have the same salary under a schooling-experience salary schedule.

We asked principals to provide the maxima and minima in the range in teacher salaries for each of

two schooling and experience mixes for experienced teachers: a) Master’s degree and 10 years

experience, and b) Master’s degree and 20 years experience. For each response, the per cent wage

variation was calculated as

       100×[maximum salary (MA, exp) - minimum salary (MA, exp)]
                       minimum salary (MA, exp)

where exp = 10, 20.

       We also asked principals to describe the characteristics of any bonus and raise programs that

reward good teaching. As noted in the introduction, there are a number of “merit pay” systems that

give raises or bonuses to virtually everyone or to a large enough fraction of teachers that the
                                                                                                    10

incentives are greatly weakened. In our sample, schools with merit raises on average gave them to

43 percent of the teachers (with a median value of 10 percent), and on average 36 percent of teachers

(with a median value of 14 percent) received bonuses in schools that offered bonuses. Teachers in

schools with no merit pay or in schools that award merit pay to all or most of their teachers have no

or little incentive to be better teachers. On the other hand, merit programs that offer merit pay to

a small fraction of teachers likely provide teachers with a stronger incentive to do well.

       The salary range, merit raise, and merit bonus responses together describe the school’s use

of financial incentives to reward individual teachers. Evidence of high wage variation, selective

bonuses, or selective raises suggests that teachers face relatively strong financial incentives to be

more effective. We construct three alternative indices of merit pay that measure different levels of

the strength of merit pay. These indices are based on the response values that would place the school

among the top 20 percent, 40, percent, and 60 percent of “merit-indicating”schools that on that

question indicated some use of financial incentives. We chose these thresholds for convenience, but

our results are not sensitive to marginal changes in these thresholds. We identified three separate

indices of merit pay strength in order to determine the degree to which the estimated correlation

between merit pay and test scores is sensitive to changes in the definition of merit pay. We conclude

below that the results are similar across different measures of merit pay strength.

       The top 20 percent of merit-indicating schools had at least one of the following indicators

of high salary incentives: a) at least a 20 percent salary range, b) merit raises that are given to no

more than 5 percent of teachers, or c) merit bonuses that are received by no more than 7 percent of

the teaching staff. We construct two indices of high salary incentives: an indicator for whether any

of these three attributes are true, and an index of the number of these three attributes that are true.
                                                                                                    11

As can be seen in Table 2, 91 of our 502 schools fall into one of these categories, 6 meet two of these

criteria, and none meet all three.

       We also construct similar indices where we define merit pay variables at the 40th and 60th

percentiles of the distribution of schools with that incentive measure. The medium-strength merit

pay index counts a school as having merit pay if the salary range is at least 13 percent, if fewer than

10 percent of teachers receive a merit raise, and/or if fewer than 12 percent of teachers receive a

merit bonus. One hundred and twenty-eight schools meet one of these criteria, 10 satisfy two, and

1 meets all three. The lower-strength merit pay index counts a school as having merit pay if the

salary range is at least 10 percent, if fewer than 20 percent of teachers receive a merit raise, and/or

if fewer than 20 percent of teachers receive a merit bonus. One hundred and fifty-nine schools meet

one of these criteria, 15 satisfy two, and 1 meets all three. These three indices represent three

alternative thresholds for defining merit pay for teachers. The relatively small number of schools

with a well designed incentive system precludes the use of more complex incentive variables.

       Other variables capture incentives that may result from teacher evaluation and dismissal.

Half the schools evaluate experienced teachers annually instead of less frequently. More frequent

performance review is expected to improve teacher performance. The threat of dismissal may be a

powerful incentive for teachers to do a good job. Therefore, we also measure whether at least one

teacher with three or fewer years of experience was dismissed or counseled to leave over the last

three academic years; this was true for 66 percent of schools. In addition, we measure whether at

least one more experienced teacher was dismissed or counseled to leave over the last three academic

years; this was true for 34 percent of schools despite the fact that there are many more experienced

teachers than there are novice teachers. We experimented with including the fraction of teachers
                                                                                                   12

dismissed over three years, but since typically only one or two teachers were dismissed, there was

very limited variation to exploit in the data; as such, we utilize dichotomous variables for dismissal

instead of more continuous measures of dismissal rates.

III    Empirical Results

       Public/Private Differences in the Utilization of Teacher Incentives

       Table 3 provides evidence on whether private schools are indeed more likely to utilize the

various incentives that were described above. Catholic schools are more than twice as likely to

dismiss novice teachers and three times as likely to dismiss experienced teachers than are public

schools but do not differ significantly in any other way from public schools. Non-Catholic private

schools are significantly different from public schools in nearly every measured dimension of teacher

incentives. These figures support prior research (e.g., Ballou and Podgursky, 1997) that has found

that private schools are more likely to rely on teacher performance incentives. Because public and

private schools differ so dramatically in their utilization of performance incentives, we estimate the

relationship between merit pay and student achievement separately for public schools.

       Estimated Relation between Teacher Incentives and Student Performance

       Table 4 reports six regressions estimating an education production function for the summed

test scores using two variants apiece of each of the three merit pay indices described earlier: an

indicator for whether any of the three component measures of merit pay met the requisite threshold

and an index of the number of these component measures that met the threshold, for each of the three

different merit pay threshold levels. Beneath each coefficient estimate is a t-statistic reflecting

standard errors that have been adjusted for clustering at the school level. The regressions are based

on 4515 students from 502 schools and include all of the variables listed in Table 1 as well as
                                                                                                       13

missing value flags for all variables except the school sector and teacher incentive variables. The

coefficient estimates on the control variables conform to expectations and prior research results using

the NELS, but are excluded from this paper due to space constraints. The full set of coefficient

estimates is available on the web as a supplemental file.

        We find evidence that the use of teacher salary incentives is associated with higher levels of

student performance, all else equal. Regardless of the measure of teacher financial incentives (i.e.,

whether the school offers relatively high levels or relatively low levels of incentives, as well as the

ways in which the incentives are cumulated) the incentive coefficients are positive and at least

marginally significant. For example, having any high salary incentive (column 2) is associated with

a 1.7 point increase in test scores, all else equal, while column 1 indicates that having one high salary

incentive is associated with a 1.6 point increase and two high salary incentives is accompanied by

a 3.2 point increase in test scores. Regressions 2, 4 and 6 indicate that having any salary incentive

is associated with a 1.3 to 2.1 point rise in test scores, depending on how the incentive program is

characterized. These are small changes when compared to the 33 point standard deviation in test

scores, but are comparable in magnitude to increasing maternal education by approximately 3 years.

        All three of the merit pay definitions employed in Table 4 imply a reasonably high degree

of selectivity in the distribution of financial incentives. In results not shown but available on request,

we find that if indiscriminately-administered merit pay plans are treated equivalently to more

selective plans, merit pay per se is not associated with test score improvements - the coefficients

associated with the merit pay categorization that includes both selective and unselective plans are

not statistically significant. This suggests that while selectively-administered merit pay programs

are associated with increased student test scores, those that award bonuses to very large fractions of
                                                                                                      14

teachers are apparently not associated with student outcomes.

        At the same time, the regressions in Table 4 also suggest that non-financial incentives for

teaching performance are unrelated to student learning. The coefficients on more frequent teacher

evaluation and firing teachers are not statistically significant. This lack of finding for the teacher-

dismissal variables is robust to different characterizations of teacher dismissal rates. The coefficients

on annual evaluation are never statistically significant.

        In Table 1 we showed that in the full sample there were significant differences between

responding schools and all schools for several variables. However, these differences are almost

entirely driven by school sector, as responding and non-responding public schools are statistically

indistinguishable in terms of observables for all but one variable. Table 5 therefore reports our basic

findings for the set of all 502 schools (column 1) and the subsample of 392 public schools (column

2). In the public school subsample, there is a positive and marginally significant correlation between

student achievement and the various salary incentive index variables. The coefficients in the public

school subsample are about one third smaller than the coefficients based on the full sample.

However, the fundamental conclusion that teacher incentives are associated with higher student test

scores continues to hold in a public-only sample.

        A Contemporaneous Measure of Teacher Incentives

        The question from the 1993 SASS data set on whether a teacher received a merit bonus is

used to create a contemporaneous measure of the use of incentives in our NELS schools. This SASS

incentive variable equals one if at least one teacher in a NELS public school district in 1993 reported

in the SASS data set receiving a merit bonus and equals zero otherwise. With this variable, changes

over time in incentive policies are no longer an issue. The results of a regression using this variable
                                                                                                     15

in the sample of 526 schools in public school districts in both the NELS and SASS data sets are

reported in column 3 in Table 5. The coefficient is significant at the 5 percent level and implies that

test scores are 1.0 points higher in public schools that have merit bonuses. The finding of a smaller

(though significant) merit pay coefficient using the SASS instead of our survey may be due to the

fact that the SASS variable includes both judiciously-administered and indiscriminate merit pay

systems.

       Selectivity and Endogeneity Biases

       The SASS analysis also helps shed additional light on the question of sample selection bias.

In regressions not reported in the table, we repeat this analysis for the subsamples that responded to

our survey and that did not. The estimated coefficient on the SASS incentive variable was 0.9 points

for public schools that responded to our survey and 1.0 points for public schools that did not respond.

This result provides additional evidence supportive of the notion that sample selection bias is not

responsible for our findings.

       It is also potentially the case that schools with teacher incentives face different twelfth grade

populations than do schools without such programs. To investigate this possibility, we estimated

identical regression models to those used in columns 1 and 2 in Table 5, but with high school

dropout or sample attrition as the dependent variable. We found that our merit pay measures are not

related to either the probability of high school dropout or of leaving the sample for other reasons.

These results are available on request from the authors. Therefore, schools with merit pay programs

are not facing differentially selectively-sampled students in the twelfth grade of the NELS data.

       Despite having a rich set of covariates, there may still be some endogeneity bias. As is

shown in Table 3, private schools are considerably more likely than are public schools to have
                                                                                                     16

teacher salary incentive programs. In the public school regressions we control for sector differences

in the propensity to have merit pay and still find that teacher incentives are significantly correlated

with test scores. Within the public sector there also exists considerable differences between schools

in their likelihood of offering teacher incentive programs. Specifically, non-unionized schools are

more than twice as likely as are unionized schools to offer teacher incentive programs. But our

regressions control for union status, and we still find a positive association between teacher incentive

programs and test scores. We also discovered that schools in states with active school reform

agendas in the early 1990s were also more likely to have teacher incentive programs. One measure

of this reflects the timing of a state’s charter school law. Schools in the eight states that legalized

charter schools first, between 1991 and 1993, are two-thirds more likely than are schools in the rest

of the United States to have teacher incentives, by our measures. While these policies, like union

status and school sector, are not good candidates for instrumental variables because of their potential

independent correlation with the dependent variable, we can still stratify our sample on the basis of

these policies to get a handle on the potential endogeneity problem. Columns 4 and 5 in Table 5

present the results of this analysis. The coefficients on our incentive variables are of similar size in

both subsamples of schools. Accordingly, a positive association between the use of teacher

incentives and student performance remains even after controlling for three potential sources of

heterogeneity in the use of individual teacher incentives - school sector, unionization, and state

reform activity.

       Parental monitoring provides schools with some pressure to be more efficient. Many teachers

complain that lower-income parents often are uninvolved in their children’s education. This

complaint is substantiated by the findings that parental income is strongly positively correlated with
                                                                                                     17

PTA activity and the likelihood of having frequent parent-teacher contact in the NELS, and that

SASS principals of higher-income schools report dramatically higher levels of parental involvement

than do SASS principals of lower-income schools, as measured by the fraction of a school’s student

receiving free or reduced-price lunches. Since there appears to be less parental monitoring in schools

serving poorer families, these schools may have a greater potential for improvement when merit pay

plans are instituted. To test whether financial incentives have a stronger relationship with test scores

in schools serving low-income families, we divided the full sample into thirds based on mean family

income for the students in our sample from the school. The resulting regressions using the three

salary indices are summarized in Table 6. Individual financial incentives for teachers are unrelated

to student achievement in schools serving higher-income families, but the teacher incentive

coefficients in the schools drawing students from lower- and middle-income families are large (1.8

to 2.7 points) and statistically significant. This result is consistent with the notion that merit pay

could be most effective in settings where parental monitoring of schools is weaker, but it could also

be the case that these schools are the places where more innovative teachers and principals – perhaps

the same educators more likely to experiment with merit pay systems – have the most latitude for

positive change. In cross-section it is impossible to disentangle these two competing explanations

for the relationship that we observe.

IV      Conclusions

        This paper is the first to systematically document the relationship between individual teacher

performance incentives and student achievement using United States data. We demonstrate that

students learn more in schools in which individual teachers are given financial incentives to do a

better job, though we cannot discern whether this relationship is due to the incentives themselves or
                                                                                                     18

to better schools also choosing to implement merit pay programs. Several different indicators were

combined to ascertain whether schools offer these financial incentives. Other things equal, students

apparently learn more in schools in which there is a wide range in wages for teachers with a specified

mix of schooling and experience or in which small numbers of teachers receive targeted bonuses or

raises, and this relationship is strongest in schools serving lower-income populations. The estimated

gains in test scores associated with the judicious use of salary incentives are modest but are as large

as those associated with other prominent variables in the education production function literature.

        The evidence of a positive association between merit pay and student performance should

be interpreted with caution. It could reflect students learning more in schools in which the use of

merit pay is correlated with more innovation in teaching, for example, and in which higher student

achievement is due to the innovation in teaching but not to the use of merit pay. We have shown that

the positive correlation between teacher incentives and test scores persists even after we control for

three sources of heterogeneity in the use of merit pay - teacher unionization, school sector, and

educational reform in the state. These efforts, however, are unable to remove all doubt that the

estimated association between teacher incentives and student performance in our cross sectional

identification strategy is due to unobserved school quality rather to the teacher incentives themselves.

A controlled experiment would be necessary to obtain estimates of the effect of the use of individual

teacher incentives on student achievement that could truly be considered causal. Randomized

experiments like the U.S. Department of Education-funded studies set to take place beginning in

2008 will provide valuable evidence on the causal effects of teacher incentives.

       School districts or states conducting such an experiment would be well advised to note that

merit pay per se is by no means a silver bullet. Principals, who themselves have little financial
                                                                                                      19

incentive to do a better job, often find it easier to praise most of their teachers. In the 1993-94 SASS,

principals reported that four out of five of their teachers rated a “good” or “excellent,” and in 2000

an even greater percentage of Florida teachers were identified by their principals as worthy of

receiving state-funded merit pay. Doling out merit pay to most teachers provides them with little

incentive to do a better job. Our evidence, which is unique to the incentives literature, suggests that

there is a relation between test scores and merit pay targeted to a few but no association between

student performance and indiscriminate merit pay. In this light, Glewwe et al.’s (2003) finding that

merit pay effects are illusory when all get the same reward is unsurprising.
