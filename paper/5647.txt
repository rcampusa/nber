                                           ABSTRACT



       Married women’s decisions about child-bearing and market work are importantly interrelated.

Although there are many estimates of the effects of fertility on female labor supply few of them have

adequately addressed the problems of simultaneity inherent in these choices. In this paper, we use

exogenous variations in fertility due to twin births to measure the impact of an unanticipated   child

on married women’s      labor supply and earnings.      We find that the short-run     effects of an

unanticipated birth on labor supply are appreciable and have increased in magnitude as more mothers

enter the labor market. It also appears that the impact of unanticipated births on earnings and wages

has changed from 1980 to 1990. In 1980 reduced labor supply caused a temporary drop in earnings,

but in 1990 earnings and wages remained depressed well after the labor supply effects of a twin birth

had disappeared.

                          Using Twin Births as a Natural Experiment




1.     Introduction

       Despite the dramatic increase in married women’s labor force participation      rates in

recent decades, in most families women continue to be responsible      for providing the majority

of childcare and other nonmarket    services. 1 Fuchs (1989) has argued that conflicting

demands on women’s time have been an important factor inhibiting the reduction of gender

gaps in earnings and occupations.    To meet familial obligations,   he argues, many women

drop out of the labor force entirely, while others look for part-time or less demanding    types




    1 According to Juster and Stafford (1991, p. 474) in 1981 American women spent over
two times as many hours doing housework (30.5) as American men (13.5). For married
women with children under 5 at home, Robinson (1988) reports that hours of housework fell
to 22,5 per week in 1985 from 32 per week in 1965. On the other hand, in 1985 married
men with children under 5 at home averaged just 9 hours of housework, up from 3.9 hours
in 1965. Jacobsen (1994, p. 61) calculates that although the fraction of time spent by both
men and women in child care is relatively small, women spend 4 times as much time
engaged in this activity as men.
                                                                                                               2

of work.     Increased labor supply drives down wages in female dominated occupations,                 while

lower levels of investment in human capital formation reduces the future growth of earnings.

Thus, he concludes,     it is mainly women’s stronger preference for children (rather than

discrimination)   that explains persistent gender inequality.

        Unfortunately    it is difficult to measure the impact of childbearing     on women’s labor

supply behavior and earnings.      Many early studies of female labor supply treated fertility and

family structure as exogenous determinants        of female labor supply behavior (e.g., Mincer

1962, Cain 1966, Heckman 1974).         However, decisions about when and how much to work,

on the one hand, and about the number of children to have and the timing of their births, on

the other, are most plausibly viewed as jointly endogenous consequences            of the household’s

utility maximization    problem.   Consequently    the population correlation between fertility and

either labor supply or earnings may be misleading for several reasons.            First, to the extent

that fertility is affected by measured exogenous variables--such      as a woman’s wage, her

education or her husband’s income--failure        to account for the endogeneity     of fertility may

bias estimates of the effect of both fertility and these exogenous variables on labor supply

behavior.    Second, to the extent that there are left out or unmeasured        variables--such   as

individual heterogeneity    in tastes--that affect both labor supply behavior and fertility

decisions,   observed fertility will serve as a proxy for the effects of these variables (Shultz

1978; Rosenzweig       and Wolpin 1980; Nakamura and Nakamura          1992).     One solution to these

problems is to estimate the determinants     of fertility and labor supply within a simultaneous
                                                                                                              3

equations framework.2         But implementing     this approach is complicated by the difficulty of

finding plausible identifying restrictions       so that the underlying    structural parameters   can be

recovered.        Another approach,   suggested by Nakamura and Nakamura (1992) and Lehrer

(1992), is to include the lagged dependent variable as a regressor to control for unobserved

differences   in tastes that are likely to affect both labor supply and fertility,       While this

approach sidesteps the problem of finding plausible identifying restrictions            it does not address

the endogeneity       problem caused by the dependence of both fertility and labor supply on a

common set of explanatory         variables.

         Ideally we would like to be able to observe how female labor supply and earnings

would respond to an exogenous variation in the number of children within a family.                   We

cannot, of course, literally perform such an experiment.           However,     as Rosenzweig      and

Wolpin (1980) note, the occurrence of twins in the first birth provides a close

approximation.3        The occurrence of twins in the first birth is an exogenous and unanticipated

event,   Moreover,      because the occurrence of twins is random with respect to other

characteristics     that may be related to labor force participation      and earnings, we can measure

the effects of exogenous fertility variations using simple statistical techniques. 4 The major


    2 This has been the approach adopted in most recent studies of female labor supply. See
for example, Shultz (1978), Dooley (1982), Moffit (1984), Hotz and Miller (1988).
Although most of these studies find substantially different parameters when fertility is treated
as endogenous, Mroz (1987) concludes on the basis of extensive specification tests that the
erogeneity of actual fertility cannot be rejected.

    3 See also Bronars and Grogger (1994), who use twin births to explore the impact of
unwed motherhood.

    4 It is necessary to control for parity because the probability of twin births is obviously
an increasing function of the number of pregnancies, and the number of pregnancies is likely
to be correlated with unobserved preferences concerning family size. Since every woman
                                                                                                      4

challenge in using the twins first approach arises from the need to identify a large enough

sample of twin mothers.       Rosenzweig and Wolpin’s (1980) estimates, for example, are based

on a sample of just 87 twin mothers--with      the result that most of their coefficient estimates

are not very precise.

         Here we use the Public Use Micro Samples (PUMS) from the 1980 and 1990

censuses to identify large samples of twins-first mothers in each year.      We compare this

“treatment” group to a randomly selected control group of mothers who experienced           single

first births.   We find that in both years, exogenous variations in fertility cause a significant,

but temporary     reduction in married women’s labor supply.     As the overall rate of labor force

participation   has increased for married women over the decade of the 1980s, we find that the

size of the labor supply effects has also increased.    Although the labor supply effects of

exogenous fertility variations appear to be relatively transitory in both 1980 and 1990, we

find that they have a more persistent impact on wages and earning.         Moreover the magnitude

of the impact on earnings appears to have increased substantially between 1980 and 1990.




2.       Methods and Data

         If the occurrence of twins in the first birth were uncorrelated   with any other

individual characteristics   then we could proceed to estimate the effect of exogenous variations

in fertility as the difference in the average level of the outcome variables of interest between




who wishes to have a non-zero number of children must experience a first pregnancy, we can
avoid this selectivity bias by using the occurrence of twins in the first birth. See Rosenzweig
and Wolpin (1980, p. 336). Comparison at higher levels of parity are also possible, but
sample sizes will be smaller.
                                                                                                        5

the treatment and control groups.       Because the probability   of twins rises with age, however,

and age may be an important determinant         of labor supply decisions and earnings, the

situation is slightly more complicated      (Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1980, pp. 336-37; Bronars

and Grogger 1994, pp. 1142-43).         To isolate the pure effect of fertility variations it is thus

necessary to control for variations in age at first birth.

        The basic regression framework that we use to estimate the treatment effects

controlling   for age at first birth is as follows:

                 Yji = ajO+ ajlAGEFBi + ajzAGEFB~ + aj~TWINS li + ui,                           (1)

where i indexes individual observations,       Yj is the jth outcome variable, AGEFB is age at first

birth, TWINS 1 is an indicator variable equal to one if the woman had twins in the first birth

and zero otherwise,    and u is a disturbance term.     Because of the independence     between the

TWINS 1 indicator variable and all other factors influencing the outcome variables Y, we can

subsume the influence of these other variables into the disturbance term.         The impact of

twins first on the jth outcome variables is estimated by the coefficient aj~.5

        To compile a sample of twins-first mothers we used data from the 1980 and 1990

Census PUMS (Bureau of the Census 1983, 1993).             For 1980 we drew a l-in-5 random

sample from the 5 % (A) sample, and for 1990 we used the 1% (B) sample of the census.

The PUMS data contain a single record for each individual in each household,            which

includes information    on his or her demographic     and economic characteristics.     The record



     5 Note that this approach provides an estimate of the effect of the discrete event “twins
in the first birth. ” Alternatively, it is possible to obtain an estimate of the relationship
between the number of children in a household and the outcome variables of interest using
the occurrence of twins as an instrumental variable which affects the number of children but
is uncorrelated with the error term. See Bronars and Grogger (1994, p. 1143).
                                                                                                         6

also contains information     about the individual’s relationship    to the head of household and to

other persons in the household.

        Following    the procedure used by Bronars and Grogger (1994), we first identified

families within households,     and then determined whether the first birth of the mother in the

family had been twins.      To be included in the twins-first     sample a woman had to: (1) be

living with the same number of children as she reported ever having born; (2) have no

children older than 18, and (3) have a second child with the same age as her oldest child.

Mothers of children over the age of 18, and mothers living apart from their children were

excluded from the sample to ensure that it consisted of women whose oldest children were

twins and not women whose oldest children remaining in the home were twins.               To construct

the control group we randomly sampled women who met criteria (1) and (2), but had

singleton first births.

        A total of 1,924 twins-first mothers were located in the 1990 PUMS, and 6,428 non-

twin mothers were sampled as controls.        For 1980 we located 1,987 twins-first mothers,       and

drew a sample of 8,085 non-twin mothers as controls.            Because of the potential differences    in

labor supply response to fertility variations across married and unmarried mothers we further

restricted our sample to include only currently married (not separated) women.            Finally, to

focus on the civilian labor market, we excluded the very small number of mothers who

reported that they were employed in the armed forces.

        Table 1 reports the means and standard deviations of a variety of variables for twin

and non-twin mothers in 1980 and 1990.         Blacks make up 9-12 percent of our samples in

1980 and about 8 percent of our samples in 1990.         As would be expected the average number
                                                                                                           7

of children is higher for twins-first mothers than for the control group.       The twins-first

mothers are between a quarter and half a year older than the comparison         group, and their age

at first birth is also slightly higher, consistent with the positive relationship   between age and

the probability   of twinning.    The remaining rows of the table compare a variety of measures

of labor supply and earnings experience.        In the next section we examine differences     in these

variables across the treatment and control groups controlling for the effects of age at first

birth.




3.       The Effects of Unplanned        Births on Number of Children Ever Born

         Before exploring the labor supply and earnings effects of twins-first      it is helpful to

consider more carefully the nature of the fertility variation that this experiment      represents.

Initially, the occurrence of twins in the first pregnancy is like adding an unplanned child to

the household.     In the long-run, however, families are likely to adjust their fertility to

compensate     for this shock.   Over a woman’s lifetime, then, the occurrence of twins-first         is

perhaps most appropriately       viewed as an exogenous variation in the timing of births rather

than in completed family size.       Because some families desire only one child, because fertility

control is imperfect,    and because desired family size may be partly path dependent,       it is

unlikely that all families will be filly adjust subsequent childbearing     in response to the

occurrence    of twins in the first birth.   Nonetheless,   we would expect that the impact of a

twins-first   birth on the total number of children would tend to diminish with time.

         Table 2 examines the effects of twins-first births on the total number of children in

the household     as a function of the number of years since the first birth for both the 1980 and
                                                                                                                  8

1990 samples.       As the table shows, within the first two years after birth, the effects of twins

is very close to that of adding an additional child.        Thereafter the effect diminishes.       In the

most extreme case, that of White mothers in 1990, by 12 to 18 years after the occurrence                    of

twins, there are on average just 0.4 more children in twins-first households than in the

control group.      In both 1980 and 1990 the effects of twins on the total number of children

ever born are more persistent among Blacks than Whites.

        The cross-sectional      evidence in Table 2 does not reflect true life-cycle experiences           for

any individual.      Rather, as one reads down the columns one is examining women whose

child-bearing     experiences   occurred at different points in time.    In 1980 women whose first

child was born 12 to 18 years ago had their children in the early to mid 1960s when abortion

was illegal and other contraceptive      technologies    were less readily available.      The relatively

high fertility effects of twins for these women may be attributable to the greater difficulty of

adjusting completed fertility to an unplanned birth.         The subsequent decline the effect of

unplanned births on fertility for women in this group in 1990 suggests that changes in the

legal environment      and improved contraceptive       technology has allowed families to adjust more

completely to the exogenous shock of a twin birth.




4.      The Effect of Unplanned         Births on Labor Supply

        The addition of a child increases the quantity childcare services required by a family

and raises the marginal value of time at home.           In most cases it appears that women are

responsible     for supplying the additional non-market      services that are required.     In response to

the increased value of time at home some mothers may withdraw entirely from the labor
                                                                                                              9

force, others may seek to reduce the intensity of their work effort by shifting to part time

work schedules or finding less demanding occupations.            Using the twins-first methodology       it

is possible to explore the impact of an exogenous variation in fertility experience on the

amount of time that mothers devote to market work.             Again it makes sense to look at how

these responses vary with time since the first birth.        As children age, the amount of time that

is required for their care declines.      Moreover,    as we have just seen, in the long-run

adjustments      in subsequent behavior enable families to move back toward their desired level

of completed fertility.

         The census contains information        on a variety of dimensions   of labor supply behavior,

and it is helpful to consider each of them separately. Here we consider three: (1) labor force

participation,     (2) the number of hours worked in the week preceding the census, and (3) the

number of weeks worked during the calendar year preceding the census.               Most of the

adjustment       in labor supply occurs through adjustments in labor force participation        and in

weeks worked, rather than in weekly hours.            The effects on both participation   and weeks

worked are appreciable,       but transitory,   being concentrated   in the years immediately    following

the birth.    Between 2 and 6 years after an unplanned birth, the labor supply behavior of

women who experience an unplanned birth is indistinguishable             from that of women in the

control group.

         Table 3 examines changes in labor force participation         due to the occurrence of twins

in the first birth.     Consistent with the fact that the greatest conflicts between work and home

time arise when children are young, and the declining fertility effects of a twin birth with the

passage of time, differences between the treatment and control groups are most pronounced
                                                                                                                     10
within two years of the first birth.          In 1980, when about 50 percent of White mothers,              and

about 70 percent of Black mothers were in the labor force, an unplanned birth reduced

participation      rates by roughly 8 to 9 percentage points for women in the first two years after

their first birth.     Beyond the two year time horizon, an unplanned birth had little consistent

effect on labor force participation.          The large positive effect of twin-births    for Black mothers

12 to 18 years after their first birth may indicate some intertemporal             substitution   in labor

supply and/or the income effects caused by additional children in the family.

          Between 1980 and 1990 labor force participation           rates increased within the control

group (see Tables la and lb), rising to 63 percent among Whites, and 78 percent among

Blacks.     At the same time, the magnitude the effect of twin-births          increased substantially          as

well.     In 1990, the participation    rate of Black mothers was reduced by nearly 29 percentage

points in the first two years after an unplanned birth.          Moreover,    the negative effects of a

twin birth persisted longer, reducing participation          by 21 percentage points 2 to 6 years after

the first birth.     Among Whites, the negative effects of a twin birth on labor force

participation      rates increased as well.    Within the first two years of an unplamed          birth,

participation      rates of White mothers in 1990 were 13.5 percentage points lower than for the

control group.       Thereafter the effect was slightly--though      statistically insignificantly--positive.

          Even with the increased impact of twin births between 1980 and 1990, our estimates

of the effect of unanticipated      variations in fertility on labor supply appear somewhat lower

than those found by Rosenzweig          and Wolpin (1980) using the twins first methodology                to

analyze data from surveys conducted in 1965 and 1973.               Based on a pooled sample from

these two surveys they find that twins-first reduced labor force participation             by 37 percentage
                                                                                                          11

points among women in the 15-24 age group and by about 10 percentage points for women

in the 25 to 34 age group.       Because of the imprecision of their estimates, however,       it seems

risky to draw any inferences about longer term trends based on this comparison. s On the

other hand, the magnitude of the participation        effects we find is equal to or larger than the

effects found by studies using other methodologies.            Shultz’s (1978) estimates of labor force

participation    equations using instrumental    variables to control for endogeneity    based on data

from 1967 imply that an additional child reduces the likelihood of participation          by about 8 to

10 percentage points in most cases.        Lehrer’s (1992) paper treats family composition      as

exogenous,      but includes a measure of past labor supply as a proxy for unobserved        differences

in tastes.    Based on survey data gathered in 1982, she finds that increasing the number of

children under 6 from 1 to 2 reduces the likelihood of working by 7 percentage points among

Whites regardless of education level.       Among Black mothers, however,         she finds that the

probability     of working is reduced only among women with more than 12 years of schooling,

and then it falls only by 4 percentage points.

         Tables 4 and 5 examine the effects of exogenous fertility variation on the intensity of

work.    For these tables the sample is restricted to only those mothers who reported positive

numbers of hours or weeks worked, respectively.               The effects of unplanned births on

weekly hours shown in Table 4 appear quite modest overall.              Most of the effects are small in

economic magnitude       and not statistically significant.    The short-run effects for Blacks in both

although they do report separate effects for the older age groups depending on whether their
first birth occurred before or after age 25.
                                                                                                             12

1980 and 1990 reduce average hours worked slightly.            For both Blacks and Whites, however,

by 12 to 18 years after the first birth, the effects appear weatiy positive.

        The effects of unplanned births on weeks worked in the previous year appear to be

more substantial.     Once again, the negative labor supply effects of an unplanned birth are

concentrated    mainly in the years immediately      following that event, and the effect diminishes

fairly steadily thereafter.   Between 1980 and 1990 the magnitude of the negative effects

increased substantially   in the first two years.    The parallel behavior of labor force

participation   and weeks worked, along with the more limited effects on hours of work

suggests that most of the adjustment in labor supply behavior in response to unplanned births

occurs through movement       into and out of paid work, rather than through shifts into part time

work.    This may be due either to fixed costs of work, or to institutional        rigidities that make

hours adjustments     difficult in many workplaces,

        The increasing impact of unplamed       births on labor force participation         and weeks

worked between 1980 and 1990 is striking.           It is not immediately   clear if this is an

anomalous event or if it reflects an ongoing trend.        It may be, however,     that as more and

more married women move into paid work, the demands of child care will cause more of

them to temporarily     reduce their supply of market work,




5.      The Effects of Unplanned       Births on Earnings and Wages

        The temporary     reduction in women’s labor supply caused by exogenous fertility

variations can affect their earnings in a variety of different ways.        Interruptions     in work will

reduce the amount of on-the-job experience that women acquire, thus reducing their quantity
                                                                                                           13

of human capital and hence earnings potential at any later date.            Reduced labor force

participation     and interruptions   in paid work may also be associated with a movement         into

occupations      that allow more flexibility about when work is performed.         The increased supply

of labor to these occupations may drive down wages.              These may also be jobs which do not

offer much opportunity        for human capital accumulation,      and consequently   subsequent wage

growth may be slower for women in these jobs.

         Table 6 reports the differences in earned income (wages, salaries, and self-

employment       income) between the treatment and control groups.          The sample is limited here

to those women who reported working some positive number of weeks during the year

preceding the census.       For Blacks unplanned births caused substantial short-run reductions          in

income in both 1980 and 1990.           The figures in Table 6 are nominal, but even after adjusting

for the 66 percent inflation in consumer prices from 1979 to 1989, within the first two years

following a twin birth, the impact on income was about twice as large in 1990 as it had been

in 1980.       Adjusted for inflation the impact on income between 2 and 6 years after a twin

birth was about the same for Blacks in 1990 and 1980.              For Whites, the increase in the

impact of unplanned births was even more dramatic.              In 1980 there was little difference

between treatment and control groups.           By 1990 the effects were large and persistent,

increasing in magnitude for women as much as 12 years after an unplanned birth.

        In part, the increased impact of unplanned births on women’s income may be

attributable    to the larger impact of fertility variations on labor supply in 1990.       Since labor

supply effects of unanticipated       births are transitory,   however, this cannot be the entire story.

To explain the persistent and increasing impact on earnings, there must also have been some
                                                                                                           14

effect of fertility variations on wage rates.        This is indeed what Table 7 shows.     In 1980 the

effect of unplanned births on wages were relatively small in magnitude and never statistically

significant.      In contrast, by 1990 there appear to be large negative effects on wages as much

as 12 to 18 years after an unplamed         birth.   The effects reported in Table 7 imply that for

Whites in 1990, wages 2 to 6 years after an unplamed             birth were roughly 20 percent below

levels for the control group.        Six to twelve years after an unplanned birth this gap had fallen

only to 14 percent.         For Blacks, the short-run effects were even larger (48 percent within the

first two years; and 24 percent 2 to 6 years after the unplanned birth), but were not

statistically    significant.

           We cannot offer a conclusive explanation for the increasing cost of exogenous fertility

variations,     but these results appear consistent with Fuchs’ conjecture that married women’s

responsibility     for child care and other non-market activities is an important factor inhibiting

reductions in the gender gap.         The increased impact on wages and earnings of unplanned

births between 1980 and 1990 is also striking.          Possibly this reflects the fact that in the past

married women generally opted for career paths that offered fewer opportunities             for human

capital accumulation        and earnings growth either by choice or through societal pressures and

employer discrimination.         Consequently,   interruptions   in work caused by unanticipated   births

did not have much lasting effect on earnings or wages.            As career opportunities   for women

have expanded over the past decade and a half, however, it appears that the financial

pemlties      of taking time off from work have increased substantially.
                                                                                                         15

6.      Conclusions

        For married women decisions about child bearing and the allocation of time between

market work and other activities are significantly      interrelated.   Understanding   the linkages

between fertility variation and married women’s labor supply and earnings is important both

for predicting    future changes in the size and composition     of the labor force, and for

analyzing the sources of the gender gap in earnings and occupations.           Unfortunately   the

simultaneity     of work and fertility decisions has made it difficult in the past to estimate the

true effects of exogenous variations in fertility on married women’s labor supply.

        In this paper we have sought to resolve this problem by using the exogenous variation

in fertility due to twin births as a natural experiment to investigate the impact of

unanticipated     births on married women’s labor supply behavior and earnings.          Our estimates

indicate that an unanticipated    birth has a pronounced but transitory impact on both labor

force participation    and the number of weeks married women work per year.             Moreover,

comparisons      between 1980 and 1990 indicate that as more married women have entered the

labor force, the strength of these effects has increased.

        Withdrawal      from the labor force or reductions in the intensity of work impose a direct

cost in terms of foregone earnings and an indirect cost in terms a reduction in human capital

accumulation.      In 1980 we find that most of the costs of unanticipated     births were transitory,

but in 1990 an unanticipated      birth had a large and persistent negative effect on married

women’s wages which lasted well after the labor supply effects had disappeared.             It seems

possible that this widening wage gap is attributable to the greater opportunities        for human
                                                                                             16

capital accumulation   and career advancement that have been opened up for women since the

late 1970s.

Notes: Each entry shows the change in probability of labor force participation of having twins rather
than a singleton in the first birth. Estimates of the impact of twins on the probability of labor force
participation are derived from probit estimates of the equation
         LF = N + alagefb + azagefb2 + aqtwinsl + e,
where the LF takes the value 1 if the woman is in the labor force, agefb is age at first birth, and
twins 1 takes the value 1 if the individual experienced twins in the first birth and O otherwise, and e is
an error term. Standard errors are in parentheses.

Notes: Impact of twins is derived from Ordinq Least Squares regression estimates of the following
equation:
                   Hours = N + alagefb + ~agefb2 + a~twinsl + e
where Hours is the munber of hours worked in the week before the census, agefb is the woman’s age
at first birth, twins 1 takes the value 1 if the first birth restited in twins and O if the first birth was a
singleton, and e is an error term. The equation was estimated for all women who reported a positive
number of houm worked.

Notes: Impact of twins is derived from Ordinary Least Squares regression estimates of the following
equation:
                 Weeks = N + alagefi + ~agefbz + aqtwins1 + e
where Weeks is the number of weeks worked during the year before the censuss, agefb is the
woman’s age at first birth, twins 1 takes the value 1 if the first birth resulted in twins and O if the first
birth was a singleton, and e is an error term. The equation was estimated for all women who
reported a positive number of weeks worked in the previous year.

-:        Impact of twins is derived from Ordinary Least Squares regression estimates of the following equation:
                    Income = aO+ alagefb + azagefb2 + a~twins1 + e
where Income is the sum of wage, salary, and self-employment income reported for the year preceding the
census, agefb is the woman’s age at first birth, twins 1 takes the value 1 if the first birth resulted in twins and O
if the first birth was a singleton, and e is an error term. The equation was estimated for all women who reported
a positive number of weeks workded during the previous year.

Notes:   Impact of twins is derived from Ordinary Least Squares regression estimates of the following
equation:
                 Wage = ~ + alagefb + a2agefb2 + agtwins1 + e
where Wage is the hourly wage imputed by dividing income reported for the previous year by an
estimate of annual hours worked obtained by multiplying weeks worked in the previous year by the
number of hours reported worked in the week before the census, agefb is the woman’s age at first
birth, twinsl takes the value 1 if the first birth resulted in twins and O if the first birth was a
singleton, and e is an error term. The equation was estimated for all women who reported a positive
number of hours and weeks worked.
