                                          ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes the non-market benefits of education and ability. Using a dynamic model of
educational choice we estimate returns to education that account for selection bias and sorting on
gains. We investigate a range of non-market outcomes including incarceration, mental health,
voter participation, trust, and participation in welfare. We find distinct patterns of returns that
depend on the levels of schooling and ability. Unlike the monetary benefits of education, the
benefits to education for many non-market outcomes are greater for low-ability persons. College
graduation decreases welfare use, lowers depression, and raises self-esteem more for less-able
individuals.

1       Introduction

In his pioneering analysis, Gary Becker (1964) discussed both the market and non-market
benefits of education. Nonetheless, most of the subsequent literature on the returns to
education has focused on the returns to wages and income.1 However, education is strongly
correlated with a variety of non-market outcomes. For example, a positive correlation between
education and health has been well documented, with evidence that a considerate portion
of this correlation is causal.2 Education is positively correlated with better mental health,
higher levels of civic engagement, lower welfare use and a lower propensity to commit crime.
Outcomes like civic engagement are valued in democratic societies despite having little direct
economic impact. For other outcomes like reduced incarceration or receipt of welfare, there
are direct cost-savings for the government as well as private benefits. Ignoring these outcomes
could lead policymakers to greatly underestimate the benefits of supporting education.
    There are many challenges in identifying and interpreting the causal effects of education.
Observed returns are subject to both selection bias and sorting on gains.3 In addition,
schooling choices have a dynamic character. Each year of schooling opens up options for
additional schooling.
    This paper investigates the non-market benefits of abilities and education while addressing
these challenges. We analyze a range of non-market outcomes including crime, mental health,
civic engagement, self-esteem, trust, and participation in welfare. We consider a model where
the returns to education vary across educational decisions and across individuals. Unlike the
early literature, we do not restrict the returns to a year of schooling to be the same for each
individual, or the same across levels of schooling for any individual, thereby allowing for rich

      The positive correlation between schooling and health is a well-established finding (Grossman, 1972, 2000,
2006). See also Adams (2002); Arendt (2005); Lleras-Muney (2005); Silles (2009); Spasojevic (2003); Arkes
(2003); Auld and Sidhu (2005); Grossman (2008); Grossman and Kaestner (1997); Cutler and Lleras-Muney
(2010); Conti, Heckman, and Urzúa (2010) and HHV (2017).

      In the context of a Mincer model ln Yi = αi + ρi Si , where ln Yi is log earnings for person i, Si is years
of schooling for person i, αi is an individual-specific intercept, ρi is the rate of return for person i, selection
bias arises if Cov(αi , Si ) 6= 0, and sorting on gains arises if Cov(ρi , Si ) 6= 0.

variation in the returns to schooling. For example, estimates of the model show that the
nonmarket returns to high school are very similar across persons of different ability, but the
returns to college are, in general, higher for low-ability people. We address both selection bias
and sorting on gains by allowing observed covariates as well as a vector of unobserved (but
proxied) skill endowments to affect baseline outcomes as well as the gains from education.
    Our model accounts for the dynamics of educational decisions. At any stage of the life
cycle, educational choices shape the possibility sets for future choices. Rather than estimating
only pairwise comparisons between two final schooling levels, we identify dynamic treatment
effects, which estimate the returns from making different educational decisions, accounting for
the fact that these decisions shape the possibilities for future educational choices. Dynamic
treatment effects are policy relevant because they estimate the benefits at each educational
level, which assess policies that affect educational participation.
    We find that the nonmarket returns to education are larger for low-ability individuals
compared to high ability persons. For example, we find that college graduation decreases
welfare use, lowers depression, and raises self-esteem more for low-ability individuals than
high-ability individuals. This evidence is in contrast with that of Heckman, Humphries, and
Veramendi (2017) (henceforth HHV, 2017), who show that market returns to education are
typically larger for high-ability people, particularly when making post-secondary decisions.
    This paper builds on a large literature that studies the impact of education on non-
pecuniary benefits and the impact of cognitive and non-cognitive skills on non-pecunary
outcomes. See Lochner (2011) for a comprehensive review of the literature.4 Vila (2000)
presents another review of the literature on the non-wage benefits of education, including
improvements in family planning, health benefits, outcomes for children, job-search, and
savings. Oreopoulos and Salvanes (2011) present additional evidence on the non-market

     A positive association between education and labor market outcomes has long been noted in the literature
(Mincer, 1958, 1974). For surveys, see Card (1999) and Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2006) and the references
they cite. Lochner and Moretti (2004) review some of the early evidence on the non-market benefits of
education. Ehrlich (1973) is a pioneering analysis of the economics of crime. His 1975 paper presents an early
analysis of the correlation between education and crime.

benefits of education. They report that schooling improves happiness, leads to higher job-
satisfaction and occupational prestige, less disability, improved health, decreased smoking,
lowered probabilities of arrest, more schooling, leads to sorting with more highly educated
spouses, lowers the probability of divorce, and improves trust. Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman,
and Kautz (2011) review the literature on the importance of cognitive and non-cognitive
skills. Section A of the Web Appendix presents a detailed review of the literature on each of
the six non-market outcomes we consider in this paper.



2    Dynamic Discrete Choice Model of Education

This paper estimates the non-market benefits of education using the multistage sequential
model of educational choice developed in HHV (2017) with transitions and decision nodes
shown in Figure 1. We estimate returns to education at each node. People begin in high
school and choose if they wish to graduate or not. Importantly, the set of future choices
available to them depends on their earlier educational choices. If people choose to graduate
from high school, they have the choice to enroll in college, and, if they enroll, they have the
choice to graduate from college. If people choose to drop out of high school, they then have
the option to take the GED to earn a high school equivalency certificate.

   More generally, people are assumed to traverse a tree of educational decisions (Figure 1)
where current choices affect future choice sets. We assume that at each choice node people
make a binary decision. A person’s final schooling level is s ∈ {G, 0, 1, 2, 3}, where G denotes
earning a GED, 0 denotes high school dropout, 1 denotes high school graduate, 2 denotes some
college, and 3 denotes college graduate. Individuals can only reach particular educational
decisions (and particular final levels of schooling) if they have previously made specific choices.
We define Qj to be an indicator of whether an individual attains j and faces a choice between
educational levels j and j + 1. QG indicates whether the person dropped out of high school
and had the choice to get a GED or not.
   Each person has a vector of characteristics X that affect educational decisions and
outcomes at different schooling levels. These characteristics can include background variables
such as parent’s education or information on if one grew up in an urban environment. They
also include contemporaneous variables such as the unemployment rate at the time decisions
are taken. We also have access to instrument vector Z, including the presence of a local

                                                            7

college or local price of tuition, that affect educational decisions, but do not affect outcomes.5
We assume Z and X are known by both the agent and the observing economist, but we
allow agents to act on a multidimensional set of unobservables θ that can affect educational
decisions and outcomes, but are not directly observed by the economist. While θ is not
directly observed, it is proxied by measurements. These measurements render the random
effects interpretable. In our previous research (HHV, 2017) we fit models with two unobserved
factors which we estimate by a multivariate mixture of normals.6 We test, and do not find
evidence for, additional factors. The measurements of θ are interpretable and correspond to
cognitive and socio-emotional abilities.


Educational Decisions Educational decisions are modeled using latent variables crossing
a threshold as described in Cameron and Heckman (2001). Educational decisions depend on
functions of X, Z, and θ as well as additive idiosyncratic shocks. For decision j the indices
generating choices can be written as:


                           Ij = φj (X, Z) + θ 0 αj − νj , j ∈ {G, 0, 1, 2}.                          (1)
                                   | {z } | {z }
                                    Observed     Unbserved
                                    by analyst   by analyst



We do not impose rationality or rational expectations but Equation (1) is consistent with
that. The unobserved components in θ or observed components in Z need not necessarily
affect all educational decisions in the same way.


Outcomes Outcomes Y are assumed to depend on a function of directly observed charac-
teristics X, the unobserved components θ, and an idiosyncratic shock. Importantly, we allow
the intercepts, the observed characteristics X, and the unobserved components θ to affect
outcomes differently depending on the final level of schooling. This can be thought of as a
hedonic equation where all observed and unobserved (but proxied) variables are interacted
   5
      The estimated model includes such instruments, but does not necessarily require the instruments for
identification.

with schooling. The persistent (and known by the agent) proxied unobservable θ enters
the model in a fashion similar to a random effect, but the impact of the random effect can
vary across schooling levels. For example, cognitive ability plays a more important role in
explaining outcomes for those with a college degree compared to high school dropouts. The
equation for outcome k for a person with final schooling level s is:


                   Ỹsk = τsk (X) + θ 0 αks + ωsk ,       k ∈ K,   s ∈ {G, 0, 1, 2, 3},             (2)

where Ỹsk is the outcome or a latent index for discrete outcomes.


The Measurement System The unobserved but proxied vector θ plays an important
role in our analysis. Along with the observed variables, they generate the dependence
between choices and outcomes. Conditional on X, θ is assumed to capture the dependence
between the unobserved components of the outcomes and the unobserved components of
the educational decisions. If θ were observed, we could condition on (θ, X, Z) and identify
selection-bias-free estimates of a variety of causal effects. While θ is not observed, it is proxied
by NM measures that facilitate identification of the distribution of θ. To accomplish this, we
use a measurement system M consisting of early-life tests or outcomes which are thought
to be generated by θ. Similar to the educational decisions and outcomes, we assume that
they depend on observed characteristics X, the proxied vector of factors θ, and idiosyncratic
shocks. The X and θ account for dependence across measures as well as the dependence
among the measures, outcomes, and schooling decisions. Our measurement system includes
subtests from the ASVAB achievement test, GPA in core subjects in 9th grade, and measures
of whether persons committed risky or reckless behaviors when they were young. The system
of measurement equations can be written as

   Using measurements, we can identify and interpret the estimated factors. We find that two
factors are sufficient to explain our data (HHV, 2017). ASVAB scores, GPA, reckless or risky
behavior, and educational decisions all determine the first factor. GPA, reckless behavior,
and educational decisions determine the second factor. By excluding the second factor from
the ASVAB tests, we are able to interpret the first factor as residual cognitive ability and the
second factor as the residual ability that determines grades, educational decisions, and early
behaviors that is not captured by cognitive ability—which we call socio-emotional ability.7


Identification The treatment effects developed in this paper can be identified using two
different approaches. One approach relies on conditional independence. The other relies on
instrumental variable exclusion restrictions. Heckman, Humphries, and Veramendi (2016)
present a formal proof of model identification. Here we provide an intuitive explanation
justifying each approach.
   Conditioning on θ, X, Z, outcomes and choices are statistically independent. If we, in fact,
could observe the unobserved factors θ, this would be equivalent to the assumptions made in
matching. Since θ is not observed, we treat it as a random effect. Unlike the usual random
effect approach, we proxy θ using a set of measurements described in Section 2. Under our
assumptions, we can non-parametrically identify the distribution of θ. Effectively, we match
on X, Z, and proxies for θ, accounting for measurement error in the proxies. This is a
version of matching on mis-measured variables where, because of access to multiple measures
of the latent true variable, we can correct for measurement error. As shown in Heckman,
Humphries, and Veramendi (2016), the model can also be identified using instrumental
variables. Different combinations of assumptions about IV and proxy matching also identify
our model.

the computation. The precise parametrization and the likelihood function for the model we
estimate are presented in Web Appendix B.8


2.1     Defining Treatment Effects

This section discusses the various returns to education considered in this paper. Specifically
we focus on two types of returns: (1) differences across final schooling levels, and (2)
dynamic treatment effects that capture the benefits of choices, inclusive of continuation values
associated with future educational decisions.9


Differences Across Final Schooling Levels The traditional approach in the literature
on returns to education is to define them as the gains from choosing between a base and a
terminal schooling level. Let Ysk0 be outcome k at schooling level s0 and Ysk be outcome k at
schooling level s. Conditioning on X = x, Z = z, and θ = θ, the average treatment effect
of s compared to s0 is E(Ysk − Ysk0 |X = x, Z = z, θ = θ). Thus, we fix S = s and condition
on X = x, Z = z, and θ = θ̄.10 ATE (AT Es,s
                                        k
                                            0 ) is calculated by integrating over X, Z, θ for


the subset of the population that completes one of the two final schooling levels (S ∈ {s, s0 }),
although in principle we could condition on one or the other element in this set or on other
conditioning variables. This type of conditioning recognizes that the characteristics of people
not making either final choice could be far away from the population making one of those
choices, and hence, might not have any empirical or policy relevance. One can also compute
parameters for other subpopulations.


Dynamic Treatment Effects Dynamic treatment effects take into account the direct
effect of transiting to the next node in a decision tree, plus the benefits associated with the

   9
      See HHV (2017) for formal definitions of these treatment effects.
   10
      Fixing versus conditioning is the key notion in causal models since Haavelmo (1943). For a recent
discussion, see Heckman and Pinto (2015).


                                                  11
The Non-Market Benefits of Education and Ability                                       September 20, 2017


options opened up by the additional choices made possible by such transitions. So, instead
of fixing final schooling levels, dynamic treatment effects fix a decision (Qj+1 = 1 versus
Qj+1 = 0) conditioning on the set of persons who visit the decision node (Qj = 1). Those
who go on to the next node (Qj+1 = 1) may choose to go on even further. So the outcome for
fixing Qj+1 = 1 will include the probabilities and returns of future decisions. The mean gain
(AT Ejk ) of fixing decision j is calculated by integrating over X, Z, θ for the subset of the
population that reaches node j. Proceeding in a similar fashion, we can define conventional
treatment effects, e.g., ATE, TT, TUT, AMTE for different subpopulations.11
    To clarify the distinctions between the two types of treatment effects, consider a simplified
example where there are five levels of schooling: high school dropout, GED recipient, high
school graduate, some college, and college graduate (s ∈ {0, G, 1, 2, 3}) as shown in Figure 1.
Consider outcome Y , where:


                      Yi = βi,0 + βi,G Qi,G + βi,1 Qi,1 + βi,2 Qi,2 + βi,3 Qi,3 + Ui ,                     (3)


where Qi,j = 1 indicates that the individual i made it to decision node j. Qi,G = 1 if a person
drops out of high school, but then chooses to earn a GED, Qi,1 = 1 if a person graduates
from high school, Qi,2 = 1 is equal to one if a person enrolls in college, and Qi,3 = 1 is equal
to one if a person graduates from college. For this simplified model, assume that Ui is an
independent (across states) shock.12 The βi,j are the marginal benefits of being at state j.
Note that the β have i subscripts as we allow them to vary by both the individual’s observable
and unobservable characteristics.
    For this model, the mean treatment effect associated with differences across adjacent final




   11
      These are the average treatment effect (ATE), treatment on the treated (TT), treatment on the untreated
(TUT) and the average marginal treatment effect (AMTE). AMTE is the treatment effect for those who are
indifferent between treatment and non-treatment. See HHV (2017).
   12
      With the factor structure used in this paper, Ui can be correlated with educational choices and outcomes.


                                                      12
The Non-Market Benefits of Education and Ability                                       September 20, 2017


schooling levels (s, s0 ) are given by:


                                      AT Es,s0 = E [βs0 |S ∈ {s, s0 }]


where we have conditioned the expectation for populations at one of two final schooling levels
s and s0 and assume that the individual is deciding between staying at s or continuing their
schooling to s0 .13
    In order to construct dynamic treatment effects, we need to account for the decision rule
for how educational choices are made. Let 1(Qj = 1) be an indicator that denotes whether or
not person i makes it to node j. The individual level dynamic treatment effect of graduating
from high school is then:


           Ti,1 = βi,1 + 1(Qi,2 = 1)βi,2 + 1(Qi,2 = 1)1(Qi,3 = 1)βi,3 − 1(Qi,G = 1)βi,G ,                  (4)


which is the direct benefit of graduating (βi,1 ), plus the continuation value associated with
the fact that the person may then choose to enroll in college or enroll in and graduate from
           14
college.        Given that agents who drop out can earn a GED, we must also subtract the
continuation value associated with getting a GED from the treatment effect. Thus, decisions
affect future choice sets (such as creating the possibility of college enrollment) while closing
down other future decisions (like earning a GED).15
    Note that even if we assumed that the direct gains are identical across individuals (i.e.,
βi,j = βj , ∀ i), if decisions to continue on differ across people, then the dynamic returns
to schooling will be also be heterogeneous. The other three dynamic treatment effects for

   13
      Treatment effects without this conditioning can also be constructed.
   14
      We abstract from discounting. The βi,j coefficients can be interpreted as incorporating the discounted
value.
   15
      Note that these treatment effects are similar to those in Heckman, Urzúa, and Vytlacil (2008), where in
a multinomial model they consider the treatment effect of choosing between two choice sets. For an individual
could choose between A = {Dropout, GED} or B = {HS Grad, Some College, College Grad}. This would be
similar to the treatment effects of graduating from high school or not in our model. The key difference is that
here we assume that agents only know the idiosyncratic shock associated with their current choice, allowing
us to break down the returns into direct effects and continuation values.


                                                      13

individual i are:


                                       Ti,2 = βi,2 + 1(Qi,3 = 1)βi,3                                        (5)

                                       Ti,3 = βi,3 ,                                                        (6)

                                       Ti,G = βi,G ,                                                        (7)


where the returns to graduating college and the returns to earning a GED are equal to
the direct returns in our example as they are final levels of education. To construct the
population average dynamic treatment effects, we take the expectation of these individual
returns over the full population:16


                                             AT Ej∗ = E [Ti,j ] .                                           (8)


    Equation (8) is the average treatment effect for the entire population. This likely entails
using out-of-sample estimates far from the samples of people making specific choices such as
the earnings of dropouts as college graduates. The full population ATE is less empirically
and policy relevant than ATE for those who reach a particular decision node. In this paper
we report:


                                        AT Ej = E [Ti,j |Qi,j = 1] ,                                        (9)


which is to say we estimate the average dynamic treatment effect for those that reach
particular decision j.17 Web Appendix B gives more detail on the specification of the model.




   16
      This entails taking the expectation over the full population (and thus integrates over the full support of
X, Z, θ, and U ).
   17
      In particular, this can be thought as integrating over a particular support of X, Z, θ, and U that
results in Qj = 1.

3        The Data

This paper considers six non-market outcomes constructed from the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth 1979. These six outcomes are depression, self-esteem, incarceration, voting,
welfare receipt, and trust. Table 1 provides a brief description of how each of the six outcomes
are constructed. Section C of the Web Appendix provides details on the construction of each
outcome.18

                              Table 1: Description of Outcomes

 Outcome              Description

 Depression           CES-D depression scale at age 40.
 Self-Esteem          Rosenberg Scale administered in 2006.
 Incarceration        Individual was incarcerated at time of interview between 1990 and 2010.
 Voting               Individual reported voting in the 2006 election.
 Welfare Receipt Individual was ever on welfare between 1996 and 2006.
 Trust                Individual reported “usually” or “always” trusting people in 2008.


Notes: All outcomes are from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. See Section D of
the Web Appendix for additional health outcomes from HHV (2017). See Section C of the Web
Appendix for additional details on the construction of the outcomes.


     Before discussing estimates from our model, it is informative to present adjusted and
unadjusted associations between the outcomes and schooling. Figure 2 presents estimated
regression relationships between different levels of schooling (relative to high school dropouts)
and the six outcomes analyzed in this paper.19 The black bars in each panel show the
unadjusted mean differences in outcomes for persons at the indicated levels of educational
attainment compared to those for high school dropouts.
     Higher ability is associated with better outcomes and more schooling. However, as shown

    18
      In addition, the Web Appendix contains additional information and results on smoking at age 30 and if
health ever limits work, two health outcomes considered in HHV (2017).

      Adjustments are made through linear regression.

Notes: The bars represent the coefficients from a regression of the designated outcome on dummy variables for educational
attainment, where the omitted category is high school dropout. Regressions are run adding successive controls for background
and proxies for ability. Background controls include race, region of residence in 1979, urban status in 1979, broken home
status, number of siblings, mother’s education, father’s education, and family income in 1979. Proxies for ability are average
score on the ASVAB tests and 9th grade GPA in core subjects (language, math, science, and social science). “Some College”
includes anyone who enrolled in college, but did not receive a four-year college degree. Source: NLSY79 data.

4.1      The Effects of Endowments on Education and Outcomes

We first demonstrate the relationships between the latent endowment θ and non-market
outcomes and educational choices. Figure 3 plots the effects of the latent endowments on
incarceration, use of welfare, depression, self-esteem, electoral participation, and trusting
others. In the Web Appendix, we additionally reproduce results on health limits work and
smoking reported in HHV (2017). Figure 3 shows the expected outcome based on deciles of
the cognitive and socio-emotional endowment. The two lower figures in each panel show the
marginal impact of cognitive (left) and socio-emotional (right) endowments. The cognitive
endowment affects all six outcomes, while the effect of the socio-emotional endowment is
statistically significant for the prison, welfare, voting, and trust outcomes.20
     Moving persons from the lowest decile to the highest decile in both cognitive and socio-
emotional ability lowers the probability of being incarcerated by 20.5%, the probability of
receiving welfare by 40%, the depression score by 0.55 standard deviations, and the self-esteem
score by 0.97 standard deviations. It increases the probability that they voted in the 2006
election by 46%, and the probability that they trust others by 46%.21

      While the option to get a GED is included in our model, we omit the treatment effects in our results for
clarity and because we find that the GED has few causal benefits.
   21
      Someone in the highest decile in both cognitive and socio-emotional ability has the following probabilities
for each of the following outcomes: 0.9% to be incarcerated, 6.1% to use welfare, 83% to vote in the 2006
election, and 67% to trust others.

Notes: For each of the six outcomes, we present three figures that study the impact of cognitive and socio-emotional
endowments. The top figure in each panel displays the levels of the outcome as a function of cognitive and socio-emotional
endowments. It marginalizes over X, Z. In particular, we present the average level of outcomes for different deciles of
cognitive and socio-emotional endowments. Notice that we define as “decile 1” the decile with the lowest values of
endowments and “decile 10” as the decile with the highest levels of endowments. The bottom left figure displays the average
levels of endowment across deciles of cognitive endowments, marginalizing over the non-cognitive endowment as well as X, Z.
The bottom right figure mimics the structure of the left-hand side figure but now for the socio-emotional endowment,
marginalizing over the cognitive endowment, as well as X, Z.19

    Figure 3 shows the total effect of ability on outcomes. A substantial portion of its impact
comes through educational decisions. Figure 4 presents the probabilities of making the
indicated educational choice at various levels of agent latent endowments. The top figure
shows the probability of making the transition by decile of both cognitive and socio-emotional
endowments, marginalizing over X, Z. The figures below the graphs of the joint distribution
display the marginal effects on outcomes for cognitive and socio-emotional endowments
respectively, marginalizing over X, Z, and the other endowment.22 The estimates reveal clear
evidence of sorting into education by both cognitive and socio-emotional endowments. For
example, moving someone from the lowest decile to the highest decile in both cognitive and
socio-emotional ability increases the probability of graduating high school by 75.7%, increases
the probability of enrolling in college by 68%, and increases the probability of graduating
from college by 63%.23
    At the same time, these endowments have important impacts on adult outcomes. Together,
these results imply strong selection biases in observed differences in outcomes by education
level. This highlights the importance of accounting for observed and latent traits when
estimating the causal impact of education.




   22
      The bars in the subfigures show how the population reaching the decision fits into the deciles of the skill
distribution for the whole population. Since everyone reaches the high school graduation decision, these are
flat at 0.10 per decile. We see that the GED decision has few high endowment individuals, while we sort
towards high endowment individuals as we work through the college enrollment and graduation decisions.
   23
      Someone in the highest decile in both cognitive and socio-emotional ability has the following probabilities
for each of the following outcomes: 99.1% to graduate high school, 83% to enroll in college, 81% to graduate
with a four-year college degree.

Notes: For each of the four educational choices, we present three figures that present the probability of that specific
educational choice. Final schooling levels do not allow for further options. For each pair of schooling levels j and j + 1, the
first subfigure (top) presents P rob(Qj+1 = 1|dC , dSE , Qj = 1), where dC and dSE denote the cognitive and socio-emotional
deciles computed from the marginal distributions of cognitive and socio-emotional endowments.
P rob(Qj+1 = 1|dC , dSE , Qj = 1) is computed for those who reach the decision node involving a decision between levels j and
j + 1. It marginalizes over X, Z conditional on Qj = 1. The bottom left subfigures present P rob(Qj+1 = 1|dC , Qj = 1),
where the socio-emotional factor and X, Z are integrated out. The bars in these figures display, for a given decile of cognitive
endowment, the fraction of individuals visiting the node leading to the educational decision involving levels j and j + 1. The
bottom right subfigures present P rob(Qj+1 = 1|dSE , Qj = 1) for a given decile of socio-emotional endowment, as well as the
fraction of individuals visiting the node leading to the educational decision involving levels j and j + 1, marginalizing on X, Z,
and the other endowment.



4.2                          Estimated Causal Effects

We next present estimates of the main treatment effects for our model. Since our model
is nonlinear and multidimensional, we report interpretable functions derived from it. We

                                                                                                                                                                                                  21

randomly draw sets of regressors from our sample and a vector of factors from the estimated
factor distribution to simulate the treatment effects.24 We first present the traditional
treatment effects across final schooling levels. We then consider how dynamic treatment
effects vary across decisions and endowment levels.


4.2.1    The Estimated Causal Effects of Final Educational Levels

For certain outcomes almost none of the observed difference is causal. For example, for self-
esteem and depression, we find that the observed differences between high school graduates
and dropouts are large, but the estimated average treatment effect is almost zero. We first
compare the outcomes from final schooling level s with those from s − 1. The estimated
treatment effects of education on the six outcomes are shown in Figure 5.25 For each outcome,
the bars labeled “Observed” display the unadjusted raw differences in the data. The bars
labeled “Causal Component” display the average treatment effect obtained from comparing
the outcomes associated with a particular schooling level s relative to s − 1. These are defined
for individuals at s or s − 1.26 There are substantial causal effects on incarceration, welfare
use, self-esteem, and voting. At the same time, the causal average treatment effect is only
one third to two thirds of the observed difference.




   24
      We randomly draw an individual and use their full set of regressors.
   25
      These are calculated by simulating the mean outcomes for the designated state and comparing it with
the mean-simulated outcome for the state directly below it for the subpopulation of persons who are in either
of the states.
   26
      The circles and black circles indicate that the ATE is statistically significant at the 0.05 and 0.01 level,
respectively.

Notes: Each bar compares the outcomes from a particular schooling level j and the next lowest level j − 1. The “Observed”
bar displays the observed differences in the data. The “Causal Component” bar displays the estimated average treatment
effects (ATE). The difference between the observed and causal treatment effect is attributed to the effect of selection and
ability. The error bars and significance levels for the estimated ATE are calculated using 200 bootstrap samples. Error bars
correspond to the 16th and 84th percentiles of the bootstrapped estimates, allowing for asymmetry. Significance at the 5%
and 1% levels is shown by open and filled circles on the plots, respectively.

4.2.2      Dynamic Treatment Effects

We next report treatment effects by decision node (see Figure 6). We compute the gains to
achieving (and possibly exceeding) the designated level of schooling (including continuation
values) and compare them to the outcomes associated with not achieving that level. The
Average Marginal Treatment Effect, AMTE, is the average treatment effect for those at or near
the margin of indifference for that decision node.27 AMTE is introduced in Carneiro, Heckman,
and Vytlacil (2011) and formally developed in the context of our model in HHV (2017).
   Each box of Figure 6 presents this array of educational treatment effects for each education
level for the outcomes studied. The effects are presented as the height of different bars in
each figure. They are defined as the differences in the outcomes associated with being at the
designated level, compared to the one preceding it (not necessarily final or terminal schooling
levels). ATE is calculated for the population that reaches the decision node. At each node j,
the treatment effect is E(Y k |F ix Qj+1 = 1, Qj = 1) − E(Y k |F ix Qj+1 = 0, Qj = 1) for those
who reach node j. ATE (high) and ATE (low) are the ATEs for different ability groups. The
high- (low-) ability group is defined for individuals with both cognitive and socio-emotional
endowment above (below) the median of the full population. The whiskers show standard
errors while the hollow and black circles indicate statistical significance at the 0.05 and 0.01
levels, respectively. The table below the figure displays the fraction of individuals at each
educational choice who are in the high- or low-ability group.




  27
       We define the margin of indifference to be || Ij /σj ||≤ .01, where σj is the standard deviation of Ij .

Notes: Each schooling level might provide the option to pursuing higher schooling levels. Only final schooling levels do not
provide an option value. The error bars and significance levels for the estimated ATE are calculated using 200 bootstrap
samples. Error bars correspond to the 16th and 84th percentiles of the bootstrapped estimates, allowing for asymmetry.
Significance at the 5% and 1% level are shown by hollow and black circles on the plots, respectively. The figure reports various
treatment effects for those who reach the decision node, including the estimated ATE conditional on endowment levels. The
high- (low-) ability group is defined as those individuals with cognitive and socio-emotional endowments above (below) the
median in the overall population. The affect of graduating from college on prison was not estimated as very few individuals
who enroll or graduate from college are ever incarcerated. The  25table below the figure shows the proportion of individuals at
each decision node that are high and low ability. The larger proportion of the individuals are high ability and a smaller
proportion are low ability in later educational decisions. In this table, final schooling levels are highlighted using bold letters.

4.2.3      The Effects on Cognitive and Non-Cognitive Endowments on Treatment
           Effects

The disaggregation of the treatment effects for “high” and “low” endowment individuals in
Figure 6 is coarse. One benefit of our approach is that we can determine the contribution
of cognitive and non-cognitive endowments (θ) to explaining estimated treatment effects.
We can decompose the overall effects of θ into their contribution to the causal effects at
each node and the contribution of endowments to attaining that node. We find substantial
contributions of θ to each component at each node.
   To illustrate, the panels in Figure 7 display the estimated average treatment effect of either
getting a four-year college degree (compared to stopping with some college) or graduating from
high school (compared to dropping out) for each decile pair of cognitive and non-cognitive
endowments.28 Treatment effects in general depend on both measures of ability. Moreover,
different outcomes depend in different ways on the two dimensions of ability.

       The deciles are calculated using the full population, rather than the population that reaches each node.

Notes: Each panel in this figure studies the average effects of high school or college graduation on the outcome of interest. The
effect is defined as the differences in the outcome between those with a four-year college degree and those with some college.
For each panel, let Ysome coll and Yf our−yr degree denote the outcomes associated with attaining some college and graduating
with a four-year degree, respectively. For each outcome, the first figure (top) presents E(Yf our−yr degree − Ysome coll |dC , dSE )
where dC and dSE denote the cognitive and socio-emotional deciles computed from the marginal distributions of cognitive
and socio-emotional endowments. The second figure (bottom 27    left) presents E(Yf our−yr degree − Ysome coll |dC ) so that the
socio-emotional factor is integrated out. The bars in this figure display, for a given decile of cognitive endowment, the fraction
of individuals visiting the node leading to the educational decision involving graduating from a four-year college. The last
figure (bottom right) presents E(Yf our−yr degree − Ysome coll |dSE ) and the fraction of individuals visiting the node leading
to the educational decision involving graduating from a four-year college for a given decile of socio-emotional endowment.

4.3    A Summary of Treatment Effects by Outcome

In this subsection we summarize the estimates of our model, outcome by outcome.


Prison We find that both the cognitive and socio-emotional endowments affect incarceration.
An individual with both endowments in the top decile have only 0.98% probability of being
incarcerated, while someone in the bottom decile in both endowments has a 21.7% probability.
We find the largest observed difference in outcomes between high school graduates and high
school dropouts, for which we also find the largest average causal impact (see Figure 5). For
the population of high school graduates and high school dropouts, graduating from high
school on average decreases the probability of being incarcerated by about 6% points. Turning
to the dynamic treatment effects, Figure 6 shows that almost all of the benefits come from
high school graduation. Interestingly, the average marginal treatment effect is larger than
the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect for low-endowment individuals
is much larger than the average treatment effect for high-endowment individuals. This
suggests that low-skill individuals who graduate from high school are much less likely to be
incarcerated (about 12% points lower)—an important benefit from high school graduation not
fully captured by earnings. Figure 7 shows how the average treatment effects for graduating
high school depend on the abilities of the individuals, where high-ability individuals receive
almost no return.


Any Welfare Figure 3 shows that both cognitive and non-cognitive endowments affect
welfare, though there is a stronger dependence on cognitive endowments. The probabilities
of using welfare are 6% and 48.5% for those with both endowments in the top and bottom
deciles, respectively. Like prison, we find that the largest observed difference in outcomes is
between dropouts and high school graduates. As shown in Figure 5, we find that the average
treatment effect between dropouts and high school graduates is about half of the observed
difference (13% point decrease). Though smaller, we also find the average pairwise treatment
effect between college and some college to be statistically significant. As shown in Figure 6,

the average dynamic treatment effects are large for graduating from high school for both high-
and low- endowment individuals. There are also statistically significant benefits to enrolling
in and graduating from college, though they are much smaller. As we see with many of the
non-market outcomes, low-endowment individuals gain most from a four-year degree.


Depression Lower levels of depression are associated with higher levels of the cognitive
endowment. The relationship with the socio-emotional endowment is much weaker. An
individual in the top and bottom deciles of both endowments has, respectively, depression
levels that are 0.48 and -0.30 standard deviations from the population mean. For depression,
the largest observed difference shown in Figure 5 is between high school graduates and
dropouts, but we find that the average treatment effect is small and insignificant. The
only pairwise average treatment effect we find to be statistically significant is graduating
from college, which we find to be almost equal to the observed difference between the two
groups. For the dynamic treatment effects we find that the average marginal treatment
effect is statistically significant across the three educational nodes. Many of the treatment
effects reported are not statistically significant for the high school graduation or college
enrollment decisions, but we find that the ATE, AMTE, and ATE for low-ability individuals
is statistically significant for college graduation. Figure 7 further illustrates how treatment
effects vary with ability for the college graduation decison. We find that those with lower
cognitive ability benefit much more from college graduation while the benefits are flat or
slightly increasing in socio-emotional ability.


Self-Esteem Similar to depression, higher cognitive ability is associated with higher self-
esteem, but the role of socio-emotional ability is small and statistically insignificant. An
individual in the top and bottom deciles of both endowments have self-esteem levels that are
0.60 and -0.67 standard deviations from the population mean. Similar to depression, we find
that the observed difference between dropouts and high school graduates is large, but that
the average pairwise treatment effect is small and imprecisely estimated. Unlike depression,


                                                  29
The Non-Market Benefits of Education and Ability                              September 20, 2017


we find that there are also large observed differences between high school graduates and those
with some college as well as between those with some college and those with college degrees.
In addition, we find that the average pairwise treatment effect accounts for more than 75%
of these observed differences. As shown in Figure 6, there are no benefits for self-esteem from
graduating from high school, but the ATE, AMTE, and ATE (low) are large and statistically
significant for college enrollment and college graduation. Low-ability individuals increase
their self-esteem level by 0.31 standard deviations by enrolling in college and also by earning
a four-year college degree. Interestingly, the effects are small and statistically insignificant for
high-ability individuals at both margins. Figure 7 further demonstrates how returns differ by
endowments. For the decision to graduate college, we find that the gains are larger for those
with lower levels of socio-emotional skill, while the returns are more or less flat with respect
to the cognitive endowment.


Voting As shown in Figure 3, voting depends strongly on both endowments. The probability
of voting for an individual in the top and bottom deciles of both endowments is 83% and
31%, respectively. We find that the average pairwise effect accounts for half or more of the
observed difference in outcomes. Figure 6 shows that we find returns to schooling for voting
across all margins: graduating from college, enrolling in college, and graduating from high
school. Unlike the other outcomes, we find that the returns are statistically significant across
educational decisions and endowment levels. Graduating from high school, enrolling in college
and graduating from high school increases the probability that an individual will vote by
15% points, 12% points, and 15% points, respectively.


Trust Trust also strongly depends on both cognitive and socio-emotional endowments. The
probability that an individual in the top and bottom deciles of both endowments reports
trusting others is 62% and 23%, respectively. We find large observed differences between
adjacent schooling levels, but do not find any of the pairwise average treatment effects to be
statistically significant. Looking at dynamic treatment effects, we find statistically significant


                                                30
The Non-Market Benefits of Education and Ability                             September 20, 2017


returns for enrolling in college for the AMTE and ATE but find all other reported treatment
effects to be statistically insignificant. Thus, trust serves as an example where there are large
observed differences between schooling levels, but we find little evidence of causal effects.
    In Section D of the Web Appendix we reproduce results from HHV (2017) for smoking
and health limits work. We briefly review these outcomes as well.


Daily Smoking In our previous work, we find that the observed differences in smoking
across education levels are largely causal. While the observed difference is somewhat larger
than the estimated pairwise ATE for high school graduation, they are close to identical for
college enrollment and graduation. For the dynamic treatment effects we find that education
reduces smoking across the educational decisions we consider as well as across the various
average treatment effects we calculate.


Health Limits Work For health limits work, we find that the estimated pairwise average
treatment effects account for roughly 75% of the observed difference between high school
graduates and dropouts as well as college graduates and those with some college. Considering
dynamic treatment effects, we find large benefits to college graduation across endowment
levels, but little benefit to enrolling in college except for a small but statistically significant
ATE. Finally, for college graduation, we find that there are gains on average but that low-
ability individuals do not benefit. This contrasts results with many of our other non-market
outcomes where the low-ability individuals are the primary beneficiaries.



5     Summary and Conclusion

Becker (1964) emphasized both the market and non-market benefits of education. This paper
demonstrates the wisdom of his insights and finds that there are substantial and diverse
non-market benefits to education. Estimating a robust dynamic model of educational choices
and their consequences, we account for selection bias and sorting on gains in a dynamic


                                                31

sequential model of educational decisions. We identify and estimate dynamic treatment
effects that account for the options opened up from each educational choice. The dynamic
treatment effects are policy relevant because most policies only affect choices at one margin
of education, but do not restrict future choices.
   Using our model, we investigate a range of non-market outcomes including incarceration,
mental health, voter participation, trust, and participation in welfare. We find that the
returns to education for many non-market outcomes appear to be larger for low-ability
individuals—a feature of the returns to education that is missed if only market returns are
analyzed. We also demonstrate the important effects of cognitive and non-cognitive abilities
on educational choices and their effects on outcomes fixing educational levels.
