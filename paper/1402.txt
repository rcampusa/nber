             Nutrition and the Decline in Mortality
             Since 1700: Some Preliminary Findings

                             ABSTRACT

       This paper uses the data in the NBER/CPE pilot sample of

genealogies to create a new time series on life expectation in the

U.S. since 1720. After attaining remarkably high levels toward

the end of the eighteenth century, life expectation as measured by

ê began   a decline that lasted about 80 years before beginning the

new rise with which we have long been familiar. Second, time series

on the average adult stature of national populations in North America

and Europe are used as a measure of nutritional status. The properties

of this measure in the analysis of labor welfare and an explanation for

the high correlation between stature and the Cmi ratio are discussed.

The time series on stature is strongly correlated with the series on

    and other measures of mortality. Third, these correlations are used

to estimate the contributionof improvements in nutritional status (not

diet alone but diet net of prior claims) to the decline in mortality in

Europe and America since 1800.   Improvements in nutritional status may

have accounted for as ifiuch as four tenths of the decline in mortality

rates, but nearly all of this effect was concentrated in the reduction

of infant mortality. The new findings are used to resolve several

paradoxes and the implication of the findings for the standard-of-

living controversy are considered.

                             1. The Issues

          Between c. 1700 and 1980 there was a decline of about 35 points
                                                       *
in   the standardized American death rate (see Table 1).   Between the same

years, the British rate declined by about 21 points. About 70 percent of

the American decline and about 50 percent of the British decline took place

before 1911.1

         The causes of this remarkable decline remain a puzzle. Until

the mid l9SOs it was widely attributed to improvements in medical tech-

nology. During the past three decades Thomas McKeown vigorously disputed

that view in a series of highly influential papers and books. McKeown

agreed that there had been a considerable expansion of hospital services

and important advances in medical knowledge during the eighteenth and

nineteenth centuries but he argued that such advances had little effect

on the decline in death rates until the twentieth century. A pediatrician,

McKeown gained prominence for his studies of the relationship between

birth weight and perinatal mortality rates in Eitmingham after World

War II (McKeown and Gibson, 1950, 1951) before turning his attention to

long-term changes in medical practices and demographic rates.



1.1 The Nutritional Contribution: The English Experience

         McKeown's explanation for the decline in mortality rates after

1700 is most fully set forth in his book on The Modern Rise of Population

(1976) and he subsequently restated and cogently summarized his argu-

ment in 1978 and 1983. In the place of medical technology, McKeown

substituted improvement in nutrition as the principal factor affecting

the decline in mortality. He does not make his case for nutrition

directly but through a residual argument in which he rejects the other

principal explanations. The alternatives to nutrition are advances in medical

technology; reductions in the virulence of pathogens; human acqui-

sition of immunity through natural selection, genetic drift, or

acquired immunities; personal hygiene; and public sanitation.

          McKeown's analysis turns on a careful consideration of the

British pattern of decline in death rates due to specific infectious

diseases between c. 1850 and 1971. During this period the standardized

death rate attributable to infectious diseases declined from 13.0 per

thousand to 0.7 per thousand. About 54 percent of the decline was

associated with airborne diseases, 28 percent with water- and food-

borne diseases, and 18 percent with diseases spread by other means

(McKeown 1976, pp. 54-63). This simple classification permits HcKeown

to assess the probable impact of public health measures and personal

sanitation. Cleaning up the public water supply and      improving   sewage

systems, he argues, would have had little effect on the airborne diseases.

Moreover, as long as water supplies were polluted, individuals could not

protect themselves against such water-borne diseases as typhoid and cholera

by   washing regularly. Under such circumstances "the washing of hands is
about as effective as the wringing of hands" (McKeown, 1978, p. 540).
In   his view public health measures did not become effective until.the very end

of the nineteenth century. The sharp declines in    food- and water-borne
diseases (which he dates in England and Wales with the start of the
eighth decade) were not only   due to better water and   sewage systems
but   to improvements in food hygiene, especially pasteurization. He

attributes the rapid decline of infant mortality between 1900 and 1931
                                -4-




mainly to the development of a "safe milk supply" (McKeown, 1976,

p. 122; McKeown, 1978, p. 540). McKeown argues that improvements

in personal or public hygiene would not have reduced deaths from

airborne diseases unless they reduced crowding, and crowding generally

increased during the nineteenth century.

        McKeown's skepticism about the efficacy of early medical

measures is based on his study of the temporal pattern of decline in

the death rates of the most lethal diseases of the nineteenth century.

Tuberculosis, the leading killer in England and America during much

of the nineteenth century, is   case in point. During 1848-54 tuber-

culosis caused nearly one out of every six English deaths from all causes,

and one out of every four due to infectious diseases. It was not until

1882 that the tubercle bacillus was identified and an effective chemo-

therapy for this disease was not developed until 1947. Nevertheless,

the death rate of respiratory tuberculosis declined to just 43 percent

of its 1848-54 level by 1900 and to just 10 percent of that level before

the introduction of streptomycinin 1947. Similarly, the major decline

in the death rates from bronchitis and pneumonia, whooping cough,

measles, scarlet fever, and typhoid all preceded the development of effective

chemotherapies. McKeown also doubts the efficacy of the 1ying-in

hospitals which were established during the eighteenth and nineteenth

centuries, noting that well into the third quarter of the last century

"hospital death rates were many times greater than those for related

home deliveries" (McKeown, 1975, p. 105).
                                ——




        McKeown is skeptical of the contention that the decline in

mortality rates was due to a decline in the virulence of pathogens.

He notes that scarlet fever and influenza have fluctuated in their

severity in short periods of tine and acknowledges that these fluc-

tuations may be due to changes in the character of these diseases.

He lists typhus as another disease that might have declined due to

changes in the pathogens. However, the fraction of the total decline

attributable to these three diseases is small. On a more general plane

he notes that infectious diseases that are now relatively benign in

developed nations are still quite virulent in less developed countries

and argues that it is quite unlikely that pathogens would have lost

their virulence only in developed countries. McKeown also minimizes

the impact of natural selection, arguing that in the case of tuberculosis

too much of the population had been exposed to the bacillus for too long

a period before the decline, and the decline itself was too rapid, to

be consistent with natural selection.

        McKeown's arguments in favor of a nutritional explanation fall

into two categories. First, he cites evidence that per capita food

supplies in England increased sporadically during the late eighteenth

and early nineteenth centuries and then regularly in the late nineteenth

and in the twentieth centuries. Second, he emphasizes findings of medical

researchers currently working in the developing countries who have concluded

that there is a synergistic relationship between malnutrition and infection,

and that malnutrition significantly increases the likelihood that a victim

will succumb to an infection. In this connection he cites a report of

the World Health Organization which concluded that malnutrition was an

associated cause in 57 to 67 percent of the deaths of children underage $

  in Latin America (1975, p. 136).

 1.2 The Nutritional Contribution: The American Experience

        McKeown's argument has been extended to the American experience by

Meeker (1972) and by Higgs (1973, 1979). According to Meeker, the

period from 1880 to 1910 witnessed both a substantial rise in per capita

income and a decline in mortality rates. In cross-sectional regressions

for 1890 and 1900, city mortality rates are significantly related to

housing density vat   '

                          les and state mortality rates are significantly

related to income, in his 1973 paper Riggs estimated the decline in

rt.iral mortality rates for the period from 1870 to World War I. Despite

the absence of direct observations on rural mortality, Riggs was

able to infer a series by making use of three other series (the

aggregate crude death rate, the urban crude death rate, and the share

of the population that was urban) and an thentity that related the rural

crude death rate to these series. This procedure produced a rural

crude mortality series which declined at approximately the same rate

as the urban mortality series, the total decline over 50 years amounting

to between 30 and 40 percent. Riggs argues that whatever role public

sanitation and medical care might have played in the urban context,

they were of minor consequence in rural areas which were undersupplied

with physicians, and which continued to draw water mainly from wells,

springs, and cisterns, continued to rely on prM'ies, and continued to

consume unpasteurized milk. Like McKeown, Higgs concluded that "the

great bulk of the decline in rural mortality before 1920 is probably

attributable to rising levels of living among the rural population"

(1973, p. 189).

 1.3 Objections to the Nutritional Argument

       Virtually all those who are attempting to explain the secular

decline in mortality rates in Europe and America agree that improvements

in nutrition made a contribution. But some scholars believe that

McKeown and others have greatly exaggerated the case (Livi-Bacci, 1983).

The doubts arise partly because of major gaps in the evidence. Razzell,

for example, doubts McKeown's claim that the food supply in England grew

more rapidly than the population before 1840. He argues that at least

for the eighteenth century the evidence is "much more consistent with a

reversed hypothesis- -that the standard of the diet was a function of

population change" (Razzell, 1973, p. 8). Even more basic is the

absence of adequate evidence on mortality rates. Before 1837 in Great

Britain and before 1900 in the United States information on death rates

is so sparse that historical demographers are at odds not only on the

levels of mortality but even on the direction of change (Linden, 1983;

Easterlin, 1977; Vinovskis, 1972).




       In the American case, for example, fragments of evidence led

Thompson and Whelpton (1933) to believe that mortality rates declined

fairly steadily from the middle of the eighteenth century to 1900.

This judgment has recently been reinforced by Easterlin who, primarily

on the basis of the trend in per capita income, estimated that U.S.

life expectation increased by 6.1 years between 1800 and 1840 and

by 5.8 years between 1840 and 1880 (Easterlin 1977, p. 138). On
                                  -8-




 the other hand1 Yasuba's (1962) examination of available urban death

 registrations and some scattered registrations from rural communities

 led him to conclude that mortality rates increased between 1800 and

 1860. More recently, a study, of Deerfield, which has vital records

 that extend back to the early eighteenth century, revealed that mortality

 was low and stable within this rural town of western Massachusetts until

 the turn of the nineteenth century. Between 1795-99 and 1840-44,

however, mortality rates nearly doubled (Meindl and Swedlund, 1977,

p. 398).

        It is not merely the evidential gaps in the argument of McKeown

and others that aroused the concern of critics. Certain facts seemed

to contradict the case for nutrition. The absence of a significant gap

between the mortality rates of the peerage and the laboring classes in

England before 1725 was particularly vexing. "If the foodsupply was

the critical variable," Razzell argued (1973, pp. 6-7), mortality

reductions should have been "concentrated almost exclusively
                                                               amongst

the poorer" classes and the mortality rates of the aristocracy should

have been 'Cinaffected."   Yet as Table 2 shows, between the fourth

quarter of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the second

quarter of the nineteenth century, the mortality rates of the aristocracy

were about as high as those of the general population. Both the high'

mortality rates of the nobility before 1725 and the rapid fall in these

rates thereafter, although there was no apparent change in the diet of the

       Efforts to relate both short- and long-term variations ii, the

mortality rates to variations in bread or wheat prices have also

undermined the nutritional explanation. Appleby's (1975) regressions,

which related London deaths from specific diseases to bread prices

over the period from 1530 to 1750, led him to conclude that there was

no correlation between the supply of food and deaths due to plague,

smallpox, or tuberculosis and only slight correlations between bread

prices and deaths due to typhus and "ague and fever." More sophisticated

analysis by Lee (1981) revealed statistically significant but weak

relationships between short-term variations in death rates and in wheat

prices. According to Schofield (1983, p. 282) short-run variations

in English mortality were "overwhelmingly determined" by factors other

than the food supply and the long-run trend in mortality was

unaffected by the trend in food prices.

       Lindert's (1983) examination of the work of Lee, Wrigley, and

Schofield confirmed their conclusions on the absence of a notable

relationship between food prices and mortality rates. Nevertheless,

he was discontent with results that implied that living standards

"left little or no mark on mortality." The puzzle, he

acknowledged, extended to his own work with Williamson, since they

have not yet been able to "find a firm causal link behind the obvious

correlation between income and life expectancy after 1820. He

suggested that the resolution to "the mystery of independent mortality"

trends might require more complex attacks on the issue. That would

be the case if the "life-extending" effect of income "was hidden

behind the shift toward earlier death in the growing unhealthy cities."
                                —11—




He also suggested that diets may "have improved in ways unmeasured

by income" (pp. 147-48).

       Other investigators have found evidence which indicates

that factors which McKeown diminished had a substantial impact on

the decline in mortality during the nineteenth century: Estimates

of the cause of mortality rates in the three largest urban areas

of France during the nineteenth century by Preston and van de Walle

(1978) led them to the conclusion that water and sewage improvements

played a major role in the urban mortality decline. Not only were

the declines concentrated in the waterborne diseases but the rate

of decline was much more rapid in the two cities that introduced

vigorous sewage and pure water programs than in the one that did not.

On the other hand, deaths due to tuberculosis did not decline in

Paris over a 33 year period, although deaths due to other airborne

diseases showed small declines. Even these declines could have been

due to the clean-up of the water supply.    Preston and van de Walle

stress that diarrheal and other waterborne diseases have important

nutritional consequences because they "reduce appetite, reduce the

absorption of essential nutrients, increase metabolic demands and

often lead to dietary restrictions" (p. 218). Thus cleaning up the

water system not only reduced deaths caused by water borne diseases but

also contributed to the reduction in deaths due to airborne diseases be-

cause the reduction in water borne diseases improved the nutritional

status of the population, especially of infants and young children.

1.4 The Concepts of "Nlutritional Status"
     and "Nutritional Adequacy"


       The last point calls attention to a terminological issue

that has confused the debate over the contribution of improvements

in nutrition to the decline in mortality. Although some

investigators have equated the term nutritional status with the

amount of food that is consumed, epidemiologists and nutritionists

use the term in a different way. To them nutritional status

denotes the balance between the intake of nutrients and the claims

against it.   It follows that adequate levels of nutrition are not

determined solely by the level of nutrient intake but varies with

the circumstances of an individual .   Whether the diet of a particular

individual is nutritionally adequate depends on such matters as his

level of physical activity, the climate of the region in which he

lives, and the extent of his exposure to various diseases. As Nevin

S. Scrimsha put it, the adequacy of a given level of iron     consumption

depends critically on whether or not an individual has hookworm.1

Thus it is possible that the nutritional status of a population may

decline even though that population's consumption of nutrients is

rising if the extent of exposure to infection or the degree of physical

activity is rising more rapidly. It follows that the assessment of

the contribution of nutrition to the decline in mortality not only

requires measures of food consumption but of the balance between

food consumption and the claims on that consumption.

                     2.   New Sources of Evidence


        The major obstacle to a resolution of the debate oil the causes

of the decline in mortality is the absence of data rather than the

absence of analytical ingenuity or credible theories. Recognition of

this point has led to numerous attempts to find sources of data that

could fill the gap. The most impressive of these undertakings have

been the work with parish records in England and France which have

produced important new series on population and vital events that reach

back to the first half of the sixteenth century. The publication of The

Population History of England and of a summary of the second volume in

the series (Wrigley and Schofield1lg83) reveal that we are now coming

into possession of a new long-term series that will greatly illuminate

the evolution of demographic processes in England. Similar promise for

French demography resides in the parish data assembled by INED, a part

of which has been insightfully analyzed by Weir (1982), and in the new

project based on the collection of a random sample of genealogies that

has been launched by Dupaquier and his colleagues. Despite the demon-

stration by Henripin (1954) and his colleagues that genealogies could

be used to reconstruct the population history of French. Canada during

the eighteenth century, historical demographers made little use of this

type of evidence during the three decades following the publication of

that study. The situation now appears to be changing. In Germany

samples of genealogies are also being employed as the principal source

of evidence in attempts to reconstruct long-term series on population

and vital events in that nation (Imhof, 1977).

       It has been far more difficult to obtain data on standards of

living and nutrition that could be used in conjunction with the demographic

series that are now coming on line. Wrigley and Schofield (1981), for

example, were forced to rely on a wage series of a small class of workers
                                -14-



in a single region and to treat the price of wheat as a proxy for the

consumption of food (cf. Thirsk, 1983). This difficulty is also being

addressed and promising new sources of data on economic variables are

now being exploited. It has recently been demonstrated that probate

records, bailiffs accounts, tax lists, and similar archival records

can provide data on economic information suitable for both cross-

sectional and time-series analysis. From these sources scholars have

been able to measure such variables as grain yields, meat supplies,

rental prices of housing, changes in occupational structure, income,

and wealth (Overton, 1979 and 1980; Schuurinan, 1980; Lindert, 1980;

Lindert and Williamson, 1983; B. Campbell, 1983).

        Although European scholars have led the way in the exploitation

of many of the new data sources, Americans have not been far behind.

Much of the work on this side of the Atlantic has been pioneered by

historians of the colonial period who have exploited the full array

of these difficult but now highly valued documentary sources to produce

evidence on demographic, economic, and social behavior (Demos, 1970;

Lockridge, 1966; Creven, 1970; Carr and Walsh, 1980; Smith, 1972; McCusker,

1970; Menard, 1975; Walsh and Menard, 1974; Rutman and Rütrtan, 1979; fischer

and Dobson, 1979; Kulikoff, 1976; McMahon, 1980; Calenson, 1981; Main,

1982; Rothenberg, 1984; Jones, 1980; IL Gallman, 1982; M. Callman,

1980; Levy, 1984). Although for the most part these studies have

focused on local coninunities and particular periods, collectively they

aduznbrate regional and national patterns and demonstrate the feasibility

of extending this approach to the national level and to the entire span

of U.S. history.

        In 1977 the NBER launched a new Program in the Development of

the American Economy (DAE) which is investigating
                                   -15-

long-term   changes in the U.S. economy that have occurred at the micro-

economic level. To facilitate this objective the DAE has organized

several studies of the feasibility of creating representative data sets

consisting of intergenerationally linked households. Such data sets

could open up entirely new possibilities for examining the interaction

of economic and cultural factors and their mutual influence on such

variables as the saving rate, the rate of female entry into the labor

force, fertility and mortality rates, the inequality of the wealth dis-

tribution, migration rates, and rates of economic and social mobility.

These data sets cannot be created from a single set of records but

require the linking of several different types of records. The pilot

studies have been aimed at determining whether the creation of the pro-

jected data sets is economically feasible and whether it is likely that

such data sets will yield the desired information. The results to

date have been quite encouraging on both counts.


2.1. The DAE/CPE Genealogical Sample

           One of   the projects in the DAE   program is called "The Economics

of   Mortality   in North America, 1650-1910." Jointly sponsored by the
                                -16—




Center for Population Economics of the University of Chicago, this

project turns on the collection of a large sample of genealogical records.

The demographic information in the genealogical sample is being linked,

on an individual or household basis, to economic information contained

in probate records, tax lists, manuscript schedules of federal and local

censuses, military and pension records, and eventually with medical

records. The projected size of the ultimate sample is approximately

1,000,000 individuals in 200,000 families that will be linked intergen-

erationally for up to ten generations (see Table 3).

        During the past five years we have retrieved a sample of

approximatelY 80,000 persons who were born or entered the United States

between 1640 and 1910. Our objective during this phase   has been to

investigate the various categories of genealogical records in order to

determine which types of records would yield the most desirable prop-

erties and which are most cost effective. Of the various categories

of genealogies that we have examined the two most promising are published

 family histories and family group sheets.



        There are at least 40,000 published histories of families that

contain information on over 20,000,000 people who have lived in North

America. The largest collection, with 24,000 volumes, is in the Library

of Congress, but the New York Public Library, the Library of American

Antiquarian Society, the Genealogical Society Library in Salt Lake City,

and the Newberry Library have extensive collections. We have surveyed

the resources in these and other collections and have put information from

 a sample of the family histories into machine-readable form. At

 the present time the sample of published family histories consists

 of about 60,000 individuals drawn from about 270 books.

           Most of the family histories begin with an iunnigrant to North

 America or some other individual who may    be   viewed as a patriarchal

 or matriarchal figure. The book then records the descendants of this

 initial individual so that a descending tree or a pyramid is described

 within the family history. Dates of birth, death, and marriages are

 recorded in the family history, along with the place of each vital

event, although omission of some vital information is common. The

typical family history in the pilot sample covers six to eight gener-

ations and contains about 2,000 individuals. Families of New England

are overrepresented in the histories but a significant number of books

exist   or each region of the country. The paucity of black family
histories is the most serious shortcoming of this source. But the
source is sufficiently diverse with respect to religion, European

origins; places of settlement in North America and period of imini-

gration   to be useful for studies of the white population.

          We have experimented with a variety of strategies in sampling

from these books. An initial concern was the distribution of the

sample over the largest feasible number of books in     order   to insure

geographic and other forms of diversity. More recently we have been

experimenting with the recording of all of the information in a book,

which may be the most cost effective procedure. This new approach

was encouraged by the discovery that whatever the initial location of

the patriarch, subsequent generations were so mobile that each book

generally had wide geographic coverage.2
                                -19-


       Of the 72,000 observations in machine-readable form only

two-thirds have been integrated into the two files currently em-

ployed for demographic analysis. For the analysis of fertility we

created an intergenerationally-linked file of about 10,000 families

embracing about 41,000 unduplicated individuals. The subsample

currently being used to investigate mortality consists of about 19,000

individuals at risk from birth. About 15 percent of the individuals

in these two working subsamples have been linked so far to economic

information obtained from probate records and from the manuscript

schedules of the federal censuses.3

       Family group sheets are also family histories but each sheet

consists of just three generations. It is posible to link successive

group sheets together in order to form longer genealogies but we have

not yet attempted to do so. So far we have used them mainly for the period

between 1830 and 1900 when foreign immigration was heavy. The group

sheets are well suited for that purpose since patriarchs who arrived

during the second half of the nineteenth century would only have had

one or two generations of eligible descendants. The family group sheets

were constructed by Mormons and there are about 101000,000 of these

records in the files of the Genealogical Library in Salt Lake City.

Although the compilers were Mormons, the ancestors included in the group

sheets usually were not.4 Much of our work with the group-sheet sample has been

concerned with whether its members are similar enough to the members of the

published family histories to consider both samples as constituting a single pooi

of information. So far the results of our tests indicate that they do,

and for many of our runs we have been pooling the two samples, although

we continue to test for differences. The current working ample of roup sheets
                                        -20-




                                                                             4
  consists of about g,soo individuals who belonged to 1,500 families.

          A priori considerations suggest that genealogies are likely

  to be a biased source of information on demographic and other socio-

  econonic characteristics. For example, it seems reasonable to assume

  that the probability that a family history will be constructed is pro-

  portional to the fertility of the family and
                                                    inversely proportional to
  its mortality.      It follows that genealogies may yield upward biased

 estimates of fertility rates and downward biased estimates of mortality

 rates. Whether the magnitude of such biases is large or small and

 whether they are correctable
                                     cannot, however, be determined on a priori

 grounds and the investigation of the direction and magnitude of various

 biases has been at the center of our work.

          One approach to this problem has been to run a series of

 regressions of the form:

         (1)   D. =                  where
                       g(X..1B..),
               D. =    a dichotomous variable for persons in the
                3                                                jth
                      age group that takes the value one in the event
                      of a death,

               X.. =   the ith behavioral factor affecting the
                                                               mortality
                       rate of the jth age group,

               B. = the    ith distortion in the data set which
                                                                spuriously
                       affects the probability of dying in the jth group.

The regressions described by equation (1) can be used to produce values

of nx corrected for the biases measured by the
                                                            At the present
tine only a portion of the           variables that we intend to consider have

been brought into analysis.. Still missing are the main economic variables,

which we are now in the process of
                                         linking to the demographic variables.
                                -21-




Nevertheless, the initial nms on age-specific risk of death (for each

sex, on each of the seven age intervals, for each of four birth cohorts)

are rather promising. Birth order is statistically significant and

has a relatively large impact on the probability of dying in most of

the age intervals, with first and last births having a higher proba-

bility of dying than intermediate births in families with at least four

live births. Place of birth has a significant impact on the probability

of dying and the high risk regions change over time.

        The bias variables (B3) indicate that practices by the compilers

of genealogies had a small but statistically significant effect on the

measured level of risk. So far these biases do not appear to have had

much effect on the coefficients of the      generally changing the values

only of the second or third significant digit. Much remains to be done,

however, on investigating alternative ways in which the bias variables

may be introduced into the regressions. But so far the impact of the

various biases identified on a priori ground appear to be small in

well chosen and carefully screened genealogies. Even in the case of

wealth, the upward bias in the genealogies is smaller than had been

conjectured. Adams and Kasakoff have collected a sample of genealogies

for northern states which they linked with the manuscript schedules of

the 1850 census. They then computed mean wealth of the men in their

sample who were age 20 or over in 1850, by occupation. Table 4 com-

pares their results with the means reported by Soltow (1975) for his

random sample from the 1850 census schedules.   Table 4

 shows that although the means in the salnple•ofAdaAs and Kasakoff

 are biased upward as one would expect, the differences are not very

 large and clearly indicate the genealogies cover virtually the whole

 range of wealth holders. Consequently, by including wealth as an argu-

 went of equation (1), it is possible to adjust for errors in estimates

 of mean mortality rates due to the overrepresentation of rich individuals

 and underrepresentation of poor ones.

        Potential biases in the mortality rates because of the

nature of different categories of genealogies raise more troublesome

issues. One of the first issues we investigated was whether the

family histories were truly family histories or merely pedigrees.

Family histories include all of the descendants of the partrtarch

but pedigrees include only the direct ancestors of the compiler (his

father, his grandfather, his great grandfather, and so on). Quite

clearly pedigrees would bias mortality rates downward severely since

the individuals in a pedigree had to live at least long enough to have

procreated. The creation of a pedigree is the first step in the

compilation of a family history since the compiler    must trace his

lineage to the patriarch. Only then can he come forward in time to

construct a complete family history. The simplest test of whether

a book is a family history or a pedigree is to observe the fullness

of the tree.   Some books can be discarded because it is obvious that

the compiler traced only a few lines. Such inspection will not, however,

reveal more subtle omissions. To get at these we devised other tests,
                                        -24-




  such   as whether the number of lines     that   died out in a given
  genealogy was consistent with the predictions generated by reasonable
  guesses at          appropriate life tabland fertility schedules. The results

  of the various tests have indicated that the majority of the family

  histories in our sample are indeed what they purport to be. It appears

  that once they determined who their patriarchs were, the compilers usually

  sought to fill in the entire family tree, although they were not always

  entirely successful.

           Other tests of potential bias have involved evaluation of

 the behavior of various fertility and mortality statistics in order

 to determine if they conform to patterns observed in comparable

 populations. We have, for example, compared age-specific fertility

 schedules and the mean birth intervals at various parities with

 those obtained from a variety of family reconstitutions and found

 them to be normal for non-contraceptive populations. We are

 currently comparing the age structure of the individuals in the sample

 who are alive at given dates with the age structure in censuses per-

 formed at the same date but have not yet completed these          tests. We
 have also computed both period and cohort life tables from the data

in our sample in order to determine whether the internal structures- of

these tables are consistent with known
                                               characteristics of life tables
and these are.

         One   such    life table has been constructed fnr 920 native-born

white males in the pilot
                              sample who were at risk to die during the

decade of the lSSOs (see panel A of Table 5). It should be emphasized
                                  —25—



that during the pilot phase of data collection the individuals included

in the sample have been chosen in such a way as to be representative

of the collections of genealogies that have been the focus of our con-

cern. Consequently1 the observations in the pilot sample are not

necessarily representative of the national population to which the

final sample will pertain. Although the individuals at risk during the

lSSOs come from all of the major regions, the Northeast is overrepresented

and the South and Midwest are underrepresented. The rural areas are

also overrepresented and urban areas are underrepresented. In principle

the deficiencies in the sample could be remedied by reweighting each of

the cells in an appropriate manner. I have not engaged in such an exercise

for two reasons. First, the current sample is too small; on average

there are only about 13 observations for each of the 70 cells that need

to be reweighted. Second, the life tables which are available for

comparison suffer from similar sample selection biases which cannot

at present be defined with the precision required for reweighting.

        Panel B of Table 5 presents the average of the 1850 and 1860

life tables recently estimated by flames (1979) from the data in the

censuses of mortality for these two years. Because these censuses

suffer from substantial underreporting, flames fitted model life

schedules to data for persons aged 5-19, ages during which the reporting

tends to be most complete. Nevertheless, it is still likely that the

mortality rates in his tables are to some degree biased downward. The

downward bias is likely to be present even at the ages he focused on

because underreporting was greater in the South than in the North and

because underreporting was severe in urban areas at all ages (cf. Kahn,

1978; Condran and Crimmins, 1980). Panel C presents the life table for

1900 constructed by the Bureau of the Census for the ten original death

 registration states. Unlike the Haines tables it is difficult to know

 the direction of bias in this table because the biases run in both

 directions. The exclusion of the South from the
                                                      original registraj0
 states tends to bias mortality rates downward.      It was not until 1933
 that all 48 states were included in the
                                             death registration system (U.S.
 Bur. Cen., 1975, p. 44). On the other hand, the states included in

 the original registration area
                                  are Overrepresented, in comparison with
 the nation as a whole, in two high
                                        risk groups: the foreign born and
 residents of large cities.

          Table 5 indicates that life
                                        expectation at age 10 during the
decade of the l8SOs in the
                              genealogical sample is 46.7 years, which is
almost identical with the
                             corresponding figure in the average of the
I-lames tables for 1850 and 1860 (46.6
                                          years) and about three years less
than that indicated by the 1900 table
                                          (49.5 years). These results are
generally consistent with what is known about the extent of improvement

in mortality between the 1850s and 1900. There are some differences
                                                                    in
the nx values between the
                              genealogical sample and the average of the
Haines tables, but because of the
                                     relatively small sample sizes, these
are within the range of sampling
                                   variability. Sampling variability can,
however, be reduced by further aggregation and for this reason the
                                                                   pre-
liminary findings presented in part 3 of this paper turn on 25-year

averages (averages of five quinquennial intervals). Allin all, the

life tables derived from the genealogies conform well to those derived

from registration data and other sources even before adjusting the

sample   for the underrepresenta-tion of various sections of the ref-
erence population.    The prospect for further improving the genealogical

sample by both fuller sampling of underrepresented groups and various

statistical adjustments is quite good.

2.2 The Height-by-Age Samples

        One   of   the variables that we wanted to include in the regressions

run on equation (1) was a measure of nutritional status. Measures of

the mean consumption of various foods are so scarce for modern populations

that it is unlikely that even the most assiduous search of archival

documents would produce reliable annual estimates of the consumption

of the principal nutrients for any significant number of individuals,

certainly not for the whole span of time that we wish to consider.

Moreover, since nutritional status depends not only on the amount of

nutrients that are consumed but also on the claims against that

consumption, a measure of food intake alone would be insufficient.

        Fortunately, there is a class of measures that are relatively

abundant, that reach far back into time, and that are sensitive to

variations in nutritional status. Both laboratory experiments on

animal populatons and observational studies of human populations have

led physiologists and nutritionists to conclude that anthropometric

measurements are reliable indexes of the extent of malnutrition among

the socioeconomic classes of particular populations. Measures of

height and weight at given ages, the age at which growth of stature

terminates, attained final height, and the rate of             change

 in height or weight during the growing ages "reflect accurately the

 state of a nation's public health and the average nutritional status

 of its citizens" (     Eveleth   and   Tanner, 1976, p.1). Consequently,these measures
 are now widely used by the World Health Organization and other agencies to

 assess the nutritional status of the population of underdeveloped

 nations.

            The use of anthropometic measures as measures of nutrition

 rests on a well-defined patterns of human growth between childhood and

 maturity. The average annual increase in height (velocity] is greatest

 during infancy, falls sharply up to age three, and then falls more

 slowly throughout the remaining pre-adolescent years. During adolescence,

 velocity rises sharply to a peak that is approximately one half of the
                                        -29-




velocity achieved during infancy, then falls sharply and reaches zero

at maturity. In girls the adolescent growth spurt begins about two

years earlier, and the magnitude of the spurt is slightly smaller

than in boys.

        This growth pattern reflects the interaction of genetic,

environmental, and socioeconomic factors during the period of growth.

According to Eveleth and Tanner (1976, p.222)

        Such interaction may be complex. Two genotypes which

        produce the same adult height under optimal

        environmental circumstances may produce different

        heights under circumstances of privation. Thus two

        children who would be the same height in a well-off

        community may not only both be smaller under poor

       onomic conditions, but one may be significantly smaller

        than the other. .   . . If   a particular environmental stimulus

        is lacking at a time when it is essential for the child

        (times known as 'sensitive periods'), then the child's

        development may be shunted, as it were, from one line

        to another.

        The relative importance of environmental and genetic factors

in explaining individual variations in height is stillamatter of

some debate. For most well-fed contemporary populations, however,

systematic genetic influences appear to have very little impact on

mean heights.         Thus, the mean heights of well-fed West

Europeans, North American whites, and North American blacks are nearly

identical. There are some ethnic groups in which mean adult heights
                                  -30-

 of   well-fed persons today do differ significantly from the West European

 or North American averages, presumably due to genetic factors. However,

 since such ethnic groups have represented a minuscule proportion of

American and European populations, they are irrelevant to an explanation

of the secular trends in mean adult heights in the U.S. and in the

various European nations since 1750. Nor do they contribute signifi-

cantly to differences, at various points of tine, between the height

means of the U.S. population and of the principal populations from which

the U.S. population was drawn. In this connection, it should be noted

that today the mean final heights of well-fed males in the main African

nations from which the U.S. black population is derived also fall within

the narrow band characteristic of Western Europe (Eveleth and Tanner1

1976; Fogel etal., 1983).

         Biologists, epidemiologists, and nutritionists have charted

the effect of nutritional deficiencies on the human growth profile.

Short periods of severe undernutrition or prolonged periods of moderate

undernutrition merely delay the adolescent growth spurt; severe, prolonged

undernutrition may diminish the typical growth-spun pattern and

contribute to substantial permanent stunting. If undernutrition is both

prolonged and moderate, growth will continue beyond the age at which

the growth of well-fed adolescents ceases. Hence, the average age at

which the growth spun peaks, the average age at which growth terminates,

the mean height during adolescent ages, and the mean final height are

all important indicators of mean nutritional status (Frisancho, 1978).

Any one of these factors can be used to identify secular trends in nutrition.
                                -31—



The more of these measures that are available, the more precise the

determination of the severity and duration of periods of malnutrition.

         In considering the relationship between nutrition and height,

it is important to keep in mind that height is a net rather than a gross

measure of nutrition. Moreover, although changes in height during the

growing years are sensitive to current levels of nutrition, mean final

heights reflect the accumulated past nutritional experience of an in-

dividual over all of his growing years including the fetal period.

Thus it follows that when the final heights are used to explain differences

in adult mortality rates, they reveal the effect, not of adult levels of

nutrition on adult mortality rates, but of nutritional levels during

infancy, childhood, and adolescence on adult mortality rates. Similarly,

when heights at age 8 are related to mortality at age 8, the exercise

reveals the effect of nutritional experience up to that age.

         The measure of net nutrition represented by mean heights

depends on the intake of nutrients, on the amount of nutrients avail-

able for physical growth after the necessary claims of work and other

activities (including recovery from infections), and on the efficiency

with which the body converts nutrients into outputs. The body's

ability to generate a surplus for growth will vary with such factors

as age, the climate, the nature of the available food, clothing and

shelter, the disease environment, the intensity of work, and the quality

of public sanitation. In other words, the same nutritional input can

have varying effects on physical growth, depending upon environmental

conditions. Consequently, mean height corresponds quite well to the

type of measure of nutritional status called for in Section 1.4: it is

a measure of the balance between food consumption and the claims on

that consumption.
                                   -32—




           Some social scientists have suggested that height (or weight)

 at given ages should not be called measures of "nutritional status,"

 but   "generalized indexes of health" or "non-specific indicators of
 health status" (Mosley and Chen, l983) The definition of "nutritional
 status" that I have set forth here is not my own, but rather the defi-
 nition employed by medical nutritionists, epidemiologists, and physi-

ologists. It is an unfamiliar concept to most economists (and other

social scientists) because we are not steeped in the medical literature.

Moreover, "nutritional status" sounds too much like "diet" to most of

us, although medical nutritionists and epidemiologists draw a sharp

distinction between the two terms. To some social scientists the use

of the ten "nutritional status" seems to be a subtle way of supporting

the oversimplified view that low levels of nutritional intake are the

only sources of malnutrition, and so use of the term appears to give

covert support to oversimplified theories of the relationship between

diet and mortality.

          Will the use of such alternative tens as "health" or "non-

specific indicators of health status" avoid the problem? These terms

have been advanced as though their meaning was unambiguous; yet as F.K.

Taylor (1979) has pointed out, "health" is difficult to define rigorously.

We can try to give it rigor by using available information on morbidity and

mortality rates. Then "healthy" populations may be defined as populations

having rates in these dimensions that fall within a "normal" range.

The difficulty with this procedure is not only that reliable measures

of mortality and, especially, of morbidity are often lacking; there is
                                  -33-


the   more fundamehtal issue that "normal" ranges of morbidity and nor-.

tality vary so widely with tine, place, and circumstances that epidemiologists

often turn to anthroponetric measures in order to detennine what is "normal"

in a given environment (Hytten and Leitch, 1971; Waterlow et al, 1977;

Habicht et al, 1974; Meredith, 1970; Naeye, 1981; Raman, 1981; Thomson and

Bellewicz, 1976; Goldstein, 1976). So the mere substitution of one term

for   another, of "generalized indexes of health status" for "nutritional
status," will not renove conceptual ambiguities or prevent oversimplified
characterizations of the empirical relationships we seek to uncover.

         Quite the contrary, striking out on our own, without adequate

attention to and connection with the extensive medical investigations

on which we must base our own work, is far more likely to be misleading

than acceptance of medical terminology that now seems strange or even

questionable. Long experience with the problems of the interrelationship

between nutritional status and infectious diseases has led medical

specialists to the conclusion that anthropometric measures are the best

single index of the average nutritional status of a population and of

the relationship between undernutrition and the outcome of a significant

range of infections (Habichtet al, 1979). Both clinical studies and laboratory

experiments have shown that body wasting, retardation in the rate of

physical development, and stunting are usually caused by undernutrition

during the developmental years, which both reduces the rate of cell

accumulation and the size of cells (Winick and Brasel, 1980). These

findings do not, however, imply that inadequate nutrient intake is the

primary source of undernutrition or that undernutrition can be remedied

merely, or even primarily, by increasing nutritional intake, since the

source of the undernutrition may be a disease which makes it impossible

for the body to assimilate those nutrients which are ingested.
                                -34-

         Moreover both laboratory experiments on animal populations and

 field studies of human populations have identified a set of infections

 whose outcome is sensitive to the nutritional status of the population

 at risk. The most carefully controlled of these field studies has

 been underway in the Narangwal district of IndIa for more than a decade

 (C.E. Taylor 1982; Kielmann et al, 1982; Kielmann et al, 1983). The

 Naraugwal project has revealed that perinatal mortality is particu-

 larly sensitive to the nutritional status of mothers. Perinatal mor-

 tality rates were reduced by more than 40 percent when the diets of

pregnant women were supplemented by various nutrients, particularly

iron and folic acid. Public health measures, such as the immunization

of mothers for neonatal tetanus and improved delivery procedures, also

were effective, contributing about half as much to the reduction in

perinatal mortality rates as did nutritional supplementation. Infant

mortality during the balance of the first year and mortality between

ages one and three were also reduced by both measures. Interestingly,

public health measures were more effective than nutritional
                                                              supplemen-
tation in curbing late infant mortality, and the two types of inter-

vention were about equally effective in curbing mortality at ages 1-3.

Both nutritional supplementation and public health measures had marked

effects on height and weight at given ages and deviations from the

50th centile of prevailing standards for height and weight were strongly

correlated with death rates. Whatever the nature of the infections     to

which they were exposed, children whose diets were supplemented grew

more rapidly up to age three (the final age of the test) than children

in the control group.

         In other words, improvements in nutritional status, whether the

 consequence of nutritional supplementation (which enables the body to

 resist infections) or medical intervention (which reduces the virulence

rates.    However, these associations are not identical or even symmetrical.

Increases in nutritional intake and medical or public health measures

often have different effects on particular diseases (and these effects

vary with different stages in the life cycle) as well as on the pattern

of human growth. For the range of issues that we are exploring it. is

particularly important to stress that every infection affects nutritional

status;   the survivors of an infection suffer a depravation .of nutrients
required for growth which slows down the rate of cell accumulation and
reduces cell mass (Winick :and Brasel, 1980). It does not follow., however,

that improvements in nutritional status necessarily reduce morbidity and

mortality rates. Not all infections are nutritionally sensitive and the

body's capacity to resist a nutritionally-sensitive infection may be

inconsequential if the pathogen is sufficiently virulent. In àther words,

nutritional status is likely to be "a       determining   factor" in   the   outcome

of an infection when that infection is both nutritionally sensitive and of

an intermediate degree of virulence (J.l.H., 1983, p. 506). Physidlogists

have also identified the "mechanisms responsible for the increased number

and severity of infections in the malnourished host" (Feigin, 1981, p. 18).

          Furthermore, although mean height is a good measure of nutritional

status, it   does   not by itself indicate whether fluctuations in net nu-

trition are due to fluctuations in the consumption of food, in the claims

on the food intake, or in the efficiency with which food is converted into

outputs. Such decomposition is possible because of the asymmetries to

which I have referred. Although both infection and inadequate nutritional

intake retard the process of    growth,    they do not do   so   in precisely the

same way. Because the body draws more heavily on nutritional stores when

it is fighting an infection than when it      is   not, an infection may cadse

growth to cease during a period of infection. However, if a child is
                                   -36-




normally well fed, and if there is sufficient time between infectious

episodes, there will usually be full catch-up in growth when an infection

ceases. Normal, well-fed children do not grow at equal daily rates but

alternate periods of growth well in excess of the daily average with

periods of little or no growth, as disease and other claims on nutritional

intake wax and wane. In well-fed children these lacunae in growth have

no affect on final heights, because of full and rapid catch-up, but in

malnourished children they contribute to permanent stunting (Fogel et al, 1983).

        The more data which are available on heights at each age, the

more numerous and disaggregated the links between age- and disease-

specific death rates, not only with anthropometric data, but with a

variety of other socioeconomic variables, the more complete the decom-

position of the determinants of the decline in mortality will be, including

the determinants of nutritional status. It is not easy to construct a

data base as varied and abundant as I have indicated, but the objective

is not out of reach. Some initial stabs at decomposition with the data

currently in hand are undertaken for a few specific cases that are con-

sidered in Sections 3.2 and 4.4.

         The collection of a modest sample of height-by-age data was

launched in early 1978 as an adjunct of the mortality project in order

to produce. a measure that could be employed in equation (1)..   However,

it quickly became apparent that this hody of evidence was filled with.

so much useful infornation on economic behavior that the scOpe of the

sampling effort was enlarged and the woxk on this body of evidence be-

came the foundation for a new Bureau project called "Secular Trends in

Nutrition, Labor Welfare and Labor Productivity," which is also co-

sponsored by the Center for Population Economics.

         The nutrition project currently involves a set of sixteen

samples (see Table 6) containing information on height by age,

weight, and various socioeconomic variables. The samples, which

cover the period from 1750 through. 1937, reveal aspects of physical

development in the United States, Trinidad, Great Britain, Austro-

Hungary, and Sweden. Ten of the samples were drawn from military

records and hence pertain to males of military age. One of the

Rritish samples is composed of poor teen-aged boys taken in by the

Marine Society, a charitable organization, from 1750 to 1910; another

is composed of upper class boys admitted to Sandhurst. Three of the

samples contain information on both sexes from infancy to old age.

One sample is of birth weights and lengths in Philadelphia from the

1840s to the end of the 1870s. The data in these samples are being

linked with additional data obtained from probate records, tax lists,

pension records, and manuscript schedules of censuses. Such linking

increases both the range of variables that can be brought into the

analysis and the complexity of the interrelationship between height,

nutritional status, and economic and social behavior that we can

investigate. As of late 1983, information had been collected on

about 400,000 individuals, which is about 75 percent of the anticipated

final number.

        Much of our work on the height data between 1977 and 1982

dealt with problems of estimating and correcting biases that arose

from using military records to estimate the mean height of the

population from which the recruits were drawn. These biases fall

into three categories. Firsts there are the self-selection biases

that are peculiar to volunteer armies. Then there are a variety of

more general measurement biases, some of which relate to the

accuracy of the age information and others to the accuracy of the

height information. Finally, there is the bias that arises because

military organizations may have height limits. Most frequently these
                                -42-




organizational restrictions produced a jagged truncation.of the left

tail of the height distribution, but right-tail truncation is also

encountered. Since we have published several papers dealing with

the techniques developed for coping with these problems (Trussell

and Bloom, 1979, Wachter 1981; Wachter and Trussell, 1982; Fogel etal,

1982; Floud, l983a; Fogel etj, 1983; Floud and Wachter, 1983;

Trussell and Wachter, 1984), I will not attempt to describe them here

but merely state that both simulation techniques and practical experience

have demonstrated the effectiveness of the procedures.


           3. Some Preliminary Findings on the Relationship
              between Improvements in Nutritional Status
                     and the Declinr in Mortality


        At the present time we have three pieces of evidence linking

mortality rates with nutritional status (as measured by height).

Before presenting these findings, I wish to reemphasize that

they are provisional.   Although the work on the         height

data is fairly advanced we are still in the pilot phase of the drawing

of the genealogical sample. The pilot sample is still relatively

small, lacking in the geographical diversity we desire, especially

before 1750, and only partly linked to the economic, medical, and

social information that we will eventually have. Nevertheless, there

are several findings which have arisen out of these data sets which

are highly suggestive, and which appear to be sufficiently robust to

warrant their presentation.

 3.1 The Secular Trends in the Height and in the
      Life Expectation of U.S. White Males, 1700-1930

         Figure 1 compares the time series that we have developed so

 far in both the height and the life expectation of U.S. white males.

 Before considering this diagram some characteristics of the series and

 their limitations should be kept in mind. First, the secular trend

 in height is controlled for shifts in the distribution of the region of

 birth, of occupation, and several other relevant characteristics while

 the life-expectation series is not, but merely gives the mean life ex-

 pectation at age 10 of all of the individuals at risk during each period.6

 Second, southerners are underrepresented in both the height and life-

 expectation series. The correction of these deficiencies, which we hope

 to make in the near future, will probably have a greater effect on the

 e10 series than on the height series, especially before c.1750.7



        It is possible to estimate tentatively the effect of the

correction by making use of Levy's(l984) estimates of the life

ewectaion of Maryland legislators. The value of e10 estimated

from his data for l7Oe-49 and 1750-99 are shown in the lower
                       8
portion of the diagram. Also shown is the effect of averaging his

observations and those in the genealogical sample, using weights that
                                                                      9
correct for the undercount of southerners in the genealogical sample.

As can be seen the impact of the correction will be greatest before

1750, partly because the differential in mortality between the regions

closed .rapidly during the first half of the eighteenth century and

partly because the current representation of the South in the sample

improves considerably after 1750. Thus I expect a more representative

sample to show a more rapid rise in e10 between 1700 and 1750. The

beginning of the peak nay be shifted        by one or two decades and

the level of the peak may be lowered slightly.

        These corrections will not change the striking and unexpected

similarities in the two series. Both series appear to be rising during

most of the eighteenth century, attaining both substantially greater

heights and life expectations than prevailed in England during the same

period. Life expectation began to decline during the 1790s and continued

to do so for about half a century. There may have been a slight decline

in the heights of cohorts born between 1785 and 1820, but the sharp

decline, which probably lasted about half a century, began with cohorts

born c. 1830. A new rise in heights, the one with which we have long

been familiar, probably began with cohorts born during the last decade

of the nineteenth century and continued for about 60 years.

        We do not, at present, have data on final heights in

America for cohorts born before 1710, but the relatively f1at

profile between':c. 1710 and c.l750 and the tall stature compared with the

ng1ish in c. 1750 suggests that heights were probably rising rapidly

 for several decades before our series begins. This inference is supported

by data on food consumption in Massachusetts discovered by McMahon (1980).

Wills deposited in Middlesex county between 1654 and 1830 indicate a

 sharp rise in the average amount of meat annually allotted to widows for

 their consumption. Between c. 1675 and c. 1750 the average allotment

 increased from approximately 80 to approximately 168 pounds per annum;

 about half the increase took place by c.l710. The evidence both on

 stature and on food allotments suggests that Americans achieved an

 average level of meat consumption by the middle of the eighteenth

 century that was not achieved in Europe until well into the twentieth

 century (McMahon, 1980; Holmes, 1907; Fogel, 1985).
                                   -46-


           Figure 1 and Table 7 reveal that Americans not only achieved

modern heights by the middle of the seventeenth century, but that they

reached levels of life expectation that were not attained by

the general population of England or even by the British peerage

until the first quarter of the twentieth century. Correction of the

e10 series for the underrepresentation of southerners may push the

period      estimate of e10 in c.l725 to about 47 years and the estimate

for c.1775 to about 54 years1 but these would still be remarkably high

values for e10. Although a more refined downward adjustment will even-

tually need to be made to obtain a reliable national average, there is

at present no obvious reason for believing that the figures shown were

not representative of the Northeast.

           The early attainment of modern stature and relatively long life

expectation is surprising, and for that reason alone calls for further

verification. Yet in light of the evidence that has accumulated in

recent years it is by no means unreasonable. By the second quarter of

the eighteenth century Americans had achieved diets that were remarkably

nutritious by European standards, and particularly rich in protein. The

American population was low in density, probably below the threshold

needed to sustain major epidemics of such diseases as smallpox. The

low density probably also reduced exposure to the crowd diseases of the

nineteenth century that took a heavy toll of life in both England and

America. This is not to say that there were no epidemics in America

between c.l725 and c.1800, but with the exception of a few port cities,

outbreaks of epidemic diseases appear to have been much milder than in

England.

           The discovery of the cycling in both height and e10, especially

of the amplitude of the movements, is so new and so surprising that many

 Sources: Column 1: Table 2, above. The two observations of e 0 (males)
  for 19-IT and 19-lIT were computed from Case etal, 1962, in tAe manner
  described in Table 2. Columns 2 and 3: Hollingworth 1977, p.328. Column
  4: The genealogical sample (N = 4,210) for all observations except 20-I,
  which is derived from U.S. registration data in the sources listed in
 notes to Table 3 and from U.S. Nat. Cent. Health Stat. 1983. The
 v1ues for     late   ages reached      after 1980 were
 projections of the entries in the 1980 life table using the rate of
 decline in age-secific death rates obtained from medical records during
  1968-1978 and reported in Wilkin 1981. The entry for 20-I is the average
 of e10 for cohorts born in 1900, 1910, and 1920. This entry includes the
 foreign born, while all the other entries in column 4 do not. Consequently,
 a comparison between 19-ITtand 20-T may understate the extent of the
 improvement in e10 for cohorts born during the first quarter of the twen-
 tieth century.

issues will have to be pursued before doubts about the discovery can

be set aside. Not least of the tasks is the need to enlarge the gene-

alogical sample and to investigate characteristics that night be inducing

spurious cycles or exaggerating the amplitude of the cycles in the un-

controlled trend. In this paper, however, it is the hitherto unsuspected

pattern in the height series and its strong correlation with the mortality

series that I want to emphasize.

3.2. Slaves and Poor London Boys

        The second piece of evidence linking mortality and nutritional

status cones from data on slaves and on the London poor. Under abo-

litionist pressures the British colonial office conducted two registrations

of slaves in Trinidad within a twenty month period, the first in 1813

and the second in 1815. Because the aim of the registrations was to

prevent smuggling of slaves, physical characteristics, including height,

were recorded. The second registration also included information on

the disposition of all the slaves who were registered in 1813. Friedman

(1982) was the first to investigate the differences between the height

of the slaves who died and those who survived. The difference is evident

in Table 8, which presents the heights of surviving and non-surviving males

under age 26. The extent of the difference is more apparent in a re-

gression format. Table 9 shows that Trinidad-born males under age 26

who died between 1813 and 1815 were 1.2 inches shorter than those who

survived. The corresponding figure for females is 0.9 inches.

        Table 8 not only shows that non-survivors were shorter than sur-

vivors, but that even the survivors were exceedingly short by modern standards.

Figure 2 indicates how bad their nutritional status was. In this diagram

the heights of Trinidad-born male slaves, at ages from infancy to

maturity, are superimposed on a set of curves which describe the current

British standard for assessing the adequacy of physical development.

The curve marked "50th centile" gives the average height at each age

among generally well-fed persons in Great Britain today. Also shown

on the diagram are the heights of U.S. male slaves (which come from

documents designed to prevent the smuggling of slaves into the U.S.), the

height of poor adolescent boys in London during the last half of the eight-

eenth century, and the height of English laborers at maturity.c. 1780.

        Figure 2 shows that during early childhood slaves in both

Trinidad and the U.S. were exceedingly malnourished. The figures

for ages 0.5 and 1.5 are probably biased downward because the legs of

the children were not fully stretched out when they were measurixi.

But at ages 2.5 and 3.5 the children were walking and would have been

measured in a standing position. Yet they were still exceedingly short

by modern standards, falling at or below the 0.1 centile. Such poor
                         of
development is indicative4kwashiorkor and other diseases caused by

severe protein-calorie malnutrition (P04). Although the gap with modern

height standards was reduced after age 3, it remained in a range

suggesting at least mild to moderate PCM through age 8. Between ages

10 and 17 the growth patterns of U.S. and Trinidad slaves diverged,

with the heights of U.S. slaves climbing into the normal range, while

the heights of Trinidad slaves fluctuated in the range of moderate to

severe PCM. By the mid-twenties, U.S. slaves were well into the normal

range and Trinidad-born slaves were borderline normal. Thus it appears

that the diet that U. S. slaves received when they began working at

adult tasks was good enough not only to sustain their work effort but

to permit a substantial degree of catch-up growth as well. In the case of

Trinidad slaves, however, the diet appears to have been inadequate to

permit the same degree of catch-up, given the character of the physical

environment.

        Figure 2 suggests that nutritional deficiencies of early child-

hood, rather than the overwork or underfeeding of adults, was the main

cause of the relatively high death rate of U.S. slaves. This possibility

is supported by available data on the death rates. Figure 3 indicates

that it was excess death rates of slave children under 5 that accounted

for the difference between the overall death rates of U.S. slaves and

U.S. whites during the late antebellum era. Moreover, the fact that U.S.

slaves and whites had similar life expectations after age 20 suggests

that it was not the general virulence of the disease environment but

conditions specific to young children. J. Campbell's (1984) examination

of a large cotton plantation in Georgia revealed a correlation between

 the infant death rate and the intensity with which planters worked pregnant

women. Steckel (19844 has also found evidence that overwork of pregnant

 women increased the stillbirth and neonatal death rates. His examination

 of the monthly pattern of a sample     of   such deaths indicated that these

 rates were highest among the babies of women whose first trimester coin-

 cided with the planting season and who were in their third trimester when

 the peak period of harvesting occurred.

         The small heights at ages 2.5 and 3.5 suggest not only that

 fetal malnutrition was prevalent but that chronic undernourishment was

 widespread during infancy and early childhood. Breastfeeding of slave

 babies was common throughout the South, but its average duration is

 uncertain. On some of the larger plantations most of the infants may

 have been at least partially weaned within 3 or 4 months. Plantation

 records which describe the diets of weaned infants and young children

 suggest that it was ample in calories but low in protein. Cruels and

porridges, usually made with cornmeal and sometimes containing milk, were

a common fare. After age 3 these were supplemented to some extent by

vegetable soups more likely to contain lard than meat, potatoes,

molasses, grits, hominy and cornbread. These more balanced diets con-

tributed to catch-up growth between ages 3 and 8, although even the

eight-year-olds were still quite short by modern standards (Fogel, 1985).

Both the available descriptions of the diets of young children and the

small stature of children, especially those under age 3, are consistent

with the evidence on protein deficiency culled from the antebellum

medical reports by Kiple and King (1981). They argue that frequent

descriptions   of the "glistening fat and corpulent paunches" of young
children, the frequent listing of "dropsy" and "swelling" as a cause
of death, and the concern of southern physicians with "the distention
of slave children's stomachs," suggest that kwashiorkor or prekwashiorkor
was prevalent.

         In Trinidad as in the U.S. the exceedingly small stature of

slaves under 3 suggests intra-uterine malnutrition of fetuses. But

in the case of Trinidad consumption of alcohol during pregnancy, which

retards fetal development and induces a number of other abnormalities

that are referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, may have been a

complicating factor. On sugar plantations liberal rations of rum were

usually provided to slaves, especially during harvest time.

Thus although the absence     of catch-up growth before
                                -56-



age 3 may indicate that the early childhood diet was very low in

protein, it could also reflect the residual effect of Fetal Alcohol

Syndrome. However, since Trinidad slaves had a weaker adolescent growth

spurt and a lower final height than U.S. slaves, the nutrients available

for adolescent growth were obviously less in Trinidad than in the slave

South. Not only was the nutrient intake of Trinidad slaves relatively

low, but the more virulent disease environment of Trinidad undoubtedly

exercised relatively greater claims against that intake. It is doubtful

that adult slaves in Trinidad could have worked harder than U.S. slaves;

the nutrient value of their diet would not permit it (Sheridan, 1985).

But in combination, the claims of work and disease and the disfunctions

caused by alcohol appear to have left Trinidad slaves with a lower net

nutrition to sustain an adolescent growth spurt than U.S. slaves.

        There are no measurements of the stature of the

poor London boys during infancy or early childhood, but their heights

between ages 13 and 16 are one to two inches less than those of

Trinidad-born slaves of the same ages. Moreover, the adult height of

the English laborers who formed the pooi from which the Royal Marines were

recruited was about one inch less than the adult height of the Trinidad-

born slaves. It thus appears likely that some combination of intra-

uterine malnutrition, poor weaning diet, and an adolescent diet inadequate

to sustain catch-up growth (under the conditions of their environment)

stunted the physical development of poor English boys between 1750

and 1800.   When Tanner assessed this evidence (1981, p. 158)
                                   —57—




  he said that the causes of such short stature, which persisted into

  adulthood without an acute retardation of the teenage growth spurt,


           have to be sought in early childhood and even the fetal period..
           Severe malnutrition of the pregnant mother followed by chronic
           and severe undernutrition of the infant could cause this
           result. More likely still is a low birthweight and/or a
           low weight gain in infancy caused by injurious substances
           breathed or eaten by the pregnant mother and the newborn
           child.

The substances to which he referred are opium, laudanuin, and morphia which
he pointed out were the ingredients of popular patent medicines for

children and which are thought to have been widely used by working

mothers unaware of their contents to keep their children quiet while they

worked at hotne or in factories. When these "elixirs" and "cordials" were

administered from birth   they often led to a permanent stillness.
3.3   Evidence From Regressions Between Height and Mortality

         Table 9 revealed a strong correlation between height and mortality

in Trinidad. This relationship has been investigated further by John (1984)

who ran a series of logit regressions relating the probability of dying be-

tween 1813 and 1815 to a number of variables including height. Among

adults and children      under age 15, the elasticity of the death

rate with respect to height averaged about       _l.4.0

The effect of height on the death rate appears to have been greater

among young children than adults, and on males than on females.

There are reasons for believing that the effect of height (or length)

on mortality rates would be greatest for infants, especially neonates,

although this proposition cannot be tested against the Trinidad sample

because both infants and infant deaths were undercounted by margins that
                                             -58-




render them of little use.

        Floud (1983b) has assembled data for eight European nations

over the years from 1880 to 1970 which permit an examination of the

relationship between adult male height and mortality.11 Equations

(2) and (3) present the results of regressions which related both

the crude death rates and infant mortality rates to height (numbers

in parentheses are t      values)

                           =      0.96;      N = 64


       where

               C =      the    crude death rate per thousand

               I =      the       infant mortality rate per thousand

               H =      adult      male height measured in centimeters

               Y =      per    capita income measured in U.S. dollars of 1970

               T =      time      (year      =   1880)
                    = a hat over a variable indicates the natural logarithm
                        of that variable

        From these equations it can be seen that a one percent increase in

height was associated with a change in infant mortality rates that was

three times as large as the corresponding change in crude mortality rates.

In both equations height has an independent effect on mortality rates, even

after controlling for per capita income and time.                   Indeed, the addition

of time to these regressions had virtually no effect                           on the
                                      —S9-



coefficients of height, although it reduced the coefficient on per

capita    income in equation (2)    by   more than half, and in equation (1)
it made   the coefficient of per capita income statistically insignificant.

Equation (2) implies that the decline in heights accounted for 39

percent of the decline in the infant mortality rate and per capita

income accounted for another 27 percent, leaving only about 33 percent

attributable to the unknown factors which are measured by time.12

          There is a question regarding the interpretation that should

be placed on the coefficients of height and per capita income when both

are included in the regression. Steckel's (1983) analysis suggests that

when per capita income is held constant, height becomes a proxy for the

degree of inequality in the income distribution. His regression on adult

height implies that a one percent change in the Gini ratio (holding the

level of income constant) had about four times as large an effect on

mean   heights   as a one percent change in the level of per capita income

(holding the Gini ratio constant).

          Equations (2) and   (3)   suggest that height and income together were

only about half as important in explaining the decline in the crude death

rate between 1880 and 1970 as in explaining the decline in infant death

rates in the eight countries covered by these equations. Even this last

statement tends to exaggerate the effect of improvements in income and

nutrition on the decline in adult mortality rates since infant death rates

represent as much as a quarter of the crude death rate in high mortality regimens

such as those which existed in Europe during the nineteenth century.

Of course the crude death rate is a poor proxy for life expectation

since it is so sensitive to variations in age structure. Nevertheless,
                                  -60-




 when considered in conjunction with the Trinidad regressions, equations

 (2) and (3) add to the evidence that the mortality rates of infants and

 very young children are much more sensitive to nutritional status than
                                              13
 the mortality rates of adolescents and adults.



                            4. Discussion

         In combination, the several pieces of evidence make a fairly

 strong case for the view that nutritional status had a significant im-

pact on mortality rates. Yet even those scholars who are skeptical of

nutritional arguments acknowledge that nutrition is a relevant consider-

ation. The real issues are the size of the nutritional contribution

to the long-term decline in mortalIty and the' locus of its impact. Much

work remains before it will be nossible to provide an adequate resolution

of these issues. But t believe that a provisional estimate of the

nutritional contributioh is possible and might be useful.



4.1. A Provisional Estimate of Improvements in Nutritional
      Status on the Long-Term Decline in Mortality

         I will first estimate the impact of improvements in nutritional

status on non-infants. Because of the absence of data a more indirect

approach is required for infants. This illustrative calculation will

be applied to the British case.
                                 -61-




        Let us begin by supposing that the nutrition of lower class

English males of c. 1800 had been improved to the point that they were

able to achieve modern stature. Then their mean final height would have

increased from 64.5 to 69.5 inches, which is an increase of 7.75 percent.

How much of an impact would such an improvement in nutritional status have

had on mortality? As previously noted, the Trinidad sample revealed

that the elasticity of the death rate of non-infants with respect to

height is about -1.4. Hence, a 7.75 percent increase in the final

height of males would have reduced the non-infant death rate by about

11 percent (-1.4 x 7.75 =—lO.85).

        The   Trinidad registrations undercounted mortality so badly
that they cannot be 'used to estimate reliably the elasticity of infant
mortality   with respect to height. We can circumvent this problem by

using the schedule that relates neonatal death rates to birth weight.14

The probability of dying at given birth weights is very high at weights

below 2,501 grams (5.5 pounds). The schedule which, relates the proba-

bility of dying to bir'thweight is stable below 2,501 grams. It varies

          Mean birth weights vary greatly with the nutritional status of

 populations (Eveleth and Tanner, 1976; WHO, 1980). This point is

 illustrated in Figure 5. The lines on this graph are normal approximations

 of the frequency distributions of birth weights.16 Birth weight is

 represented on the vertical axis, and the horizontal axis represents z

 scores (deviations of birthweight from the mean measured in units of the

standard deviation). Hence, the cumulative frequency distribution is

represented by a straight line. The lowest line represents the distribution

of U.S. non-whites in 1960. They had a mean birth weight of 3,128

grams   and, as indicated by Figure. 5,   about 13 percent of the neonates

weighed   less   than 2,501 gxams at bir;h. The second line is the distribution

of birth weights for lower class women in Bombay (Jayant,1964);        Figure 5
indicates the mean birth weight in this population was just 2,525 grams. In this

case nearly half (46 percent) of the births were below the critical level,

although the women in the sample were not the lowest of the low.

          The third curve is my estimate of the probable distribution of
                                                       17
the birth weights of the children of London poor c.1800. In deriving

this distributioji I employed established correlations between height

and birth weight as well as both published and unpublished information
                                                                     18
on the heights of the London poor developed by Floud and Wachter.         It

is probable that the distribution of the birth weightS of the     London poor

in c.lSOOhada mean of 2,276 grams, which is about 249 grams (about

a half pound )below the avenge in the deliveries of the lower class

women in Bombay. It follows that about 79 percent of the births     among
the London poor of c. 1800 wre at weights below 2,501 grams.19

       The implication of this distribution of birth weights is
revealed by Table 10. Column 2 represents the actual schedule of

neonatal death rates by weight for non-white U.S. males in 1950 and

Column 3 gives the actual distribution of their birth weights. The

product of these two columns yields an implied neonatal death rate of

26.8 per 1,000 which, of course, was also the actual death rate.          If,

however, this U.S. population had had the distribution of the birth

weights of the London poor of c. 1800 which I have estimated, their

neonatal death rate ;ould have been 173.0 per thousand (see Column 3).

The implication of Table 10 is that improvements in nutrition sufficient

to have shifted the mean birth weight from 2,276 grams to 3,128 grams

would have reduced the infant death rate by 86 percent 1 -          (48.94-

           Equation 5 can be used to estimate the overall contribution of

improvements in nutritional status to the decline in English mortality

nutritional    status accounted for about 42 percent of
the total decline in the age-standardized English mortality rate since

1800. This figure is neither inconsequential nor everything. It shows

that although improvements in nutrition made a substantial contribution

to the decline in English mortality, other factors accounted for the

majority of the decline. The main impact of the nutritional contribution

was on the infant death rate. The reduction in non-infant deaths that

may be attributed to nutrition account for just 12 percent of the total

decline in English mortality since 1800.23 Plausible upper and lower

bounds on the variables in equation (5) indicate that 42     10 probably

bounds the nutritional contribution at all ages.    It should be empha-

sized that these figures refer not merely to the diet but also to the

other factors that affected the nutrients available for growth.24

4.2 A Possible Explanation for the Peerage Paradox

          Although the calculation suggests a more modest role for nu-

trition than some have argued, other scholars may find even four tenths

is much too high a number, since the question about the peerage is still

unanswered. If nutrition was so imponant, why did the English peerage

have virtually the same mortality as the general population until the

middle of the eighteenth century? And why did life expectation of peers

improve   so rapidly after 1750 when no great change in their diet is
apparent?
          Two points seem relevant here. Nutrition does not have an equal

influence on the outcome of every disease. Table 11 classifies diseases

according to whether nutritional status is likely to influence tneir out-

come. The point to notice is that the diseases on which nutritional in-

fluence is minimal were probably the greatest killers before 1700 (McNeill,

1976). For reasons still unclear, the prevalence of these diseases

declined between 1600 and 1800, and the main infectious diseases became

those in which the influence of nutrition is large. Consequently it is

 unlikely that improvements in nutrition had as large an impact on the

  level of mortality before 1700 as it had afterwards.

          The second point is that investigators searching for the poss-

 ible influence of nutrition on the longevity of peers appear to have

 dwelt on the wrong issue: the diet of adults. As we have seen, nutrition

 has its greatest impact on the mortality of infants, not of adults. The

 fact that dukes and earls ate well as adults does not mean they were

 well nourished in infancy or in early childhood. Weanling peers of the

 eighteenth century did not eat joints of beefs but like weanling peasants,

 dined on a pap or watery gruel. During this era privilege and wealth did

 not insure a diet or a nutritional status for the upper class infants and

 young children that was better than that experienced by the conunon people.

 Although the housing, clothing, and personal care of upper class infants

 probably was better than that received by their lower class counterparts,

 these advantages do not appear to have affected the infant and early child-

 hood mortality rates of the peerage during the first half of the eighteenth

 century. Examination of the Hollingsworth (1977) mortality schedules

 indicates that 60 percent of the increase in life expectation between the

 cohorts of 1700-24 and of 1900-24 was due to the decline in deaths under

 age 10. Indeed if the peerage had continued to suffer the10Q0 value of

 1700-24 in 1900-24, but experienced the improved mortality rates of the

twentieth century at all other ages, then the life expectancy of the
peers (both sexes combined) born during 1900-24 would not have been

 65.0 but only 46.4.

        This finding suggests that the peerage did benefit from improved

nutritional status during infancy, the weaning years, and perhaps in

utero. Several new questions now come to the fore:    Did noble womefl

consume large amounts of alcohol during their preg1ancy? Was it fash-

ionable in the court during some
                                   periods for pregnant women to keep their
                                —70—

weight gain low? To what extent did the weaning diet of peers expose

then to virulent infections from contaminated water or raw milk and

when did this risk diminish? Research into these issues should, of

course, be extended to cover the experience of the lower as well as

of the upper classes.

4.3. The Wrigley/Schofield/Lee Paradox

         In interpreting the regressions between mortality rates and

wheat prices, it has often been assumed that the price of wheat was so

highly correlated with all other grain prices that it could serve as a

proxy for the price of food. It has also been assumed that food shortages

would be reflected in their price. Although the second assumption is

quite reasonable, it does not follow that a large rise in prices necessarily

implies an equally large decline in the supply of food. That would be

the case only if the demand elasticity for food was one. The demand

elasticity for a food that was a small part of the diet, such as lamb

chops or buckwheat, might be equal to or greater than one. But since

grains as a whole probably accounted for 75 percent or more of the

consumption of English calories during the eighteenth century, they

must have had a very low elasticity of demand.


        Table 12 shows the decline in the quantity of grain implied by a

given price rise under various values of C,   the   demand elasticity. For

a food as vital as grains were, cwas probably below 0.25, and perhaps

even as low as 0.1. It follows that even the so-called !FextrenelP

fluctuations in grain prices (20 percent or more above trend) were prob-

ably between 2 and 5 percent below the trend. If that is so, then even

the weak relationship between mortality and wheat prices found by various

investigators is consistent with the nutritional case. Their regressions

imply that mortality rose even when declines in the supply of food were

quite small. The fact that their regressions revealed any connection

between mortality and grain prices is all the more remarkable, since the

dependent variable was dominated by non-infant deaths which are much

less sensitive to nutritional status than infant deaths.25

      Europe and America


       The long and sustained upward movements in physical growth

schedules in Europe and the United States that began late in the nine-

teenth century and continued through most of the twentieth century were

a sharp break with the past. Before the last quarter of the nineteenth

century, only the United States had experienced a long period of rela-

tively rapid upward movement in growth schedules, with most of it

occurring before 1710. Between cohorts born in 1710 and in 1780 final

heights of native-born white American males increased at a rate of only

0.25 centimeters per decade.26 During the next century the final heights

of Americans oscillated in a narrow band or declined fairly sharply,

losing about 3 centimeters in just two decades beginning with cohorts

born about 1835. Rapid upward shifts in growth schedules probably did

not resume until the last decade of the nineteenth century. The new

period of increase in final heights which lasted for about 60 years was

more rapid than the increase experienced during the late seventeenth and

early eighteenth centuries (Sokoloff and Villaflor, 1982; Margo and

Steckel, 1983; Fogel etal, 1983; Fishman and Walker, 1984).

        The principal upward shift in English growth schedules before

1900 came later and was shorter than that experienced in the United

States. The mean final height of English working-class males born

c.1760 was about 64.5 inches (which was about 9 centimeters below those

of U.S. whites) and remained more or less at that level for the next half

century. The succession of cohorts born between c.18l5 and c.1840 appears

to have experienced a fairly rapid upward shift in growth schedules,

so that the final heights of the c.1840 cohort was about 4 centimeters

taller than the c.lSlS cohort. Thereafter, the upward shift in growth
                                     -73.



schedules slowed down so that the final heights of cohorts born half a

century later were only about a centimeter taller than their c. 1840

counterparts (Sokoloff and Villaflor, 1982; Floud and Wachter, 1982;

Floud and Wachter, 1983; Floud, 1983a; Floud, l983b).

         There were also relatively constant growth curves for France

between c.l820 and c.l900, and for Belgium between c.1830 and c.l900.

In both countries heights at age 20 remained below 65.5 inches down

through the end of the nineteenth century (Flóud, 1983b). In the

Netherlands and the Scandanavian countries the laboring classes appear

to have experienced improved living conditions sometime during the third

quarter of the nineteenth century. In the case of the Netherlands, for

example, mean adult heights between 1865 and 1905 increased at about

1 cm per decade, which is about 5 tines as large as the British rate of

increase during the same period. Even so, the Dutch rate of increase

during the late nineteenth century was only half as great as the rate

of increase during the half century following World War I (Van Wieringen,
        27
1978)

             A1though the standard of living of the laboring classes in the

United States was quite high early in the nineteenth century by European

standards, it appears that the difference narrowed considerably over

the course of the nineteenth century, partly because U.S. height declined

for nearly half a century and partly because the heights of Europeans

increased somewhat. At the end of the nineteenth century when the United

States entered a new phase of rapid upward shift in growth curves, living

standards for U.S. workers, as measured by final heights, were quite sim-

ilar to those prevailing in Northwestern Europe, but they were still sig-

nificantly better than those of Southern Europe. As late as 1900 the

mean height      of adult Italian males was below 65 inches (Terrenato and
Ulizzi, 1983).
                                    -74-




In    recent decades economists and economic historians have tended to

assume   that if the   "real waget' (an index of nominal wages divided by

an    index •of prices) was rising, then the standard of living of workers
was    rising. Beginning with the late nineteenth century, but especially
after    1930 when large investments were made in the gathering of wage

and price data, older measures of the standard of living, such as height,

weight, housing conditions, and mortality rates began to be abandoned in

favor of the newer and presumably mote comprehensive index. Numerous

criticisms have been made of the quality of the data from which long-

term series of real wages were constructed (Von Tunzelmann, 1979;

Thirsk, 1983), and far-reaching questions have been raised about what

"real wages" actually measured, even when the indexes were ideally

constructed (A.J. Taylor, 1975). Nevertheless, the tendency of economists

and historians has been to employ "real wages" not just as a measure (or

even as the principal measure) of the standard of living but sometimes

to convert it into a synonym for the standard of living.

           The point is not that "real-wage" measures should be discarded

but that the interpretation that has been placed on them needs to be

reconsidered. We may be able to obtain a deeper understanding of the

changing standard of living of workers, develop a subtler appreciation

of the manifold dimensions of the phenomenon, if the information em-

bodied in both real-wage indexes and measures of per capita income is

reviewed in the light of the information contained in anthropometric

measures, mortality and morbidity rates, and other measures of living

conditions that are now becoming available.

           IThat, for example, are we to make of a situation in which real

wages were rising rapidly, as apparently occurred in England during the
                                   —75—



 last   half of the nineteenth century    (Mitchell and Deane, 1962;   Matthews

 et al, 1982) while working class heights remained at relatively low

 levels, showing little increase over half a century? How should we

 characterize conditions of workers in the United States between 1820

 and 1860 if "real wages" were generally constant or rising, sometimes

 rising quite rapidly (Williamson, 1976; David and Solar, 1977), but

 heights and life expectation were decreasing? During an era in which

 from 50 to 75 percent of the income of workers was spent on food1 is it

 plausible that the overall standard of living of workers was improving

 if their nutritional status and life expectations were declining? These

 are not questions that can easily be resolved and I will not attempt to

 do so here. Rather, I want briefly to sketch some of the new issues about

 the course of the standard of living that are suggested by the anthro-

pometric and demographic data. When "real wages," per capita income, and

other measures all move in the same direction there is little need to

probe into their exact meaning. The interesting issues arise when the

measures diverge, and it is on some of these issues that I wish to focus.

           The evidence so far developed on height and mortality rates

suggests that improvements in the living conditions of workers during

the nineteenth éentury may have been more sporadic and uneven (both in

time and among subgroups of workers) than is suggested by indexes of

real wages or the movements in per capitadneome.        In England the

period of rapid improvement in nutritional status of workers

seems to have been confined largely to the three decades following the

end of the Napoleonic wars. In France there was little change from

the end of the Napoleonic wars until the beginning of the twentieth

century. In the United States, the nutritional status of the laboring

classe, which was initially quite high by European standards, appears

to have deteriorated during the middle decades ot.the nineteenth

century.
                                -76-


        Although the substantial declines in both heights and life

expectation shown by Figure 1 are too new and provisional to be accepted

without substantial additional evidence, let us suppose for the moment

that further investigation supports the provisional findings. Will

these series then contradict prevailing estimates of rapid increases

in per capita income? Since Williamson and Linden (1980) have pro-

vided weighty evidence that the inequality in the income distribution

increased during this period, the answer is that they probably will not.

Quite the contrary, by combining the prevailing estimates of per capita

income with the information in the series on heights it is possible to

obtain a measure of the magnitude of the increase in inequality during

the middle quarters of the nineteenth century. Steckel's (1983) anal-

ysis of the relationship between mean final height, per capita income,

and the Cmi coefficient reveals that with respect to final heights an

increase of 100 percent in per capita income would just offset an in-

crease in the Cmi ratio of 0.066. It follows that current estimates

of the increase in per capita income and the estimated decline in mean

heights of 1.5 inches together indicate that the Cmi ratio increased

by about 0.17, going from perhaps 0.30 in c.l830 (the current figure

for Australia) to about 0.47, which is a plausible estimate of the Cmi

ratio for the U.S. near the turn of the twentieth century (Sawyer, 1976;

Williamson and Linden, 1980). Thus the decline in final heights of

native-born U.S. white males appears to add to the evidence recently

developed by others which suggests that the middle quarters of the nine-

teenth century witnessed significant but not remarkable increases in

the inequality of the American income distribution (Williamson and Lindert,

1980; Pessen, 1973).
                                 -77-

       It may seem odd to those unfanilar with this body of evidence

that changes in height should be used as a measure of changes in the

inequality of the distributions of income and wealth. However, as

Floud and Wachter (1982) have recently pointed out, there was a time

when height was the most compelling and the most widely used index of in-

equality. Moreover, because of the abundance of height data and their

wide coverage of geographic regions and socioeconomic groups it is possible

to probe more deeply into vexing issues regarding variations in the con-

ditions of the population of particular regions and occupations than has

so far been possible with wage data which are skimpy in their coverage of

particular categories. Two examples suggest the possibilities that now

appear to be opening up.

        The first is drawn from the work on British sources. Data re-

cently collected by Floud on the British upper classes (1984) when com-

bined with his data on the laboring poor make it possible to estimate how

much of the improvement in the average nutritional status in Great Britain

over the past century and a half has been due to a closing of the gap between

the upper and lower classes and how much was due to an upward shift in

attainable average height. By "attainable" I mean not genetically attainable

but, within genetic constraints, attainable under the mpst favorable pre-

vailing socioeconomic circumstances. Floud's research indicates that about
 two-thirds of the increase in the mean final height of British males since

 c. 1830 was due to the decrease in class differentials in height and

 the balance to an upward shift in the mean final heights of the upper

 class (which may be taken as a measure of the attainable mean height at

 any point in
                time).28 In this connection it is worth noting that Sweden

 and Norway, which have two of the lowest after-tax Cmi ratios, are the

 only countries in which height differentials by socioeconomic class have

 disappeared (Sawyer, 1976; Lindgren, 1976;   Brundtland et al, 1980). The

 means of adult height in these nations now exceed those of high-Gmni-ratio
                                 -78-


 nations, such as the U.S. and Great Britain, by several centimeters (U.S.

 But. Cen., 1983).

        The second example pertains to the effect of urbanization on

changes in inequality. Previous research has revealed an association

between the increase in the inequality of the American distributions of

income and wealth during the nineteenth century and urbanization (Soltow,

1971; R. Gallman, 1969). Analysis of the height data in the samples drawn

from the Union and the regular army rolls supports this finding but calls

attention to the other mechanisms at work. Figure 6 shows the beginning

of the long downward trend in the aggregate series on native-born whites

(cf. Figure 1).   It also shows that when this series is disaggregated into

occupational and residential groups, the series for farmers exhibits a

rising trend until c.1830 and then declines for the next two cohorts.

The trend for urban laborers is basically flat at the beginning, rises

slightly between 1825 and 1830 and then declines. These curves indicate

that about 85 percent of the initial decline in the aggregate series

was due to a decline in the mean heights of farmers and other rural

residents. The balance of the decline in the aggregate series was

due to the increased proportion of the population experiencing the

poor nutritional and health conditions of the cities as well as to

declining heights among urban residents (Margo and Steckel, 1983;

Fishman and Walker, 1984).

        The deterioration in the mean final height of farmers apparent

in the last two cohorts of Figure 6 continued in subsequent decades.

Native-born farmers who were born c.1860 were about 1.5 inches shorter

than those who were born three decades earlier. Over the same period

the final heights of urban laborers declined by about 0.8 inches. Thus,

although deteriorating conditions in the cities and the shift of popu-

lation from the countryside to the cities played a role, they explain

only about one-fifth of the decline in the aggregate series shown in

 Figure 1 for cohorts born between c.1830 and c.1860. About four fifths

 of the decline was due to a deterioration of conditions affecting growth

 in the rural areas.
         Current research is aimed at explaining this surprising

  decline in rural heights. One possibility is that an increasing

 proportion of the native-born rural males were children of foreign-

 born parents. It is likely that foreign-born mothers were relatively

 malnourished during their own developmental years and that foreign-born

 parents generally had lower incomes than native-born parents. Both

 factors would have made the children of foreign-born parents shorter

 than the children of native-born parents. Support for this hypothesis

 is found in a subsample of the Union Army recruits which has been linked

 to the manuscript schedules of the 1860 census. This subsample reveals

 that in the rural areas native-born males of foreign parents were 0.4

 inches shorter in final height than native-born males of native-born

parents. The effect of parental ethnicity was even greater in the

cities, with children of foreign-born parents averaging 1.2 inches less

in final heights than children of native-born parents. It thus appears

that the low incomes of foreign-born parents and the malnourishment of

foreign-born mothers had an effect on children both in the cities and

in the countryside, but that effect was greater in the cities than in

the countryside. It is plausible that as much as half of the urban-

rural differential in native-born heights was associated with parental
           29
ethnicity.

        The decline of heights in the rural areas is puzzling, since

the ethnic effect could only have accounted for a small share of the

rural decline. Another possibility is that exposure of farmers to

disease increased as farming pushed into   swampy areas in

the northern states that were by-passed during the earlier waves of

farm settlement. There is also the possibility that part of the decline

is a statistical artifact.   It may be that children of the
                                  -81-



farm families who enlisted during the peacetime years of the early

1880s came on average from poorer families than those who enlisted
                        30.
during the wartime years. On the other hand, the mean height of

the native-born population as estimated from the recruits who

joined the regular army during the peacetime years of 1850-1855 was

68.1 inches, which is just a tenth of an inch below the corresponding

figure for the Union army (Sokoloff, 1982).

                              5. Conclusion

        The decline in mortality rates since 1700 is one of the

greatest events of human history.    I was inclined to say "one of

the greatest achievements of humankind," but the fact remains

that we still do not know how much of that achievenent was due to

human intervention and how much was due to causes beyond human

control. The paper published by McKeown and Brown in 1955 marked

a turning point in the effort to provide a warranted explanation of

the decline in mortality. Bridging the worlds of social. scientists

and of medical specialists, they brought into the discussion most

of the range of issues that have been under debate for the past

three decades. That debate not only defined the issues more

clearly than previously, but also revealed that the critical

differences were quantitative rather than qualitative. Nearly all

the specialists agree on the range of factors that were responsible

for the decline in mortality but they have had quite different views

about the relative importance of each of the factors.
                                      —82—




            The unresolved issue, therefore, is not really whether a par-

    ticular factor was involved in the decline, but how much each of the

    various factors contributed to the decline. Resolution of the issue is

    essentially an accounting exercise of a particularly complicated nature,
-
    which involves not only measuring the direct effect of particular factors

    but also their indirect effects and their interactions with other factors.

    Our preliminary investigations indicate that the construction of data sets

    rich enough to permit such complex accounting is critical to the successful

    outcome of the exercise. What is needed is a data set that can cope

    with the changes in the cause-of-death structure which, as Preston (1976)

    indicated, has varied significantly over time and place. To identify

    the locus of influences of each of the principal factors that contributed

    to the decline we need not only desease-specific but age-specific, and

    generation-specific information, because the influence of both risk-

    increasing and risk-averting factors appear to vary markedly both over

    lifetimes and over generations.

           The findings on the extent and the locus of the nutritional

    contribution presented in this paper are preliminary in two respects.

    First, we anticipate that more complete data will lead to revisions in

    the estimates we have presented. Second, nutrition is only the first

    of numerous other factors which contributed to the mortality decline in

    America since 1700 that we hope to measure. Our preliminary results

    indicate that the contribution of improvements in nutritional status was

    neither inconsequential nor overwhelming; although it made a substantial

    contribution, the factors which contributed to the majority of the decline

    are still unmeasured. Moreover, although our preliminary estimates in-

    dicate that improvements in nutritional status nay have accounted for

    about four-tenths     of the mortality decline, this contribution was
                                   -83—


confined largely to the reduction in infant deaths, particularly to late

fetal   and neonatal deaths. The concentration of the impact of improved
nutrition in this age group raises the possibility that increases in
diarrhea   and other diseases which divert ingested nutrients from growth,

rather than a decline in food intake, was the main cause of the decline

in nutritional status and the rise in mortality during the middle decades

of the nineteenth century.
         The preliminary results not only indicate that the factors

contributing to the unanticipated cycles in heights and mortality were

concentrated at particular ages but that the routes of influences might

have been quite round about. In commenting on this paper at the Williansburg

conference, Paul David suggested that urbanization could have contributed

to the decline in rural nutrition, and to the possible rural increase in nor-

tality,by exporting pollution into the rural counties immediately surrounding

them. Using Chicago as a case in point, he noted that the direction of

the Chicago River was reversed so that it emptied into the Mississippi

River, carrying city waste with it, instead of into Lake Michigan. Ag-

ricultural historians have called my attention to the extensive draining

of rural swamp lands during the last two-thirds of the nineteenth century,

especially in the central states, which might have impaired the health and

nutritional status not only of rural adults, but of their children who

became more exposed to water-borne diseases that diverted nutrients

from growth.

         These possibilities point to new issues in the standard-of-

living controversy. If David is correct it may turn out that the diff-

iculties created by the rapidly growing cities carried over into the
                                 -84-




rural regions surrounding the cities, so that urban disamenities imposed

costs on the rural populations that have not yet been measured (cf.

Williamson, 198la; Williamson, 198lb; Williamson, 1982;   Pollard, 1981). In the


American case it is difficult to believe that per capita food consumption

was declining during the last two-thirds of the nineteenth century since

there is so much evidence pointing in the opposite direction (Towne and

Rasmussen, 1960; Gallman, 1960; Bennett and Pierce, 1961). Yet there

      have been more unequal distribution of food products, especially

of meat, which adversely affected the nutritional status of the poor.

This appears to have been the case with blacks whose nutritional intake

apparently declined, and whose mortality increased, between 1860 and

1880 (Meeker, 1976; Fogel and Engerman, 1974; Atwater and Woods, 1897;

Frissell and Bevier, 1899; U.S. Dept. Lab., 1897). A more subtle and

possibly more pervasive effect on the living standards of laborers and

their families, both in the cities and the countryside, may have come from

increased exposure to risks not captured or only partially cap-

tured by current measures of real wages) that more than offset the rises

in consumption. This possibility does not invalidate indexes of real

wages which were designed to cope with a specific set of issues. Rather

it raises new issues which require new measures, measures that will supple-

ment the information obtained from the older ones.

          The new findings suggest that much more attention needs to be

given to the way that population pressures, urbanization and other economic

factorsaffected not just those of working age but the very young. It
may well be that the main damage to the standard of living of workers
occurred   at exceedingly young ages, in ways that no one at the time fully

appreciated, and in a manner that does not conform well to current scenarios

regarding the factors and     .individuals responsible for the        hardships
                                -85-




of working-class life during the nineteenth century. Nutritional insults

delivered early in life not only appear to have affected adult health and

longevity, but significantly reduced the later productivity of those who

recovered from early insults (cf. Fogel et al, 1983).



        The search for data sources capable of dealing with buth the

new and the old issues on the interrelationship between demographic

and socioeconomic variables has gained considerable force in recent

years. Scholars have pushed in many different directions, and nearly

all of the work has borne fruit. Careful examination of published

data on disease-specific causes of death in U.S. cities have revealed

that expenditures on sewers and waterworks had a relatively small effect

on the decline in urban mortality before the beginning of the twentieth

century (Condran and Crimmins-Gardner, 1978), that the main diseases

in which rural death rates were consistently lower than urban death

rates in 1890 axid 1900 were those which are nutritionally sensitive, and

that the urban-rural differential was greater for infants and young

children than for older persons (Condran and Criminins, 1980). Close

examination of these published sources have revealed subtle aspects of

the mortality structures (Preston, 1976) and of influences upon them

that were not adequately appreciated in the past. Condran and Cheney

(1982), for example, have found that in Philadelphia during 1870-1930,

medical intervention was effective, despite the absence of "high-tech"

chemotherapy, because of the role of medical personnel in spreading

knowledge about the environmental sources of diseases and in isolating

carriers of diseases. Among the more suggestive findings of these

recent studies of published data was the discovery by Higgs (1979) of
                                -86-




marked cycles, around a declining trend, in the mortality rates of 18

large American cities between 1871 and 1900 that is strongly associated

with variations in the rate of immigration.3'

        Work on the manuscript sources is still at an early stage, but

as the studies by Wrigley and Schofield (1983), Preston and van de Walle

(1978), 1-James (1983) and Preston and Haines (1983) have already indicated,

these sources will not only permit us to push the empirical analysis of

the causes of the decline in mortality further back in time but also to

shed light on factors that are not apparent in published data. Linked

micro data sets will make it possible to disentangle factors that are

intricately convoluted in aggregate data. The ability to measure the

separate and joint effects of diet, claims on nutritional intake, medical

practices, public sanitation, and intergenerational transmission of be-

havioral patterns will not only illuminate the past but will directly

contribute to a better understanding of important issues in current

economic and social policies.

        *This paper is a progress report on two projects jointly spon-

sored by the National Bureau of Economic Research and by the Center for

Population Economics of the University of Chicago. Aspects of the research

reported here were supported by grants from the National Science Foundation;

the Social Science Research Council, London; the British Academy; the

exxon Educational Foundation; the Walgreen Foundation; Brigham Young

University; the University of California at Berkeley; Harvard University;

Ohio State University; the University of Pennsylvania; Princeton Uni-

versity; the University of Rochester; and Stanford University. I have

drawn on the work of fellow collaborators in the two projects including

S.L. Engerinan, R. Floud, C. Friedman, C.D. Goldin, R.A. Margo, C. Pope,

K. Sokoloff, R.H. Steckel, T.J. Trussell, C. Villaflor, K.W. Wachter,

and L. Wimmer. J. Bourne, M. Fishmari, J. Moen, and J. Walker have been

effective.research assistants and have permitted me to draw on material in their

own papers. A.M. John has generously made material from her study of

Trinidad available to me, and D. Levy permitted me to cite some of the

results of his study of life expectation in colonial Maryland.       I am especially

indebted to J.M. Tanner for his encouragement and advice since the

beginning of both projects and to P.11. Lindert for insightful comments

and criticisms and for the correction of several errors in the draft presented
at the Williamsburg conference.
        nt   earlier   vcrsion of this paper was commissioned by Gunter

Steinmann and other organizers of the "Conference on Economic Consequences

of Population Change in Industrialized Countries," which was held in

Paderborn, West Germany, during June 1983. Successive versions of the

paper were presented to seminars at Caltech, the London School of Economics,

the Graduate Institute of International Studies (Geneva), Harvard, Chicago,

Birkbeck College, Minnesota, Northwestern, Pennsylvania, Princeton, Toronto,

and Rochester. Numerous revisions were made as a consequence of points

        2The principal disadvangtage of an emphasis on whole books is

that a single aberrant book will have a large influence on the whole

sample. Although such instances can be handled by reweighting, the

aberrations reduce the efficiency of the sample and diminish its use-

fulness for some purposes. This problem will diminish as the sample

size increases. The final sample will contain over a thousand books.




        3The mortality file is smaller than the family file partly

because a requirement far entry into that file is that both the birth

date and the death date of an individual is known. Non-bloodline spouses,

who are at risk only after their marriages, have not yet been integrated

into the mortality file. Their inclusion will increase the size of the

mortality file by about 25 percent.

        A family is defined by the existence of marriage, whether or not

the family produces progeny. Families with multiple marriages have
                                   —89—


not yet been integrated into the family file, but they are a relatively

small percent age of the families already in the file. Bloodline indi-

viduals who marry   will   appear in both their families of birth and   the
families formed by their marriages. The number of families suitable

for the computations of various statistics varies because of the com-

pleteness of information. For example, it is possible to compute total

births in completed families for about 77 percent of the families. In

most of the other 23 percent of the families, date of publication of the

genealogy preceded the end of the childbearing period Of families at

risk to have children. However, mothefl age at last birth can be computed

only for about 35 percent of the families since computation of this

statistic not only requires that the date of publication of a genealogy

follow the end of the childbearing period, but also requires information

on the date of birth of both the mother and    of   the last child.

        The small percentage of the individuals in the sample who have

been linked to economic information reflects the recent start on this

task. As of May, 1984 we had searched for economic information on only

20 percent of the individuals in the sample. In other words, so far

we have been able to obtain economic information on about 75 percent

of the individuals for which this information was sought.

        The Mormon Church was not founded until       1830.   The religious

objective behind the compilation of family group sheets required the

identification of ancestors who had not been Mormons. There are three

parts to the collection of family group sheets. The Main Section con-

sists of about 4,700,000 sheets submitted mainly before 1962 and

information qn about 25,000,000 individuals, only a small proportion of

whom are Mormons. The New Patrons Section was started in 1962 when members
                                     -90—


of the Mormon Church were asked to submit sheets on the most recent

four generations of their families. Their are about 1,000,000 sheets

in this part of the collection, and a fairly large proportion of the

individuals in these sheets are Mormons. The Old Patrons Section was

launched in 1924 and consists of any genealogical records held by

Church members that they desired to place on deposit in the Genealogical

Library. There are about 4,000,000 sheets in this part of the collection.

The DAB/CPE pilot sample of groups sheets is drawn from the Main Section.

           6Because the series of e10 is not yet controlled for the variables

that were controlled in producing the height series, considerable caution

needs to be exercised in interpreting leads and lags which are evident in

the two series of Figure 1.        See Fishman and Walker, 1984, for a more

detailed description of the height series. See Bourne et al, 1984, for

a more detailed description of the e10 series.


           7(This footnote will describe briefly the derivation of the two

curves in Figure 1. Cleaning and processing of the data are still in

progress so that the current version of Figure 1 is still provisional

and subject to change, as is the discussion of Figure 1).

        8Levy's life tables begin with age 25. The e10 values shown for

his data in Figure 1 were extrapolated to age 10, using the model West

tables of Coale and Demeny (1966)..


        9Levy also has a life table for 1650-1699 which was used to

establishthe location and slOpe of the line segment between 1715 and 1725

which shows the effect of a possible correction for the undercount of

southern observations in the genealogical sample employed in Figure 1.


        10The elasticity of the mortality rate with respect to height in

Trinidad was estimated from regressions (and the mean values of the

variables in these regressions) reported in a memorandum from Meredith

John to Robert W. Fogel dated November 30, 1983.   I used four of Johns

logit regressions relating the probability of surviiring to a series of vari-

ables including height. These regressions were for ma1es,age 15 (p.36),

females 3 age 15 (p. 39), males C age 15 (p. 42), females age C 15

(p. 43). The elasticities for these four groups (estimated over the

arc between the average height of each group of Trinidadians and the

current British height standard for the mean age of each group) were:

                              615= -2.00

                              6f<15 -1.54

                              6)lS -2.50

                              6f)l5
The average of these four elasticities (weighted by the share of each

group in the total population of Trinidad) was -1.57. If English pop-

ulation weights in 1801-OS are used (Wrigley and Sóhofieid, 1981,

p. 529), the average elasticity is -1.44 (the sex ratio was assumed

to be equal both above and below age 15,. since Wrigley and Schofield

do not give the sex ratio by age). U.S. population weights for 1980

(U.S. Bur. Cen. 1983, p. 33) yield an elasticity or -1.33. Population
                                     -92-


weights for England and Wales for 1851 and 1961 (Mitchell, 1975, p. 52)

yield elasticities of -1.41 and —1.32.

        The eight nations included in the Floud (1983b) study and

the dates covered are Belgium (1880-1969), Denmark (1880-1975), France

(1880-1960), Italy (1880—1952), Netherlands (1877-1970), Norway (1880-1960),

Sweden (1880-1961), and Switzerland (1884—1957).



        12
             Total differentiation of equation (3) yields:

                   (3.1)    I =   -15.9106H -0.3889Y -0.00837,

 where an asterisk over a variable indicates the rate of change in that

 variable. Regressions of the log of each of the variables in equations

 (2) and   (3)   on time yielded the following estimates of average annual

 rates of change:

                   Variable         Average annual
                                    rate of change('in percent


                       C             -1.05

                                     —2.51
                       I

                       Y              1.75




           It follows that height accounts for 39 percent (15.9106 x
                                                                     2.51 =
  0.0610      2.51 =   0.39), income for 27 percent (0.3889 x 1.75

  0.27),   and time for 33 percent (0.837 ; 2.51 = 33) of the average annual

  decline in the infant death rate.

        13The similarity between the results of equations 2 and 3 and

John's (1984) set of logit regressions on the probability of dying in

Trinidad should not obscure the significant differences in the nature

of the two sets of regressions. The Trinidad regressions related the

owj height of an individual to his or her probability of dying between

two points in time. Equation 3, on the other hand, relates the average

height of males (mainly in their early twentiesi to a nation's infant

death rate. When used in this way adult heights have only indirect

bearing on the nutritional status of infants. Since the adult heights

measure the nutritional status of males during the preceding two or

three decades, and since the mean nutritional status of a nation exhibits

high serial correlation, such a lagged measure of average nutritional

status may be a fairly good predictor of a nation's current nutritional

status especially during a period when the nutritional status of particular

nations has been changing in a fairly steady way. Adult heights also

have bearing on current infant mortality rates to the extent that they

indicate the nutritional circtcnstances of mothers during their develop-

mental years. When comparing several ñations,lagged measures may be a

good predictor of differences in current nutritional status if the

different nations had different starting levels and different rates of

change in nutritional status.


        14Neonatal deaths are those which occur within the first 28 days

of life. Perinatal deaths are late fetal deaths (generally of 20 or 28

weeks of gestational age) plus early neonatal deaths (generally deaths

during the first seven days after birth). In the U.S. and Great Britain

during the early l960s the distribution of infant deaths has been approx-

imately as follows (Shapiro et al, 1968):
                                 -94-              cumulative
                 days            percent           percentage

                  1                40                 40

                 2—7               25                 65

                 8-28               8                 73

                29—365             27                100

Late fetal deaths in Britain and the U.S. have recently been approximately

equal to neonatal deaths (U.S. Bur. Cen., 1983, p. 77). With infant

death rates in the neighborhood of 50-100 per thousand, neonatal deaths

are about35 to 60 percent of infant deaths (Shapiro, et al, 1968, Table 1;

Mata, 1978, Table 2.16; Ashworth, 1982; Bouvier and Tak, 1976). Wrigley

and Schofield, 1981, p. 97) estimate neonatal deaths in England during

the 17th and 18th centuries at about half of infant deaths.

        15               .

             However, in recent years new high-technology introduced into
maternity hospitals in the more developed nations has led to some

downward shift in this schedule, especially for births of less than 1,500

grains that are of early gestational age but not otherwise impaired

(Pharoah and Alberman, 1981; Jones et al, 1979; Lancet, 1980, p. 481).

         Fhe distribution of birth weights is not normal, mainly because

 there are too many observations in the left tail. The fat left tail

 nay be treated as the result of adding together a distribution of the

 weights of underdeveloped babies (which I will call 'pre-term") to a

 much larger distribution of fully developed babies (which I will call

 "full term"). Nevertheless, for the purposes to which they are put in

 Figures ,    normal approximations to the distributions of the U.S. nonwhite

 and Bombay lower classes yield satisfactory results.       The mean

 and standard deviation in the normal approximation to the U.S. distri-

 bution differs from those of the actual distribution by less than one

 percent (Chase, 1969). In the Bombay case the difference in the means

 is less than one percent (the standard deviation of the sample was not

 reported) (Jayant, 1964).
                                   -95-

        17
          In this case it was necessary to estimate the heaping of

pre-terin births on the left tail of the distribution of birth weights.

'r procedure was based on the proposition set forth in. footnote 16

that the observed distribution of birth weights may be viewed as the result

of a convolution of a small distribution of weights of pre-term babies

which is heaped on the left tail of a much larger distribution of

weights of full-term babies that is normally distributed. Under this

assumption the underlying normal distribution can be recovered by truncating

the left tail of the distribution at (say) 2001 grams and then using the

QBE procedure described in Wachter (1981) and Wachter and Trussell (1982)

to estimate the complete normal distribution of full-term babies. It

follows that the difference between the number of observations below

2001  grams in the reconstituted normal distribution and in the original
distribution yields an estimate of the distribution of pre-term babies
that have been heaped on the left tail.

       In estimating Column 4 of Table 10, which is graphed in Figure 5,

I assumed that the underlying full-term distribution was N(2,300; 420).

To this distribution I then added the estimated number of pre-term

births at weights below 2001 grams, using ratios obtained from Guha

   al (1973) which provides information on birth weight by gestational

age for a Delhi sample quite similar to the Bombay sample. Basically,

the number of births under 2001 grains in the original normal distribution

was inflated by the ratio of all births to full—term births in the Delhi

sample, but the additional births were distributed over two in-

tervals: under 1501 and 1501-2000. This adjustment for pre-terin births

produced a convoluted distribution with a mean of 2276 grams (down 24

grams from   the   underlying normal) and a standard deviation of 399 grains

(down 21 grains from the underlying normal).
                                -96-




         18Several different approaches lead to the same conclusion. The

 fact that age.—2 height is a good predictor of final height (Tanner, 1978)

and the fact that the final heights of the London poor was below that of

Trinidad slaves suggests that they were shorter at age two. The in-

ference is supported by their mean heights in adolescence which were

below those of Trinidadians. The small stature in early adolescence

suggest that poor nutritional circumstances in utero, infancy, and

early childhood set the London poor on the law growth path indicated

by both the data for adolescents and for final heights. Correlations

between height and weight during fetal development, at birth, and in

early childhood are discussed in Birkbeck, 1976; Southgate, 1978; and

Cole, 1979. See Steckel (1984a) and Fogel (1985) for a discussion of

methods of estimating birth weight from birth length and early child-

hood height.


        19My estimate of the mean birth weight of the London poor is

about 590 grains (about 1.3 pounds) less than mean weights of about

27,000 births at the Maternit de Port Royal in Paris delivered during

the first decade of the nineteenth century (Tanner, 1981, pp. 255-56).

I suspect that in this and in other European lying-in hospitals at

the time, women who chose to have deliveries in hospitals tended to

have babies that were relatively heavy for their length and that a sig-

nificant proportion were coming to the hospitals because of difficulties

during pregnancy. This possibility is suggested by the exceedingly high

death rate among deliveries in maternity hospitals, which were as much as

seven times as high as home deliveries (McKeown, 1976), and by the

excessive proportion of babies who appear to have had weights that were
                                  —97—


more than 1.65 standard deviations above the mean (Tanner, 1981). It

is also likely that the left tail of the distribution was truncated

because some infants who died immediately after birth were treated as

still births.

         Two recent studies, one on births between 1851 and 1905 at the

University Lying-In Hospital in Montreal (Ward and Ward, 1984), the

other of births between 1848 and 1865 at the Philadelphia Alms House

(Goldin and Margo, 1984) promise to increase our knowledge of nineteenth-

century birth size and of its bearing on perinatal deaths during that

century. The Wards have discovered a decline in mean birth weight of

about 420 grams between the late 1860s and the beginning of the twen-

tieth century. Preliminary analysis of the Philadelphia data by Goldin

and Margo, not only indicates a decline in birth weights between the

mid 1850s and the mid l860s, but also reveals that the first-day death

rate, even for live births in the range of 3,000 and 4,000 grams, was

about twice as high as in tht U.S. national sample in 1950.


          201 have not distinguished birth weight and length by sex since

it is a refinement not justified by the rough calculations which follow.

At birth the mean weight of girls is less than that of boys, but the

difference is only about 100 grains (about 3 ounces). The average

difference of birth length between the sexes is about 0.6 centimeters

(about a quarter of an inch) and shows less variation across nations

than weight differences. Cf. Seal, 1980; Tanner et     al, 1966;   Evelyth

and   Tanner,   1976; Hytten and Leitch, 1971; and the sources cited in

WHO, 1980.

                Wrigley and Schofield (p. 529) give the following values for

 1801—05:

                                  e         =    35.89
                                      0
                                  cdr =          27.08
                                  cbr =          37.71

 The appropriate value of 1% (179.0              per     thousand) for the indicated

 value of e was obtained from their Table A14.5 (p. 714) by interpolating

 between their levels 8 and 9. Then 37.71 x 0.179 = 6.42 is the number

 of infant deaths per 1000 persons in the total population. Consequently,

  infant deaths were 23.7 percent of all deaths (6.42                    27.08 =   0.237).

          23The age-standardized death rate in Britain c. 1980 was 8.32

per thousand, using the Wrigley and Schofield (1981, p. 529) age dis-

tribution for 1801-OS and the 1978-80 life table for the United Kingdom

to estimate the nx values (C.B. Cent. Stat, 0ff., 1983, p. 43). Since

the crude death rate for 1801-03 in Wrigley and Schofield (1981, p. 529)

was 27.08, the decline in the standardized mortality rate is 18.76.

Non-infant deaths were 20.66 per thousand in 1801-1805 (.763 x 27.08 =

20.66).   Then 20.66 x .1085 =    2.24 is the reduction in non-infant mor-
tality due to improved nutrition. The last figure is 12 percent of

the total decline in mortality (2.24 4             18.76    =
                                                                .119).

          24Some caveats about the foregoing estimates are in order.

After maturity height will not adequately measure nutritional status

unless the relationship between nutritional status during the growing

ages and after maturity is not only strong but of a simple form. Con-

sequently, the computations presented in the text may miss pan of the

effects of improvements in nutritional status after maturity on the

decline in adult mortality. The assumption that the elasticity between

nx and height is stable with respect to time, place, and circumstances

(which is involved in the application of the Trinidad elasticity to
                                    -loa-

 the   British case) requires confirmation and may have to be modified as

 additional evidence becomes available.


          25Even     small   reductions     in   the

 quantity of grain could have had severe nutritional consequences on

 particular groups or classes.      If, for example, the maldistribution of

 grain increased during a shortfall, the mortality of the poor, es-

 pecially the urban poor, might have risen even though the food con-

 sumption of most of the population changed little (Sen, 1981; Tilly,

 1983). Highly aggregated analysis might miss effects that would show

 up in regressions targeted at groups whose consumption was most likely

 to suffer even when declines in food production were quite moderate.

 One of the advantages of the height data and the genealogies is that

 they permit a far finer differentiation in the experiences of particular

 socioeconomic groups than has hitherto been possible, so that this

 sort of disaggregated analysis can be pursued.


          26Galenson(l981) has shown. that the najority of English immigrants

to North America were from the lower classes. If it is asswned that the

mean height of adult male immigrants before 1650 was 64.5 inches (the

approximate mean male adult height of the English laboring population for

cohorts born c.l70), then the implied rate of 4.ncrease in adult height

between   immigrants born c. 1630 and native cohorts born c. 1710 was about
one centimeter     per decade. There is no information currently available

on the mean height of English cohorts born before c.1750. However, the

high mortality rates in England between c.1625 and c.1790 (Wrigley and

Schofield, 1981, pp. 528-529) suggest that there was little change in

height schedules during this period.

           27Swedish       and Norwegian adult .heights •appear to have increased

fairly rapidly during the first third of the nineteenth century. However,

the secular increase slowed during the middle third of the century and

accelerated during the last third (Kijl, 1939; Udjus, 1964; Sandberg

and Steckel, 1980).


           28
               The equation used in this computation can be derived as

follows:

           (7.1)          H                +   ir(H       - 0).
                               (l_iT)Hu

Hence

           (7.2)          H = H   -irD.


Differentiating (7.2) totally yields:

           (7.3)          H        -   (-l)@          +   D)

where
           H =     the   mean height of the population

           Hu= the mean height of the upper class

           D =     the difference between the mean height of the
                   upper and the lower class

               =   the share of the lower class in the total pop-
                   ulation

           *=Hu 4H
           *   = an asterisk over a variable indicates the rate
                   of change in that variable.

           The following estimates were used (rates of change are in per-

centage    change perU annum; the period of change was assumed to be 150
years);                            *                                     1
                                   H = 0.047              (H      64.75; H = 69.5)
                                   H= 0.015               (H° = 69.5;        71)
                                       =   1.0734 (69.5 4 64. 75)

        291t is likely that immigrants too poor to provide their growing

children with adequate nutrition (which may be viewed as an intergen-

erational transfer of human capital) also were unable to provide children

with adequate transfers of ordinary capital.


       30
            It is possible that the inequality of the income and wealth

distributions of farmers and   other    rural occupaticns increased and that

an increasing share of rural households experienced impoverishment

during the relevant period, even though the mean income and the mean wealth of

the rural population were rising. Leaders of farm protest movements

during the nineteenth century claimed that the incomes of sizable groups

of farmers were declining both relatively and absolutely.

        31The fact that the debate launched in the mid-1950s still continues

should not distract attention from the considerable advances in knowledge

that have occurred because of the debate. Investigators have probed in-

creasingly into aspects of issues that were obscure at the outset. The

point is well illustrated by the evolution of research on the pathways

of airborne diseases. McKeown (1975) stressed direct exposure; Preston

and van de Walle (1978) called attention to the risk-increasing effects

of the lowering of resistance to airborne pathogens brought about by

infections caused by water-borne pathogens. Thus in the course of the

debate the concept of nutritional status has been refined and the factors

which affect it have been elaborated. Similarly, Condran and Chaney (1982)

have provided evidence that medical intervention became increasingly

effective before the dramatic chemical breakthroughs that became apparent

during and after World War II. However, the extent of mortality reduction

due to these less dramatic contributions has yet to be measured.
