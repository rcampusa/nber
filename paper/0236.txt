         THE SUPPLY OF SURGEONS AND THE DEMAND FOR OPERATIONS

                            Victor R. Fuchs



                               ABSTRACT



        This paper presents a multi—equation multi—variate analysis

of differences in the supply of surgeons and the demand for operations

across geographical areas of the United States in 1963 and 1970. The

results provide considerable support for the hypothesis that surgeons

shift the demand for operations. Other things equal, a 10 percent

increase in the surgeon/population ratio results in about a 3 percent

increase in per capita utilization. Moreover, differences in supply

seem to have a perverse effect on fees, raising them when the surgeon!

population ratio increases. Surgeon supply is in part determined by

factors unrelated to demand, especially by the attractiveness of the

area as a place to live.

        Inequality in the distribution of physicians across the United

States and the possible influence of physician supply on the demand for

their services are subjects of continuing interest to economists and

health policy makers. If physicians choose their locations partly for

reasons unrelated to demand, and, if, given their locations, they can

increase or decrease the demand for their services independently of

changes in price, the implications for economic analysis and for public

policy are profound. Some economists [Fuchs—Kramer 1972; Evans 1974]

have reported evidence in support of the demand—shifting hypothesis,

but others are skeptical [Sloan—Feldman 1977]. Many physicians believe

that they have almost unlimited power to shift demand. This belief is

based on introspection, clinical experience, and the correlation between

supply and utilization, but skeptics offer several alternative explana-

tions for the correlation.

        The principal purpose of this paper is to shed some light on

this question through a multi—equation, multi—variate analysis of

differences in the supply of surgeons and the demand for operations

across geographical areas of the United States. In—hospital operations

seem particularly well suited for analysis of demand—shifting because

several of the problems that have hampered previous studies can be

avoided or minimized. The following section discusses the hypothesis

of demand—shifting and indicates why this study provides a good test of

it. The analytical framework and data are then described, followed by

a section reporting the empirical results and a concluding section which

considers some implications.




The "DemandShifting" Hypothesis

        Standard economic analysis assumes that the supply and demand

schedules in any market are independent. Given an exogenous increase

in supply, a new equilibrium is reached by moving down the (constant)

demand curve, as shown in Figure lA. The demand—shift hypothesis asserts

that "given an exogenous shift in the supply of physicians from S1 to S2,

the physicians induce a shift in demand from D1 to D2" (see Figure 1B).

       Another way of viewing demand—shifting is presented in Figure 2.

The benefits from increases in the quantityof medical care, either to an

individual patient or to a population, can be assumed to increase at a

decreasing rate, hence the falling marginal benefit curve MB. For

simplicity, let us assume that the, cost of medical care to the patient

(financial cost, time costs, risks, etc.) increases at a constant rate,

shown by the marginal cost curve MC. If patients had full information

and full control over the quantity of care, they would choose quantity Q.

The fact that the quantity may be determined by the physician does not

in itself imply demand—shifting. The physician, acting as an unbiased

agent of the patient, may also choose quantity Q. If, however, the

physician chooses and the patient accepts a quantity of care greater

than or less than Q, we would say that there has been demand—shifting.

        Note that demand can be shifted either up (to the right) or down

(to the left). Let us assume that, other things equal, physicians

prefer to come as close to Q as possible, i.e., they derive utility from
                                    3


 ordering the amount of care which equates marginal cost and marginal

 benefit for their patients.' Let us also assume that physicians derive

 utility from income and that work (at least beyond some level) is a source

of disutility. If the physician/population ratio is relatively high in

an area (for reasons unrelated to demand) they may push quantity to the

right of Q in order to keep prices and incomes from falling drastically.

If there are relatively few physicians in an area, and if they cannot

or do not raise price to an equilibrium level, they may push quantity

to the left of Q in order to avoid excessive work. This latter situation,

sometimes characterized as "excess demand," has been offered as an

explanation for the observed correlation between supply and utilization

[Feldstein 1970]. Itwouldbedescrjbed inFigurelAbya pricewhich is below the

intersectjonofS1anddemand. Ashiftof supply to the right results in

higher utilization because it takes care of some of the excess demand.

        Note that the presence of demand—shifting should not be equated

with "unnecessary care." If "necessary care" is defined as Q in Figure 2,

demand—shifting to the left implies that some patients are not getting

the care they should, and does not Imply that any patients are getting

unnecessary care. Moreover, necessary care may be defined differently

than the quantity that maximizes the patient's utility (I.e., Q). If,

for instance, it Is defined as the quantity that maximizes the patient's

health regardless of cost, the optimum would clearly be to the right of Q

and such demand—shifting would not necessarily imply "unnecessary care."

        This study of in—hospital operations provides a sharp test of

demand shifting for several reasons. First, operations are typically

well—defined procedures; it Is, therefore, possible to get a direct

measure of quantIty. There is some variation in average complexity of

operations (as measured by the California Relative Value Scale) across
                                      4



geographical areas; the coefficient of variation for 11 frequently per-

formed procedures is 6 percent. A Count of operations, however, is

likely to be a much better measure of quantity of medical care than a

count of office visits, which may vary greatly with respect to length,

number of tests and X—rays, etc. Furthermore, variations in average

complexity can be studied separately.

   -A second reason why operations should provide an interesting study of demand

shifting is that we can rule out "excess demand" (1. e. demand shifting to the left)

as an important explanation for any observed relation between supply and utilization.

Excess demand may exist for house calls and other types of services

rendered by general practitioners, where price seems to be below its

equilibrium level and non—price rationing is observed, but such phenomena

are rare in surgery. Economists and physicians who have studied surgical

markets have reported that the average number of operations per surgeon

(150 to 200 per year) is far belowthe level that surgeons consider a

"full workload" (about 400 to 500 per year) [Fuchs, 1969; Hughes, Fuchs,

Jacoby and Lewit, 1972; Watkins, Hughes and Lewit, 1975]. The average

workload is less than half that recorded in group practice settings such

as the Group Health Cooperative (Seattle) and the Mayo Clinic (Rochester,

Minnesota), and below the quantity that surgeons would be willing and

able to perform at the going price. The data used in this paper reveal

that even in non—metropolitan areas where the surgeon/population ratio

is very low, the average surgeon performs only about 250 operations per

year. A recent SOSSUS report noted, ". .       . we have failed to identify
large or small areas of this country that are significantly under—supplied

with personnel suitably qualified to carry out surgery" [SOSSUS, 19761.
                                     5




         The "cost of time" explanation is also likely to be less relevant

for operations than for physician office visits. This explanation for

the cofrelation between supply and utilization asserts that equilibrium

is achieved by a change in the total price to the patient, including the

cost of time. Where the physician population is higher, the time costs

to the patient of search, travel, and waiting are all reduced, which is

equivalent to a decline in price. Thus- figure 1A is said to adequately

describe the market for physician services if price is correctly specified.

There is, therefore, no need to introduce demand shifting as an explana-

tion. Time costs are undoubtedly important for the average ambulatory

visit, but are likely to be less relevant for in—hospital operations

because the psychic costs of surgery and the time costs of hospitalization

are likely to be large relative to the time costs of search, travel, and

waiting. Thus, this study avoids an ambiguity Inherent in many previous

studies of demand shifting.

        Finally, given widespread insurance coverage for in—hospital

surgery (about 80 percent of the population), the absence of accurate

price data may cause fewer problems than in studies of demand for out-

patient services which have lower Insurance coverage.

        Although an inter—area analysis focused on surgical operations seems to

offer several advantages, there are potential problems as well. First, there is

probably a significant amount of "border crossing" by surgical patients. Whereas

most outpatients obtain care fromnearby physicians, it is not unusual for

patients to travel considerable distances for in—hospital surgery. Such

"border crossing" is likely to be particularly relevant for residents of

nonmetropolitan areas who frequently go to metropolitan areas for their
                                     6




operations. According to American Hospital Association data (1972), the

rate per thousand population of operations (excluding births) in metro—

politan area hospitals was 1.75 times the rate in nonmetropolitan area

hospitals. Health Interview Survey Data (1970) based on the residence

of the patient rather than the   location   of the hospital, indicates a

(non—obstetrical) operation rate for metro residents only 1.10 times

the rate for nonmetro residents. Using this information plus the metro!

nonmetro population ratio of 2.33, we can calculate that nonmetro residents

obtain about 30 percent of their operations in metro areas (assuming no

movement of metro residents to nonmetro areas for in—hospital surgery).2

Thus, if there is an effect of supply on demand, the demand in nonmetro

areas may be affected by the supply in the adjacent metro area as well

as by the supply in the nonmetro area itself.

        There is probably much less unreciprocated border crossing from

one geographical division to another. A comparison of the surgical

utilization rates in the HIS data for 1970 with AHA data for 1972 shows

four divisions (New England, East North Central—East, South Atlantic—

Upper, and Pacific) with rates above the U.S. average for both measures,

and five divisions (East North Central—West, South Atlantic—Lower, East

South Central, West South Central, Mountain) with rates below U.S.

average, according to both measures. There are two divisions (Middle

Atlantic and West North Central) which show rates above the U.S. average

by location of hospital (AHA data), and below U.S. average by residence

(HIS data). This suggests that there may be some unreciprocated border

crossing into those two divisions for surgery. However, it should be

noted that both those divisions had rates above the U.S. average in the
                                   7




HIS data for 1963, so it may be that some of the discrepancy in 1970 is

the result of sampling variability.3

        Another possible source of difficulty is that a significant

amount of surgery (fragmentary data suggest about 20 percent)4 is per-

formed by physicians who are not "surgical specialists"——primarily

general practitioners and surgical residents. The location of surgical

residents is highly correlated with that of surgeons, but the location

of general practitioners is not, and some attempt will be made to take

account of their supply in the analysis.

        Not only are some operations performed by "non—surgeons," but

surgical specialists typically do not limit their practice to performing

operations. Thus, this study is concerned with only a portion (albeit

the major portion) of the demand for "surgeons' services," and would

result in an understatement of "demand shifting" if, as seems likely,

It Is easier and more attractive for surgeons to shift the demand for

office procedures and tests than for in—hospital operations.5

        One problem which is perennial in attempts to estimate demand

shifting Is that of simultaneity. Strong demand for surgery in an area

may attract surgeons, rather than the surgeons stimulating demand. I

will attempt to deal with this problem by using "predicted" physician

supply rather than actual supply. The predictions will be based on a

regression that incorporates "taste" variables that affect surgeon

location.

The Ana 1ytical Framework and Data Base

        The general framework of this paper is similar to that used by

Fuchs and Kramer to analyze inter—area variations in the demand for,

and supply of, physicians' services. A demand equation is specified

which includes variables usually thought to determine demand (e.g.,

demographic characteristics, income, price), and then "predicted"

physician supply is added. This predicted supply is obtained by regres-

sing the surgeon/population ratio on a set of variables believed to

determine physician location. The physician location decision is of

interest in its own right, given the wide variation in the physician!

population ratio across areas.

       Cross—section regressions are run for 1963 and for 1970 and in

a few instances the observations for the two years are pooled. The

Health Interview Survey (HIS), which is the source for the surgical

utilization data, provides information for 22 areas (metropolitan and

nonmetropolitan areas in each of 11 divisions)6 that cover the entire

population. These areas are the units of observation for some of the

regressions. Other regressions are run on a more detailed breakdown of

the HIS data in which individuals are cross—classified by age (six

classes), sex, race (white and nonwhite), and education of head of

family (five classes), and the 22 areas. Regressions across these cells

permit much finer control of demographic variables and also permit

testing of Pauly's suggestion that demand shifting might be more important

for some groups (e.g., the poorly educated) than for others

       The possibility of border crossing from nonmetro to metro areas

is allowed for by including an additional predicted supply variable for
                                    9




each of the nonmetro areas. This variable is based on the ratio of the

number of surgeons in the adjacent metro area to the total population

of the division. Also, some regressions are run across only the metro

areas or only the nonmetro areas. Per capita income and surgical prices

are deflated by a general price index for each division, adjusted for

metro—nonmetro differences, and all nominal dollar values for 1963 are

inflated to 1970 price levels.

         The utilization rates were calculated from the Health Interview

Survey (for 1963 and 1970) conducted by the National Center for Health

Statistics. The data represent a probability sample of households

including all living civilian noninstitutionalized individuals. In 1970

interviews were conducted with approximately 37,000 households containing

about 116,000 individuals, and in 1963 with 42,000 households containing

134,000 individuals. Surgical rates were obtained in response to the

following questions: "Was the respondent hospitalized at any time during

the last 12 months?" and, if an operation was performed, "What was the

name of the operation?" For each hospitalization, only first operations

were Included; the number of second and third operations was small.

Deliveries, abortions and other obstetrical prQcedures were excluded

from the analysis because they are primarily a function of conception

rates.

         Although the Health Interview Survey data are representative of

the nation's population, they are subject to recall error by the indi-

vidual or proxy respondent. Hospitalizations and operations are reported

with greater accuracy than simple episodes of illness, but an overall
                                      10




rate of under—reporting of 10 percent remains. Moreover, this under-

reporting is not uniformly distributed among the population. Whites

tend to report hospitalization more accurately than nonwhites; higher

education is also associated with more accurate reporting, as is higher

income (controlling for education).

         The physician supply data come from the AMA Distribution of

Physicians in the U.S. and are reasonably accurate. Most of the other

data come from the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The principal variables (summary statistics in Table 1) are:


End ogenous

    Q*   Number of operations per 100,000 population.

    S Number of surgical specialists per 100,000 population.

         These are office—based patient—care physicians, both board

         certified and nonboard—certified. The M.D. supply is adjusted

         to take account of doctors of osteopathy.

 METS* This variable is used only for the noninetro areas and takes a

         value of zero for the metro areas. It is based on the predicted

         number of surgeons in the metro area divided by the total

         population of the division. It is included to allow for the

         possible effect of the surgeon supply in a metro area on the

         demand in the nonmetro area in the same division.

Exogenous

  INC* Real income per capita (in thousands of dollars).

         The income data were obtained from Distribution of Physicians in

         the U.S. 1969 data were used for 1970, and 1965 data for 1963.

         Nominal per capita income was deflated by a divisional price
                                     I'




         index derived by Jeffrey Williamson [1977] from BLS data for large

         metro areas.   Prices in nonmetro areas were assumed to be .87

         of the prices in the metro areas (the cost—of—living differential

         reported by the BLS). The all—commodity CPI was used to adjust

         for intertemporal change.

 IIOTEL* Per capita receipts (dollars per person) of hotels and motels

         in the division.   The same value was used for the nonmetro and

         metro areas in a division. This variable is used as a measure

         of the "attractiveness" of the area. The "services" component

         of the CPI was used to adjust for intertemporal change.

 NONMET A dummy variable denoting nonmnetro areas.

 NRNET The fraction of the population in a nonmetro area living in

         counties that were designated as "potential" SMSA's or that had

         population in excess of 50,000. This variable took a value of

         zero for the metro areas.

 %WYTE   Percent of the area's population that is white.

   GP* Number of general practitioners per 100,000 population.



         In addition to the above variables some attempts were made to

use an endogenous price of surgery variable. This was based on American

Medical Association data for nine divisions in 1970 reporting the average

price of an initial office visit, a follow—up office visit, and a

follow—up hospital. visit (all for surgeons). An average of these three

prices was calculated and then deflated by the Williamson—BLS divisional

price index for all commodities. The surgical price index never had

any effect in either the demand or location regressions.
                                    12




        A variable measuring the percent of the division's population

with surgical insurance was also tried without any appreciable effect.

This variable, obtained from the Health Insurance Institute, is probably

not measured accurately.8

         In the regressions across the cells, dummy variables are included

for the demographic characteristics——age, sex, race, and education of

head of family——that are used to form the cells.

        Surgeon location. Table 2 presents the results for the surgeon

location regressions.9 Representative runs for each year across the 22

areas are shown. The fits are extremely good (R2 as high as .96) and

the coefficients are relatively insensitive to changes in specification.

The principal conclusion is that the "taste" variables have a very

strong influence on surgeon location.

        The NONMET dummy variable is highly significant in all runs with a

value usually close to —25. The preference for metropolitan—like areas

is also revealed by the NRMET variable, with a coefficient of about 14.

This indicates that nonmetro areas with 100 percent of their population

in counties that are nearly like metropolitan counties have, ceteris

paribus, 14 more surgeons per hundred thousand than nonmetropolitan

areas with no population in such counties. The preference of surgeons

for metropolitan living may reflect the professional attraction of the

11medical environment" as well as their preference as consumers. Potential

demand, however, as measured by predicted utilization (Q*) has virtually

no effect on location.
                                   13



        That surgeons live in areas that most people consider desirable

to visit and vacation in is demonstrated by the HOTEL* variable. This

coefficient (usually highly significant) shows the increase associated

with an increase of one dollar per capita in receipts of hotels and

motels. The elasticity at the means is approximately .2.

        The coefficient of %WYTE is always positive and usually statis-

tically significant, but varies somewhat depending upon the specifica-

tion. A value of .20 implies an elasticity of .6 at the means. The GP*

coefficient is not significant and does not have any appreciable effect

on those that are. Some attempts were made to incorporate predicted

price into the location regressions. Its coefficient was always

insignificant.

        Demand. Table 3 presents the results for the demand regressions

across the 22 areas. Table 4 presents similar runs across the cells.

The latter regressions permit much finer control of the demographic

variables but do not, of course, allow for any additional variation in

those variables which are only available for the areas. The fits of

the demand equations are not as good as those for the surgeon location

equations, and the size and significance of the coefficients are more

sensitive to variations in specification. In general, the results support

the view that an exogenous change in surgeon supply does affect the demand

for operations.   Each additional surgeon in an area, ceteris paribus,

 is associated with an increase of between 40 and 60 operations per year.

The elasticity at the means for a coefficient of 50 is about .28. Use

 of the two—stage procedure does reduce the relation between supply and

 utilization. In OLS regressions (shown at the bottom of Table 3), the surgeon

 supply coefficient is from 8 to 40 percent larger than in the two—stage runs.
                                   14



        The regressions in Part B of Table 4 were run across cells with

11 division values instead of 22 area values. The predicted surgeons

were obtained from a regression across the divisions of S* on HOTEL*,

%WYTE and the percent of the division's population living in metropolitan

areas (%NET). The fit was good (R2 =    .80)   and the coefficient for %MET

(.24) was the equivalent of the NONMET dummy coefficient in the area

location regressions. The relative price of surgery was included in the

cell—division regressions, but was never significant.

        The income coefficient is always positive in the demand equations,

but usually not statistically significant unless predicted surgeon supply

is omitted. One surprising finding is the statistically significant

negative coefficient for GP* in 1970. One possible explanation is that

where GP's are numerous they can provide continuing nonsurgical care for

various conditions which might otherwise be treated by surgery. However,

this variable was insignificant in 1963. The coefficients for the demo-

graphic characteristics are presented in Table 5. These are usually very

significant and virtually unaffected by the inclusion or exclusion of the

area variables.

        It is possible that the effect of predicted supply on demand

reported in Table 3 and Part A of Table 4 is really the effect of the

metro—noninetro distinction on both supply and demand. To test for this

possibility, similar two—stage regressions were run for just the metro

areas and just the nonmetro areas, with 1963 and 1970 pooled in order

to have a reasonable number of observations.10

        The results for the demand regressions across the areas are

reported in Table 6 and those for the regressions across cells in Table 7.
                                   15



The principal coefficient of interest is for predicted supply (S*), and

we see that this coefficient is generally larger and more statistically

significant in these regressions than in those that included both metro

and rionmetro areas. For the five metro regressions in the two tables,

the median coefficient for S* is 82, and for the 10 nonmetro regressions

the median is 80.    These coefficients imply an elasticity at the means

of approximately .53 for the metro areas and .27 for the nonmetro areas.

The difference in elasticity reflects the much lover surgeon/population

ratio in the nonmetro areas.

        The nonmetro regressions were run with an exogenous METS*

variable, as well as without; this coefficient was not statistically

significant. A variable designed to measure the possible impact of

border—crossing in metro •areas also had no significant effect. The only

variable except predicted supply which came close to consistently signifi-

cant results Is GP* in metro areas. The negative coefficient is similar

in size to that reported in Tables 3 and 4 for 1970. In general, the

separate regressions strongly support the demand shift hypothesis and

reject the hypothesis that the mero—nonmetro distinction explains the

observed relation between predicted supply and utilization.

        Interaction with education. Mark Pauly has suggested that the

ability of physicians to shift demand for their services might vary for

different groups in the population. In particular, he hypothesized that

the effect might be inversely related to the level of education. Table 8

reports the results of regressions directed to this question. The regres-

sions are run across the cells grouped by education, with 1963 and 1970

pooled. The effect of predicted supply on demand does seem to be largest
                                   16




for the low education class and smallest for the high education class.

The differences between the coefficients, however, are not statistically

significant.

        Complexity, urgency,_necessity. Eleven frequently performed

procedures11 that account for 42 percent of all nonobstetrical operations

were scaled for "complexity," "urgency," and "necessity." The complexity

scale is based on the California Relative Value Scale. The urgency and

necessity scales are based on replies by physicians to a mailed question-

naire asking them to choose a statement which best characterizes their

impression of the operations being performed in each category.12

        Indexes of complexity, urgency and necessity were calculated for

each cell and then regressed on the demographic dummy variables, income

per capita, and predicted surgeon supply, with the results as shown in

Table 9. There seems to be some positive relation between complexity

and surgeon supply, but the coefficient is not statistically significant.

The surgeon supply coefficient in the urgency index regression is large

and statistically significant. Each additional surgeon per 100,000 in

an area lowers the urgency index by one percent——a large change, given

the relatively small variation in the urgency index across areas. The

necessity index also shows an inverse relation with surgeon supply, but

the effect is smaller than for the urgency index and not statistically

significant.

        The effect of supply on price. The effect of predicted supply

on quantity (and complexity) provides some evidence in support of the

hypothesis that surgeons shift the demand for their services. Confidence

in this conclusion would be increased if changes in supply also resulted
                                   17



in changes in price in the same direction. This question is investigated

with regressions across the 11 divisions.

        The surgical price index is derived from AMA data reporting

average fees by specialty and division for initial and follow—up office

visits and follow—up hospital visits in 1970. There is reasonably high

correlation among these different fees.'3 An average of the three types

of fees is taken to be representative Of the relative price of surgery

across divisions. This index is deflated by the Williainson—BLS divisional

price index for all commodities, as shown in Table 10.

        The surgical price index in both deflated and undeflated form

is regressed on predicted surgeon supply and predicted demand and on

the observed values of these variables. The predicted values of the

endogenous variables are obtained from regressions with INC*, %MET, HOTEL*,

and GP* as instruments.

        The results (Table 11) reveal a positive effect of supply on

price; this is clearly contrary to conventional market behavior. By

contrast, the effect of demand on price is quite small. A coefficient

of 1.5 for supply is equivalent to an elasticity of .5 at the means of

the variables. Inasmuch as predicted price had no effect in the surgeon

supply equation, we can reject the view that the high correlation between

price and surgeon supply14 reflects a causal relation running from price

to supply.

Discussion and Summary

        The small number of observations and potential measurement error

in some of the data require us to regard the results reported in this

paper as less than definitive. In particular, better price data and a

more robust demand specification would serve to increase confidence in

the findings. The shortcomings notwithstanding, the cumulative impact

of the various statistical experiments casts serious doubt concerning the

stability of the demand function for operations when there is an

exogenous shift in the supply of surgeons. The hypothesis that an

increase in the supply of surgeons results in an increase in demand is

strongly supported by the following findings:

        1. "Predictedt' supply consistently has a positive effect on

demand in a variety of specifications.

        2. The effect is present in both 1970 and 1963 even though the

quantity measure is subject to substantial sampling error and the

correlation between years is not very high.

        3. The effect is present and even stronger when metro areas and

nonmetro areas are studied separately.

        4. The supply effect on demand is inversely correlated with the

level of education.

        5. The supply effect is stronger for procedures deemed less

urgent and less necessary by physicians.

        6.   Supply has a positive effect on price; not a negative one.

        Can these results be reconciled with "normal" market behavior

without recourse to demand shifting? They can, but it takes some straining

to do so. One possible explanation is that surgeon quality is positively
                                       19




correlated with the surgeon/population ratio and that higher quality

induces additional demand much as a decrease in price does.15

        I agree that quality is probably correlated with quantity, but

it seems doubtful that the quality effect would be strong enough to explain

the observed differences in utilization or price. One indicator of

"quality" is the percentage of surgeons who are sub—specialists, such as

ophthalmologists, orthopedists, and the like, rather than general surgeons.

This percentage is highly correlated with the surgeon/population ratio

across divisions (r =   .72),   but the elasticity is only .15. Let us assume

this captures only half of the quality difference so that the full

elasticity of quality with respect to S is .3. Let us also assume that

the elasticity of demand with respect to quality is .3 (about triple the

probableelasticity of demand with respect to price). The "quality

effect" would then yield an elasticity of demand with respect to supply

of .09, considerably less than the elasticity actually observed. Further-

more, it should be noted that "better quality" surgeons frequently recom-

mend less surgery than do their colleagues with less training.

        I believe that the "stylized facts" revealed in this paper can

be summarized as follows: Surgeons have considerable discretion in choice

of location and their distribution is determined partly by their prefer—

ences as consumers. Thus geographical areas differ in their surgeon/

population ratio for reasons unrelated to the inherent demand for

operations. Where   surgeons    are more numerous, the demand for operations

increases. Other things equal, a 10 percent higher surgeon/population

ratio results in about a three percent increase in the number of opera-

tions and an increase in price. Thus, the average surgeon's workload
                                  20



decreases by seven percent, but income per surgeon declines by much

less.

        These findings do leave one troublesome question. If surgeons

can raise prices where they are more numerous, why don't they raise them

even higher where the surgeon/population ratio is lower? One possible

answer is that their incomes are already satisfactory because of their

higher (but not excessively high) workloads, and they have less incentive

to induce additional demand.

        The implications for national policy of these results seem striking.

If the surgeon/population ratio should increase (this seems likely if no

action is taken), the result will probably be higher rather than

lower fees, and also more operations. The marginal benefit of these

operations relative to marginal cost is not addressed in this paper, but

recent studies by physicians raise serious doubts, at least for some

procedures [Paradise, et. al 1978; Bunker 1977].

        One clear limitation of this study is the omission of that portion

of surgeons' workload unrelated to in—hospital operations. As suggested

previously, the surgeons' ability to shift the demand for out—patient

services is probably greater than for operations. Thus the total impact

of supply on demand may be larger, and the implied difference in income

per surgeon smaller, than that observed in this study. Indeed, while

the weakness of some of the data, and the tentative character of the

conclusions need to be stressed, it should also be noted that some of

these weaknesses probably serve to understate rather than exaggerate the

extent to which surgeons can shift the demand for their own services.

and a lower section (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and

Florida).

        7. Nevada was excluded because its huge gambling—based receipts

did not seem relevant.

        8. The number shown for the Middle Atlantic division is larger

than the division's population.

        9. All regressions use population weights.

       10. Equality of slope coefficients between 1963 and 1970 was

tested for both S* and Q* regressions and the null hypothesis was not

rejected in any equation.

       11. The 11 selected operations are: appendectomy, cataract

removal, cholecystectomy, dilatation and curettage (excluding abortions),

hemorrhoidectomy, hernia repair, hysterectomy, lumbar laminectomy for

            13. The coefficients of rank correlation across the nine divi-

    sions are: IOV and FOV .77; IOV and FHV .67; FOV and FHV .90.

            14. r    .78 for undeflated price, and .71 when the surgical

    price Index is deflated by the Williamson—BLS index.
