                                              ABSTRACT

The question of price level versus inflation targeting remains controversial. Disagreement concerns,
not so much the desirability of price stability, but rather the means of achieving it. Irving Fisher argued
for a commodity dollar standard where the purchasing power of money was fixed by indexing it to
a basket of commodities. We show that movements in the price of silver closely track the movements
in overall prices during the classical gold standard era. The one-to-one relationship between paper
and silver bonds suggests that a simple “silver rule" could have sufficed to fix the purchasing power
of money.

         Irving Fisher and Price-Level Targeting in Austria: Was Silver the Answer?



        The price level will not stand still unless we hitch it. It never has; and now, of all
        times, with the vast conflicting forces ahead, we shall be foolish if we expect
        complete equilibrium. On the contrary, we are probably destined to see, in the next
        generation, important price movements, perhaps more erratic than those in the past.
         (Fisher 1920, p. 120)


I. INTRODUCTION

        While inflation targeting has been widely adopted in recent years, the alternative

price-level targeting strategy long advocated by Irving Fisher offers a potentially superior

alternative. In committing to reverse any under- or over-shooting of inflation targets, such a policy

could potentially not only eliminate average inflation bias and lower short-run inflation variability

(Svensson 1999), but also help minimize fluctuations in nominal interest rates and ameliorate the

effects of both deflationary and inflationary shocks (Gaspar, Smets and Vestin 2010). In the midst

of the very low inflation rates prevailing since the onset of the global financial crisis, a price-level

target could help ward off expectations of deflation. Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel (2007, p. 431)

suggest that:

        “activating a price-level target to induce expectations of reflation of the economy
        would not only make it less likely that nominal interest rates would hit a floor of
        zero, but would also ... lower real interest rates, thereby stimulating the economy,
        and would help induce a rise in the price level, which would repair balance sheets.”

A price-level target could also offer a means of signaling the policymaker’s commitment to

lowering real interest rates even after nominal interest rates have already been cut to zero, as

argued by Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans in his October 2010 call for

the imposition of a price-level target in the United States (Evans 2010). Some support for this

perspective arises from Leigh’s (2010) finding that price-level targeting could have significantly

                                                   1
ameliorated Japan’s “Lost Decade,” whereas simply raising the inflation target alone would not

have had much impact on macroeconomic performance. Although no central bank has yet made

the switch to a price level target, the Bank of Canada has been seriously considering the case for

price-level targets in preparation for its next policy agreement with the government in 2011 (Kahn

2009).

         Today's proposals for price-level targeting have a rich heritage from the gold standard era.

In 1898 Swedish economist Knut Wicksell made a path-breaking case for price-level stabilization

via a form of interest-rate targeting. 1 As noted by Jonung (1979), his proposal could not be

implemented under the gold standard as it required independent control of the money supply in

order to adjust interest rates to their non-inflationary level. After Sweden left the gold standard for

good on September 27, 1931, however, "the norm that Wicksell presented at the turn of the century

became, some thirty years later, the official foundation for Swedish monetary policy" (Jonung

1979, p. 468).2 Irving Fisher was a contemporary admirer of the new Swedish policy and, in

Fisher's (1934, p. 331) view, the ensuing stability of the internal purchasing power of the Swedish

krona in conjunction with this new stabilization policy "stand out as among the remarkable facts of

the depression." Fisher (1913a, 1913b, 1920) had previously proposed maintaining price stability

using an index approach that, unlike Wicksell's proposal, could have been implemented within the

gold standard world prevailing at the time. Fisher's called for an adjustable commodity-based

dollar that would automatically offset any upward or downward pressure on its purchasing power.

Whenever prices fell below target by 1%, for example, the dollar value of the resource unit would

be raised by 1% – at the same time automatically lowering the number of resource units in the

dollar.

          Fisher (1913b) suggested that his proposal could be spearheaded by Austria, which was not

a formal member of the gold bloc but had been keeping its paper currency at par with gold by the

sale of exchange on the London market following the second renewal of the “Compromise of

1867” with Hungary in August 1892. According to Fisher (1913b, p. 342):

          “Austria might maintain a par, not with a fixed weight of gold, but with such a
          weight of gold as should have a fixed purchasing power, and could do this by
          buying and selling gold at these adjusted prices, selling gold bullion for gulden to
          contract the currency, and buying gold bullion for gulden to expand the currency.
          All other countries could maintain their par with Austria.”3

Fisher envisaged a whole new international monetary standard based on Austrian authorities

buying and selling gold at an official price that was to be fixed based on the aggregate price level.

For example, a 1% rise in aggregate prices would be neutralized by fixing the official price of gold

at a level 1% below the then-prevailing market price of gold. This would, in turn, give the public

an incentive to exchange currency for gold at the relatively cheap government price, thereby

automatically contracting the currency and acting to restore overall price stability. In case of

deflation, a policy of setting the official gold price above the prevailing market level would be

used to induce the public to exchange gold for currency and boost the money in circulation. Other

gold bloc countries need then only maintain their currencies at par with the Austrian currency in

order to import the benefits arising from varying the currency's gold content to offset any

fluctuations in its purchasing power. The resulting system would seemingly have had much in

common with the Bretton Woods exchange rate system that was set up in 1945, with the critical

distinction being that Fisher's scheme offered a clear means of ensuring stable purchasing power


3
 The “gulden” currency referred to by Fisher (1913b) was actually Austria's old monetary unit, with the switch to the
krone having been made in 1892. Unlike the gulden, the krone's gold value was kept stable even though formal
convertibility was never established.
                                                         3
for the core currency – a property that increasingly failed to be met by the weakening and

over-issued U.S. dollar in the period leading up to the break up of Bretton Woods in 1971.

         Although Fisher's scheme was, in reality, never formally adopted by Austria or any other

country, his proposition did receive serious consideration in policy circles. Fisher’s presentation of

his compensated dollar proposal at the Fifth International Congress of Chambers of Commerce in

1912 was followed by that body’s unanimous approval for convening an International Congress on

prices and the cost of living. Investigations into this question had already begun in a number of

countries, including Austria, and the Hungarian National Commercial Association submitted its

own report calling for the uniform compilation of statistics on prices. Early critics of his proposal

pointed to such issues as the difficulty in computing appropriate index numbers and uncertainty as

to exactly which commodities to include, however, as well as the potential implementation costs,

the impact on gold prices, and the question of whether it could really be undertaken by one country

alone without an international agreement among the leading nations (see, for example, Clark 1913;

Murray et al. 1913; Taussig 1913). 4 Cagan (1982) further emphasizes the potential for

over-reaction given that the monetary response required to maintain the current value of the

commodity-based dollar would have additional future consequences owing to lags, leading to a

need for compensating adjustments in the other direction later on.5



4
  In responding to questions raised by critics of his plan, Fisher (1912) acknowledged that, while "the plan could be
worked if adopted by one nation without the concurrence of others, its benefits would be best secured through its
adoption by a number of nations." There were many positive reactions as well as criticisms, however, and Laidler
(1991, p. 178) notes that it received favorable commentary in England. For example, Keynes (1911, p. 398) states that
"Fisher's admirable proposal ... deserve[d] very careful consideration, and if he can revive general interest in such
proposals he will have done a great service to the progress of monetary reform."
5
  There is also the question of whether adjustments in the dollar's gold content could keep pace with the information
available to speculators, who might recognize upward pressure on prices, say, and "convert the standard or foreign
currencies into dollars just before the adjustment and reverse the transaction just after, for a dollar profit" (Cagan 1982,
p. 22). This would likely be less of an issue today with data updating potentially allowing for near-continuous
adjustment in the standard (as seen in the Chilean example discussed below), but likely would have posed problems at
the time when Fisher first made his proposal.
                                                             4
       While we do not seek to assess the viability of the new international monetary system

envisaged by Fisher, our analysis suggests that a stripped-down form of Fisher’s idea could have

helped Austria maintain price stability during the gold standard era. Based on comparative data

from Austrian silver and paper bonds, we find that stable purchasing power could, in practice, have

been maintained without resorting to the full, wide-ranging commodity bundle envisaged by

Fisher. We show that yields on Austrian paper bonds and silver bonds moved together during

1880-1913. When increased scarcity of gold produced lower goods prices under the classical gold

standard, Austrian data imply that investors saw silver prices moving on a one-to-one basis with

the aggregate price level when the central European power bought and sold gold on the London

market to target their exchange rate. These findings suggest that a silver peg could potentially have

allowed for inflation-targeting with this one commodity used as a proxy for overall prices. This

approach would have alleviated the need for Fisher or government agencies to produce

high-quality data on a shifting, broad-based commodity bundle in order to stabilize prices.



II. FISHER'S PLAN AND ITS LEGACY TODAY

       Irving Fisher sought a self-stabilizing money that could avoid the ups and downs in

purchasing power seen in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The crux of Fisher's

proposal was the replacement of a fixed-weight dollar with a new fixed purchasing power

alternative:

       “When gold depreciates, its price should be reduced ... Reversely, when gold
       appreciates, its price should be raised ... The proposal here made is to authorize a
       raising or lowering of the sluice gates by which gold flows in or out, so as to keep
       our money lake at a uniform level. By increasing or decreasing the dollar's weight,
       we would thus be providing against either a flood or a drain.” (Fisher 1920, pp.
       106-107)


                                                 5
Fisher's index approach precludes bracket creep and, as Sumner (1990) points out, the basic tenets

of Fisher's compensated dollar plan continue to be incorporated in many modern-day proposals for

stabilizing the unit of account.6 Fisher's proposal involved adjusting the resource content of the

monetary unit in proportion to any deviations from the (fixed) target price level. Following Hall

(2005, p. 95), we can write this relationship as:

         xt = 1 / (port),                                                                                     (1)

where xt is the value of the currency expressed in resource units, rt is the value of one unit of the

resource relative to the cost-of-living bundle, and po is the target price level.

         In the aftermath of the ongoing debate between Fisher and his critics in the economics

profession, as well as the aforementioned resolution passed by the Fifth International Congress of

Chambers of Commerce in 1912 but derailed by the outbreak of World War I, the U.S. House

Committee on Banking and Currency in 1922 held hearings on a bill proposed by Congressman T.

Alan Goldsborough that would have enacted a modified version of Fisher's compensated dollar

plan (see Patinkin 1993, p. 19). Although neither this bill nor a 1924 revision ever made it out of

committee, Hall (2005) points out that Chile later adopted a bank-issued bearer certificate that

operates according to Fisher's principle of a self-stabilizing monetary unit. This Chilean monetary

unit, the Unidad de Fomento (UF), has its peso content adjusted each day in line with the estimated

cost of living so as to maintain its purchasing power. Hall (2005, p. 101) notes that, soon after its




6
 The hypothetical gains from an historical implementation of Fisher’s compensated dollar are demonstrated by Bordo,
Dittmar and Gavin (2007), who find significant reductions in price level and inflation uncertainty compared to the
gold standard. Following the demise of the classical gold standard in 1914, many observers besides Fisher sought to
arrive at a commodity bundle that would track the aggregate price level (see Burdekin 2007). Lewis (1925), for
example, proposed including silver alongside wheat, cotton and iron. Nor did interest in this area entirely abate in the
postwar era, with Hall (1982) concluding that a particular mix of ammonium nitrate, copper, aluminum and plywood
would have closely tracked the overall US cost of living over the 1946-1980 period.

introduction in 1967, “essentially all forward contracts in Chile came to be written in UFs – the

country achieved cost-of-living indexation painlessly.”7

          Fisher's (1920) concern with price fluctuations emphasized the uncertainty of these moves

and the sluggishness of nominal contracts and wages in adjusting to unforeseen price movements.

Bondholders and those on fixed incomes were especially hurt as the dollar's purchasing power fell,

declining at a rate close to 25% per annum during 1915-1918 (Fisher 1920, p. 62). As shown by

Friedman (1992, p. 26), sharp swings in real interest rates continued through the interwar era even

as nominal bond yields remained relatively stable. The subsequent upward trend in nominal

interest rates during the postwar era occurred only after inflation had become entrenched in the

world economy. Not only did modern-day inflation targeting emerge in an environment where

everyone had come to expect rising prices, but inflation targets of central banks built in positive

rates of inflation. Irving Fisher's commodity dollar standard sought to minimize the price

fluctuations that had plagued even the gold standard economies without permitting the upward

drift in the price level that continued even after the widespread adoption of inflation targeting by

central banks around the world.



III. THE CHANGING MONETARY ROLE OF SILVER

          From 1880-1913, gold became the monetary standard for most of the world’s economies.

With the exception of India, which switched from silver to gold in 1893, silver standards were

maintained only in China and the Far East by this time. The gold standard countries faced

persistent deflationary pressures over most of the last two decades of the nineteenth century.

Higher monetary usage of gold coupled with a paucity of new gold discoveries pushed gold prices

higher and goods prices lower, producing considerable discontent in the United States (see, for

example, Fox 1897; Friedman 1992; Frieden 1997). Until 1873, the United States had combined

monetary roles for both gold and silver under "bimetallism," whereby the mint coined both metals

at a preset ratio. Abandonment of the old bimetallic standard also meant abandonment of the

stabilizing effects deriving from the increased minting of the cheaper metal if shifts in demand and

supply caused the other metal to appreciate.8 Had the bimetallic standard not been removed in

1873, increased minting of silver would likely have significantly reduced, perhaps even eliminated

the deflationary trend of the 1880s and 1890s (Drake 1985; Friedman 1992; Velde 2002). This

automatic expansionary response would have occurred as the silver market price fell below its

mint value based upon the old 16:1 ratio against gold. Calls for restoration of bimetallism persisted

until deflationary pressures were alleviated by new gold production near the end of the century.9

        Decades after the demonetization of silver in the United Kingdom and United States,

commentators lamented the additional depreciation of silver relative to gold that followed the

closing of the Indian mints to the free coinage of silver in June 1893. Selby (1895, p. 86) goes so

far as to argue that the widespread demonetization of silver had the effect of “grossly changing the

relation between debtors and creditors throughout the world.” Meanwhile, Bear (1896)

emphasizes a link between the fall in the price of silver and declining wheat prices – with farm

prices in the United States falling even more steeply than those in England. Most striking of all,

however, is the fact that, notwithstanding the sharp drop in silver's value in terms of gold, silver's

purchasing power over other commodities seemed to hold steady. In 1890, for example,

contemporary observers noted that "the relationship between silver and other commodities

  Large-scale silver purchases remained a key part of US attempts at monetary expansion even in the 1930s, however
(Burdekin and Weidenmier 2009).
                                                        8
remains now about what it was before 1873" (The Statist 1890, p. 502), with silver and other

commodities each falling against gold by approximately 30-35% over this period. This same issue

was raised during the lead in to the U.S. presidential election of 1900, with Fox (1897, p. 95)

bemoaning a 50% drop in the domestic mint price of silver being matched by a similar 50% drop in

agricultural product prices.

       Although the importance of silver, like bimetallism itself, was hotly debated at the time,

there is no doubt that silver prices continued to be widely followed throughout the classical gold

standard era. It was also widely believed that silver prices continued to track the overall price level

even while the silver-gold ratio was skyrocketing in the late nineteenth century. This, in turn,

raises the question of whether stabilization of silver prices might have offered a parsimonious

means of achieving the overall stability in the currency unit so earnestly sought by Irving Fisher.

We now use newly-collected data on sovereign bonds from the gold standard era to address this

question empirically.



IV. EVIDENCE FROM THE SOVEREIGN BOND MARKET

A. Debt Issues and Price Movements in Austria

       Our empirical analysis focuses on Austria for two reasons. First, Fisher (1913b) identified

Austria as a potential lynchpin for a new, self-stabilizing monetary standard. Second, Austrian

sovereign bond data allow us to examine whether silver could have been used to stabilize the price

level. During the classical gold standard era, Austria was unique among the major European

economies in that it issued sovereign bonds in gold, silver, and paper. All three types of issuances

were actively traded, not only in Vienna, but also in the major external financial markets of



                                                  9
London, Paris, Amsterdam, and Berlin.10 The terms of the three sets of bond issues were identical

(perpetuity bonds) with the exception that the coupons on the paper and silver bonds were subject

to a 16 percent tax. Austria broke from the silver standard in 1879, just before our data series

begins in January 1880. In allowing its currency to float against silver, Austria avoided the

currency inflation that would otherwise have occurred had owners of silver bullion been able to

take advantage of free coinage into the gulden at a guaranteed fixed exchange rate (Yeager 1976, p.

298). Indeed, by the time free coinage of silver was ended, inflows into Austria and Hungary had

already swelled the coinage of silver gulden from 16.5 million in 1877 to nearly 25 million in 1878

and over 64 million in 1879 (Wieser 1893, p. 384). After August 1892 the Austrian authorities

pursued a gold exchange standard under which Austria's currency became closely tied to the gold

bloc even though gold convertibility was never formally established in the pre-World War I era.11

Austria's irredeemable paper currency was kept at par with gold through the interventions

discussed by Fisher (1913b) and was considered to have become substantively integrated by 1896,

aided by the liberal use of such modern instruments as foreign exchange forwards and repurchase

contracts (Jobst 2009).

         Fluctuations in the Austrian exchange rate relative to the major gold standard countries

averaged 15% between 1876-1891 before dropping to 8% during 1892-1895 and no more than 2%



10
   The interest rates on the paper and silver bonds have been adjusted to account for the 16 percent tax in the figures
and empirical analysis.
11
    Although the Austro-Hungarian Bank implemented a de facto gold standard with an effective cover ratio above
40%, political wrangling with the Austrian and Hungarian governments precluded any formal accession to the gold
standard (Flandreau 2003). Contrary to Tullio and Wolters (2007), this remained true throughout the pre-World War I
period (see also Flandreau and Komlos (2006, 2007). Austria's gold-exchange standard was similar to that adopted by
India after 1899 and was spreading rapidly across Asia, Africa and Central America in the approach to World War I
(Laidler 1991, p. 169). In Austria’s case, formal convertibility may have made little difference at the time. Mises (1909,
pp. 204-205) observes that the Austrian public had a preference for paper money such that “even were the bank
compelled to exchange the notes for gold, people would prefer to use paper to gold, as is the case nowadays where the
bank willingly pays notes in gold.”
                                                           10
after 1896 (Flandreau and Komlos 2002).12 Even prior to this convergence with the gold bloc,

Austria was able to float a large issue of paper bonds in the 1860s (in addition to silver and gold

bonds). As much as 20% of the paper bonds was held by foreign investors (Morys 2008) and the

size of the paper debt issue actually exceeded that of the silver and gold-based bonds.13 Based on

the silver-gold interest rate spread, Mitchener and Weidenmier (2009) find that the implied

silver-based expected inflation rate averaged 1.25% over the 1880-1911 period.14 Meanwhile,

Austria's gold holdings rose dramatically. While the Austro-Hungarian bank's silver holdings were

approximately three times as large as its gold holdings in 1890, this situation reversed over the

1890s such that gold holdings were nearly two times silver holdings in 1895 and nearly four times

silver holdings by 1900 (Table 1). This massive reversal in the holdings of the Austro-Hungarian

Bank leaves little room for any belief that Austria remained tied to the silver standard. An ongoing

link between silver and aggregate prices would still not be surprising, however, given the apparent

juxtaposition between silver and other commodity prices seen in other countries, such as the

United States, that had moved off silver earlier than Austria.

        With data on consumer and wholesale prices not widely available to investors in the

pre-World War I era, the silver price of gold represented a coordinating price for forming

expectations about overall price movements. As noted earlier, the relationship between silver and

overall commodity prices was seen to be maintained in spite of the rise in the relative value of gold

in the late nineteenth century (The Statist 1890, p. 502). Confirmation of the relevance of the silver

price of gold as a proxy for overall price trends arises from our examination of the correlation

   As of 1910, the market value of the unredeemed paper bonds totaled 886 million kronen, while there was around

Blattman, Hwang and Williamson (2007), we find correlations with silver equal to 0.81 for wheat,

0.56 for cotton, 0.60 for maize and 0.51 for lead – plus 0.67 with respect to an equal-weighted

index of the four commodities together. 15 Wheat was a particularly important commodity, with

average consumption of 65.7 million quintals in Austria-Hungary combined exceeding that of both

Germany and Italy in the pre-World War I period (Wilson 1921, p. 336).16 Hungary later settled a

debt to Switzerland on the basis of a special wheat export in lieu of the cash sum owed (Einzig

1936, p. 207).

         As shown in Figure 1, the silver price of gold features a rising trend during the gold

standard era. This upward movement appears to accelerate quite markedly after the

aforementioned 1893 closure of the Indian mints. The relevance of this advance in silver prices

(relative to the fixed gold price) is supported by the substantial co-movement with commodity

prices detailed above. Indeed, Figure 2 offers a compelling visual indication that Austrian silver

and paper bonds were essentially two peas in a pod over the available 1880-1913 sample period.17

As noted in Table 2, the average spread is less than five basis points over the full sample, shrinking

to just 2.79 basis points after 1896. Each series features a much more substantial yield spread with

respect to the gold bond, varying between approximately 100 and 150 basis points. The average

spread relative to gold exceeds 120 basis points over the full sample for both the silver and paper

issue, and remains more than 100 basis points higher than gold over the second half of the sample


490 million kronen in gold bonds and 519 million kronen in silver bonds.
14
   This calculation relies upon the Fisher equation laid out below.
15
   While we would not ascribe the same importance to silver in the postwar period, observers such as Mundell (2003)
and Hanke (2010) have pointed to the US dollar serving an analogous role as a barometer of commodity price trends in
the modern era.
16
   A majority of the Austrian and Hungarian labor force remained in agriculture at this time, which still accounted for
54% and 73% of total employment in the respective economies in 1910 (Schulze 2007, p. 194).
17
   Our data are from the London and Amsterdam markets as reported in The Economist, The Times, and the
Amsterdamsch Effectenblad. The quotations are all in percent of par, thereby avoiding any exchange rate
complications stemming from variations in the relative valuations of gold, silver and paper currency. (See Neal (1990)
on the longstanding utilization of percent of par quotations on the London market.)

period– the period when Austria had become closely integrated with the gold bloc. All three bond

issues feature high levels of liquidity, with bid-ask spreads of 65 basis points for the paper bonds,

63 basis points for the silver bonds, and just 52 basis points for the gold bonds during 1880-1911.18

These bid-ask spreads compare favorably with the 150-450 basis point range identified by Alquist

(2008) for the London sovereign bond market over the 1871-1907 period.

           The silver and paper bond yields themselves not only feature similar trends but also match

each other over essentially every up and down that occurs over the more than 30 years of data.

Such co-movement is hard to credit unless investors treated the discount attributed to silver over

gold to be synonymous with the discount attached to paper assets in general. That is, silver price

expectations appear to have been indistinguishable from aggregate price expectations (as reflected

in the paper bond). Meanwhile, the divergence with gold remains strikingly higher. Table 2 reveals

that the average paper-gold spread is more than 29 times larger than the paper-silver spread over

the full sample, over 24 times higher during 1880-1895, and over 38 times higher during

1896-1913. Although Austria's move to shadow the gold standard is followed by much lower

standard deviations in the paper-gold spread after 1896, the shrinkage in the actual size of the

paper-gold spread is much less than the shrinkage in the paper-silver spread. This implies that,

irrespective of whether Austria was part of the gold bloc, a "silver rule" would have been much

more likely to stabilize aggregate prices than a gold-based policy. Using a simple policy focusing

only on silver, our results for Austria are consistent with Bordo, Dittmar and Gavin's (2007)

finding that Fisher's compensated dollar plan is superior to the gold standard.

B. Cointegration Tests

        The Fisher equation states that the nominal interest rate on a given sovereign debt

obligation is equal to the real interest rate plus the expected rate of inflation. Support for the

implied short-run relationship between expected inflation and nominal interest rates during the

gold standard era is obtained by Perez and Siegler (2003) using U.S. data as well as by Mitchener

and Weidenmier (2009) for the Austrian case. The nominal interest rate for Austrian paper bonds

can be written as:

         itP  rt   te,P ,                                                                             (2)

where rt is the real interest rate and  te , P is the expected rate of inflation for paper assets.

At the same time, the Fisher equation for Austrian silver bonds can be written as:

         itS  rt   te,S ,                                                                             (3)

where  te , S is the expected rate of inflation for silver assets.

        This leads to the testable proposition that, if real interest rates are the same for both

securities, the yields on paper and silver bonds will track one another so long as the expected rate

of inflation for paper assets matches the expected rate of inflation for silver assets. Such

co-movement is suggested in Figure 2 and implies that the two series should be cointegrated.

        In order to formally test the relationship between the silver and paper bond series, we first

determine whether they contain unit roots. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller-GLS test implies that

each series does, in fact, have a unit root. There is strong evidence of cointegration, however, and

the λMAX statistic from the Johansen procedure for the cointegrating equation below is significant

at better than the 99% confidence level – as is the coefficient on paper bonds:



the Austrian paper bonds were quoted only in the Amsterdamsch Effectenblad, which did not report bid-ask prices.
                                                       14
      Silvert  17.640  .960 Papert
                                                                                                                (4)
                            (.009)

The sample period for equation (4) is January 1880-1913. The standard error is in parentheses and

the λMAX statistic is equal to 143.753. The restriction that there is a one-to-one relationship

between silver and paper bonds can be rejected at the five-percent level of significance (even

though the coefficient on the paper interest rate is close to one).

         If we re-estimate the cointegrating equation over the second half of our sample, when

Austria had become more fully integrated with the gold bloc and bought and sold gold to peg the

price of its currency, the null hypothesis of no cointegration can again be rejected at better than the

99% confidence level. The λMAX statistic is equal to 63.8444. and we have:

     Silvert  17.112  1.027 Papert
                                                                                                                (5)
                           (.038)

The sample period for equation 5 is January 1896-1913. The restriction that the coefficient on

paper bonds equals one cannot be rejected at the 90% or 95% confidence level, thereby supporting

a one-to-one relationship between silver and paper bonds during the period when Austria

shadowed the gold standard.

         The econometric results therefore confirm a close and highly significant relationship

between the silver bond and paper bond yields that is indistinguishable from a one-to-one

mapping.19 Whereas Fisher's ideal index envisaged looking at a wide range of commodities, we

focus on only one – silver. These findings suggest that, at least over the period of the classical gold

standard, silver prices served as an excellent proxy for paper assets in general. This property

persists through Austria's move to a de facto gold standard near the mid-point of our sample period


19
  The results are in each instance robust to allowing for the addition of a time trend. Our analysis utilized a lag length
of ten based upon the AIC criterion.

and also survives silver's extended plunge in value against gold. Indeed, the near one-to-one ratio

between the Austrian silver and paper bonds is maintained despite the silver-gold ratio nearly

doubling from 18.0 in 1880 to 34.6 in 1913. While we have no way of eliminating the possibility

that the adoption of a silver rule would have disrupted the relationship in line with the Lucas

critique, it is not clear that such a policy move would have changed the landscape as much the

existing worldwide movement away from silver into gold that so dramatically transformed the

gold-silver relationship in the pre-World War I era.20



V. CONCLUSION

         In contrast to inflation targeting, the price-level targeting strategy of Irving Fisher provides

a clear commitment to reverse any under- or over-shooting in aggregate prices. This could not only

lower short-run variability in inflation and nominal interest rates, but also help ward off

expectations of deflation. Although a broadly-enough defined commodity basket as suggested by

Fisher (1920) would be an almost perfect target, we show in this paper that a simpler,

silver-focused strategy would have worked well in the past. Much importance was attached to

silver by contemporary observers under the classical gold standard and the Austrian data offer a

rare, if not unique, opportunity to test the empirical relevance of silver in the formation of

aggregate price expectations and its potential role in implementing Fisher’s compensating dollar

proposal. By comparing paper and silver bond yields for the same sovereign issuer over the same

sample period, we sidestep the otherwise insurmountable problem that the historical price indices

one would wish to set alongside the silver price series simply do not exist. Investors actually


20
  Naturally, any direct intervention in the silver market would be expected to disrupt this relationship – as with the
1934 Silver Purchase Act that had the effect of driving silver prices up far faster than prices in general as the US
government actions drew in silver stocks from all over the world, especially China (Burdekin 2008).
                                                          16
appear to have viewed the Austrian paper bonds and silver bonds as perfect substitutes, in turn

implying that the expected rate of inflation for silver relative to gold mirrored the expected rate of

inflation for paper assets in general. This not only supports Fisher's focus on a commodity-based

approach to inflation targeting, but also indicates that, at least in the pre-World War I period, a

singular focus on silver may have sufficed.
