                  The Adjustment Process and the
                  Timing of Trade Liberalization


                               ABSTRACT




     This paper examines the appropriate time path of the tariff rate for a

small open economy that has decided to move from protection of import competing

industries to free trade. Adjustment costs for moving resources to alternative

uses do not provide a rationale for gradual adjustment of the tariff rate because

in the absence of distortions, rational optimizing agents will make socially

appropriate investment decisions with respect to adjustment when they are qiven

correct price signals. Some distortions of the adjustment process imply the

desirability of gradual adjustment of the tariff rate to slow adjustment, but

other distortions imply the desirability of subsidizing imports in the short

run in order to speed movement of resources out of previously protected industries.

Concern with the income redistribution effects of reductions in the tariff rate

(which usually injure owners of factors in previously protected industries)

does provide a general rationale for a gradual move to free trade. The influence

of the unemployment consequences of tariff reduction on the appropriate path

of commercial policy depends on the nature and shape of the resoone of the rate

of resource reallocation to the level of unemployment in previously protected

industries.

Introduction and Summary

     This study is concerned with the appropriate time path of commercial policy

for a country that has already determined that a more liberal trade policy is in

its long run best interest. In contrast to the question of a country's best

static trade policy which has been extensively discussed in the economic literature,

the sublect of the present study has received scant attention.1 However, unless

one believes that most countries have already achieved their optimum trade

policies or that the best time path of policy is always and unquestionably to

move immediately to the best long run policy, then the question of the annrooriate

time path of commercial policy should be regarded as an interesting and iurnortant

issue.

     The approach that will be adopted in examining this issue in the present

study is to assume that a country with a high level of protection granted to

domestic industries that produce goods competing with imports has decided, for

whatever reasons, that a more liberal commercial policy, with a much lower level

of protection for import conmeting domestic industries, is in its long run best

interest. To keep matters as simple as possible, it will usually be assumed

that this country is sufficiently small that it has no influence on the world

prices of the goods it trades, and that there are no distortions or externalities

that make any policy other than complete free trade the optimal long run policy

for this country. The issue for policy makers in this country is how to alter

commercial policy over time in order to move in an optimal manner from a policy

that grants substantial protection to imnort competing industries to a policy

of free trade.

     This statement of the issue under study is not meant to suggest that the

problem with respect to the optimal path of commercial policy is always how

to move optimally to free trade. As is well known, there are circumstances

in which a country's best long run commercial policy is not free trade——especially

when its economy is infected by distortions that have some relationship to

international trade and that are beyond the scope of government policy to

eliminate completely. Rather, the suggestion is that by considering a simple

and well defined question, in the context of a well specified analytical structure,

some principles will emerge that will have relevance in more general situations.

Moreover, while the specific issue under study is the optimal path for commercial

policy leading from protectionism to free trade, the principles that emerge in

the exinination of this issue will presumably have some relevance for related

issues concerning domestic policies dealing with taxes, subsidies, price controls

and other government interventions into the economic system. No attemnt will be

made here, however, to draw any conclusions for this broader range of issues

from the present analysis.

    To limit further the range of the present investigation, it will consider

only the optimal path of commercial policy in a program of trade liberalization,

and not the appropriate paths of other policies that would normally be used in
                                     3



conjunction with, and in support of, commercial policy in a sensible and

comprehensive program of trade liberalization. Among the policies that will

not be considered are the monetary, fiscal, and exchange rate policies that

would have to be pursued in conjunction with a more liberal commercial policy

in order to insure an adequate level of aggregate demand and to prevent, to

the extent possible, the more liberal commercial policy from resulting in an

increase in the general level of unemployment. Also not considered are

policies of "adjustment assistance" that might be used either to facilitate

the movement of resources out of previously protected industries or to com-

pensate the owners of these resources for income lost due to the removal of

protection. Further, the only commercial policy that will be considered

explicitly is a tariff applied to imported products. No consideration will be

given to the interesting and important question of how to move from a complicated

system of tariffs, quotas, export taxes and subsidies, content requirements,

multiple exchange rates, and other commercial policy interventions to a more

uniform and liberal system of commercial policy.

     Having described the limitations of this study, it is now appropriate

to summarize the specific issues it does investigate and the results of this

investigation. First, the study considers the effect of adjustment costs

incurred in moving resources out of previously protected industries and into

other activities on the appropriate time path of trade liberalization. In the

absence of such costs, the economy could, in principle, adjust immediately to

the new long run equilibrium position consistent with its optimal long run

commercial policy. The question is——Then such instantaneous adjustment is not

possible because of costs incurred in moving resources, Is there a case for

moving more gradually from a policy of protectionism to a liberal trade policy?

The answer, in general, is no. Specifically, when private economic agents who
                                     4



control the disposition of productive resources have rational expectations which

allow them to calculate correctly the values of locating these resources in

alternative activities, and when there are no distortions of the adjustment

process that cause these agents to see private adjustment costs that differ

from social adjustment costs, then the adjustment process subsequent to an

immediate change of commercial policy to its long run optimum will be socially

efficient. By implication, a slowing down of the implementation of the policy

of trade liberalization, which would reduce the privately perceived incentive

to relocate resources outside of previously protected industries, would result

in less socially desirable adjustment path for the economy.

     Second, when there are distortions that affect the adjustment process, then

the strong presumption in favor of an immediate move to the best long run com-

mercial policy as the best time path of policy disappears. Unfortunately, for

the variety of distortions that might reasonably be thought to affect the adjust-

ment process, there is no general indication of how the time path of commercial

policy should deviate from the policy of an immediate move to the best long

run commercial policy. For some distortions, such as the distortion that arises

when economic agents hold static expectations concerning the incomes that will

be earned by factors located in different activities, adjustment occurs too

rapidly following an immediate move to the best long run commercial policy.

tn these cases, there is an argument for gradualism in reducing the level of

protection in order to slow down the adjustment process. For other distortions,

such as the distortion created by taxes on factor incomes which affect the

privately perceived benefits of factor movements, adjustment occurs too slowly

following an immediate move to the bet long run commercial policy. In these

cases, it is desirable for the level of protection initially to be reduced to

below its long run optimal level (imports or exports should be subsidized if
                                     5



free trade is the best long run policy) in order to increase the speed with

which resources are moved out of the previously protected industries. Thus,

no general case for gradualism in implementing a policy of trade liberalization

emerges from consideration of the implications of distortions that might affect

the adjustment process.

     Third, a general case for gradualism in trade liberalization can be based

on a desire to limit the income and wealth losses sustained by owners of resources

initially employed in protected industries. For reasons that will be discussed,

limitation of such losses may be a valid and Important objective of policy

makers even if the owners of these resources are not among the poorer members

of society (and even if their private losses do not correspond to any social

loss). Under reasonable assumptions about the structure of the economic system

including the nature of the adjustment process, it can be shown that a more

gradual policy of trade liberalization moderates the income and wealth losses

sustained by owners of resources initially employed in protected industries,

but at some cost in terms of the efficiency of the economy's adjustment path.

The issue for policy makers concerned with limiting the losses of these resource

owners is to make the appropriate trade off between limiting these losses and

securing reasonable efficiency of the adjustment process. Among the factors

that influence the nature of this trade off are the degree to which resources

employed in protected industries are specific to those industries and must be

allowed to depreciate In order to move them to other activities. When adjustment

must occur primarily through wearing out existing plant and equipment and by

waiting for skilled workers with specific human capital to retire, little may

be gained in terms of the efficiency of the adjustment process by pushing trade

liberalization more rapidly than the rate required to Induce no new capital to

be Invested and no new workers to train for skilled jobs in the previously

protected industries.

     Fourth and finally, the appropriate time path of commercial policy in a

program of trade liberalization may be influenced by the possibility that

resources employed in protected industries may become unemployed as a conse-

quence of reductions in the level of protection. Because of the difficulty

in specifying a completely satisfactory and widely acceptable model of why

resources become unemployed (and remain in that state for substantial periods),

the analysis of this issue in the present study is based on an assumed reduced

form relationship which relates the rate at which resources are moved out of

protected industries to the amount of unemployment experienced by resources that

continue to seek employment in these industries. Doubts about the existence

and stability of this reduced form relationship imply doubts about the validity

and generality of conclusions based upon its use. Accepting the general approach

as valid, however, the key result that emerges is that the optimal path of

commercial policy is the path that balances the marginal social cost of increased

unemployment of resources in protected industries (which results in a loss of

output) against the marginal social benefit of stimulating more rapid movement

of resources out of these industries. The time path of the level of protection

that maintains this balance depends critically on the shape of the reduced form

relationship between the rate of movement of resources and the level of unemployment.

With a proportional relationship, it turns out that the optimal long run commercial

policy is not free trade. This is so because when the economy gets sufficiently

close to its free trade equilibrium, the marginal social benefit of moving

additional resources out of protected industries becomes very small and ultimately

becomes smaller than the social cost for the output lost due to unemployment of

these resources. Along the path of convergence to this optimal long run commercial

policy, however, the level of protection exhibits peculiar rovershootingT behavior.

Specifically, in the optimal program of trade liberalization, the level of
                                      7




protection is initially reduced to below its long run optimal level (and perhaps

to below zero) and is subsequently raised back up to this optimal long run level.

This peculiarity disappears when the reduced form relationship between the rate

of resource reallocation and the level of unemployment is not proportional, but

instead has theproperty that the rate of resource reallocation relative to the

level of unemployment becomes large at low levels of unemployment. It is

argued that this property is reasonable if decisions about the industries of

employment for newly produced capital and new workers entering the labor force

are strongly influenced by relatively small differences in expected earnings

between industries. If this argument is generally correct, then the time path

of commerical policy that trades off appropriately the marginal social cost of

increased unemployment against the marginal social benefit of more rapid adjustment

will be a path along which the level of protection is gradually reduced to its

long run optimal level.

I. Adjustment Costs and the Timing of Trade Liberalization

     If productive resources could move costlessly and instantaneously among

alternative uses and product and factor prices adjusted immediately to clear

markets, there would be no interesting issue concerning the optimal timing

for a policy of trade liberalization. The optimal policy would be to move

immediately to the stance of commercial policy that is optimal in the long

run. For a small country without any monopoly power in trade and without any

domestic distortions requiring trade interventions as part of a second—best

policy regime, this optimal policy would be an immediate move to complete

free trade. For a more complicated economy, the optimal long run policy would

not necessarily be free trade, but it would still be optimal to move immediately

to this most desirable long run policy.

     In real world economies, of course, productive resources cannot be moved

instantaneously among alternative uses, and movement of many resources is a

costly activity either in terms of direct costs of movement or in terms of

foregone output while resources undergo transformations necessary to make them

productive in alternative uses. Because of the time and cost involved in moving

resources to alternative uses, the adjustment to any sudden change in economic

conditions, including a sudden shift to a liberal commercial policy regime,

will not occur all at once, but will be spread out over time. Moreover, during

the period of adlustment subsequent to a sudden trade liberalization, the value

of final output produced in the economy will be reduced to the extent that costs

are incurred in the adjustment process. Because these costs tend to be higher,

at a moment of time and in total, the more rapidly adjustment takes place, it

desirable that the economic system not adjust too rapidly to any change in

economic conditions. To some, this might suggest the desirability of slowing
                                      9



the process of trade liberalization in order to limit the costs that the economy

incurs in adjusting to the new, long run commercial policy regime.

     The main purpose of this section is to demonstrate that this intuitively

plausible notion is not in general correct. Even though adjustment costs rise

as the pace of adjustment quickens, it is not generally desirable to slow the

pace of trade liberalization in order to limit the cost of adjusting to the

new commercial policy regime. Provided that the economic agents who control

the allocation of resources perceive a private benefit from resource movements

that corresponds to the true social benefit, and provided that they see costs

of resource movements that correspond to true social costs, they will make the

socially correct decisions concerning the appropriate pace of adjustment subsequent

to an immediate trade liberalization. The case for gradualism in implementing

a policy of trade liberalization, therefore, depends on the existence of distor-

tions affecting the social efficiency of private decisions about resource move-

ment (discussed in section II), or on concern about the income redistribution

effects of a sudden trade liberalization (discussed in section III), or on the

unemployment effects of trade liberalization (discussed in section IV), rather

than on any general argument based on the existence of adjustment costs.

A. A Two—Sector Economy with Adjustment Costs

      To develop the main proposition concerning the influence of adjustment

costs on the appropriate timing of trade liberalization, it suffices to consider

a relatively simple model of a two—sector economy. It is assumed that the output

of the protected sector, X, and the output of the rest of the economy, Z, are

produced in accord with standard, neo—classical, constant—returns—to—scale

production functions, using two inputs, labor and capital:

(1)        X =
                 F(L)(   Kx)
           z =
(2)
                 C(L     Kz)
Labor is assumed to be freely and instantaneously mobile between X and Z, but

capital (which presumably includes human capital) is assumed to be specific,

at least at a moment of time, to the industry where it is located. The assump-

tion of free mobility of labor is intended as a convenient simplifying assumption,

not as a description of the situation of most workers in a real world economy.

      An essential element of the present model is the specification of the

technology of the adjustment process for the redistribution of existing capital

and for the construction and allocation of new capital. There are many ways in

which the technologies of these two adjustment activities might be specified

that would be consistent with the assumption that they are resource—using

activities with rising marginal costs——the assumption that is crucial for the

conclusions of the present analysis. For analytical simplicity, it is convenient

to assume that these two adjustment activities are pursued separately and that

each utilizes only labor in its production process. Formally, it is assumed

that the amounts of labor used in capital movement, LN, and in investment in

new capital, L1, are determined by

           LM =   1J(IMI),     i(O) =    0,   '    > 0,   iv"   >0

           L1 =   cIJ),        (O)   =   0,   ' > 0,      "     >0
                                                   11




where M is the rate of movement of old capital out of Z and into X. and I is

the rate of production of new capital which may be allocated to either industry

to replace depreciating old capital or to add to the industry's capital stock.

Taking account of movement of old capital, allocation of new capital, and

depreciation of old capital, the rules governing the rates of change of the

capital stocks in the two industries are given by

(5)
          Kx=M+Ix_•Kx
(6)
          Kz=_M+Iz_6•Kz
where I >      C)   and        >    0 are the amounts of new capital allocated to X and Z,

respectively, subject to the constraint

(7)                 +      =   I,
and where cS        is   the deoreciation rate of capital which is assumed to be the same

for both industries.

      Aside from the assumption that capital movement and investment in new capital

use only labor as a factor of production, this specification of the technology

of the adjustment process captures, in a stylized form, key elements of the

processes governing adjustments of physical and human capital in actual economies.

Many types of existing plant and equipment can be transferred to alternative

uses, but usually only at some cost for restructuring, remodeling, retooling,

or relocation. In addition, physical capital may be transferred to alternative

uses by allowing existing plant and equipment to depreciate and by locating the

new capital that corresponds to such depreciation in some other industry.

Similarly, for human capital, it is possible to retrain and relocate workers

who have already acquired substantial human capital that is specific to a

particular industry. It is also possible to achieve a reallocation of human

capital by not replacing retiring workers in one industry and training new

entrants to the labor force in the skills required for other industries.

      Given the specification of the technology for producing the final outputs

X and Z and the technology of the adjustment process, we may address the question

of the optimal timing of trade liberalization by considering the considering

the policy that would be adopted by a social planner whose objective Is to

maximize the welfare of a representative consumer in the economy. Assuming

for simplicity that the economy is small and takes the world relative price

of X in terms of Z, denoted by P, and the world interest, r, as given, the

objective of this social planner may be stated as the maximization of the

present discounted value of the economy's final output, V, as defined by


(8)       V =   f0 [P F(Lx, Kx) + G(L , K )Iexp(—rt)
                                   z    z
                                                       dt,


subject to the technology of the adjustment process specified in (3) through

(7), and subject to the overall employment constraint,

(9)
          Lx+Lz4LM+LIL,
where L is the fixed supply of freely mobile labor) The Initial condition for

this dynamic optimization problem is determined by the initial amounts of capital

that are located in the X and Z industries, Kx(O) and K(O). Since the initial

state of the economy is assumed to be the long run equilibrium position for the

economy before trade liberalization when the X industry was protected by an

import tariff, it is correct to assume that K(O) exceeds the equilibrium size

of the capital stock in X that is appropriate under free trade, K, and that

Kz(O) is less than the equilibrium size of the capital stock in Z that is

appropriate under free trade,



1. Since the optimum policy is to move immediately to free trade, we may safely
disregard the consumption distortion cost of a tariff. We could treat the case
where the interest rate is endogenously determined by equilibrium in the domestic
credit market (with no international capital mobility), but this would complicate
the analysis without altering its basic conclusions. If the country faced an
upward rising foreign borrowing cost schedule, the planner would need to tax
                                          13



       Without going into the formal details of the analysis of the planner's

optimization problem (which are discussed in an appendix), it is possible to

explain the economic principles that govern the planner's behavior. The

world market price of X in terms of Z, P. tells the planner the correct way

to value output of X in terms of output of Z. In addition to this price,

the planner needs to calculate a shadow price for a unit of capital located

in X, denoted by p, and a shadow price for a unit of capital located in Z,

denoted by pg,, and a, shadow wage rate for a unit of mobile labor, denoted by w.

The appropriate shadow prices for units of capital located in the two industries

are the present discounted values of the value of the marginal product of capital

in the respective Industries, adjusted for the rate of depreciation of capital;


(10)       Px(t) =   I PFL(Lx(s),     K(s))exp(_(r+).(s_t)) ds

(11)       z(t) =    I   GL(L?(s),   Kz(s)).exp(_(r+).(s_t)) ds


       Given the socially correct prices for output of X and for units of capital

located in the two industries, the planner sets the shadow wage rate to achieve

the socially appropriate distribution of labor among X production, Z production,

movement of existing capital, and production of new capital. The correct amount

of labor to employ in X is the amount for which the value of the marginal product

of labor in X, PFL(Lx, Kx), is equal to the shadow wage rate, w. Taking account

of constant returns to scale In production of X, this amount of labor can be
                 d             d
expressed as Kx9.x(w/P), where 9(w/P) is the labor demand function of an



foreign borrowing at a rate that would make the privately perceived cost of
such borrowing correspond to the true social cost. With this tax in place,
however, there would be no reason for gradualism in trade policy.
2. In the present model, the long run stock of capital,           + Kz, is not fixed.
It is possible to show that if X production is relatively labor intensive, the
long run stock of capital will rise due to the removal of protection; whereas
it will decline if X production is relatively capital intensive.

X producer with one unit of capital. Similarly, the correct amount of labor

to employ in Z is determined by the requirement that the value of the marginal

product of labor in Z, GL(L7, Kz), equal W; and is equal to K7'9(U), where

        is the labor demand function of a Z producer with one unit of capital.

       The correct amount of labor to employ in moving existing capital is

determined by the requirement that the marginal social cost of this activity

must equal the marginal social benefit. The marginal social cost of capital

movement is equal to the shadow wage rate (which measures the social cost of

a unit of labor) multiplied by the amount of labor required for a marginal

increment in the race of capital movement, lp'(INI). As shown in figure 1, the

marginal social cost of capital movement, for a given W,       is   an increasing

function of the rate of capital movement, MI. The marginal benefit of capital

movement is equal to the absolute value of the difference between the shadow

prices of capital in the two industries, with the sign of the difference

determining the appropriate direction of capital movement. Thus, as illustrated

in figure 1, when      =           =    and W   = (' the   appropriate rate of capital

movement is 1M01 and the appropriate direction of capital movement is out of X

and into Z. Applying this condition more generally, we determine that the

appropriate amount of labor to employ in capital movement is given by


(12)
           L(w/IPx   - 7I)   =


       The correct amount of labor to employ in producing new capital is determined

by the requirement that the marginal social cost of investment in new capital

must equal the marginal social benefit. The marginal social cost of new investment

is equal to the shadow wage rate multiplied by the amount of labor required for

an increment in investment, '(I). Since it does not make economic sense to

locate any new capital in the industry with a lower shadow value of capital,

the marginal benefit of investment in new capital is determined by the shadow

price of capital for the industry with the higher shadow price of capital;

that is, by p = maximum of p and           As illustrated in figure 2, therefore,

the correct amount of investment in new capital is determined by the condition

that the marginal cost of such investment equal p. From this condition, we

determine that the correct amount of labor to employ in producing new capital

is given by

(13)       T4(w/) =

       Adding together the amounts of labor allocated to its four different
uses, it follows that the total amount of labor allocated by the social planner

is given by

(14)                              P) =
           Ld(w, 1'x' 1z' Kx.            K.4(wIP) + Kz.9(w) + L(w/ki_p)
                                              + L1(w/inax( p,

The constraint that the total amount of labor allocated must equal the available

supply, that is,

(15)        Ld(w, 'x' 'z' Kx, Kz, P) =

determines the appropriate value of the shadow wage rate, given the shadow prices
of capital for the two industries, the amounts of capital in the two industries,

and the relative output price.

       With the determination of the shadow wage rate, every aspect of the planner's

optimal behavior at a moment of time is completely determined. Specifically,

the allocation of labor among its four uses determines the outputs of X and Z,

the rate of movement of existing capital between industries, and the rate of

production of new capital. The sign of the difference between         and

determines the direction of movement of existing capital and the allocation of

all new capital to the industry with the higher shadow price of capital.

     Starting from the long run equilibrium position of the economy when the

X industry is protected by a tariff, the tath that the economy will traverse

under the guidance of the social planner may be described as follows.     Since

at the starting point for the economy, the capital stock in X is too large

and the capital stock in Z is too small, relative to their appropriate long

run equilibrium levels under free trade, the initial shadow price for a unit

of capital in X,        is less than the initial shadow price for a unit of

capital in Z,         This implies that at the starting point along the

economy's optimal path, the planner allocates a positive amount of labor to

the task of moving existing capital out of X and into Z. In addition, the

planner directs that all newly produced capital be located in the Z industry.

The result is that the stock of capital in X declines through outward movement

of existing capital and through depreciation, while the stock of capital in Z

grows because of inward movement of existing capital and because the total

amount of newly produced capital that is all allocated to this industry exceeds

depreciation of existing capital. As Kx declines and K7 rises, the differential

between    and ii? narrows and the rate of movement of existing capital out of X

and into Z declines. All newly produced capital, however, continues to be

allocated to the Z industry. Ultimately, a point is reached where the value

of the marginal product of capital in X is equal to the value of the marginal

product of capital in Z, and this condition is subsequently maintained so that

   thereafter remains equal to p. When this point is reached, the economy

will not, in general, have yet reached the long run equilibrium position appro-

priate for free trade. Subsequent adjustment does not involve any movement of

existing capital out of X and into Z, since devoting resources to this activity

is not optimal when    equals p7. Rather, adjustment is achieved by distributing

newly produced capital between X and Z in an appropriate manner, with the share
                                     19




of investment going to X gradually rising (from zero) and the share of invest-

ment going to Z gradually declining (from unity) until the level and distribution

of the capital stock reaches the long run equilibrium level and distribution

of capital appropriate for free trade.

     It should be noted that for the planner to move the economy along this

optimal adjustment path, he must calculate the appropriate time paths for the

shadow prices of units of capital in the two industries. At any given date,

these shadow prices depend on the present discounted value of the value of

the marginal product of capital in the respective industries. To know what

these shadow prices should be, therefore, the planner must know the future course

of the amounts of labor and capital that will be employed in the two industries.

The future course of these variables, however, depends on the future course of

the shadow prices for units of capital in the two industries. Hence, to move

the economy along its optimal adjustment path, the planner must solve a complex

dynamic optimization problem in which he jointly and simultaneously determines

the appropriate paths for the shadow prices of capital in the two industries

and the appropriate paths for the amounts of labor and capital employed in

these industries and the amounts of labor allocated to movement of existing

capital and production of new capital.

B. Optimal Commercial Policy with Private Agents

     When decisions about the allocation of resources are made by private

economic agents rather than by an all powerful social planner, government

policy influences the adjustment path of the economy only indirectly by

affecting the economic conditions that influence the decisions of these

agents. The issue with respect to the optimal timing of trade liberalization

is how the government should vary the level of protection over time in order

to induce private economic agents to follow a socially optimal adjustment

path. If there are no distortions in the economic system other than the

pre—existing protection granted to import competing industries, and if private

economic agents have rational expectations about future economic conditions

relevant to their current decisions, it can be shown that the optimal policy

is to reduce the level of protection immediately to its long run optimum level

and to allow private agents to adjust as they see fit to this change in economic

circumstances. In particular, for small country that was described analytically

in the preceding subsection, the optimal policy is to cut the import tariff rate

immediately to zero and hold it there permanently.

     To understand why this policy of an immediate move to free trade induces

private economic agents to pursue a socially optimal adjustment path, it is

useful to consider the way in which such agents, acting exclusively in their

own private interest, would determine the adjustment path of the economy.

Economic agents who own units of capital in the X and Z industries must decide

at each moment of time whether they wish to retain their capital in its present

industry or pay the cost of moving it to the other industry. They must also

decide on the amount of new capital they wish to purchase to replace capital that

is depreciating or to add to their stock of capital and on the industry in which
                                            21



to locate this new capital. To make these decisions, these agents need to

calculate the value (to them) of a unit of capital located in each of the two

industries. Since there are no distortions in the economy, these agents face

the same interest rate as the social planner and Income from each unit of capital

that is equal to the value of the marginal product of capital in the industry

where the capital is located, adjusted for the physical depreciation of capital

at the rate .      By the assumption of rationality of expectations, the path that

these agents will expect the value of the marginal product of capital to follow

in each industry will correspond to the path that is calculated by the social

planner.    Hence, the values that private agents will assign to units of capital

located in the two industries will correspond to the shadow prices,
                                                                           li and 117
that are calculated by the social planner, as defined in equations (10) and (11).

Indeed, if there were a market in which economic agents could trade claims to

units of capital located in the two Industries,           and    would be the market

prices of these claims.

     Given the values that agents assign to units of capital in the two Industries,

the benefit that they will see from moving an existing unit of capital out of X

and into Z must be the difference between           and      This difference determines

the price owners of capital will be willing to pay for the service of moving

capital out of X and into Z.         In figure 1, this fact is represented by showing

a horizontal demand curve for the service of movement of capital at a height

equal to [IJXO —              The supply curve of producers of this service must
                   'zot   .




correspond (under the assumed absence of all distortions) to the marginal cost

curve for producing this service, as determined by the wage rate that producers

of this service must pay for the labor they employ, multiplied by the amount of

labor required to produce a marginal increment in this service. It follows that

if the wage rate paid by producers of this service is the same as the shadow
                                        22



wage rate used by the social planner, the amount of capital movement determined

by the equilibrium of demand and supply of this service on the part of private

agents will correspond exactly to the amount determined by the social planner.

Obviously, the direction of movement of existing capital determined by private

agents (out of the industry with the lower value of capital and Into the industry

with the higher value of capital) is the same as that determined by the social

planner.

     With respect to investment in new capital, It is clear that private agents

will direct all such Investment into the industry with a higher value of capital,

since to do otherwise would imply a loss to the owner of new capital relative to

what he could costlessly achieve by making the socially correct decision concerning

the distribution of newly produced capital) It follows that the value that

private agents will assign to newly produced capital is the value of a unit of

capital in the industry where capital has Its highest value; that is, the same

value p max[p, p1J that is used by the social planner to determine the benefit

of investment in new capital. This value to capital owners of newly produced

capital Is the demand price that faces suppliers of such capital, as represented

by the horizontal demand curve at height p in figure 2. The supply curve for

new capital corresponds to the marginal cost curve for its producers, as

determined by the wage rate multiplied by the amount of labor required to

increase new capital production by a marginal unit. It follows that if the wage

rate facing producers of new capital is the same as the shadow wage rate used

by the social planner, then the level of new capital production determined by

private agents (as well as its distribution) will be the same as that determined

by the social planner.



1. When p =           private agents will also behave exactly like the social planner
                p7,
in allocating investment between X and Z so as to keep the economy along its
optimal path.
                                        23




     The wage rate that faces suppliers of new capital and of the service of

capital movement in the economy controlled by the behavior of private agents

must be the same as the shadow wage rate used by the social planner because

the condition of labor market equilibrium in the privately controlled economy

is the same as the condition (15) that the planner uses to determine the

appropriate value of the shadow wage rate. Specifically, since labor is

freely mobile between its four productive uses, it is clear that maximizing

behavior by workers who supply a fixed amount of labor L will compel the wage

rate to be the same for all demanders of labor. The demand for labor in each

of these uses is determined in the privately controlled economy by the same

functional relationship that the planner uses to allocate labor to each use.

Producers of X and producers of Z each demand labor up to the point where the

value of the marginal product of labor in their respective industries is equal

to the market wage rate. Movers of existing capital and producers of new

capital demand labor up to the point where the value of its marginal product

in their respective activities (using p —         as the price of the service

of capital movement and p =            p] as the price of new capital) is equal
                              max[p,
to the market wage rate. Since the sum of these four demand functions yields

the aggregate labor demand function defined in (13), and since the supply of

labor L is the same as for the social planner, it follows that the market equili-

brium wage rate implied by the behavior of individual economic agents is the

same as the shadow wage rate used by the social planner. This, in turn,

guarantees that all aspects of the behavior of the economy when it is controlled

by the behavior of individual economic agents are the same as when it is under

the control of the social planner.

    If the tariff imposed on imported units of X were not immediately reduced

to zero at the start of the process of trade liberalization, the economy would
                                     24



not converge to its appropriate long run equilibrium position along the socially

optimal adjustment path. This is so because with a positive tariff remaining

imports of X, domestic producers of X will see a price for their output that

exceeds Its true social value.1 Consequently, they will employ more labor in

producing X than is socially desirable, at the expense of other more valuable

uses of this labor. Moreover, because the market price of domestically produced

X is kept artificially high by a tariff, owners of capital in X will see a

value of the marginal product of this capital which exceeds the true social

value of its marginal product and will calculate a value for a unit of this

capital that exceeds its true social value. This will slow down the rate at

which existing capital is moved out of X and into Z to below the socially

optimal rate. In addition, because the increased use of labor in X comes

partly at the expense of labor that should be used in Z, the value of the

marginal product of capital in Z will be reduced to below its socially appro-

priate level (along the economy's optimal adjustment path), resulting in a

reduction in the value assigned to a unit of capital located in Z (relative to

its value along the economy's optimal adlustment path). Since the value of

a unit of capital in Z is the demand price for new capital that determines the

rate of production of new capital, this reduction in the value of a unit of

capital in Z implies that adjustment through production of new capital and its

location in Z will proceed at less than the socially optimal rate.2 Thus,

any policy of gradually reducing the tariff rate to zero, rather than reducing it

all at once, results in a suboptimal adjustment path.



1. In addition, so long as any tariff remains in effect, there is a consumption
distortion loss that results from this tariff.

2. Even if there is no immediate reduction in the tariff rate but only an
announcement of reductions to occur in the future, the value of a unit of capital
in X will fall relative to the value of a unit of capital in Z. Thus, the effect
of any program of trade liberalization should be to make the value of a unit of
capital in Z the effective determinant of the demand price for additions to
the capital stock.
                                      25



      If the assumptions about the structure of the economy or about the tech-

nology of the adjustment process were modified from those described in the

previous subsection, the description of the optimal policy of the social

planner and of the behavior of the economy when under the control of private

agents would require corresponding modification. The basic conclusion of the

present discussion, however, would not be modified. In the absence of distortions

in the economy other than protection and with rationality of expectations on

the part of private agents, immediate cutting of the level of protection to

zero will be the optimal path of commercial policy (for a small country). The

reason is that this policy provides private economic agents with the correct

price signals upon which to base their individual decisions with respect to

the allocation of the economy's scarce resources. These are the signals that

make the privately perceived costs and benefits of any action correspond to

its true social costs and benefits and, hence, lead individual economic agents

to behave in a way that is consistent with the maximization of social welfare.

     This proposition, of course, is not new in economics. It dates back to

Adam Smith's description of the mechanism of the "invisible hand" through which

the forces of competition in an economic system compel individual agents who

seek only their own interest to serve the social interest. The main point of

the present discussion is that the validity of this proposition is not suspended

in an economic system where the movement of resources among alternative uses is

a time consuming and costly activity and where the agents who control the

disposition of these resources must solve dynamic rather than static optimization

problems.

II. Distortions of the Adiustment Process

     A key assumption in demonstrating the desirability of free trade as a

country's optimal static commercial policy is that its economy is free of

distortions other than the distortions that would be introduced by some other

commercial policy. When this assumption is invalid because the country has

market power in some of its exports or imports or because there are externalities

associated with producing or consuming these products or because of other rele-

vant distortions, free trade is not, in general, the best static commercial

policy. Similar reasoning, suggests that while an immediate move to a country's

best long run commercial policy is the best time path for commercial policy in

the absence of distortions affecting the adjustment process, it is not necessarily

the best path in the presence of such distortions. However, in contrast to the

theory of static commercial policy, where we have some understanding of the

distortions that would justify specific divergences from free trade, we have as

yet little understanding of the distortions of the adjustment process that would

justify gradualism in moving commercial policy to its long run optimum. Indeed,

nothing rules out the possibility that the optimal path for commercial policy

in an economy with excessive protection and with other distortions affecting the

adjustment process would be to reduce the level of protection initially to below

its long run optimal level in order to speed the movement of resources out of

previously protected activities.

     The purpose of this section is to examine the implications of a variety

of distortions that might affect the adjustment process for the optimal path

of commercial policy. For simplicity, we will focus on the case of a small

country where the optimal long run commercial policy is free trade, but where

imports are initially restricted by a tariff.   The analysis is based on the
                                      27




model presented in the preceding section. No attempt will be made, however,

 to demonstrate rigorously the conclusions of the present analysis (though such

a demonstration is certainly possible). Rather, the discussion will be directed

 toward explaining the economic rationale for these conclusions and suggesting

the generality of their application. To limit somewhat the range of discussion,

we will consider only the implications of distortions of the adjustment process

for the optimal path of the tariff rate, and we will ignore the importance

of other policies that might be used in conjunction with variations in the tariff

rate to offset these distortions and obtain a more efficient adjustment path)

A. Distortions Arising from the Tax System

      One potentially important cause of distortions in the adjustment process

arises from taxes that governments impose on incomes and on products. Consider

specifically, a general income tax levied on all factor incomes or on income

from capital (the resource that is subject to costly and time consuming adjust-

ment in response to trade liberalization). Such a tax distorts the adjustment

process because it reduces the privately perceived benefit of adjustment to

below the true social benefit. As discussed in the preceding section, the

true social benefit of moving capital out of the previously protected

industry, X, and into the other industry, Z, is equal to the difference between

the present discounted value of the value of the marginal product of capital in

in the two industries.   When income from capital is not taxed and private

capital owners have rational expectations and face the same interest rate as

the social planner, the privately perceived benefit of capital movement will

correspond to the true social benefit. However, when the income of capital is



1.   Some of the policies that might be used to offset distortions affecting the
adjustment  process are examined in Mussa (1982b).
                                     28



taxed, private capital owners will see only the present discounted value of the

after tax difference in returns to capital in the two industries as the benefit

they will receive from costly investments in moving capital out of the previously

protected industry. Accordingly, if the tariff Is immediately reduced to zero

in the program of trade liberalization, adjustment through the movement of

existing capital would proceed at less than the socially optimal rate. Moreover,

taxation of income from capital which reduces the present discounted value of

the after tax return to capital in both industries reduces the aggregate level

of investment in new capital and, hence, slows down the process of adlustment

through location of new capital in the Z industry. In this situation (if the

tax on factor incomes or on income from capital cannot be eliminated or offset

by an investment tax credit), it is surely not desirable to slow down the process

of trade liberalization since adjustment is already too slow. If anything, it

would be desirable to reduce the tariff rate initially to below its optimal long

run level (that is, to subsized imports initially) in order to stimulate more

rapid adlustment.

     The distortionary effect of product taxes on the adlustment process is less

clear than for income taxes since the effect clearly depends on the particular

products being taxed and on their role in the adjustment process.   If products

used in moving existing capital among industries are heavily taxed, then the

privately perceived cost of adjustment through movement of existing capital will

exceed the true social cost, and adlustment will occur too slowly. On the other

hand, if these products are subsidized, adjustment will occur too rapidly. The

case for gradualism in reducing the tariff rate would be strengthened if the

latter form of distortion is more important than the former.
                                     29



B. Distortions Arising in the Capital Market


     Another important source of distortions that might affect the adjustment

process and the appropriate path of trade liberalization arises from distortions

in the capital market. One such distortion would be a divergence between the

discount rate used by private capital owners in valuing future income streams

and the appropriate social discount rate used by the social planner.    The

usual assumption here is that the social discount rate is tvically lower than

the private discount rate. If so, then the privately perceived benefit of moving

existing capital or investing in new capital will be below the true social benefit.

This means that adjustment in response to an immediate reduction of the tariff

rate to zero will proceed at less than the socially optimal rate. To correct

this problem it would clearly not be desirable to slow down the process of trade

liberalization. If anything, it would be desirable to spur adjustment by initially

subsidizing imports and gradually reducing this subsidy as the economy approaches

its long run equilibrium.

     In many countries, capital markets are also distorted because credit is

not allocated among firms in an efficient manner through freely functioning

credit markets. If existing firms in the protected industry receive allocations

of cheap credit that they would lose if they shifted their activities to another

industry, or if new entrants to industries that should expand as a consequence

of a move to free trade do not have adequate access to credit at interest rates

that reflect its social cost, then the process of adlustment subsequent to art

immediate move to free trade would be impeded. If this situation cannot be

remedied by altering the policies that control the allocation of credit, it might

be desirable to increase the incentive for more rapid adjustment by initially

subsidizing imports. Such a policy could easily backfire, however, if the
                                     30




financial institutions that have granted credit to the previously protected

sector feel compelled to continue to extend credit (or even expand credit)

to these enterprises rather than write off bad loans and visibly impair their

own financial condition. In this situation, a more gradual reduction in the

level of protection might be desirable as a means of allowing credit to be

withdrawn from firms In the protected industries and reallocated to firms in

expanding industries.

     Capital markets would also be distorted if the country as a whole faced

an upward rising supply schedule for foreign loans, but individual enterprises

believed that they faced a horizontal supply curve for their own foreign

borrowings at an interest rate equal to the average interest rate for the

country as a whole. To correct this distortion, the government should tax

all foreign borrowing at a rate that makes the private cost of such borrowing

correspond to its true social cost. In the absence of such a tax, the private

discount rate will he less than the social discount rate, implying that the

privately perceived benefit of adjustment in response to an immediate move to

free trade exceeds the true social benefit. To retard what would otherwise

be an overly rapid adjustment to free trade (and an excessive accumulation of

foreign debt to finance such adjustment), it would be appropriate to reduce the

tariff rate gradually to zero, rather than doing so all at once.

C. Distortions Arising from Errors in Expectations

     To determine the benefit of moving capital out of the previously protected

industry and of investing new capital in the other industry, private capital

owners must calculate calculate the values of units of capital located in these

two industries. Such calculations are necessarily based on expectations concerning

the future paths of the earnings of units of capital located in these industries.
                                     31



If these expectations are not correct, then private capital owners will assign

incorrect values to units of capital in the two industries and the adjustment

process will be distorted. For example, if capital owners had "static expecta-

tions" under which they always expected that current returns to'capital in each

industry would persist into the indefinite future, then the privately calculated

value of moving capital out of X and into Z subsequent to an immediate reduction

in the tariff rate to zero would exceed the true social value of such a movement

of capital.   Adjustment through movement of existing capital would proceed

more rapidly than is socially optimal. To correct this problem, it would be

appropriate to slow down the rate at which the tariff is reduced in order to

make the privately perceived benefit of capital movement (for capital owners

who have static expectations) correspond more closely to the true social benefit

of such capital movement.

     There is no good reason to believe, however, that capital owners will always

expect that current differences between returns to capital will persist into

the indefinite future. They well might recognize that as capital moves out of

the previously protected industry and as new investment is concentrated in other

industries, the differential between the return to capital in these other indus-

tries and the return to capital in the previously protected industry

will gradually diminish. If the rate at which they expect this differential

to diminish is greater than the rate at which it would diminish (along the socially

optimal adjustment path), then private capital owners will calculate too small

a benefit from capital movement and adjustment through this process will proceed

too slowly. To correct this problem, it would be approDriate to subsize imports

initially in order to stimulate more rapid adjustment.

    A specific problem concerning errors in expectations arises in regard to

expectations concerning the future course of the governments commercial policy.
                                     32



The government might reduce the tariff rate to zero and announce its commitment

to a continuing policy of free trade, but private agents might not believe that

the government (or its successors) would actually continue to pursue this policy

or at least might perceive a positive probability of a policy reversal. Unless

private agents perceive an offsetting possibility that the government might go

beyond a policy of free trade and subsidize imports (or subsidize exports), the

value that they will assign to moving capital out of the previously protected

industry, taking account of the possibility of a policy reversal, will be less

than the social value of such capital movement. For this reason, adjustment to

the new policy of free trade will proceed at less than the socially optimal rate.

To correct this problem the government might wish to subsidize imports initially

which will stimulate move rapid adjustment both by its direct effect on the

actual returns to capital in the two industries and by its indirect effect of

pursuading private capital owners of the possibility of such an action in the

future.

     The difficulty with this solution to the problem of persuading private

agents of the government's commitment to a more liberal commercial policy is

that the government might be compelled by political pressures to modify its

policy, or might be replaced by another government so inclined. The likelihood

that political pressures will compel a policy reversal may well be positively

related to the aggressiveness of the liberalization policy. Thus, a policy of

an immediate move to free trade or beyond that to the subsidization of imports

might be thought so unlikely to survive that it would actually stimulate less

rapid adjustment than a policy of more gradual liberalization) On the other


1. If a rapid reversal of a policy of trade liberalization is anticipated there
may be a surge of imports (particularly of capital goods and consumer durables)
as consumers attempt to take advantage of what they regard as a temporary oppor-
tunity to buy these goods at low prices. Such an import surge, in turn, makes
it more difficult to sustain the policy of trade liberalization.
                                     33



hand, a policy of very gradual liberalization might be regarded as such a

concession of political and weakness and indecision on the part of the govern-

ment that it would have no credibility with private agents and would stimulate

little or no adjustment. A balance must be struck, therefore, between a policy

that is so aggressive that reversal is thought highly probable and a policy

that is so feeble that it too lacks credibility.


D. Distortions Arising from Monotoly and Monopsony Behavior

    The exercise of monopoly or monopsony power distorts the economic system

by creating divergences between the effective price or cost of a product or

factor to its purchaser and the marginal cost to its supplier. Exercise of

such power either by the suppliers of services used in the adjustment process

or by the suppliers of factors used in producing such services should normally

result in a slowing of the adjustment process to less than its socially optimal

rate. If this problem could not be addressed directly, it might provide an

argument for a policy of reducing the level of protection initially to less

than its optimal steady state level in order to induce more rapid adjustment.

However, in the absence of specific evidence of the importance of monopoly and

monopsony behavior in the activities involved in the adjustment process, this

seems like a rather weak reed upon which to base a general argument for ati

excessively aggressive path of commercial policy.

    Another circumstance in which the exercise of market power would impede

the adjustment process in response to a trade liberalization is if firms in

the industries benefited by liberalization are able to impede the entry of

new firms and new capital into these industries or if workers and labor unions

are able to impede the entry of new workers. Suppose, for example, that a

labor union in the Z industry of the model described in the preceding section
                                     34




is able to prevent entry of any new workers into that industry subsequent to

a trade liberalization and that all workers not in that industry remain fully

employed but at wage rates that are below the wage paid to workers in Z. In

this case it can be shown that if there are no other distortions in the economic

system, the optimal time path for commercial policy is to move immediately to

free trade. This policy does not result in the same adjustment path for the

economy (or the same long run equilibrium) as would prevail in the absence of

the barrier to the movement of labor into the Z industry. But, taking this

barrier as given, this is still the best path for commercial policy.

     This conclusion would be altered if the barrier to the movement into the

Z industry was not absolute but tended to break down over time at a rate that

is positively related to the differential between the wage earned by workers

in Z and the wage prevailing elsewhere in the economy. Maintaining the assump-

tion that labor always remains fully employed, it can be shown that there is

a social gain from initially reducing the tariff rate to less than zero (subsi-

dizing imports or subsidizing exports) in order to speed the movement of labor

into the Z industry. This conclusion might be reversed, however, If labor

outside the Z industry became unemployed with the amount of such unemployment

depending (as it does in the Harris—Todaro (1970) model) on the differential

between the wage rate in Z and the wage rate in other activities.


E. Distortions Arising from Price Rigidities

     Failure of prices to adjust immediately (or ever) to market clearing levels

due to government controls or rigidities in the operation of price adlustment

mechanisms are another source of distbrtions that might affect the optimal timing

of trade liberalization. Consider specifically the case of a minimum wage rate

fixed by law that cannot be altered in connection with the policy of trade
                                     35



liberalization. To eliminate the possibility that monetary and exchange rate

policy could be used to neutralize the effects of this minimum wage by raising

the general price level, suppose that the minimum wage is Indexed to the cost

of a consumption basket that includes the economy's two final goods, X and Z.

Further, suppose that the wage rate prior to the removal of protection from

the X industry is above the legal minimum, that it would fall to less than the

legal minimum as an immediate consequence of the removal of all protection from

X if all labor remained employed, but that its long run equilibrium level

under free trade would exceed both the legal minimum and the level prevailing

prior to the removal of protection from the X industry.2 In these circumstances

it may be desirable to cut the tariff rate immediately only to the level at

which the equilibrium wage rate with all labor employed is equal to the legal

minimum wage. This will be so if the marginal social cost from the unemployment

resulting from a further reduction in the tariff rate exceeds the benefit of

such a reduction in reducing the consumption distortion cost of the tariff and

in speeding the adjustment of the economy toward its optimal steady state position.

On the other hand, it is possible that the optimal commercial policy would be

to reduce the tariff rate initially to below zero. This can happen because a

lower tariff rate creates a greater incentive to move   capital out of X and into Z,
and the more rapidly capital moves in this direction the more rapidly the wage

rate that is consistent with labor market equilibrium with full employment

rises above the legally required minimum wage.

    This analysis of the effects of a minimum wage can be extended to more

realistic descriptions of conditions prevailing in labor markets and more



1. See van Wijnbergen (1983) for an interesting analysis of implications of
wage indexing for the effectiveness of commercial policy as a means of stimulating
employment.

2. In the model of the preceding section, if Z production is labor intensive
in long run equilibrium, then the long run effect of a reduction in protection
of X should be an increase in the wage rate in terms of both final products.
                                       36



generally in the economy. It might be assumed, for example, that individual

workers differ in the amounts of labor that they can supply in each industry,

measured in efficiency units. This would introduce the possibility that workers

in the same industry and in different industries could earn different wage rates

as an equilibrium phenomenon, and it would allow for the result that a minimum

wage would exclude specific workers from employment) The ambiguity would still

remain, however, concerning whether it is better to reduce the tariff rate

initially by only a fraction of its appropriate long run adjustment in order

to limit the unemployment effects of decreased protection, or whether it is

better to reduce the level of protection initially to below its long run optimal

level in order to stimulate more rapid adjustment of the disposition of the

capital stock.


F. Conclusions Concerning the Implications of Distortions


     From the consideration of these examples of distortions that might affect

the adlustment process, no general presumption appears to emerge that a policy

of gradualism in reducing protection is superior to a policy of moving immediately

to a country's long run optimum commercial policy or even an "overshooting" policy

in which the level of protection is initially reduced to below its long run

optimum level. For some types of distortions, gradualism is the best policy.

If the circumstances of a particular economy indicate that these types of

distortions are especially important, then gradualism in trade liberalization

would be lustified for that economy.        For other types of distortions, however,

gradualism is not the best policy; and for economies where these distortions

are important, an "overshooting' policy would be justified.



1. A model with these characteristics is presented and analyzed in Mussa (1982a).
                                     37




     An explanation for this ambiguity concerning the implications of distortions

affecting the adjustment process for the optimal time path of trade liberaliza-

tion may be given in the following terms. The condition that must be satisfied

for the economy to be moving along its optimal adjustment path is that marginal

social benefit of more rapid adjustment (which would be stimulated by a small

further reduction in the level of protection) must equal the marginal social

cost of more rapid adjustment. When there are distortions affecting the adjust-

ment process, the adjustment path induced by an immediate move to the economys

long run optimal commercial policy no longer has an unambiguous claim on optimality

because the privately perceived benefits and costs of more rapid adjustment along

this path do not necessarily correspond to the true social benefits and costs.

There is no strong presumption, however, that the nature of distortions will

generally be such that the privately perceived benefit of more rapid adjustment

exceeds the true social benefit or that the privately perceived cost of more

rapid adjustment is less than the true social cost. Hence, there is no general

presumption that pace of adjustment subsequent to an immediate move to the optimum

long run commercial policy is too rapid rather than too slow. Only if there

were a presumption that the pace of adjustment in response to immediate and

complete trade liberalization were too rapid would there be a presumption in

favor of gradualism in trade liberalization.

     It follows that to build a case for gradualism in the reform of commercial

policy on the basis of distortions afflicting the adjustment process, it is

necessary either to identify specific distortions in specific cases where the

second best policy involves gradual adjustment of commercial policy, or to

identify a general class of distortions frequently affecting adjustment processes

for which the second best policy involves such gradualism. Obviously, no general

conclusion can be stated concerning the outcome of case by case analyses. With
                                  38



respect to a general class of distortions that might provide a rationale for

gradualism, one candidate is the distortions associated with unemployment of

resources previously employed in protected sectors of the economy. This issue

is examined in section IV. Another candidate is the distortions associated

with failures and bankruptcies of enterprises in previously protected industries.

Failures and bankruptcies, of course, are a normal part of the functioning of

the economic system, and their occurence as a consequence of a trade liberal-

ization does not necessarily imply any distortion of the functioning of the

adjustment process. However, if socially valuable capital associated with

continued operation of firms as going concerns (such as the organizational

capital of such firms) is destroyed as a consequence of failures and bankruptcies,

there may be an important distortion of the adjustment process) Gradualism

in trade liberalization which would reduce the failure rate of previously

protected firms might be justified in this situation as a method for reducing

the social losses associated with failures and bankruptcies.



1. Failures and bankruptcies almost always involve private losses as individual
asset holders are forced to write down the value of their assets. Social losses
occur only when socially valuable capital is destroyed as a consequence of a
failure or bankruptcy.

III. Income Redistribution and the Case for Gradualism


     A policy of trade liberalization will almost inevitably alter the distri-

bution of income and wealth within society. Consumers will gain from reductions

in the relative prices of previously restricted imports and their domestic

substitutes to the extent that they consume such products; and they will lose

from increases in the relative prices of products whose output is stimulated

by trade liberalization. On net, consumers should gain from trade liberalization

(up to the point of the optimum trade policy) because of the reduction in the

consumption distortion loss resulting from excessive protection. But, nothing

generally guarantees that each individual consumer will gain as a consequence

of the changes in relative prices resulting from trade liberalization. Owners

of factors of production specific to or used intensively in previously protected

industries are likely to suffer substantial declines in income and wealth as

a consequence of trade liberalization; while owners of factors of production

specific to or used intensively in industries stimulated by trade liberalization

should enjoy gains in income and wealth from this policy. On net, income and

wealth should rise due to the reduction in the production distortion loss of

excessive protection. But, rarely if ever are the net winners from trade

liberalization compelled to compensate the net losers; nor is it clear that they

ought to be.

     Decisions about commercial policy are necessarily political decisions,

and politics is at least as much concerned with the distribution of income

as it is with economic efficiency. For this reason, an analysis of the

appropriate time path of trade liberalization should consider the effects of


1. In the model of section I, if X is relatively labor intensive, then capital
of capital initially located in X will suffer a short run decline in their income
as a consequence of trade liberalization, but will enjoy a long run increase in
their income. Whether these capital owners end up as net winners or net losers
from trade liberalization depends on the speed with which the economy moves from
the short run to the long run; see Mayer (1974) and Mussa (1974) for further
                                     40



alternative paths of commercial policy on the income redistribution effects of

trade liberalization. For reasons that are intuitively apparent and that will

be examined in greater detail in this section, a more gradual policy of trade

liberalization should reduce the intensity of the income redistribution effects

of the liberalization, but only at the expense of some loss in the efficiency

of the adjustment process. The key issue with respect to the design of the

policy of trade liberalization, therefore, becomes making the appropriate

trade—off between reducing the intensity of the income redistribution effects

of the liberalization and maintaining the efficiency of the adjustment process.

A. The Significance of the Income Redistribution Issue

     Before examining the analytical issue of the factors that influence this

trade—off between income redistribution and efficiency, it is important to

discuss significance of income redistribution in the context of a program of

trade liberalization. One reason why the income redistribtion effects of

trade liberalization might be important is because the poorest members of

society are injured (or assisted) as a consequence of liberalization. If the

heavily protected industries prior to liberalization are primarily low wage

industries whose workers would have difficulty in finding re—employment

if protection were substantially reduced, then losses sustained by these workers

would be a serious consequence of liberalization. If these losses could be

reduced by a more gradual program of liberalization, this would be a valid and

important argument in favor of gradualism even at the expense of some loss in

efficiency. In the highly developed countries where some heavily protected

industries (especially textiles and to some extent agriculture) are low wage

industries, this argument may have practical relevance. In many developing

countries, however, the heavily protected industries are not typically the

low wage industries that employ the poorest members of society. Indeed, in
                                       41



many developing countries, the poorest workers are employed in agriculture——

an industry that is usually disadvantaged by protection that is granted to

manufacturing industries. Of course, protected industries in developing countries

will usually employ some low wage workers who might experience difficulty in

finding other jobs, and the capital employed in these industries might be owned

by the less wealthy in society. It is difficult to see, however, that a general

case for gradualism in trade liberalization in developing countries could be

built on the argument that rapid liberalization would typically benefit the

richer members of society at the expense of the poorer.

     Even if those who suffer reductions in income and wealth as a consequence

of trade liberalization are not typically among the poorest In society, the

income redistribution effects of liberalization are likely to be important

to policy makers because of their political consequences. Those who are

injured as a consequence of trade liberalization are likely to see more liberal

trade policies as a cause of their injury and are likely to make use of whatever

opportunities the political system provides to seek redress of their grievances.

In many instances, the political power of these groups will be substantial——as

testified to by their previous success in securing and maintaining protection for

their industries.   Few governments can afford to ignore completely the complaints

of those who are inlured as a consequence of trade liberalization, even (or

perhaps especially) if these people are not among the poorest in society.

     Moreover, apart from political necessity or expediency, there may he good

reason for governments to pay special attention to those who are injured as a

consequence of trade liberalization.        In this circumstance, inlury is suffered

not as a consequence of unforeseen changes in economic conditions that are

under no one's control, but rather as the direct consequence of a deliberate
                                      42



 change in government policy. Among those who suffer the greatest loss from

 trade liberalization will be those who have made costly investments in physical

 and human capital that is relatively specific to the previously protected

 industries, in the expectation that protection would be continued. In many

 instances, the return that would have been earned on these investments with

 the continuation of protection would not have exceeded the normal rate of

 return on other investments in physical and human capital.   Hence, the losses

 these individuals suffer as a consequence of trade liberalization cannot legi-

timately be regarded as merely a surrender of ill gotten gains. Rather, these

are losses sustained as a consequence of pursuing investments that it was the

previous objective of government policy to promote. For this reason, it might

be argued that the goverment has a responsibility to protect these individuals

from inordinately large losses so long as it can do so without exceptionally

high cost to the rest of society. Moreover, if a government adopts the general

attitude that those who are injured as a consequence of policy changes are

entitled to no consideration even if those losses are a consequence of performing

in accord with past policies, then It is likely to find that people are less

willing to pursue those actions that the government would like to promote with

its new policy. In the case of trade liberalization, the incentive to invest

in the industries that ought to expand under a more liberal commercial policy

will be blunted if potential investors see the possibility of a later policy

reversal and fear that they will receive no consideration for the losses they

would sustain in the event of such a reversal. Hence, on grounds of promoting

more effecient functioning of the economic and political system (broadly conceived),

it may be desirable to provide some compensation to those who are injured as

a consequence of trade liberalization even if they are not among the poorest in

society.

B. The Redistributive Consequences of Alternative Paths of Commercial Policy

     In principle, compensation could be paid to those injured by trade liberali-

zation without altering the path of commercial policy from that which yields

greatest economic efficiency. In practice such means of paying compensation

have occasionally been used. As a general matter, however, it is difficult to

design and implement policies that compensate directly those injured by trade

liberalization without distorting economic incentives. The practical means of

providing compensation that is generally available is simply to slow the pace

of liberalization.

     The theory of international trade generally identifies two considerations

that relevant in determining the extent to which the income of a particular

factor of production is raised or lowered as a consequence of variations in

relative output prices induced by changes in commercial policy. If all factors

are mobile between industries, then the income of each factor tends to be linked

positively to the relative prices of the products of the industries in which it

is used relatively intensively. In particular, in a two—product, two—factor

economy, the Stolper—Samuelson theorem indicates that a factor's income will

rise in terms of both products when the relative price of the product in which

it is used intensively rises and, corresponding, a factor's income will decline

in terms of both products when the relative price of the product in which it

is used intensively declines. When all factors are not perfectly arid immediately

mobile between industries, the incomes of factors that are not immediately

mobile tend to be positively linked to the relative prices of the products of

the industries where they are presently employed, while the incomes immediately

mobile factors tend not to be so strongly linked to the relative prices of

particularproductsJ In particular, In a two—product, three—factor model where



1. In an economy with many products and many factors used to produce each product,
some perfectly mobile and some not, virtually any result is possible if one assumes
                                     44


labor is assumed to be perfectly mobile between industries and capital is assumed

to be specific (at least in the short run) to each Industry, an increase in the

relative price of one industry's nroduct increases the income of capital specific

to that industry in terms of both goods, reduces the income of capital specific

to the other industry in terms of both goods, and reduces the wage in terms of

that industry's product while raising it in terms of the other industry's product.1

     In my iudgment, the theory that focuses on the short run specificity of

factors of production to particular industries as the prime determinant of the

income redistribution effects of relative price changes is the most relevant

theory for understanding the likely redistributive effects of trade liberalization

in most economies. In making use of this theory, however, it should be recognized

that "labor" which is assumed to be a perfectly mobile factor of production does

not correspond to all labor in actual economies. Much of the labor that is

employed in many industries embodies a substantial amount of human capital that

is relatively specific, at least in the short run, to the particular industry

where it is employed. In the discussion that follows, therefore, "capital

located in an industry" should be thought of as including not only physical

plant and equipment that is specific, in the short run, to that industry but

also human capital that shares this property of short run specificity.

     Using the model of section I, it can be shown than a permanent reduction in

the level of protection, as measured by the tariff applied to imports of X,

implies an immediate reduction of the income of capital located in X relative

the income of capital located in Z. Under reasonable additional assumptions,



sufficiently wierd complementary and substitution relations among factors. While
these oossibilities may occasionally have practical relevance, they will not be
considered in this discussion.

1. The specific capital model is described in Jones (1971), Mayer (1974), and
Mussa (1974). The last of these papers presents specific formulas that indicate
the extent to which each factor's income is affected by a relative price change
as a function of parameters describing the production processes. It also indicates
how these results generalize to an economy that produces many goods using one
specific factor in each industry and one mobile factor common to all industries,
                                     45



it may be shown that the income of capital located in X falls absolutely in

terms of both goods while the income of capital located in Z rises absolutely

in terms of both goods. The effect of a permanent reduction in the tariff on

the values of units of capital located in the two industries, as determined by

the present discounted values of their future income streams     and     is

less clear, except that    must fall relative to p. This ambiguity arises

because the long run effect of a permanent reduction in the tariff on the income

of capital must be the same for both industries and depends on which industry

is relatively capital intensive. If X is relatively capital intensive, the long

run level of income of capital will fall in terms of both goods; while if Z is

relatively capital intensive, the long run level of income of capital will fall

in terms of both goods. If adjustment to the economy's long run equilibrium

occurs sufficiently rapidly subsequently to a tariff reduction, the long run

effect of the tariff reduction on the income of capital in both industries

could dominate the short run differential effect on the income of capital in

each industry, with the result that the value of a unit of capital could rise

in both industries or could fall in both industries. I do not believe that

either of these results is a likely consequence of tariff reductions in most

instances. Rather, I think it more likely that the adjustment process works

sufficiently slowly that the short run effects of capital specificity dominate

over the long run effects of capital intensity, with the implication that a

tariff reduction initially reduces the value of a unit of capital located in X

while raising the value of a unit of capital located in Z. This result will

be assumed in the discussion that follows.

     It is clear that if a permanent teduction in the tariff rate reduces the

income and wealth of owners of capital initially located in the protected

industry, then one way to reduce the (private) losses suffered by these capital
                                     46


owners is diminishing the extent of the reduction in the tariff rate. The dis-

advantage of this policy is that it leaves the economy with permanent efficiency

losses resulting from a tariff that exceeds its optimal level (zero for a small

country. An alternative policy that achieves the objective of diminishing the

losses sustained by owners of capital located in the protected industry while

avoiding permanent efficiency losses from the continuation of protection in

excess of its optimal level is a policy of gradually reducing the level of

protection to its long run optimal level. There are two Important reasons why

a gradual reduction In the level of protection diminishes the losses suffered

by owners of capital located in the protected industry. First, by delaying

the losses of income implied by future scheduled reductions in the tariff rate,

the program of gradually reducing the level of protection reduces the magnitude

of the initial decline in the present discounted value of the income stream

generated by a unit of capital originally located in the protected industry.

Second, even a small initial decline in the value of a unit of capital located

in X relative to the value of units of capital located elsewhere in the economy

(which would be induced by an announced program of very gradual reductions in

the tariff rate) induces some capital to move out of the protected Industry and,

perhaps more important, encourages new investment not to be located in this

industry. If the demand curve for the protected industry's product is to any

extent downward sloping or the supply curve of other inputs is to any extent

upward sloping, the reduction in the industry's capital stock through outward

movement of existing capital and non—replacement of depreciating capital should

moderate the decline in the income earned by capital that remains in the protected

industry.'


1.  In the model of section I, the supply curve of the other input, mobile labor,
Is upward sloping to the X industry, but the demand curve for the industry's
product is horizontal at the world market price multiplied by one plus the tariff
rate. In circumstances where domestically produced products are imperfect sub-
stitutes for Imported products, the demand curve facing the protected domestic
Industry should be downward sloping.
                                    47



    Formally, the problem of determining the optimal path of trade liberaliza-

tion in the light of concerns about the losses suffered by owners of factors

located in the protected industry could be analyzed in at least two ways. Ignoring

for simplicity the consumption distortion loss of protection, the objective of

the problem could be stated as the maximization of the present discounted value

of the economy's final output, as in section I, but subject to some constraint

on the maximim permissible reduction in either income earned by a unit of capital

in the protected industry or in the private value of a unit of capital located

in that industry.   Alternatively, the objective function could be modified by

substracting from the value of output at each date some measure of the political

and social cost of losses sustained by owners of capital in the protected industry.

In the first approach, the trade off between efficiency in the adjustment process

and limiting the losses suffered by those injured by trade liberalization is

exhibited by considering tighter or looser constraints on the maximum permissible

loss of owners of capital located in the protected industry. In the second

approach, the appropriate trade off is determined endogenously as part of the

solution of the maximization problem (given the function that describes the

social and political cost of losses suffered by owners of capital located in

the protected industry).

     Without going into the details of the formal analysis of either of these

formulations of the optimization problem, it is useful to state the following

general conclusions that may be derived from such an analysis. First, when

the protected industry is labor intensive, there are circumstances (which I

believe to be of limited practical relevance) in which there is no conflict

between the goal of economic efficiency and the desirability of limiting

losses sustained by owners of capital located in the protected industries.

In these circumstances, the optimal path for commercial policy is to move
                                     48



immediately to the long run optimal commercial policy of free trade. Second,

when the protected industry is capital intensive, there are circumstances in

which concern with the losses suffered by owners of capital in the protected

industry can be sufficiently important that it is not optimal to move all of

the way to the commercial policy of free trade that is optimal on grounds of

economic efficiency.   This result might be taken as representative of the

situation in which some protection is justified on the grounds of raising the

incomes of the poorest in society.1 Third, in the "normal case" where a

greater reduction in the tariff rate implies a greater reduction in the income

of capital in the protected industry and in the present discounted value of

that income, a tighter constraint on the maximum permissible loss of owners

of capital in the protected industry or a greater political and social cost

assigned to such losses implies a slower optimal rate of reduction of the

level of protection.   This result provides a valid argument for gradualism

in trade liberalization under "normal" circumstances when a government is

concerned, for political or economic reasons, with limiting the losses of

income and wealth sustained by owners of factors of production that are

initially located in the protected scetor of the economy.



1. The analogy here is very weak, reflecting the fundamental weakness of the
model of section I in dealing with the issue of the distribution of income
among individuals in society, as opposed to the distribution of income among
classes of factors. In this model, all capital earns the same income in long
run equilibrium. Hence, removal of a tariff that protects the capital intensive
industry could reduce the income of capital below some arbitrarily prescribed
minimum. It is doubtful, however, that this is what is at issue when one
discusses the income of the poorest members of society. To get at this issue,
we would need a model in which different individuals own different amounts of
human and physical capital perhaps with varying efficiency in different industries.
Then we might consider how removal of protection might injure those who own
only small amounts of this capital.

C. Factors Affecting the Trade Off between Efficiency and Redistribution

     Economic analysis can contribute to an understanding of the path of trade

liberalization that balances appropriately the social and political costs of

loses imposed on owners of factors located in protected industries against the

efficiency gained by rapid reductions in the level of protection by indicating

the circumstances In which reducing the loses of these factor owners by slow

liberalization will, or will not, have a high cost in terms of the efficiency

                                                that should be considered are
of the adlustment process. Among the factors

the following: (1) the ease with which factors located in protected industries

can be moved to alternative activities that should expand as a consequence of

trade lIberaliZatiofl
                        (2) the extent to which factors used in protected indus-

tries are specific to those industries and must be worn out (in the case of

physical capital) or retire (in the case of human capital) and be replaced by
                                                                (3) the likely
new factors in order to be moved to alternative activities;

productive life span of the factors in the previous category:     (4) the geographic

                                                        relative to the likely
 distribution of factors used in protected industries

 geographic distribution of factors that would be employed in industries stimulated

 by a reduction in protection.

      First, consider the circumstances In which factors used in protected industries

                                              that should expand as a consequence
 could move relatively easily to activities

 of trade liberalization. This would be a likely circumstance if the workers
                                                 unskilled, had a high level of
 employed in protected industries were largely

 general skill rather than specific skill (to the extent that this is possible)

 or had skills that would likely be useful in the industries that would expand
                                              This last circumstance would be more
 as a consequence of trade liberalization.
                                           widely within a sector of the economy
 likely if levels of protection differed

 such as manufacturing rather than between sectors such as manufacturing and
                                     50


agricultural. If some manufacturing industries were heavily protected while

other manufacturing industries using similar types of labor and capital received

negative protection, then factors employed in protected industries probably

could move into alternative uses with comparative ease)- This would not be

likely,.however, if all manufacturing industries are heavily protected at the

expense of agriculture and mining. With respect to physical capital, movement

to alternative uses is likely to be comparatively easy when capital consists

largely of office and plant space rather than highly specialized equipment.

When circumstances are such that it appears that most factors employed in

protected industries could move relatively easily into alternative activities,

then incomes and wealth losses that are likely to be sustained by a rapid

reduction in levels of protection should not be enormous and the efficiency

gain from stimulating rapid adjustment should be substantial.

     Second, the circumstances in which factors used in protected industries

must be allowed to wear out or retire and be replaced by new capital or new

workers are essentially the reverse of the circumstances described in the

preceding paragraph. When these circumstances are descriptive of the factors

employed in protected industries, then it is likely that these factors will

sustain substantial and prolonged income loses as a consequence of a rapid

reduction in the level of protection. Aside from reducing the consumption

distortion cost of protection, however, little efficiency may be gained by

reducing the level of protectionmore rapidlythan is necessary to discourage

new workers from acquiring skills specific to the protected industries or

new capital from being invested in the protected industries. Hence, in these



1. The activities that will expand due to a reduction in protection will depend
to some extent on the factors that are available in the economy and on the prices
at which these factors make themselves available.
                                      51


 circumstances, a gradual rate of reduction of the level of protection at near

 the rate that discourages new factors from moving in to the protected industries

may be the best policy.

     Third, when labor and capital cannot move easily out of protected industries,

the expected productive lifespan of these factors may be an important guide for

the pace of liberalization. If many of the workers with specific skills in

protected industries have only relatively short periods remaining in their

likely working lives, they are unlikely to pay the costs and suffer the dis-

locations associated with moving to other lobs, even if they suffer substantial

reductions in income (including reductions due to unemployment) as a consequence

of a rapid decline in the level of protection. Hence, little efficiency can be

ained by a rapid reduction in the level of protection that imposes substantial

loses on these workers. En contrast, if most workers in protected industries

have many years remaining in their productive lives, the prospect of many years

of lower income if they remain in their present jobs (or unemployed waiting for

work in the previously protected industry) may induce them to incur the costs

of retraining and relocation in order to find new jobs in expanding industries.

In this case a more rapid reduction in the level of protection at least serves

some purpose in increasing economic efficiency. The same principles apply to

physical capital, though policy makers may be less concerned with losses sustained

by capital owners than by workers.

     Fourth, the geographic location of protected industries may sometimes be

an important factor influencing the appropriate pace of trade liberalization.

If these industries are located in larger metropolitan centers where workers

employed in them have reasonable prospects for finding re—employment in other

expanding industries, then the losses they will suffer due to liberalization

should not be too large, and efficiency is likely to be promoted by a relatively
                                     52


rapid pace of liberalization. On the other hand, if the protected industries

are dominant employers in smaller centers that are isolated from the areas

where workers might reasonably expect to find re—emnloyment in expanding

industries, then a rapid pace of liberalization is likely to generate very

substantial losses for these workers and for the owners of capital in the

protected industries. In this circumstance, it may be appropriate to reduce

the level of protection more gradually in order to limit income losses for

workers and capital owners in the protected industries and to allow adjustment

to take place through attrition and depreciation.

     Finally, it should be emphasized that the general state of economic condi-

tions in a country influences the appropriate pace of trade liberalization. In

a rapidly growing, vibrant economy, labor and capital released from protected

industries can much more easily be absorbed in other industries than is likely

to be the case in a slowly growing or stagnant economy. The implication is

that trade liberalization can probably proceed more rapidly and with smaller

losses to factors employed in protected industries when liberalization is

undertaken in a vibrant and rapidly growing economy. It should be recognized,

however, that in an expanding world economy, a policy of trade liberalization

(combined with appropriate monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies) may have

some capacity to transform a stagnant of slowly growing national economy into

one with a healthier rate of economic progress.

 IV. Unemployment and the Path of Trade Liberalization


      It is widely believed that the process of adjustment subsequent to a

 sudden reduction in the level of protection will involve not only a gradual

 movement of resources out of previously protected activities and into other

 activities with a higher product value, but also substantial unemployment of

 some of these resources, perhaps for an extented period of time. Concern

 with the social cost and political consequences of such unemployment, especially

 unemployment of labor, is probably an important reason for resistance to the

 implementation of programs of trade liberalization. Concern with these costs

 also seemingly provides a rationale for gradual implementation of more liberal

 trade policies in order to reduce the amount of unemployment they generate,

or at least to spread the cost of such unemployment over time.

     The purpose of this section is to investigate the influence of unemploy—

ment resulting from trade liberalization on the optimal path of liberalization.

In this investigation, it is assumed that some amount of unemployment, speci-

fically unemployment of labor, is an inevitable concomitant of any reduction

in the level of protection, and that a larger reduction in the level of pro-

tection generates both a larger immediate increase in unemployment and a

more rapid movement of workers out of the previously protected activity.

These assumptions imply that there can be no liberalization without enduring

some cost of unemployment and that more rapid liberalization has both a cost,

in the form of higher short term unemployment, and a benefit, in the form of

more rapid adjustment. The problem, therefore, is to choose the path of

liberalization that appropriately balances this cost and benefit.

     This investigation is subject to three important limitations that cast

some doubt on the validity or generality of its conclusions and that should be
                                   54



noted at the outset. First, there is no attempt to model or to analyze the

details of the economic and institutional arrangements that lead to the assumed

reduced form relationship between the level of unemployment of workers in a

previously protected industry and the rate at which these workers move to

other industries Presumably this has something to do with arrangements

governing the determination of wage rates, but no mention is made of the

wage determination process In the discussion that follows. It is certainly

possible that conclusions of the subsequent analysis, particularly the conclu-

sions relating to social welfare, might depend in a critical way on the details

of the structure that underlies the reduced form relationship between the level

of unemployment and the rate of adjustment of the labor force. Second, the

only policy tool that is considered in the subsequent analysis is the level

of protection, specifically the ad valorem tariff rate applied to Imports.

It is possible that through the use of other policy tools, such as wage

subsidies, retraining programs, or relocation assistance, that the government

could reduce the unemployment cost of trade liberalization while facilitating

the adjustment process. This possibility, however, is not considered. Third,

the subsequent analysis focuses on the effects of unemployment in the previously

protected industry on the optimal path of commercial policy. It does not consider

the effect of the overall unemployment rate on the path of commercial policy.

Rather, the implicit assumption underlying the analysis is that an excess

supply of labor In the previously protected industry is always matched by an

excess demand for labor in the rest of the economy. In many situations, this

assumption may not be valid, and in others its validity may be contingent on

pursuit of appropriate monetary, fiscal, and exchange rate policies, in

concert with the policy of trade liberalization.



1. This relationship might depend on expectations concerning the future course
of economic variables including the government's commercial policy. Hence, it
might not remain stable in the face of changes in policy.
                                    55




     To clarify further the nature and scope of the present Investigation,

 it is useful to emphasize that "the level of unemployment" that will be referred

to in subsequent discussion is always to be interpreted as the level of unem-

ployment in the previously protected industry, in excess of the level of unem-

ployment that would normally prevail In that industry and that is assumed to

prevail in the rest of the economy. It is assumed that an increase in the

level of unemployment, so defined, Increases the rate at which workers move

out of the previously protected industry and into other industrIes. This

assumption would probably not be appropriate if "the level of unemployment"

were understood to mean the general level of unemployment in the economy as

a whole. M increase In the general level of unemployment would presumably

have a negative effect, or no effect, on the rate at which workers move out

of the previously protected Industry, since an increase in the general rate

of unemployment (holding the structure of unemployment constant) would pre-

sumably decrease, or at best not change, the perceived probability of finding

a new job for a worker who decides to shift out of the previously protected

industry. For this reason, it would be desirable to keep the general level

of unemployment low (by whatever means are available and appropriate) during

a period of trade liberalization, while simultaneously raising the level of

uemploynient in the previously protected Industry In order to stimulate a

redistribution of workers Out of this industry.

A. The Social Cost of Unemployment


     Before beginning the formal analysis of the influence of unemployment on

the optimal path of commercial policy, it is useful to consider briefly the

nature of the social cost of unemployment. By definition, an unemployed worker

does not produce anything that is included in the standard measure of the

value of national output. The social loss from unemployment of this worker,

however, may be less than, equal to, or greaterthatt the value of the output

he would produce if employed. Discussion of a few specific cases will serve

to illustrate this point.

     First, consider a worker formerly employed at a very high wage in a

heavily protected industry.who would like to continue to work in his old

job at his old wage, but who is not willing to accept available work in

another job at a much lower wage rate. This worker has suffered an individual

economic loss from the removal of protection for the industry that previously

employed him. There is not, however, any social loss that is necessarily

associated with his unemployment. Certainly the amount he would have earned

in his job is not a valid measure of the social loss from the disappearance

of that job since the value of the output of that job was raised artificially

above Its true social value by the previous grant of protection. Moreover,

if this worker chooses to remain unemployed and use   his   time in non—market

activities, rather than accept work at a wage that reflects the social value

of the marginal product of his labor, then it might be concluded that there

is no social loss from his unemployment. If this worker chooses to remain

unemployed only because he receives a subsidy (such as unemployment compen-

sation) that is contingent on his unemployment, then the social loss should

be measured as the difference between the value of what he would produce
                                   57



when employed (in a new industry) and the value he assigns to non—market

uses of his time.

     Second, consider a worker who remains unemployed so that he can search

more efficiently for a higher paying job than he could find without search.

This is a common assumption is search theory models of unemployment. For

this worker, unemployment is a productive activity, even though its output

(finding a better job) is not included in the usual measure of the value

of the economy's output. If there are no externalities in the search process

arising from one worker's search interfering with the search of others when

there are a fixed number of jobs, then the private benefits of search should

correspond to the social benefits (ignoring some complications arising from

taxation). In this case, the technology of the adjustment process for moving

workers between industries has the same essential properties as the technology

of the adjustment process for moving capital in the model presented in

section I. As in that model, the privately perceived cost of adjustment

(including the cost of being unemployed) will correspond to the true social

cost, and so too will the privately perceived benefit correspond to the

true social benefit. Thus, while there is a social cost of unemployment, this

cost is appropriately taken into account by the agents responsible for deter-

mining the extent of unemployment——leaving no rationale for government inter-

vention. Of course, if there are distortions affecting either the privately

perceived cost or benefit of unemployment, then there is a rationale for

government intervention along the lines discussed in section II.

     Third, the costs of unemployment are not evenly spread across members

of society, but tend to be heavily concentrated on the particular individuals

who become unemployed and on their families.   This concentration is diminished
                                     58



somewhat by unemployment compensation, provision of public services, and

social welfare programs. But, even in societies with extensive social welfare

programs (and more so in societies without such programs), there may be legit—

mate concern that losses that are heavily concentrated on a small part of

society have a greater social cost than losses that are evenly spread. This

would make the social cost of unemployment exceed the value of lost output.

     Fourth, in some cases, heavily protected industries that will be the

principal victims of trade liberalization may be geograhically concentrated

and may be dominant or very Important employers in their locales of operation.

In such cases, substantial declines in employment in previously protected

industries may have important, concentrated, and negative spillover effects

for other enterprises and workers in their locales of operation. Even when

macroeconomic and exchange rate policies are successful in maintaining a

level of aggregate demand adequate to absorb resources released from previously

protected industries, these local economic difficulties are unlikely to be

overcome completely. This may add to the social cost of unemployment

associated with the removal of protection in these cases.

     Fifth, it has been observed that workers who suffer prolonged periods

of unemployment also suffer substantial declines in their human capital, at

least as measured by the wages they are subsequently able to obtain. To the

extent that this phenomenon reflects a loss in the private return to human

capital that Is socially less valuable, there is no additional social cost

of unemployment. However, to the extent that this phenomenon reflects an

actual deterioration in general human capital due to unemployment, the social

cost of such unemployment may well exceed the value of the output lost during

the actual period of unemployment.

B.   A Formal Analysis of the Optimal Path of Unemployment

      In order to provide a formal basis for analysis of the influence of
unemployment on the optimal timing of trade liberalization, it is useful to
consider a simple model of the interaction between adjustment to changes in

commercial policy and the level of unemployment (especially in the industries

directly affected by the commercial policy change) .   Since the model used
earlier in this paper to analyze the optimal timing of trade liberalization

treats labor as a perfectly mobile factor, this model cannot be used without

modification to analyze the effects and implications of unemployment of labor.

Rather than modifying this model to allow for a sensible analysis of unemployment,

it is easier to consider a model with a somewhat simpler basic structure.

     Suppose that the small economy under investigation has two industries:

the X industry that has previously been granted protection be means of a

tariff from imports of similar foreign goods; and the Z industry which produces

every other good in the economy, including goods for export. Each industry uses

only a single factor of production, labor, and the output of each industy is

a concave function of the amount of labor employed in that industry;

          X =
                F(Lx)
          Z =
                G(L)•
The amount of labor employed in each industry is always less than or equal to

the number of workers who seek work in that industry, and the number of workers

who seek work in each industry is assumed to be a slowly adjusting variable.

The number of workers who seek work in X is denoted by N, and the number of

workers who seek work in Z is the total work force, N, less those who seek

work in X. Given the world relative price of X in terms of Z, denoted by P,

the demand for labor In the two industries i8 assumed to depend on the ad
                                      60




 valorern tariff rate, T, that Is charged on imported units of X. Specifically,

 the demand for labor in X, denoted by L(T), is assumed to correspond to the

 equilibrium level of employment in the X industry with free movement of labor

 when the tariff rate is T; and the demand for labor in the Z industry is, by

 the same assumption, given by N —   L(t).   When the demand for labor in an

 industry is greater than the number of workers in that industry (as will

 typically be the case for the Z industry in subsequent discussion), there is

an unsatisfied excess demand for labor in that industry. When the demand

for labor in an industry is less than the number of workers in that industry,

the excess supply of labor in that industry is unemployed. Since this situation

will generally apply to labor in the X industry In subsequent discussion, it

is convenient to denote the level of unemployment in this industry (and in

the economy) by

           U = N -   L(T).
Unemployment of workers who seek to work in an industry is assumed to provide

the incentive, directly or indirectly, for some of these workers to move out

of this industry and seek work in the other industry. Since subsequent analysis

will be concerned with unemployment in the X industry (resulting from the removal

of tariff protection), this assumption can conveniently be embodied In the

specification that

(1)

where    > 0 measures the speed at which workers move out of the X industry in

response to unemployment in that industry.

      The initial condition of the economy is assumed to correspond to the

equilibrium position of the economy'with a positive level of protection,

granted to domestic producers of X, with the number of workers in X equal

to L(t0) and the number of workers in Z equal to N(i0). The problem for
                                             61



  the social planner who controls commercial policy is to chose the path of

  the tariff rate that maximizes the present discounted value of the
                                                                               economy's
  final output, V, as given by

            V =   f0 [PF(L(T))     + G(N —   N)J.exp(—r.t)   dt

  subject to the transition law

           N =    — •[N   -   L(T)].
  In this specification of the objective function of the social planner, it

 should be noted that the cost of unemployment is reflected, one—for—one, In

 the value of output of X (measured as world market prices) that is lost due

 to unemployment of labor In that industry.            (No unemployment occurs In Z
 so L7 is set equal to N —      N.)    Thus, no allowance is made either for the

 excess social cost of unemployment above the value of output lost, or for

 the value that unemployed workers may derive from alternative uses of their

 time. Also, In the specification of the objective function, no allowance is

 made for the consumption distortion loss that results from a non—zero tariff

 rate on imports of X. The specification of the objective function could be

modified to take account of these factors with the cost of increased analytical

 complexity, but without altering the basic conclusions of the present discussion.

      Since the number of workers in the X industry, N, Is a state variable of

the dynamic optimization problem confronting the social planner, It is possible,

using the relationship that U = N —          L(T),   to view the planner's control variable

as the level of unemployment, U, rather than the tariff rate, T. Adopting this

view (which no policy maker would publicly admit), the problem for the planner

Is to maximize


(2)       V =   f0 [P•F(N   — U)
                                   + G(N— N)]exp(—r•t) dt

subject to the transition law

           N =   —



by choice of the time path of U.

      To determine the solution of this problem, we form the current value

Hamiltonian,

(3)        H =   PF(N   —   U) + G(N — N) + A•u,

where A represents the shadow price of being a worker seeking work In Z

rather than a worker seeking work in X. (A is defined this way so that

A will positive along the adjustment path associated with trade liberali-

zation.) The first order condition for optimal behavior requires that

U be chosen so that

(4)        H/U — — P•F' (N      — U)   + A < 0

with equality holding whenever U is > 0.         This condition says that whenever

U is > 0, the level of unemployment must be such that marginal benefit of

unemployment arising from a more rapid movement of workers from seeking

work in X to seeking work in Z, as measured by A3, must equal the marginal

cost of unemployment arising from the value of lost output of X, as measured

by PF'(N — U).       When the marginal benefit of unemployment is so low that

this condition cannot be satisfied (i.e., A <       P•F'(N)/I3),   then the level

of unemployment is zero. When A is greater than this minimum value, the

level of unemployment is given by

(5)       U = N -    F'1(A/P).
From this result, it is apparent that the level of unemployment is an increasing

function of A when A >      PF'(N)/.
      Substituting the solution for the level of unemployment into the transition

law governing the evolution of N, it follows that
                                                           63


                             0                                   when   A < P   F'(N)/
      (6)         N=                  —l
                             fF' (Xe/P) —           N) < 0       when   A > P   F'(N)/

  This result is represented in the phase diagram shown in figure 1.                                The

  negatively sloped line along which A =                        P.F'(N)/    is the upper boundary of
  the region in which the level of unemployment is zero and accordingly there

  is no movement of workers from seeking work in X to seeking work in Z; i.e.,

  in this region N =                 0.    Above this region, the level of unemployment is positive

 and N is negative, indicating that workers are shifting from seeking work in X

 to seeking work in Z.

             The transition law for the shadow price A is given by

 (7)              A =   r.A      —
                                      H/E(—N) =     r-A   + P'F'(N — U) —   G'(i —    N).
 Taking account of the solution for U implied by (4 ),                          it   follows that when
 ).    <    P.F'(N)/    (and hence U =            0),   the rate of change of A is given by

 (8)             A =    r'A      + P.F'(N) —       G'(i — N).

Thus, in the region of the phase diagram where U = 0 and N =                                0, the combinations
of N and A for which A = 0 are those for which

(9)             A =      [G'(—            N) —   PF'(N)]/r.
These combinations of A and N are indicated by the section of the A =
                                                                      0 locus
in figure 1 that lies in the region below the line along which A =
                                                                                                 P.F'(N)/.
When A >        P.F'(N)/ (and              hence U = N —    F'1(A/p)),      the rate of change of A is
given by


(10)            A =     (r   + 6)A — G'(N — N)

Thus,        in the region of the phase diagram where U > 0 and N >

of N and A for which A = 0 are those for which

 that lies in the region above the line where A =       P•F'(N)/.   In general, in

 the region above the A = 0 locus A is > 0        and in the region below the A      0
 locus, A is <   0.
      The distribution of workers that corresponds to the free trade equilibrium

 of the economy, indicated by N =    N*, occurs where the value of the marginal
 product of labor in X, P.F'(N*), is equal to the value of the marginal product

of labor in Z, G'(N —   N*).   If the social planner inherited this distribution of

workers as the initial distribution at the start of the policy of trade liberali-

zation (which is not possible If the economy was at equilibrium position cor-

responding to a positive tariff rate), the optimal policy for the social planner

would clearly be to set A = 0 and have the economy sit at its free trade equl—

librlutn position. In the phase diagram, this policy is indicated by the point

where N = N* along the N axis. Starting with N =         N*, any choice of A(O), other
than zero, would clearly not be optimal since it would place the economy on

a dynamic path that would ultimately lead away from the free trade equilibrium

and toward an equilibrium where either N = N (if A(0) < 0) or N = 0 (if X(0) >           0).
     It must be recognized, however, that the point where N = N* and A = 0 is

not the only optimal steady state for the economy. In fact, any point on the
A = 0 locus in the region of the phase diagram where N = 0
                                                           is an optimal steady

state position. In other words, if the economy inherits a distribution of

workers with N between the levels NA and NB illustrated in figure 1, the optimal

policy is to set A(0) =   [G'(N   — N) —   P.F'(N)J/r   (which makesX —0) and to hold
the distribution of workers at the inherited distribution. This is the optimal

policy because the benefit of shifting a worker from one industry to another,

as measured by X(O) which is the present discounted value of the difference
                                           66



between the value of the marginal product of labor in the two industries, is

smaller than the cost of the unemployment that must be created (or tolerated)

in order to induce a worker to shift industries.

        The largest number of workers in the X industry consistent with an optimal

steady state, NB, and the associated value of XB for this optimal steady state

satisfy the condition that

(12)          PF'(NB)/ =         = [C'(N   —         —
                                               NB)       P.F'(NB)]/r.
If the level of protection previously granted to the X industry was substantial,

it is likely that the inherited number of workers in the X industry, N0, will

exceed NB. In this case, the optimal policy for the social planner is to choose

X(O) =        in   order to place the economy at the point C that lies along the

stable branch of the dynamic system illustrated in figure 1. With this choice

of X(0), the economy moves gradually along the stable branch of that dynamic

system until it arrives at the optimal steady state position indicated by

the point B. At this point, no further movement is desirable because the

social value of shifting additional workers out of X and into Z does not

repay the social cost of inducing such movement. Any other choice of X(O)

would not be optimal since it would lead to a situation either where N

converged to N (if X(0) were <             or where N converged to 0 (if X(O) were
                                    X)
>           In either case, the transversality conditions of the planner's
    Xe,).
optimization problem would be violated.

       To move the economy along its optimal path, the social planner does not

directly set the unemployment rate. Rather, he sets the path of the tariff

rate applied to imports of X.       If the level of protection previously granted

to the X industry was so low       that   the planner inherits a number of workers

in the X industry that is within the range of optimal steady state levels of N
                                          67



 (i.e., 1.etween NA and NB), the planner simply holds the tariff rate cOnstant

 in order to hold the demand for labor in X, L(t), at the inherited level of N.

 (This requires a positive tariff rate if N is between N* and NB and a negative

 tariff rate if N is between NA and N*.) If the level of protection previously

granted to the X industry maintained a level of employment N0 =            that
                                                                  L(r0)
was greater than NB, as illustrated in figure 1, then the planner must imme-

diately cut the tariff rate to below its previous level, T0, in order to

reduce the demand for labor in X to below N0 and stimulate the optimal rate

of movement of workers from seeking work in X to seeking work in Z.       Subse-

quently, the planner must manipulate the tariff rate in order to move the

economy along the stable branch In figure 1 until the steady state point B

is reached. The path of the tariff rate that moves the economy along the

stable branch is determined by the requirement that the demand for labor at

each level of N must be consistent with the required level of unemployment

at that level of N along the stable branch; formally this requires that


(13)        L(T) =   F'1(X(N).6/p)
where A(N) is the value of A that is associated with N along the stable

branch in figure 1. The tariff rate at the optimal steady state position B

Is the tariff rate TB that is determined by this requirement when N is set

equal to NB and A(N) =
                          X(NB)      XB
       To move the economy along its optimal path from C to B, the tariff rate

set by the social planner must be declining. This is implied by the fact

that A(N) is declining as we move along the stable branch in figure 1 from

the point C to the point B. Thus, the optimal path for commercial policy

during the period of trade liberalization requires "overshooting" in the

sense that the tariff rate is initially cut below its inherited level
                                    68




to a level    (associated with the point C in figure 1) that is below its new

steady state value TB• Subsequently, the tariff rate is raised in order to

move the economy along its optimal path from the point C to the point B.

Indeed, if the inherited level of    was sufficiently high, it is even possible

that the optimal policy will be to cut the tariff rate initially to a level

that is below the free trade level——that is, the optimal path for commercial

policy would involve an initial period during which imports of X would be

subsidized in order to stimulate a rapid rate of movement of workers Out of

the X industry and into the Z industry.

 C. Extensions and Modifications


        It would be misleading to suggest than any of the specific implications

 of the model discussed in the preceding subsection have any substantial claim

 to generality. In particular, the conclusion that the optimal path of corn—

 mercial policy in a trade liberalization involves "overshooting" in which the

 level of protection is initially reduced below its optimal steady state level

 (and perhaps made negative) is a specific implication of that model, and not

 a general property of reasonably specified models of the influence of unemploy-

 ment on the optimal timing of trade liberalization.          To obtain a better notion
 of the range of conclusions that are consistent with models th.3t might have some

 claim to economic sensibility, it is useful to consider variations of the

 model of the preceding subsection which preserve Its simple two—industry, one—

 factor structure, but allow for modifications in the objective function of the

 social planner or in the specification of the transition law that relates

 the rate of redistribution of workers to the level of unemployment.

       With respect to the planner's objective function, one important modifica-

tion would be to take account of the consumption distortion loss resulting

from a tariff.       Assuming for simplicity that the consumption distortion loss
is a function D(T) of the tariff rate, the objective of the social planner

would become the maximization of


(14)       V =   f [P.F(L())   + G(N — N) —   D(i)].exp(—   r.t) dt
                 0

by choice of the time path of T, subject to the transition law

           N = — S•(N —
                          L(T)).
Without going through the details of the formal analysis of this problem, the

following modifications of the results of the preceding subsection should be
                                      70



noted. Since the consumption distortion loss of the tariff is second order

of smalls for small values of T (assuming no other distortions), we retain

the earlier result that there is a region of optimal steady positions for

the economy surrounding the free trade equilibrium point. The size of this

region of optimal steady states, however, is reduced because taking account

of the consumption distortion loss of a tariff implies a greater shadow

value for shifting workers out of X and into Z at any level of N >           N*;
specifically, at any steady state position (where U = 0 and N =           0),   A is

now given by

(15)      A =   [G'(N - N) - P•F'(N) +
Comparing this result with (9), the additional term D'(L1(N))L1'(N)/r

that appears in (15) represents the present discounted value of the gain

from reducing the consumption distortion loss of the tariff by the amount

permitted by reducing the number of workers seeking work in the X industry

by one unit. More generally, along the stable branch of the dynamic system

governing the evolution of N and A (which corresponds to the optimal path

for the economy), the value of A will now be the present discounted value of

G'(N — N) —   P•F'(N   — U) + D'(L1(N —   U))L1'(N     —   U),   rather than the present

discounted value of G'(N — N) —    PF'(N   —   U).   For this reason, for N >      N*,
the value of A along the optimal path will be greater than it was when no

account was taken of the consumption distortion loss of the tariff.                This,

in turn, implies that for any value of N above the optima1—steady state region

the optimum level of unemployment will be higher and the optimum level of

the tariff rate will be lower than it was when no account was taken of the

consumption distortion loss of the tariff.
                                      71




       Modification of the planner's objective function to allow for social

costs of unemployment other than the value of lost output can be dealt with

in much the same way as the modification allowing for the consumption distor-

tion loss of the tariff. If the social loss from unemployment is assumed to

be less than the value of lost output because unemployed workers derive

benefit from alternative uses of their time, to the extent measured by the

function W(U) (with W(U) >   0, W'(U) > 0, and W"(U) < 0), then the marginal
social cost of unemployment is reduced from P.F'(N — U) to P•F'(N — U) —             W'(U).
The first order condition determining the optimal level of U, for given values

of N and A becomes

(16)        P.F'(N — U) — W'(U) <

with   equality holding whenever U > 0.    It Is apparent that the maximum value

of A consistent with zero unemployment is now smaller than it was when unemployed

workers were assumed to derive no benefit from alternative uses of their time.

For A above this maximum, the level of U determined by (16), say U(A, N, P),

is reater than the corresponding level of U, given by N —              F'1(X/P),   deter-

mined in the preceding subsection. Since the transition laws determining the

evolution of N and A are still given by ( 1    )   and   (   7),   It is relatively easy

to establish that the optimal path of trade liberalization is modified in the

following ways. The range of optimal steady values of N around N* is reduced

because the marginal social cost of unemployment is reduced. For any N above

this range, the optimal level of unemployment is Increased and the optimal

level of the tariff rate is reduced. The long run steady state level of the

tariff that is reached starting from such an N is lover and the rate of conver-

gence of the tariff to its steady state level is greater, implying a greater

Initial reduction in the tariff below the previously granted level of protection.
                                   72




    On the other hand, if the social cost of unemployment is assumed to be

greater than the value of output lost, for any of the reasons previously

discussed, then theconclusions of the preceding paragraph are reversed. The

range of optimal steady state value of N around N* is expanded. For any

N above this range, the optimal level of unemployment is reduced and the

optimal level of the tariff rate is increased. The long run steady state

level of the tariff that is reached starting from such an N is higher and

the rate of convergence of the tariff rate to this long run steady state

level is slower, implying a smaller initial reduction in the tariff but not

an elimination of the "overshooting" of the initial reduction in the tariff

to a level below its new steady state level.

     Another area in which it is important to consider modifications of the

model analyzed in the preceding subsection is in the specification of the

transition law that governs the rate at which workers move from seeking

work in the X industry to seeking work in the Z industry. This transition

law is important because It controls the marginal benefit associated with

unemployment by specifying the relationship between the level of unemployment

and the rate of redistribution of the work force. In a more complete analysis

than will be attempted here, it would be appropriate to consider how this

critical transition law arises out of the economic and institutional arrange-

ments that govern wage rates, employment levels, labor migration, and educa-

tion and training of the work force. For the present, it is desirable at

least to consider alternative specifications of the transition law (   1),   which

should be thought of as a reduced form relationship that might be derived

from a more detailed investigation.
                                                    73



         A more general formulation of the transition law (1 ) would allow the

  rate at which workers move from seeking work in X to seeking work in Z to

 depend upon both the level of unemployment experienced by workers in X and

 on the number of such workers; say

  (17)          N =   - 4,(U,   N),     (O, N) = 0 for all N,
 with       =   /U       > 0 and N =         /N     > 0. An additional attractive assumption

 is that        is a linear homogeneous, quasi—concave function, implying that

 equal proportionate increases In U and N (which would hold the unemployment

 rate for workers in X Constant) would result in a proportionate increase in

 the rate of movement of workers Out of the X industry. A specific form of

   that has this property is the Cobb—Douglas form,

 (18)             =   .Ua.N a          0 < a < 1.


 The original form of the transition law (                1)   may be thought of as the limiting

 case of this Cobb—Douglas form with a =                 1.
         Given the more general form of the transition law (17), the Hamiltonian

 for the social planner's optimization problem becomes

 (19)           H = P•F(N — U) + G(N — N) —          X•(U,     N).

The first order condition that determines the optimal value of U, for given

values of N and A becomes

 (20)           H/U = — P.F'(N         — U) +             N) < 0

with equality whenever U > 0. The value of U that satisfies this condition

(and maximizes the value of H) may be written as a iinction of A and N, say

            U = T(X, N).

When U(A, N) is > 0, its partial derivatives are given by

(21)         U/A =      — /(P         F" +

             U/N =
(22)                    (P •F" —
                                      A.q)/(p •F" + A.u)
                                           74



The second order condition for maximization of H with respect to U,

 (23)        2H/aU2 = P.F" +           <   0,
implies that the denomintors in the expressions for U/X and U/N must be

negative. Since        must be negative at the value of U that satisfies (20)

(with equality), it follows that U/X >          0.   In other words, an increase in

the shadow value of moving workers out of X and into Z always justifies an

increase in the level of unemployment. In the case where              is a linear

homogeneous, quasi—concave function, we also know that

(24)         4•U + JN•N = 0.

Since U must be < N, it follows that in the linear homogeneous, quasi—concave

case, 0 <    U/N <   1, with 1J/3N =   0 only if          =    (which is true for the
transition law (1 )), and with 3U/3N = 1 only if. U = N (which is true only if

all workers in X are unemployed).

        The determination of the optimum level of unemployment as a funttlon of

  and N is illustrated in figure 2. In this figure, the number of workers

seeking work in X, N, and the number of workers actually employed in X, N - U,

are measured positively along the horizontal axis, starting from the origin 0.

Relative to the origin 0, the curve labeled P.F'(N—U) shows the value of the

marginal product of labor in X as a function of the number of workers employed

in that industry. For a given number of workers seeking work in X, N0, this

same curve, viewed from the perspective of an origin at N0, shows the trarginal

cost of unemployment, with the level of unemployment measured negatively along

the horizontal axis starting at N0. When N =

benefit of unemployment is indicated by the curve labeled
                                                                    Ao•u(TJ, N0) which

reflects the assumption that                  <   0; that is, the marginal response of the
rate of redistribution of workers to an increase in the level of unemployment

is assumed to decline as the level of unemployment rises. The intersection

of the marginal cost and marginal benefit curves at the point A determines

the optimum level of unemployment U(A0, N0). An increase in A to A1 shifts

this intersection point to B and increases the optimum level of unemployment

to U(A1, N0).
        With the modification of Hamiltonian for the social planner's optimization

problem, the rule governing the evolution of the shadow price A becomes


(25)             A =   rA   —   H/(—N)   =   rA   + PF'(N—U) — G'(N—N) +
                                                                           XN(U,N).
Setting U = U(A, N) in this differential equation and in the transition law

N      —   (U,   N) that determines the evolution of N, we obtain the differential

equation system that governs the joint behavior of N and A.

        One important issue concerning the nature of this differential equation

system concerns the circumstance under which it will have a range of optimal

steady state values of N and A, where N = 0 and A =               0, as was illustrated in
figure 1. This situation arises when the "marginal product" of unemployment

in increasing the rate of redistribution of workers,                       N), is bounded as

the level of unemployment approaches zero.                 The reason is that with an

upper      bound on the limiting value u(U, N) as U approaches 0, the limiting
value      of the marginal benefit of unemployment,                  N), for   small values
of     A is less than the marginal cost of unemployment, P.F'(N — U).               This

means that in the neighborhood of the distribution of the work force N* that

corresponds to the free trade equilibrium, where the value of A associated

with the stable branch of the dynamic system governing N and A must be small,

we cannot satisfy the first order condition (20) with a positive level of U.
                                       77



Hence, within a region around N*, N will be zero, implying that once we reach this

region it is not optimal to incur the costs associated with any positive level

of unemployment in order to enjoy the benefits of moving closer to free trade.

In contrast, when the limit of u(U, N) as U approaches zero is unbounded, the

only optimal steady state position will be the free trade equilibrium position.

     Another important issue concering this differential equation system is

the path of the tariff rate along the path of convergence to an optimal steady

state position, starting from a level of N that is above the range of optimal

steady state levels of N. In this regard, it should be recalled that for the

transition law N =   — .U   examined in the preceding subsection, the optimal path

of the tariff rate Involved "overshooting" in the sense that the tariff rate

was initially reduced to below its new steady state level (which was below its

inherited level) and then gradually raised to this steady state level. Since

the tariff rate is directly related to the actual level of employment in X,

through the function L(T) described In preceding subsection, the path of the

tariff can be inferred from the path of L = N — U.     Whenever the initial N

is above the range of optimal steady state values of N, it follows that the

tariff rate must initially be cut to below its inherited level in order to

start the economy moving toward its optimal steady state. If L = N — U is

rising along the subsequent path of convergence to this steady state, it

follows that the tariff rate must be rising along this path, and hence that

tariff rate must initially be cut to below its new steady state level-—that

is, there must be "overshooting" in the optimal behavior of the tariff rate.

On, the other hand, if L declines along the path of convergence to the optimal

steady state, the tariff rate must be declining along this path and, hence

must initially be reduced by only a fraction of its ultimate reduction. This

might be described as the case of "gradual adjustment" of the tariff rate.
                                                 78



        After some rather tedious manipulations (the details of which are omitted),

it is possible to show that the rate of change of employment in X along the

path of convergence to the steady state is given by

(26)        L =                 +        +

where

(27)           =   l/(PF"   + x.utj)   <0

Along this path of convergence, starting from an N above the steady state region,
  = — N will be positive and X will be negative. Hence, the prospects for

avoiding "overshooting" of the tariff rate as a optimal policy depend on

having       +       negative and sufficiently large that L is positive. For

the transition law t(U, N) =        U    examined in the preceding subsection, this

condition cannot possibly be met since                and      are both zero.   Iti the

case wFre (U, N) is a linear homogeneous, quasi—concave function, we may

use the fact that UU + UN =

< 0 to conclude that term                    +        contributes   to the possibility that

the initial reduction in the tariff rate will not overshoot the ultimate steady

state reduction in the tariff rate. More specifically, in the Cobb—Douglas

case where 4(TJ, N)      .Ua.Nla, it can be shown that starting from an N > N*,

the tariff rate will ultimately be reduced to a steady state value of zero

(free trade equilibrium will be reached) and that the tariff rate will be

declining along the optimal path of convergence to free trade at least in the

region where

(28)        G'(N — N) < (l/a).P.F'(N).

Since G'(N*) =     P.F'(N*),   it is apparent that this region necessarily includes

a range of values of N immediately above N*. When a is small and when the

marginal product of labor in the two industries is not very sensitive to changes
                                        79



in the levels of employment in the respective industries, the region where

gradual convergence of the tariff rate is assured tends to be quite large.

     Mt   explanation   of the result of gradual convergence to free trade in

the Cobb—Douglas case may be given as follows. With the Cobb—Douglas

specification of the U, N) function, the marginal product of unemployment

in stimulating workers to move from X to Z,        =     a(N/U)a,   becomes indefi-

nitely large as the level of unemployment is reduced toward zero. This

implies that even with a low shadow value for shifting a worker when we are

near the free trade distribution of the work force, the value of the marginal

product of unemployment, A.41, will be able to equal the marginal cost of

unemployment at some positive level of U. Hence, it always pays to tolerate

at least a small amount of unemployment to move the economy in the direction

of its free trade equilibrium. The marginal product of unemployment in

stimulating redistribution of the labor force, however, is a sharply declining

function of the level of unemployment, especially at relatively low levels

of unemployment (i.e.,        = — ct.(l—a).N 1-cL•Ua—2   is large and negative

for small values of U). This means that there is an incentive to provide

the stimulus reguired to induce workers to move to the free trade distribution

of the labor force by having very low levels of unemployment spread over long

periods rather than higher levels of unemployment for shorter periods. Hence,

the optimal path for the tariff rate does not involve a large Initial cut that

would generate a high initial level of unemployment and stimulate a rapid

initial rate of convergence of N toward N*. Rather, the optimal policy calls

for a small initial cut in the tariff rate to stimulate a small amount of

unemployment, and then a gradual reduction in the tariff rate to maintain

a small but decreasing level of unemployment along the adjustment path to

the free trade equilibrium.

D. Suggested Conclusions

     As previously noted, concern about the economic and institutional arrange—

merits that underlie the assumed reduced form relationship between the level of

unemployment in the previously protected industry and the rate at which workers

shift out of this industry casts some doubt on the validity and generality of

the analysis based on this reduced form relationship. If, however, we accept

the hypothesis that there is such a reduced form relationship that remains

stable for variations in the commercial policy regime (and for variations in

other related policies), then some general conclusions may be seen to follow

from the preceding analysis concerning the influence of unemployment on the

appropriate path of commercial policy in a program of trade liberalization.

     First, there are circumstances in which it is not optimal, because of

the social cost of unemployment, to push trade liberalization all of the way

to what would be the first best optimum in the absence of these costs. These

circumstances arise when the marginal social cost of unemployment in the

previously protected industry is positive and bounded away from zero at low

levels of unemployment in that industry and when the "marginal product" of

unemployment in stimulating a more rapid movement of workers out of the

previously protected industry does not become very large as the level of

unemployment becomes small.   When these conditions are met, it is not

optimal to reduce the level protection below a certain finite level because

the social cost of the unemployment generated by further reductions is greater

than the present discounted value of the gain in allocative efficiency from

inducing workers to shift out of the previously protected industry.

     Second, the circumstances under which a finite, permanent level of protec-

tion would be justified by the social costs of temporary unemployment resulting

from reductions in the level of protection would not arise if it were possible
                                    81



to maintain a finite rate of redistribution of the work force with a very

low level of unemployment in the previously protected industry. In particular,

adapting the model of capital redistribution used in section 2 to the present

discussion of labor force redistribution, new workers entering the labor force

might be assumed to locate outside of the previously protected industry in

response to the incentives associated with even a very low level of unemployment

in this industry; whereas workers already employed in the protected industry

would move (prior to retirement) only in response to a much higher level of

unemployment. In this situation, it would be optimal to generate, through

reductions in the level of protection, at least the very low level of unemploy-

ment necessary to induce new workers not to locate in the protected industry.

until the first best equilibrium is achieved.

     Third, the behavior of commercial policy along the path of convergence

to the optimal steady state depends critically on the shape of the reduced

form relationship between the level of unemployment in the protected industry

and the rate at which workers are shifting out of this industry. In the case

analyzed in subsection B, where we have a proportional response of N to U, we

find that it is optimal for the initial reduction in the tariff rate to over-

shoot the long—run steady state and for the tariff rate to rise (subsequent to

this initial reduction) along the optimal path of convergence to its (positive)

steady state level. However, in the case of the Cobb—Douglas response function

discussed in subsection C, the optimal initial reduction in the tariff rate

is smaller than the optimal steady state reduction (to zero), and the tariff

rate declines along the optimal path of convergence to its steady state value.

     Fourth, it is possible to argue, at least heuristically, that the properties
                                                              c Nl-c
exhibited by the Cobb—Douglas response function t(U, N) = U            are probably
                                     82



more reasonable than the properties exhibited by the proportional response

function U, N) = f3U.    The argument is that even with a low level of unemploy—

rnent in the protected industry (when the level of protection in this industry

is not too high), most new workers will see the advantage of seeking jobs

outside of this industry, especially if the prospect is for further reductions

in the level of protection. Hence, even with a low level of unemployment in

the protected Industry (relative to the average in the economy), there will be

a fairly high net rate of movement of workers out of this industry as older

workers retire and few new workers enter this industry. At higher levels of

unemployment in the protected industry, even fewer new workers will decide to

enter, and some older workers will decide to shift industries before retirement.

However, the rate of worker redistribution will rise far less than proportion-

ately with increases in the level of unemployment in the protected industry

because most new workers will be affected even at low levels of unemployment

and because the number of older workers who decide to shift in response to

an increase in unemployment tends to decline as the level of unemployment

rises.

     Finally, if this heuristic argument about the form of the (U, N) function

governing the response of the rate of worker movement to the level of unemployment

in the protected industry is accepted, then it follows that concern with con-

trolling the social costs of unemployment arising from reductions in the level

of protection provides a valid rationale for a gradual policy of trade

liberalization.

                                      APPENDIX



          This appendix presents some of the formal          details   of the analysis

of the dynamic process governing the adjustment of the economy for the model

described in Section II. We consider an economy that produces two goods, X

and Z, in accord with standard, neoclassical, linear homogeneous production

functions, using two inputs, capital and labor:

(Al)      X =
                 F(Lx, Kx)

(A2)      Z =
                G(Lz,   Kz).

Labor is assumed to     be   mobile between X and Z production, but capital is

specific, at least at a moment of time, to producing output in the industry

where it is located.

          There is an adjustment process through which capital can be moved

from one industry to another over the course of time. Such capital movement

is "costly" in the sense that it requires use of some of the economy's

supply of mobile labor, in accord with the labor requirements function for

capital movement;

(A3)      LM =   lp(fMI),       p(O) = 0    p'(0) =   0, p" > 0

where M denotes the rate at which existing capital is being moved out of Z

and into X. The specification of i as a function of the absolute value of

M implies that the cost of moving existing capital is independent of the

direction of movement.

          In addition to movement of existing capital, adjustment occurs

through depreciation of existing capital, at an exponential rate 5 common

to capital located in both industries, and through investment in new capital
                                       84




that may be located (initially) in either industry. Investment requires

use of some of the economy's supply of mobile labor in accord with the

investment labor requirements function;

(A4)      L1 =    4(I), O) =     0,   4'(I) >   0,   4"(I) >   0,
where I is the rate of production of new capital.

          Taking account of investment in new capital, depreciation of

existing capital, and movement of existing capital, the rates of change

of the capital stocks in the two industries are given by

(A5)


(A6)
          Kz=Iz_6Kz_M;
where Lx >Oand a         > 0 are, respectively, the amounts of investment allocated


to X and Z, which add up to total investment in new capital; i.e.,

(A7)
          1x+
                    =   I.
          The total amount of mobile labor available to produce final goods,

to produce new capital, and to produce the service of movement of existing

capital is the economy's endowment of labor, L. Assuming that labor is

fully employed, the constraint on the total use of labor is expressed by

the requirement

CAB)
         LX+LZ+LI+LM=L.
          It   is assumed that the behavior of the economy is governed by a

social planner whose objective is to maximize the present discounted value

of the economy's output of final goods, V, where V is defined by


A9)      V=         (P.X + Z) exp(—r.t) dt.
                                                        85




It is assumed that the relative price of X in terms of X, denoted by P,

and real interest rate measured in terms of units of Z per year, denoted

by r, are fixed exogenously (by conditions in world goods and capital

markets). This assumption of exogeneously determined values of P and r

could be relaxed with some increase in the complexity of the analysis,

but without altering any of its basic conclusions. The social planner's

behavior Is constrained by the relationships expressed in (Al) through (A8).

           To determine the solution or the social planner's optimization

problem it is convenient to define the current value Hamiltonian

(AlO)      H =                        + G(Lz,Kz) + 11.(I —                              + H)
                 P.F•(Lx,Kx)                                                    I5.KX


                 +                —            —
                                                   M)   + w(L     —         —         —        +   —
                                      S.KZ                             Lx        Lz

In   this Hamiltonian,             represents           the shadow price of a unit of capital

located in X, i represents the shadow price of a unit of capital located

in Z, and w represents the shadow wage rate, all measured in terms of

units of Z at time t. The first order conditions for optimal behavior at

time t require maximization of H by choice of the current control variables

Lx, Lx, 1x' I H, and
                                      .
                                           Assuming an interior solution, the associated
first order conditions are for the maximization of H are given by

          The condition (Alla) determines the amount of labor employed in X

through the requirement that the value of the marginal product of labor in

X must equal the shadow wage rate. It follows that

 (A12a)   Lx =     K•Q(w/P), /(w/P)                    <   0

where £x(w/P) is the labor demand function (the inverse of the marginal

product of labor schedule) for a firm with one unit of capital located in X.

Similarly, the condition (llb) determines the amount of labor employed in

Z through the relationship

(A12b)    Lz = Kz•.Zz(w),       z" <           o

where .(w) is the labor demand function (the inverse of the marginal

product of labor schedule) for a firm with one unit of capital located in Z.

          The conditions (Alic) and (Alid) jointly determine the level of

investment in new capital and its distribution between X and Z. Except in

the special case where          =           satisfaction       of these two conditions

requires that all newly produced capital be allocated to the industry

which has the higher shadow price of capital, and that no new capital be

allocated to the industry with the lower shadow price of capital; that is

                   t1(/) f            px >


In the special case whereU                   the aggregate level of investment is

determined by I =
                    ''() = 1(1),                       and the distribution of investment

between X and Z is determined by conditions other than the first order

conditions for maximization of the current value Hamiltonian.

         The rate and direction of movement of existing capital between

industries is determined by the condition (Alle) which says that the

marginal cost of moving capital from Z into X, w.sign(M)i'(N), should

equal the marginal benefit of such movement, as measured by the difference

between the shadow price of a unit of capital located in X and the shadow

price of a unit of capital located in Z. Solving this condition to determine

M, we find that


(A12e)   N =
                 sign( -   )I_1(J         -



Thus,    —          determinesthe rate at which existing capital is moved
between industries, and the sign of           —        determines the direction of

that movement.

          The appropriate value of the shadow wage rate is determined by

the condition (A12f) which is imply the labor market clearing condition.

Using (A12a) through (A12e) to substitute into (Alif), it follows that

this value of the shadow wage rate must satisfy


(Al2f)    Kx.Lx(w/P) + KzLz(u)) +


                  + P(*''(Ix —
                                 p/w))        =   L.


This condition can be solved for the optimum value of w as a function of

the State variables        and   and the co—state variables            and    (with

the aggregate labor supply suppressed as a argument); viz
                                           88




(Al3)
               w(K., Kz, 11x'       z'
where the partial derivatives of w with respect to each of its arguments

is positive. Using the function w(Kx, Kz, 'x' liz)               to   substitute for the

variable w that appears in (A12a) through (A12e), we may determine the

values of the other current control variables, Lx, Lx, 1x'                    and M, as

functions of the state variables               and Kz and the co—state variables

and .      These functional relationships, which are implied by the first

order conditions for maximization of the current value Hamiltonian, are

indicated by a "tilda" appearing above the respective variable; e.g.

                       denotes the level of labor employed in X as a function
Lx(Kx Kz, x'
of the state and co—state variables of the social planner's maximization

problem.

           Optimal behavior by the social planner also requires that the

state variables        and Kz and the co—state variables                       evolve    in

accord with the appropriate transition laws. Specifically, for                     and Kz,

we require that

              =
(A.14a)
                  H/iix =       IX(KX, Kx, lir) —
                                                             +
                                                                 M(Kx, Kz, lix U)


                            =                         —
(A14b)     1z =   3H/ali        IZ(KX, Kz, Mx ) — 6.Kz M(Kx,             Kz, lix liz).

For the co—state variables,             and p2, we require that


(A14c)        =
                  r.M
                        —           = (r   +         —
                                                         P•FK(Lx(Kx, Kz, Mx              K)

(A14d)        =
                  ri    —
                            3H/Kz
                                    =   (r +    )•M —
                                                         GK(LZ(KX, Kz, Mx liz), Kz)
                                    89




In addition, for the social planner to have chosen the optimal path for

the economy, Kx and Kz must have the initial values determined by the

initial levels of capital in the two industries, and the paths of the

state and co—state variables must satisfy the non—negativity constraints

and the relevant transversality conditions.

          Since the dynamic system that characterizes the evolution of the

state and co—state variables is a (nonlinear) fourth order system, the

usual graphical techniques (phase diagrams) that are applied for systems

with one state variable and one co—state variable cannot be applied in the

present case. There are, however, three important features of the present

system that can be described relatively easily.

          First, taking the forward looking solutions of the differential

equations (A14c) and (A14d) that characterize the evolution of the shadow

prices of capital in the two industries, we find that


(A15c)   Mx(t) =   ft P.FK(s).exp(_(r+S).(s_t))ds + B.eXp((r+S).t)
(A15d)   Mz(t) =   f   GK(s).exp(_(r+5)(s_t))ds. + B.exp((r+c5).t)


The transversality conditions for the social planner's optimization imply

that the constants Bx and Bz in (A15c) and (A15d) must both be zero. Thus,

the shadow price of capital located in each industry at time t is equal to

the present discounted value of the future return to a unit of capital in

that industry, as determined by the value of the marginal product of capital

in that industry, discounted at a rate equal to the market interest rate

pius the depreciation rate. When the economy is controlled by private

agents, these shadow prices calculated by the social planner are replaced
                                    90




by the prices of units of capital located in the two industries which are

calculated by private agents.

             Second, at the steady state position of the economy for a given

(constant) relative price of X in terms of Z, the value of the marginal

product of capital must be the same in the two industries. Assuming that

production is non—specialized, It follows that steady state wage rate,

w*(p), and the steady state rental rate on capital, R*(P), (both measured

in terms of the numeraire Z) correspond to the equilibrium wage rate and

rental rate determined in the standard two—sector (Heckscher—Ohlin—

Samuelson) model in which labor and capital are assumed to be perfectly mobile

between industries. The steady state wage rate and rental rate, therefore,

depend only on the relative commodity price, P.    In the present model, how-

ever, the size of the capital stock is not fixed, and its steady state

level depends on the relative commodity price. Specifically, the steady

state size of the capital stock, K*,Is determined by the requirement that


(A16)     w*(P)I(K*) = R*(P)/(r       +5) =

where R*/(r + ô) corresponds to the common steady state value of      and

denoted by        From the properties of the standard two—sector model, it is

known that if X production is relatively capital intensive, R*(P)/*(P) is

an increasing function of P. It follows that in the present model if X

production is relatively capital intensive, then the steady state capital

stock will be an increasing function of P. The converse obviously holds if

X is relatively labor intensive. The steady state distribution of the

capital stock also depends on P: specifically, it can be shown that 4(P)

is an increasing function of P and K(P) is a decreasing function of P.

         Third, with respect to the adjustment process, it is important to

note the difference between the factors that determine the rate of investment

in new capital (and the distribution of that investment between industries)

and the factors that determine the rate of movement of existing capital

between industries. For the rate of investment, what matters is the

maximum of      and     and any small difference between    and    leads all

new capital to be located in the industry with the higher shadow price of

capital. Changes in the shadow price of capital for capital with the lower

shadow price have no effect on the rate of investment in new capital or on

its distribution between industries, so long as this shadow price remains the

lower of the two shadow prices of capital. In contrast, the rate of move-

ment of existing capital depends on the difference between the shadow prices

of capital in the two industries. Common changes in the levels of        and

therefore, have no effect on the rate of movement of existing capital.

             The nature of the adjustment process subsequent to a permanent

reduction in the level of protection (which reduces the relative price of

X in terms of Z seen by domestic producers and consumers) may be understood

with the aid for figure Al. This figure is constructed for the case where

the protected industry, X, is relatively capital intensive. Since only

relative commodity prices matter, it is clear that this analysis applies

equally well to a permanent increase in the level of protection of the Z

 industry which is assumed to be relatively labor intensive.

             In figure Al, the line labeled L*L* shows the combinations of

             for which the long run level of labor demand is equal to the
 K and
 available labor supply, as expressed by the requirement that

                                                  =   •(1'(*/*(p))).     The

nature of the solution of the social planner's optimization problem is

such that the economy reaches this line precisely when        and    are equal

to each other and equal to i*.      Once this line is reached, ii and     remain

equal to     ( and      1Z are both equal to zero), the amount of labor devoted

to investment remains constant at L, the shadow wage rate remains constant

at w*(P), and aggregate investment remains constant at 1* =              The
                                                                 4(L).
distribution of aggregate investment changes in order to keep (A17) satisfied;

that is,     and        jointly satisfy the conditions

           Kx.   t + k. s = o
(A18b)     Kx + Kz = 1* —         +   Kz)•


From these conditions, it follows that when the economy is at a point along

the L*L* line above and to the left of the optimum steady state point

(K, K), K is rising, Kz is falling, and the aggregate capital stock

Kx + Kz is rising (since the rate of increase of         is greater than the

rate of decrease of Kz). This process continues until the economy reaches

the optimum steady state position (K, K) which depends on the given value

of the domestic relative price of X in terms of Z. At this optimum steady

state position, aggregate investment is just sufficient to cover aggregate

capital depreciation and the distribution of investment is such as to keep

the capital stock in each industry constant. Conversely, if the economy

starts at a point on the L*L* line that is below and to the right of the

optimum steady state point, then K will be falling and          will be rising,
                                      94




and the aggregate capital stock will be falling (since rate of decrease

of     exceeds the rate of increase of Kz) This process also continues

until the optimum steady state point (K, K) is reached.

           If the initial levels of capital in the two final goods industries

place the economy at a point off of the L*L* line defined by (A17), the

optimum initial value of       will necessarily differ from the optimum

initial value of     determined by the solutions to the social planner's

optimization problem. In particular, if the point corresponding to the

initial levels of capital in the two industries lies above the L*L* line,

like the point A =          4), the optimum initial values of       and p, denoted
                     (14,
by 4(0) and 4(0), must be less than *          with 4(0) > i4(o).   At this

initial point, Kz will be falling and          will be rising because all new

investment will be devoted to the X industry and some existing capital

will be moving from z to X.--" The point describing the position of the

economy in figure Al, therefore, will be moving downward and to the right

along a path leading to point on the L*L* line (or on the           axis). As

the economy moves along this path, both jj. and         will be rising, and

rising more rapidly than          When the L*L* line is reached, i7   will    equal

     and both will equal        Henceforth,   the economy will move along the

L*L* line in the manner previously described.

            If the initial levels of capital in the two industries place the

economy at a point such as B =
                                   (4      4) that is below the L*L* line, the




1/ If the capital stock in both industries is large, the initial level of
    aggregate investment together with the rate of capital movement may not
    be sufficient to compensate for depreciation of capital in X. In this
    case, both K and     will be declining at the economy's initial point.

optimum initial values of      and        denoted by 4(0) and i4(O), will be

greater than i*, with 4(0) < 4(0). At this initial point,              will be

falling and     will be rising because all new investment will be devoted

to the Z industry and some existing capital will be moving out of X and

into Z. The point describing the position of the economy, therefore, will

be moving upward and to the left along a path leading to the L*L* line (or

to the Kz axis). As the economy moves along this path, both            and       will.

be falling, with      falling more rapidly than           When the L*L* is

reached,      will equal i7 and both will equal ji*. Henceforth, the economy

will move along the L*L* line in the manner previously described.

            If the initial position of the economy is the steady state

equilibrium position corresponding to a higher relative price of X (sustained

by the previous tariff protection granted to the X industry), then this

position must be at a point like C =
                                          (4.   4) that lies below the L*L* line

and below and to the right of the new steady state equilibrium point (,

At   this initial point C, the total capital stock,         =
                                                                4 + 4, must be
greater than the new steady state equilibrium capital stock, K* =            +
                                                                                 9.
This   is indicated in figure Al by the position of the point C above the K*K*

line which shows the combinations of            and Kz for which the total capital

stock is equal to K*. Starting at C, the rules governing the adjustment of

the economy are those described in the preceding paragraph: Kx falls and

rises, and both      and    fall until L*L* line is reached at which time



1/ The old steady state equilibrium position must lie along the line
    described by (A17) for a higher value of P. Using the properties of
    the standard two—sector model, it may be shown that this old L*L* line
    must lie below the L*L* line in figure Al which is drawn for a lower
    value of P.

  —    — A*. The   point D at which the L*L* line is reached (starting

from C) must lie below and to the right of the new steady state equilibrium

point (K. K). Subsequent adjustment along the L*L* line, therefore,

involves a positive K and a negative Kx, with these levels of net investment

converging to zero as the steady state equilibrium position is reached.

The path of adjustment from the point C to the new steady state equilibrium

position at (K, K) is the path of adjustment in response to an immediate

trade liberalization that is discussed in the main text.
