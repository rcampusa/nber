                    CONSUMER     DISCRIMINATION AND SELF- EMPLOYMENT


                                          ABSTRACT




      Self-employment    rates     and incomes   differ   significantly     by race.   We show

that these differentials arise in markets with consumer discrimination and

incomplete information about the price of the good and the race of the seller.

Equilibrium income distributions have two properties:                  mean black incomes are

lower than mean white incomes, and the returns to ability are lower for black

than for white sellers.        Able blacks, therefore, are less likely to self-

select into the self-employment sector than able whites.                  Using the 1980

Census data, we find that observed differences in the self-employment income

distributions are consistent with the theoretical predictions.

I.    Introduction

     After a long period of neglect, economists have recently begun to

systematicallyanalyze the role that self-employment plays in the labor

market.     This developing literature has already established a few

interestingempirical regularities regarding the determinants of self-

employment rates and the compensation of self-employed persons.        For

example, Blau (1987) finds that changes in tax laws and technology account

for a large fraction of the observed increase in self-employment       rates over

the last two decades; Lazear and Moore (1984) document that the age/earnings

profiles of self-employed persons are substantially flatter than the

age/earnings profiles of salaried workers; and Evans and Leighton (1987)

show that the transition rates into and Out of self-employment are

independent of age and labor market experience.

     It is also well known (Moore 1983; 8orjas 1986) that there exist

sizable differences in the characteristics of the self-employment       sector

across ethnic/racial    groups.     In particular, whites have larger self-

employment rates and incomes than blacks or Hispanics.        This fact is hard to


interpret    in the traditional framework of an employer discrimination model

since self-employed persons have no reason to discriminate against

themselves.1     This paper presents a theoretical and empirical analysis of

the differences in both self-employment rates and incomes across racial

groups.     Our maintained hypothesis    is thatthese differences are generated


by consumer discrimination,       whereby white consumers dislike purchasing goods

and services from blacks and other minorities (becker 1971).

     The simplest consumer discrimination model assumes perfect information

(i.e., consumers costlessly know the price of the good and the race of the

sellers)    and generates an equilibrium of complete segregation (Cain 1986).
                                        -2-



Racial   differences   in self-employment rates and incomes in this model can

only be created by differences across black and white consumers and/or

sellers.     In particular, black and white consumers have to differ in their

preferences    for goods or incomes, or there must be racial variation in

endowments (of skills or wealth) of sellers.     The theoretical analysis,

therefore,    then depends on a number of extraneous assumptions about

heterogeneity between the black and white populations.2

    A more powerful analysis results if consumers can only obtain information

about the price of the good and the race of the seller at a cost.           The

existence of imperfect information yields two important implications about

the population income distributions    of self-employed blacks and whites.

First, the mean income level of blacks will be smaller than that of whites

due to consumer discrimination.     Second, the relative gains of entering the

self-employment    sector are reduced for able blacks.     Intuitively, high

                                                                    their
ability self-employed blacks are more likely to expand the scale of

firm and cater to the larger white market.     This expansion, however, requires

that high ability blacks lower their prices in order to "compensate' white

consumers for their disutility.     Our empirical analysis uses the 1980 U.S.

Census and shows that indeed blacks and other minorities are negatively

selected into self-employment, but that whites are not.3

    Section II presents a search model with consumer discrimination          that


generates    equilibriumprice and income distributions for white and black

sellers.     This model implies that skill wage differentials will be narrower

in the self-employed sector for blacks than for whites.        The empirical

                of the theory are tested in Section III.     Our analysis
implications

documents    a fundamental difference between whites and other racial groups in

the self-selectionmechanism that generates the pooi of self-employed
workers.    Finally, Section IV summarizes the results of the study.



II.    Theory

      A.   Consumer 8ehav..ir

      Suppose    there are two types of sellers, black (b) and white          (w),

producing a homogeneous good.             The fraction of black sellers in the

population is          8, where 8 is assumed   to be less than one-half throughout

the analysis.          There are also black and white buyers, and, for simplicity,

we assume that the fraction of black buyers in the population is also given

                                                                   are risk-
by         Finally, we assume that all consumers maximize utility,

neutral, have a zero discount rate, and an infinite time horizon.

      In order to focus on the essential aspects of consumer discrimination,

we assume that white consumers have a taste for discrimination               against black

sellers, but that black buyers are indifferent about the race of the

seller.5        This implies that if black sellers charge price        F,   a white buyer

will perceive the price as being P/(l.d), where d is the discrimination

coefficient.       Define    P.   to be the consumer's valuation of the good.        The

maximum price white consumers are willing to pay for a unit of the good

purchased from a black seller is R(l-d).            White consumers   who purchase from

white sellers, and black consumers who purchase from any seller, are willing

to pay up to      P.   for the good.     We assume that consumer demand is inelastic

below the price R.

      Consumers randomly Contact sellers.           Imperfect   information implies that

consumers do not know (without incurring some search Costs) the price of the

good and the race of the seller.             If the buyer rejects the seller's

"price/race      quote", the Cost of contacting another seller is C dollars.               The


optimal search strategy has a Constant reservation price property where
                                                                 .4-




reservation prices differ according to both the race of the seller and the

race of the buyer.

    Let V(P,i,j) denote the value of a price offer P from a seller of race i

to a consumer of race j (i,j—b,w).                           This value function is defined by:




    V(P,i,j) —        max(R-D(i,j)P, 0,              -   C +      EV(P,i,j))                    (1)




where D(i,j)—l/(l-d)                  for i—b, j—u, and                D(i,j)—l otherwise.   Expectations

are taken over the distribution of offer prices F(P).

    A reservation price P*(i,j) is implicitly defined by:



    P.   •
             D(i,j)   P*(i,j) — xnax(0,          -       C   +   EV(P,i,j))                     (2)




The reservation price P*(i,j) is the price offer from a seller of race i                                    to
a buyer of race           j        that leaves the buyer indifferent between purchasing the

good at that price and continuing to search.                                 Since there are four types of

consumer/seller           matches that can occur in this model, there are four

possible reservation prices (P*(w,w), p*(w,b), P*(b,w), p*(b,bfl for

consumers.       We denote the reservation price distribution by G(P*).                               Equation

(2) implies that G(P*) depends on F(P).




    5.       Seller Behavior

    Sellers are assumed to be utility maximizers, with a utility function

given by U —      I   -       H6/6,    where I is self-employment                income, H is hours worked,

and 6 > 1.       Sellers engage in two kinds of activities.                            First, goods are

produced at rate              fi   per unit of time, where                  differs across sellers due to


ability.      Second,              there is a period of time during which sellers and
consumers   conduct the transaction.                    Suppose that all sellers, regardless                 of

their ability,   can complete a transactions per unit of time.                              During this

'contact" period between sellers and consumers, sellers are prevented                                   from

producing the good.             Ci rn that consumers randomly encounter sellers,

information   regarding the price of the good and the race of the seller is

also exchanged during this contact period.                          Incomplete information implies

that some contacts between consumers and sellers will not result in a sale

and the time costs incurred during the contact period cannot be recovered.

Thus incomplete information imposes an opportunity cost on sellers.

    Let r be the fraction of contacts that result in a sale.                                Sellers offer a

price/race quote that leads to one of three possible selling strategies:                                      (a)

sell to all consumers            (r    —   1);   (b)   sell only to blacks (r       —   9);     and   (c)   sell

only to whites   (r    —       1-9).       Let s be the fraction of the workday spent in

production.    Efficiency requires that                   sH    —   ai(l-s)H,   hence   s   —

    The price charged by the seller, P(r), is a function of the segregation

behavior chosen:       P(r) must be less than or equal to the reservation prices

of all the consumers it chooses to serve.                       The objective of the seller,

therefore, is to choose H and r so as to maximize:




    U —        P(r)H       -
                               H6/6                                                             (3)




    The maximization of (3) is easier to conduct in two stages.                                 First,

consider the seller's optimization over                    H.       For a given price, P(r), the

seller's indirect utility function is given by:



       -
            (l/)[L PC?)]                   -   y/c                                              (4)
                                            -6-




where c —    5/CS-I), andy    is the income level           associatedwith utility-

maximizing behavior. The second stage of the maximizationprocess involves

the choice of segregation behavior by the seller.                    The indirect utility

function in (4) can be evaluated at the three alternative values of                         r,      and a

seller chooses the value of r that maximizes utility. The functional form in

(3)   implies   that utility-maximization       leads to the same segregation behavior

as income-maximization.7     This is easily verified since U*(r) >                     U*(r')    if and


only if y(r) >    y(r'),   for r s r'.

      As noted earlier, sellers differ in their ability to produce output (as

measured by the parameter fi).      For   simplicity, we assume that there are two

types of sellers     (within each race group).             High ability sellers are indexed

                                         low ability sellers are indexed by                               >
by the productivity parameter      h'                                                           1
fi)    and the fraction of high ability sellers in the population is                       w.       We

assume the same ability distribution for both race groups so that any income

differentials    in the model cannot be attributed to skill differences.

      The four types of sellers in the market generate the offer price

distribution F(P) over the prices Pwh           P          P        and P         where offer
                                            ,
                                                  wl   ,
                                                           bh   ,
                                                                         bl   ,




prices are indexed over the race and ability of the seller.                          Since sellers

can charge no more than the minimum reservation price of all the consumers

it chooses to serve, F(P) will depend on G(P*), the distribution of

reservation prices of consumers.



      C.   Equilibrium Price and Income Distributions

      Because of imperfect information, the offer price distribution is likely

to be non-degenerate.      We, therefore, must characterize the properties                          of

the equilibrium price distribution in the market (as in Reinganum 1979; and

Carlson and McAfee 1983), before analyzing income differentials across
sellers.     We use a Nash equilibrium concept so that in equilibrium no seller

has an incentive to alter his offer price, and no buyer has an incentive to

alter his reservation price, taking the actions of other agents as given.

We define an equilibriur price distribution as a set of offer prices and

segregation strategies for sellers, and reservation prices for consumers,

such that given F(P) consumers choose optimal reservation prices P*(i,j)

that collectively generate C(P*); and given G(P*) sellers choose utility

maximizing price, output, and segregation strategies chat collectively

generate    F(P).
    Several      important properties   of an equilibrium price distribution follow

from our assumptions about preferences and technology and the definition of

an equilibrium:

    i.      price sellers charge is the minimum of the reservation prices of
           The

the consumers they choose to serve. Sellers will be unable to sell to all
the consumers they wish to serve if they charge a price higher than the
minimum    reservation price; and, given inelastic      demand,   sellers   have no

incentive    to reduce the   price below the minimum reservation price.
    ii.     Reservation prices are      ordered as follows:


            P*(w,w)      P*(w,b) —   p*(b,b)    p*(b,w) —   (ld)P*(w,w)               (5)




The (maximum) price whites are willing to pay white sellers [P*(w,w)} is at

least as great as the price blacks are willing to pay white sellers

[p*(w,b)}:       White buyers set higher reservation prices if they contact a

white seller because their potential gains from search are reduced by the

possibility of encountering a black seller in their next contact.              Further,

since blacks are indifferent to the seller's race, blacks have a single
                                           -8-




reservation price   [P*(w,b) —   P*(b,b)].       Third, the price blacks are willing

to pay a black seller [P*(b,b)] is at least as high as the price whites are

willing to pay a black seller (P*(b,w)].8           Finally, our definition of

consumer discrimination   implies that P*(b,w) —        (l-d)P*(w,w).
    iii.    If sellers serve a segregated market it will be of the same racial

group as the seller.    Equation   (5)   indicates that sellers of race I must

charge the same or lower price in order to attract buyers of race          j   (i   j).

Sellers of race i, therefore, have no incentive to cater solely to buyers of

race j.

    iv.    High ability sellers of any race group only segregate if low ability

sellers of that race group have also segregated.           This result is implied by

the production technology since the opportunity costs of "wasted contacts"

(i.e., contacts that do not result in a sale) are greater the more able the

seller.    This behavior implies that the offer price distribution        can be

ordered as follows:



                                                                         (6)
    1'wl   wh     'bi   bh

This ranking follows from the fact that the lowest price a white seller will

ever charge is the black reservation price, and this is the highest price

that a black seller can ever charge.         Further, since within each race group

high ability sellers are more likely to integrate, they cannot charge a

higher price than low ability sellers if they want to cater to all consumers.

    In order to assess the impact of consumer discrimination on economic

welfare, it is essential to compare the income distributions of black and

white sellers.    Equation (4) shows that income levels will depend on the

offer price distribution.    It is impossible to derive a single equilibrium
                                               -9-




price distribution       for all ranges of parameter values                         and
                                                                  (afi,$h#d
C).     Nevertheless,    the model allows us to characterize       the first two moments of

the equilibrium      income distributions      regardless of the specific price

distribution observed       i    the market.    Equation (4) implies that the utility-

maximizing level of income for a seller of race i and ability level k (k—h,

.1)   is:




            — Ia1ikflk           ic
              L1.ik+pk                                                    (7)




where tik is the segregation strstegy chosen by the seller, and P(rik) —                  ik
is the price asaociated with that segregation strategy.

       It is easy to show that the mean income of black sellers is lower than

the mean income of white sellers.           A white seller of ability k can always

opt to charge the price               and retain at least as many contacts as a
                                bk
black seller of ability         k.    Moreover, equation (6) shows that even if black

sellers are retaining all contacts, white sellers can, in general, charge a

higher price and also retain all contacts.             Therefore, white sellers can

always do better than black sellers.

      Consumer discrimination         also affects the variances of the population

income distributions.       The variance of log incomes for race group          i         is
                                                                                    (o)
given by 1r(l-w)(y/y.))2             where w is the fraction of sellers that are high

ability.     Note that since the variance of log incomes depends on the ratio of

high- to low-ability incomes, higher variances are asaociated with higher

returns to ability for that race group.              The white/black ratio of standard

deviations in log incomes is then given by              —
                                                            (/j)    +

be shown that, under certain conditions, consumer discrimination leads to the
                                                                                      It can




result A > 1, 50 that white sellers have a higher return to ability than

a low ability white seller; and                  as the ratio of the low ability black

seller's income to the income he would have received had he chosen the same

segregation strategy as a high ability black seller.9                 3y construction, the

                                       1b are greater than or equal to one, since
"selection biases"               and

each seller selected the segregation strategy that maximized indirect

utility.       Furthermore,          1w and 7b are strictly greater than unity if low

ability workers choose a different segregation strategy than high ability

workers within each race group.                The ratio   can be written   as:




           b
                  1wi2
                  I
                                 •   bhh1cI                                       (8)
               WLa7+flh


The discussion above and inspection of (8) leads to the following result.




PROPOSITION:           The equilibrium      income distributions   of black and white self-

employed workers have the following properties.

   i.      Mean white income exceeds mean black income.

   ii.     If low ability whites retain more Contacts than high ability blacks

           (wl        > rbh ),   the   white income distribution has more variance

           than the black income distribution.             If low ability whites retain as


           many contacts as high ability blacks (rWj_rbh),               the white

           income distribution has more variance than the black income

           distribution if, for at least one race group, there are differences

           in the segregation behavior of high and low ability sellers (i.e.

           either 7b or               exceeds unity).
                                                   -1]-




   iii. If low ability whites retain fewer contacts than high ability blacks

              (rwl <    rbh ),   the   ratio of standard deviations   is bounded from

              below by:



                        >                                                    (9)




              where              1 with a strict inequality if, for at least one race

              group, there are differences in the segregation behavior of high and

              low ability sellers.




    These results are quite intuitive.                Suppose, for instance, that both low

ability whites and high ability blacks integrate.                Consumer discrimination

reduces the relative incomes of high ability blacks because they must charge

a lower price in order to retain white customers.                If high ability blacks

segregate       they must discard more contacts than white sellers regardless            of

the segregation strategy of whites.                The opportunity cost of segregation    is


clearly highest for high ability blacks, and hence the black income

distribution          is compressed relative to the white      income distribution.

    Suppose,          on the other hand, that         <        This implies that high

ability blacks integrate, but low ability whites segregate.                High ability

blacks must lower prices in order to retain white consumers.                Low ability

whites could have integrated (and charged a higher price than high ability

blacks)   ,   but   chose not to because their incomes are raised by segregating.

In effect, this reduces white income inequality, and thus the impact of

consumer discrimination on the ratio of variances cannot be determined.                   The

lower bound in equation (9), however, implies that as long as blacks are a

small minority it is unlikely that the black income distribution has less
                                        -12-




variance than the white income distribution.

    Our result that the returns to ability are lower for black sellers than

for white sellers has important implications for the sorting of individuals

between self-employment    and other sectors of the labor market.1°       In

particular,    able blacks have less incentive to be self-employed      than

able whites.     Consumer discrimination and incomplete information,      therefore,

have an impact not only on the relative size of the black self-employment

sector, but also on the composition of sellers in that sector.11          Moreover,

this prediction of the impact of consumer discriminationdoes not follow

from a simpler complete information model.

    Zero search costs imply that buyers and sellers are sorted perfectly by

race and that a single price will prevail in the market.          Since consumers

can costlessly identify the price of the good and the race of the seller in

all firms, there are no "wasted contacts".       Equation   (7)   implies that the

income of a seller of race i and ability k is given by:




         —
             k    ]                                                     (10)


where P is the market price.     Using equation (10),   it is easy to verify that

the ratio of standard deviations of white to black incomes,        , is   unity.

Consumer discrimination in a complete information model, therefore, does not

lead to racial differences in the returns to ability.12



    D.   Employer Discrimination

    Our analysis of consumer discrimination in the self-employment         sector

shows that the population income distribution for blacks will be more

compressed than the population income distribution for whites.          These
                                                      -13-



population       incoee distributions             are the ones that would be observed if every


person in the labor market became self-employed.                      The choice of self-


employment,      however, is endogenous and is based on a comparison of income

opportunities       in the self-employed and salaried sectors.                    The actual


composition of persons in the self-employed pooi, therefore, will also depend

on the characteristics of the salaried income distribution.                             Hence it is

                                                                               in salaried jobs leads
necessary to determine whether employer discrimination

to the same types of income compression as consumer discrimination                              in self-

                    13
employed jobs.
                                        there are two types of workers, high-
    Suppose that within each race group

and low-ability, with wage rates rib and                     r1   (i—b,w), and that labor can be
                     .               .                                   14         -    -
                                                   such that   h > .R•                         in the
             -

measured in efficiency units,               fi,                               Competition

labor market requires that for each racial group the price of an efficiency

unit of labor (r/$) be the same for all skill groups.                          This implies that

         —               (i.-b,w).       It follows immediately that the black/white wage
r.h/r.
ratio is independent of skill level.                    Labor market competition,            therefore,

ensures that employer discrimination                  does not lead to any compression or


widening of skill differentials within each race group.15

    It has been argued that affirmative action raises the demand for black

skilled workers relative to other blacks (Leonard, 1984).                          There is, however,

little economic reason for this to occur.                      Suppose, for example, that a law

mandates that 8 percent blacks be hired at the same wage as whites.                               A profit-

maximizing firm will meet this requirement by hiring the cheapest possible

black labor available, namely low-skilled black workers.                          This result follows

from the fact that affirmative action programs are specified in terms of the

relative number of blacks hired, and not in terms of efficiencyunits.                                   Hence


the simplest model of employer discrimination                      suggests that, if anything,
                                               -14-




there may be an increase in the relative demand of unskilled black workers.

          In summary, consumer discrimination reduces the returns to ability for

blacks (relative to whites) in the self-employment sector.            Employer

discrimination (in the absence of affirmative action) does not change the

relative returns to ability for blacks in the salaried sector.            These

theoretical      implications,   therefore,    suggest that the skill composition of

self-employed and salaried workers will differ by race.            In psrticular,

skilled blacks have more incentives to enter the salaried sector than

skilled whites, and unskilled blacks have more incentives to enter self-

employment than unskilled whites.           Therefore, blacks are more likely than

whites to be negatively selected into self-employment           and positively

selected into salaried jobs.



III.        Empirical Analysis

       A.    Framework

       Individuals compare income streams between the salaried sector,     and
                                                                       w0,

       The implications of the model are best understood in the special case

                     lc — 0.    As long ss p01 is positive (i.e., able persons do well

in both self-employed and salaried jobs)           ,   positive   selection into self-

employment occurs if °l°0 > p01, and negative selection occurs otherwise.

Therefore, when the income distribution is compressed in the self-employment

sector relative to the salaried sector, it              is   likely that the most able

persons stay in the salaried sector, and that low ability persons (in terms

of   c)     become self-employed.

       In the more general case where the costs of entering the self-employment

sector and earnings are correlated, the coefficients of the selection

variable in          (15)   and (16) also depend on the correlation coefficients     0c   and

          and on the variance 02. Though little is known about these parameters,
plc'

negative selection into self-employment is still more likely among blacks

than among       whites     as long as the black income distribution in the self-

employment sector has less variance than the white income distribution.



       B.     Data

       The empirical analysis uses individual data from the 1/100 B Sample of

the 1980 U.S. Census of Population.             In order to focus on self-employment      in

the non-agricultural            sector, our data consist of observations     of white,

black, Asian, and Hispanic men (aged 25-64), residing in metropolitan areas,

who are not employed in the agricultural industry.                 The data include all

observations in the 1/100 random sample for individuals who are minority and

self-employed,          and random samples for other groups.17        We use the Census

definition of a self-employed person as one whose main job is in that

sector.        There are other ways of defining self-employment, and our use of
                                          -17-




alternative    definitions of self-employment    did not lead to different

results.     Finally, the income measure used throughout the study is the

logarithm of weekly income in 1979.

      Table 1 presents sumary statistics for these data, and shows that self-

employment rates differ substantially across racial and ethnic groups.

White males are nearly three times as likely as black males to be self-

employed.     Hispanic men are also much less likely to be self-employed than

whites, while Asians have self-employment rates that are nearly identical         to

whites.     Mean self-employment incomes, like salaried incomes, display

considerable variation across groups.       For instance, blacks earn about 38

percent less than whites in the salaried sector, and about 47 percent less

than whites in the self-employment Sector.       Hispanics earn about 38 percent

less than whites in the salaried sector, and about 28 percent less in the

self-employmentsector.      Thus, among blacks and Hispanics,    the income gap

between minorities and whites in self-employment       incomes is nearly as large

(if not larger) than the gap in the salaried sector.

      Table 2 presents the means of some demographic variables for self-

employed and salaried workers.     Self-employed persons are significantly more

likely to be college educated than salaried persons.       For instance, 38

percent of self-employed whites are college educated, but only 29 percent of

salaried whites are.     Even among blacks, 19 percent of se1f-empoyed persons

are   college educated, while only 12 percent of salaried blacks are.        Table 2

also indicates a large age differential between workers in the two sectors:

Self-employed workers are about    3   to 5 years older than salaried workers.

Finally,    self-employed workers are more likely to be married with a spouse

present in the household than salaried workers.       Among whites, for example,

81 percent of self-employed persons are married, spouse present, but only 75
                                          -18-



percent of   salaried persons are.    Among blacks, the respective Statistics

are 68 and 61 percent.




    C.   Results

    Table 3 presents the probit regressions on the determinants of the self-

employment probability for each of the groups.         These regressions estimate

the parameters of the reduced form index function in equation (14).          Like

the descriptive    statistics   in Table 2, the regressions indicate that more

educated and older persons are more likely to be self-employed.         In

                                                                        of
addition, higher education levels for the wife increase the probability

self-employment.     In general, the qualitative effects of these explanatory

variables are essentially the same for all the groups.

    The probit regressions in Table 3 also include measures of the

                 composition of the labor market's population.      These variables
ethnic/racial

are defined by the fraction of the SMSA's population that is black,

Hispanic,    or Asian.   In general, these "enclave" variables have a weak

                                                                      black
marginally significant is the positive impact of percent black on the

self-employmentrate.      The regressions also include a number of other local

labor market characteristics      (e.g., the crime race, population growth,

etc.).   These variables proxy for labor market specific differences in the

costs of becoming self-employed.       In general, the coefficients of these

variables differ in terms of statistical significance as well as sign across

the ethnic/racial    groups.    To conserve space, therefore, the coefficients of

these additional local labor market variables are not presented in Table 3.

    The white probit regression can be used to predict what the average

self-employment    rate of the various minority groups would be if the same
                                           -19-




mechanism that determined self-employment rates for whites generated

minority self-employment    rates.   This predicted probability       is presented in

the last row of Table 3 and is calculated using:18




    P — Z
             (Zi)/N                                                          (17)




            is the vector of variables
where
        Z                                 (for individual   i)   included in the

probit;       is the vector of probit coefficients estimated in the white

sample; and N is the sample size.        The summation   in (17) is conducted over

all persons in the particular ethnic/racial group.

    The predicted probabilities show that the self-employment rates of

blacks and Hispanics would be almost identical to those of whites if the

minority groups faced the same structure determining self-employment, while
the self-employment    rate of Asians would exceed that of whites.           For

example, the average black has a predicted self-employment          rate of 10.5

percent (as compared to the actual 4.5 percent self-employment             rate); and

the average Hispanic has a predicted rate of 12.0 percent           (as   compared to

the actual 7.0 percent self-employment rate).        P,oth blacks   and Hispanics,

therefore, would have self-employment       rates remarkably close        to the 11.8

percent self-employment    rate of whites if the groups faced the same

Structure.    This implies that differences in characteristics across groups

cannot explain the large variation in observed self-employment             rates.

Instead     the observed variation in self-employment rates is due to

differences in the mechanism that selects the self-employment             pool in each

of the race/ethnic groups.

    The probit regressions in Table 3 are used to estimate selectivity

corrected earnings functions in each of the two sectors for each of the
                                        -20-




groups.19     The earnings regressions are presented in Table 4 for the self-

employed sector, and in Table 5 for the salaried sector.        Before turning to

the selectivity variables,    it is instructive to briefly analyze the impact

of the demographic variables on incomes in each sector.        One striking result

is that the impact of the demographic variables is basically the same for

self-employment    and salaried incomes for all race groups.     There are, of

course,   differences in the magnitudes of the coefficients by race and by

sector, but the overall comparisons of the earnings equations       do not support

the hypothesis that earnings determination in the two sectors is

qualitatively different.20

    Of course, the main focus of the study is the determination of the kinds

of selections that generate the pools of self-employed and salaried workers.

The type of selection is determined by the sign of the coefficients of the

selectivity variables.     One key result in Table 4 is that the coefficient of

the selectivity variable in the self-employment income regression is

positive for whites, but zero or negative for all minority groups.        Since,

as defined in equation (16), the selectivity variable in the self-employment

sector (A1) is positive, this result implies that there is positive

selection into self-employment    in the white aample, negative selection       into


self-employment    among Hispanics and Asians, and zero selection into self-

employment among blacks.

    The same dramatic differences in the selectivity coefficients       are

observed in the regressions estimated in the salaried sample (Table       5).     In

particular,    this coefficient is positive for whitea but negative and

significant for all minority groups.     Since the selectivity variable (A0)

is negative in the salaried sector, the coefficients imply that there is

negative selection in the composition of the salaried sample for whites, but
                                           -21-




that there is positive selection generating the salaried samples of

minorities.

    Among whites, therefore, we observe that the most able persons enter self-

employment,     and that the least skilled persons remain in the salaried sector.

Among the various minority groups, however, essentially the opposite result

is observed:      the most able persons remain in the salaried sector, and the

least skilled become self-employed.        It is important   to note that this


empirical   result is exactly what    is predicted   by our theoretical model.        In

particular,     the existence of consumer discrimination     reduces the gains from


self-employment     for the most able members of a minority group.


    Remarkably,     these findings persist even when the self-employment        and

salaried sectors are stratified into two major occupation groups:

professionals    and others.21    Table 6 presents the coefficients of the

selectivity variables     in each of the two sectors by occupation group.         White

self-employed    persons are positively selected regardless      of occupation,

while minority self-employed workers are never positively selected, and are

often negatively selected.       Conversely, white salaried persons are not

positively selected, while minority salaried persons are always positively

selected.

    Our theoretical model is based on the premise that personal contacts

between consumers and sellers are essential for the presence of consumer

discrimination.      To the extent that the degree of personal contact differs by

occupation group, it seems reasonable to expect that the intensity of

selection would differ by occupation.        However,   it is unclear a priori which

                                                                 Do accountants and
occupation group has more contact with their consumers:
                                                                    and
lawyers have more personal contact with their clients than salesmen

plumbers?     Moreover,   disaggregating   the sample into two   broadly   defined
                                           -22-




occupations     may not be aufficient to capture the subtle variations in

selection that arise as the degree of personal contact varies.

Unfortunately,     any further disaggregation leads to increasingly smaller

samples and to less robust estimation of the parameters.

    The selectivity       results presented in this section arise because the

variance in self-employment       incomes (relative to the variance in salaried

incomes) is reduced for minorities       due to consumer discrimination.    This

implication of the model can be tested directly by calculating the standard

deviation of the population income diatributiona in each of the two sectors.

Table 7 presents estimates of the standard deviationa of log incomes in the

two sectors by race.        The predicted population standard deviation    (i.e.   ,   the

variation that would arise if all individuals entered the sector after

controlling     for differences in demographic variables)   is calculated using the

formula suggested by Heckman (1980, p. 217).       Table 7 also presents the

(square root of the) truncated mean square error from the selectivity-

corrected OLS earnings regressions.

    A key prediction of our model is that there will be less income

inequality among self-employed minorities than among self-employed whirea.

Table   7   indicates that the population standard deviations   of self-employment

income are indeed lower among blacks and Hispanics than among whites.

Selection,    however,    is determinedby the ratio of population   standard

deviations between the selZ-employment and the salaried sectors.           The

results in Table     7   reveal that the ratio of the standard deviation of self-

employment incomes to salaried incomes is always greater for whites than for

minority groups (particularly blacks and Hispanics).        For example, the

predicted population standard deviation ratio for whites is 2.4, but only

1.3 for blacks and Hispanics.
                                         -23-




    These ratios differ by race, in part, because in the salaried sector the

minority income distributions    exhibit more dispersion     than the white income

distribution.     We do not know why this result arises since there has been

little study of racial differences     in the second moment of wage

distributions.22Nevertheless,      it is important to note that this result is

not simply generated by the algebra underlying the construction of the

population standard deviation because it is also found in the simpler MSE-

based measure of income inequality (which is based on the residuals of the

OLS regression)

    The results in Table    7, therefore,   are consistent with the selection

patterns indicated by the earnings functions in Tables 4 and 5.          Although the

measures of income inequality in Table      7   are generated from the same earnings

functions   as the selectivity   coefficients, the sorting patterns observed in

the data are not derived from our estimates of the populationvariances.

There is nothing in the statistical procedure that forces the pattern of

selectivity coefficients and populationvariances to be consistent with each

other.

                                                     4 and 5 to decompose the
    Finally, we use the earnings functions in Tables

observed wage differential between whites and the various minority groups in

each of the two sectors.     This decomposition, presented in Table      8, is


conducted by setting the selectivity variables                equal to   zero so that,

in effect, we are comparing means of population income distributions.            The

results for blacks and Hispanics     reveal that even after controlling      for


differences   in demographic characteristics the income gap between minorities
                                                                           lower
and whites remains.     Self-employed blacks, for example, have 19 percent

mean incomes than whites.     This result   is consistent   with the implication of

our theoretical model.     The theoretical prediction     that self-employed
                                           -24-




minorities have    lower incomes than whites, however, is not confirmed by the

analysis of the Asian data, since in this case Asians actually earn more than

whites,   on average.




IV.     Summary

      This paper presents a theoretical and empirical analysis of racial

differences    in self-employment propensities and incomes.      The theoretical

model is based on the hypothesis       that white consumers   dislike purchasing

goods from self-employed       minority workers, and that it is costly to acquire

information about the price offers and racial characteristics         of sellers.

Our equilibrium search model not only implies the existence of price

dispersion    in the marketplace, but also yields two interesting predictions.

 First, minority self-employed workers have lower incomes than white self-

employed workers.       Second, the income distribution of self- employed minority

workers has less variance than the income distribution of self-employed

whites.    The latter result implies that the gsins to self- employment for

able minorities are relatively       smaller than the gains   to self- employment   for

able whites.      Therefore,   able minorities have much lower incentives   to become


self-employed     and minorities   are more likely than whites to be negatively

selected into self-employment.

      The empirical analysis used the 1980 U.S. Census and showed large

differences    in both self-employment    rates and incomes across the

ethnic/racial     groups.   The self-employment rates of blacks and Hispanics,      for

example, were found to be at least 50 percent lower than those of whites, and

the earnings differential between self-employed whites and blacks (or

Hispanics)    was almost as large (if not larger than) the racial wage
                                       -25-




differential in the salaried sector.    In addition,   our analysis revealed that

minorities are negatively selected into self-employment while whites exhibit

positive selection,     Conversely, whites are negatively selected into salaried

jobs, while the most able minorities   remain in the salaried sector.   The

theory of consumer discrimination, therefore, provides unique insights into

the composition of the pool of workers who self-select between the two

employment   sectors.

     We are graceful to Steve Trejo, to seminar participants at the Labor

Summer Workshop of the National Bureau of Economic Research and the

University of Chicago, and to a referee for helpful comments.            The research

was supported by a grant from the Economic Development Administration, U.S.

Department of Comjerce, and by a     grant from the National Science Foundation

(Grant No. SES-8604973).

           fact,   if employers are the only source of racial discrimination in

the marketplace, one would expect that self-employment rates for minorities

would be higher since these groups would find it less profitable to be in

salaried jobs.

     2For example, if we assume that white and black consumers are "perfect

substitutes" in the marketplace (i.e.    ,   they   have equal incomes   an   dentical

preferences) the black self-employment Sector would be a mirror image of the

white self-employment sector, though on a smaller scale.

     3Blau (1985) examines the choice between self-employment and salaried

jobs in a self-selection model where individuals differ in their managerial

ability.    His model, however, does not generate predictions about the types

of selection that are expected to arise.

     4The assumption that     he   percent black among consumers equals the

percent black among sellers is not necessary for the theoretical analysis.

It only simplifies the notation and the presentation.

     5The model can be generalized by allowing black buyers to discriminate

against white sellers.      This extension complicates the presentation of the

analysis, without fundamentally changing the nature of the results. This

generalization will be discussed in more detail below.
                                          -29-




     6lnvoking the Law   of   Large Numbers, we assume that sellers making n

contacts with consumers contact exactly Gn blacks and (l-9)n whites.

Allowing the number of consumers of each race group to be a random vatiable

to the firm does not alter the important results of our model, but simply

generates variation in income and output across firms of the same race and

ability level.   In addition,   we focus on a "steady state" equilibrium of the

model, where the number of consumers leaving the market in each period just

equals the number of new consumers entering the market.          For simplicity,   we

also assume that each consumer who is searching makes exactly one contact in

the period.

     7Thjs property follows from the assumption that utility is additively

separable in income and leisure (Scitovsky 1943)

     8Note that the ordering in equation (5) implies that there can be at

most three prices in the equilibrium distribution.        The fact that black and

white sellers may charge the same price implies that price alone is not a

perfect signal for the race of the seller.

     9The precise definitions of    -y   and     are given by:




       —   r    wh1 1whh)        wh1
           lw1flh)Tw1hPw2J

       —   r'                      b21
           L((mrbh)/(arbh+j))P(rbh)i



     10Although the proposition has been derived under the assumption that

contacts are random, and that each sellers probability of encountering a

consumer of race j equals the population proportion of consumers of race j,
                                        -30-




we can generalize our results to allow for racial "ghettos". The existence

of racial ghettos implies that although contacts between buyers and sellers

are random, sellers encounter a larger fraction of consumers of their same

race than the overall population proportions.        It is easy to show that the

proposition still holds given the alternative values of r which result from

racial ghettos, although "ghettoization"       does increase the incentives for

both whites and blacks to segregate.

     11Throughout this section, we have used a very simple form of consumer

discrimination by ignoring the possibility that black consumers prefer to

purchase from black sellers.    It can be shown that the key result that the

black income distribution (under certain conditions) is more compressed than

the white income distribution holds even in the general case where both types

of consumers have a taste for discrimination. The ranking of black and white

mean incomes, however, depends on the relative strengths of discrimination by

the two types of consumers and on the percent black in the marketplace.
     12
          The discussion implicitly assumes that white and black buyers are

"perfect substitutes" in terms of their demands for the good.        Suppose

instead that black buyers have less income and therefore a lower demand for

the good.    High ability black sellers may not be able to attain their optimal

level of output by catering to only blacks, and will have to lower their

price to P(l-d) in order       attract white buyers.     Competition among black

sellers reduces the price in all black firms to P(ld).         This leads to lower

black self-employment incomes, but it is easy to show that       ,   the ratio of

standard deviations of white and black incomes, is still unity.

     13See Goldberg (1981) for   a   modern treatment of the Becker model of

employer discrimination.
                                                                            a
            efficiency units we mean that one unit of high ability labor is
perfect substitute for     h1 units of    low ability labor.

     15An extension of Reinganum's (1979) search model to the case of

employer discrimination under incomplete information reveals that, under some

conditions, wage skill differentials remain independent of race.        The returns

to ability for blacks, however, may be reduced in more general formulations

of the model that allow for differential search costs by ability level.

     16The self-selection model presented in this section is due to Roy

(1951)

     170ur sample consists of 3.3% of white salaried workers; 33% of white

self-employed workers, and black and Hispanic salaried workers; all Asian

salaried workers, and all black, Hispanic,     and Asian self-employed workers in

the 1980 Census data.      Due to the stratified sampling technique,   the probit

regressions reported below are weighted (and their standard errors corrected)

to reflect the sample composition. Finally,      itt   order to match the individual

data with SMSA-specific characteristics we restrict the sample to persons

residing in the 75 largest SSAs.       The source of these SMSA-specific and

local labor market variables is the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1986).

     18This formula ensures that the predicted probability in the white

sample is identical to the observed self-employment rate of whites.        See

Madd,ala (1983, p. 26).

     19The aggregate labor market characteristics listed in the notes to

Table 3, which proxy for mobility costs, are omitted from the earnings

functions.

     20Tables 4 and 5 can also be used to assess the impact of 'enclave'

effects on earnings.      The comparison of the relevant coefficients across the

two sets of regressions, however, does not provide any evidence that enclave

effects have a   differential   impact on self-employment and salaried incomes.

     21The professional category includes all persons working in managerial

and professional specialty occupations according to the 1980 Census

occupation codes.    All other workers are in the residual category which

includes sales, service, craftsmen, operators,     and laborers.   The fraction of

salaried workers who are in the professional occupation group is 31.2% for

whites,   14.2% for blacks, 14.0% for Hispanics,   and 34.3% for Asians.   The

fraction of self-employed workers who are in the professional occupation

group ia 46.7% for whites, 29.6% for blacks, 34.1% for Hispanics, and 52.4%

for Asians.

     22smith and Welch (1979) present an analysis of income inequality by

race, and also find that the black income distribution in the salaried sector

exhibits substantially more dispersion than the white income distribution.
