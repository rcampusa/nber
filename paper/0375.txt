        The Work and Wages of Single Women: 1870 to 1920




                             ABSTRACT




       Single women in the U.S. dominated the female labor force

from 1870 to 1920. Data on the home life and working conditions of

women in 1888 and 1907 enable the estimation of earnings functions.

Work in the manufacturing sector for these women was task oriented

and payment was frequently by the piece. Earnings rose steeply with

experience and peaked early; learning was mainly on-the-job. Sex

segregation of employment is seen as a partial product of the method

of payment, and the early termination of human capital investment was

a function of the life-cycle labor force participation of these women,

although the role of the family is also critical.

1.0 The Era of Single Women Work: 1870 to 1920

       In preface to a book on working women, a past president of the American

Economic Association has stated that:

       "The importance of [this] subject. . .cannot well be over-
       estimated. Our age may properly be called the Era of Woman,
       because everything which affects her receives consideration
       quite unknown in past centuries. . . [W]oman is valued as never
       before. . .and. . .it   is
                                perceived that the welfare of the
       other half of the human race depends more largely upon the1
       position enjoyed by woman than was previously understood."
Surprisingly enough, these are not the comments of John Kenneth Galbraith, but
those of Richard T. Ely writing in 1893. Generations other than ours have
also viewed themselves in the midst of radical change concerning the economic
role of women. But. Ely and his contemporaries, rather than being concerned
with married women's work, were more interested in the status of the young
and unmarried working woman. The conditions of industrial work for single
women, their health, their morals, and the sufficiency of the pay of those
living away from h were the heightened issues of a period witnessing the
rise of factory employment     and increased    immigration to its large cities. The
motivation for this regard was      not   entirely unselfish. Prior to the 1870's women
had   been employed only in a very restrictive number of industries,but as more
become employed in trades previously occupied by men, increased concern was
expressed about the relative efficiency of the sexes, the related issue of pay
differentials,   and the impact of female labor on the economic position of    men.
       In the history of woments labor market experience in the United States the
half century from about 1870 to 1920 was the era of single women.2 Fully 75% of
the   white female labor force in 1890     and 1900 were single and fewer than 10% were
married. But by the late 1920's married women comprised        over 25% of the female

work force. Even though the participation rate of single women continued to rise,
they became less a force in the economic history of American women.3 The history
of the female labor force from 1870 to 1920 was dominated and formed by single
                                                                               2


women, and, correspondingly that from 1920 to 1970 by those who were married.

Accompanying these changes in the composition of the labor force was an evolution

of occupations, events that were not in the least unrelated. The first period

witnessed the peaking of the employment of women in manual, manufacturing

occupations and the second the rise of clerical employment.4

     The concern for single working women in the Progressive Era led to the

collection of data on their industrial and social condition, and it is perhaps

ironic that these documents were ultimately used to draft legislation effectively

limiting their employment.5 These reports, whatever their original or eventual

purpose, are a remarkable depository of information on work and home life, and

it is fortunate that two of the most detailed records span the high-point of single

women's work in 2inerican history. Carroll Wright's Bureau of Labor document

Working Women in Large Cities (1889) and the nineteen volume report of the Secretary

of Commerce and Labor, Women and Child Wage Earners (1910), studies of women in

1888 and 1907 respectively, form the basis of this article on women in the midst

of the era of single women's work.

Ll Characteristics of Single Working Women, 1888 to 1907.6

     Single working women at the turn of this century were historically unique in

terms of their home lives and occupations. They worked at a time when there were

primarily two positions available to urban women —— manual factory work and service

employment ——   and their occupations, unlike those in the then nascent clerical

sector, did not particularly prepare them to reenter the labor force after marriage.7

Their jobs were predominantly task oriented, were frequently paid for by the piece,

(between 35% and 47 % of women in manufacturing in 1890 worked on piece—rates) ,8

and were almost uniformly distinct from those occupied by men. They learned their

trades on—the-job in the factory, store, or home, and although their educations

preceded the rise of vocational schools for women, formal schooling was a clear
                                                                                          3



advantage      to them in the labor market.
      Women frequently began their labor market experience when young, working
continuously until they married. But their age at first marriage was late,
indeed it      was the   latest of all birth cohorts of american women, and the
percentage      of these women who never married was correspondingly high. These

women worked in the labor market when it was con as well for a young girl

to have worked instead full-time in her parent's home. About 35% of all urban,

single women 16 to 24 years old were neither at school nor working outside their

homes in 1900, although only about 5% were by 1930. Therefore a large fraction

of these women were still attached to their parent's homes, working in them, or,

if they worked outside, giving their entire salaries to their families. But

fully 38% of all single urban women over 16 years old in 1900 lived away from

their parents with their employers or in the homes of others. Even though part

of this rather large figure is accounted for by servants, housekeepers, teachers,

and    cottoninill towns, the nature of employment alone did not     determine residence.

And,    as a footnote    to   this attempt at generalization, a hallmark of this group
was its cultural heterogeneity.
1.2 Issues and Sources
       Questions on both the demand and supply sides of the labor market are suggested
by the unique position of single women during this period of linerican history. I
have   concentrated here almost exclusively on the supply side to         give answers to
the    following: (Nunters in parentheses refer to sections of this article.)
        (1)    What was the nature of work and of skill formation? What were the
               functions of piece work and task oriented jobs? (2.1)
        (2).   What governed   the   choice of occupation for a single women   among   jobs
               in manufacturing,     in a store, or as a servant? (2.1)

        (3)    What were the payoffs to women (or their families) from entering the
               labor force when young and remaining at work until marriage, and what
               were. the gains to parents from having their daughters specialize in
               home or market work? (2.1, 2.2)
                                                                                          4



       (4) Why were occupations segregated by sex? (2.2)

       (5) What determined whether working women lived at home with their
            families or in boarding houses? (2.2)

       (6) What roles did education and ethnicity play? (2.3)

Data   from two federal     studies enable the estimation of a relationship between

earnings,experience on-the-job, and other variables which will provide insights

to these issues.

       Carroll Wright's Working Women in Large Cities (hereafter the 1888 study),

the first federal report on working women, investigated the conditions of women

"who work in   great   city manufactories upon light manual or mechanical labor and

in stores (p. 9)." The study included 343             industries   in 22 cities and contained

information on 17,427 women, of whom 88% were single.9 It was not until the

Secretary of Commerce and Labor's multi—industry report Women and             Child   Wage

Earners, (1907 study), that women were again a direct concern of a federal agency)°

Only city-industry averages can be used in the 1888 study, the original surveys

having never been located, but the 1907 study contains most of the             raw data
collected for 6 industries, in various locations, n total information on about

10,000 single girls). This article is based on all the observations for men's

clothing in Chicago, and      for   cotton textiles in Massachusetts and North Carolina,

1785 observations on single women of all ages. The 1888 study includes women living

away from home; the observations used for the 1907 study are only for those living

at home.


2.0 Earnings Functions: Theory and Results

       The earnings equations estimated are variants of a general form implied by a

model of human   capital    formation with a linearly declining investment ratio. The

simplest statement of such an       earnings    function is:


(1)              R,n    =      + 1s   +         +   3e2 + v
                                          B2e
                                                                                         5

where         = log    of earnings at time t ,   e =   total work experience, and
s = schooling. The coefficient on schooling,        can be interpreted as its rate
of return, and one can also derive the rate oE return to experience and the initial
               •
investment ratio
•
                  from 2 and . 11 The data used in the estimation procedure are
weighted city—industry averages for 1888 and micro—level observations for 1907. The
following summarizes the major findings of the results given in Table 1.
2.1 The Nature of Work, Skill Formation, and       Occupational   Choice
       Earnings data for women doing manual work in both      1888   and   1907   indicate that
there were large gains to remaining in the labor force. Earnings rose steeply with
experience   on   the job, peaking or leveling of f early, (vars. 1    and 2, cols. 1 — 4,

Table ).                The occupations women held during this time may be colloquially

termed unskilled or, at best, semiskilled, but they involved substantial learning-
by-doing and    only   after several years of job training did individuals become pro-
ficient. In various industries       (e.g. men's clothing) moving up on the earnings

function   involved job mobility, "Occupational promotion in coat making necessitates
changes in the character of the work done and      involves   a period     of   reduced pro-
ductivity and     reduced wages (lo7 study, Vol. 2, p. 477)." In others it involved

supervising   more machines (e.g. weaving), or    making more and better        pieces (e.g.
shoes).
       Learning on the job was considerable for individuals entering at any age.
Although maturity was a factor in the                    function, it was not an
overriding one. Delaying entry into the labor force for one year added less than
                                                                                                  12
3% to earnings, but working for that year would have added over 9%, (var. 10, col. 5).

In   other words, a 14 year old working for 2 years would earn at a maximum 6% less than

a 16 year old working for 2 years, bot the 14 year old working for 2 years would

earn 12% more     than a 16 year old just entering the labor force.

      The shape of the earnings profile was, in addition, not merely a function of
some screening mechanism used to identify fast quitters from slow quitters. Various
economic theorists have posited that employers having fixed hiring costs and hetero-
geneous labor with not      easily identifiable characteristics will maximize profits            by

having two       of earnings functions, one flat and one rising. This screening
             types

mechanism ensures the self—selection of laborers, with the slow quitters opting
for the rising function. The widespread use of piece rates for women is of               crit-

ical importance in this regard.13 Piece work rates may have been used by firms

to   screen workers initially and then to maintain employment        by   continously re-
warding effort. Employers desiring to attract female labor            may have    altered work
organization to include more task oriented and         incentive   pay jobs to reward effort
where occupational mobility was      excluded   by the limited   nature   of job attachment.
But the   use of   piece rates implies that differences in earnings were a          direct

function   of   productivity and   not   a mere construct • Furthermore, there was an
alternative occupation that had a relatively high but flat           earnings     profile that
may have   served to attract the casual worker. Lucy Salmon, in summarizing her
1889 survey of domestic      service, indicated precisely these market forces in de-

termining the allocation of women among occupations.14

      Altbough the earnings functions for both years display similar characteristics

that for 1907 rises more steeply and peaks later than that for            1888.    This finding

suggests the evolution and expansion of jobs in        terms   of training possibilities

for   single women during these 20 years. A third type of occupation, that of store
work, also   existed    for single women   during this period, and work     in stores in 1888
also appears to have differed substantially from that in 1907. Although in 1888
there was a bonus to store workers with more schooling (var. 11, cols. 1 and 2),
earnings did    not   differ by experience, that is, the profiles had the same shape
                                                                           8

but that for store work was about 3% greater. By 1907 there was more room for ad-

vancement in store work. Earnings were initially lower by 8% but rose by 1.8% with

each year of experience over and above the same gradient in the factory, (eq. 2).

2.2 A Comparison of Male and Female Earnings Functions and the Role of the Family

     The scant information that presently exists on the earnings of men with similar

characteristics during the same time period suggests that their earnings rose less

rapidly but peaked later than did those for women)5 Earnings were somewhat higher

for young girls than for young boys, but young boys received a higher return on their

education. Boys invested more in training, or should I say had more invested in them,

than did girls, and given their respective life—cycle labor force participation rates,

these may have been optimal strategies. But the implicit investment choice was made

more by parents than by youngsters. Parents were a large factor in the intergenera-

tional transmission of cultural norms, and the earnings functions are suggestive in

this regard. Young women who lived at home earned less than did those who boarded

(var. 9, cols. 1 and 2), and, understandably, those who assisted at home earned

even less (var. 10). Those who lived away from home may have been a biased sample

of all young women in terms of their differences with their parents' decisions and in

terms of their innate ability. Those who mothers were alive earned less than did

those without mothers at home (vars. 9, cols. 3 and 4), an indication that girls

worked at home part—tine and either worked fewer hours in the factory or worked less

intensively.

     Occupations and industries were often highly segregated by sex, and it is

likely that these divisions were less a reflection of inherent differences in ability

than they were a by-product of segregation by method of payment and the specialized
                                                                                 9

nature of work. Men were infrequently found in the tedious, task oriented jobs that

women held. Because of their greater expected attachment to the labor force they had

a greater incentive to perform efficiently in non—piece rate work and stood a higher

probability of eventually receiving 'prizes' in the form of promotions and monetary

rewards.


2.3 Education and Ethnicity

     Education had a smaller impact on earnings than is observed for contemporary

data but was, nonetheless, an important factor. Although the results in col. 3

indicate that the foreign born (var. 7) earned 9% less than did native born with native

or foreign born parents, this differential disappears when relative maturity is

considered. The foreign born began work younger, and therefore given their level

of experience earned somewhat less.


3.0 Summary Remarks

     In summary, work in the labor market for women from 1870 to 1920 was the realm

of the unmarried whose occupations involved much on-the—job-training but little long

ranged advancement. The estimated earnings functions are consistent with the hf e—

cycle labor force participation of these women. But the comment by one astute

observer that in "most cases, probably, woman's expectation of marriage is responsible
    for her lack of skill, but in some instances, doubtless, her enforced lack of skill
    is responsible for her longing for marriage as a relief from intolerable drudgery"
     (1907 Study, Vol. 9, H. Sumner, p. 32)

indicates that this harmony need not have been universally felt or long lived.

2. There is little at present known about the labor force participation of
    women prior to 1870, but evidence that does exist suggests that the per-
    centage of married women at work was higher in large cities prior to that
    time.

3. See Table 4 of Goldin, "Women in the American Labor Experience," paper
    presented at the 1979 Cliometrics meetings. Labor force participation
    rates for single women by age, nativity, and race are given below for the
    entire US, and for cities of over 100,000 in 1890, and it can be seen
    that part of the rise in the labor force participation of single women
    after 1890 was probably a function of the movement of population to the
    cities.

7. Among all white working women in the U.S. in 1890, approximately 1/3 were
    employed in domestic and personal service, 1/3 in manufacturing and mechanical
    trades, 1/10 in trade and transportation, 1/10 in professional jobs, and the
    rest in agriculture. Only a trivial fraction were clerical workers.

11. See, in particular, Jacob Mincer, Schooling, Experience and Earnings, (New
     York: 1974). Under a particular set of assumptions, Mincer (p. 91) has
     shown that:               k
                    = [rtk   +     (14-k)] and       =   rtk

                                                                      2
                                                                 2T

    where r = rate of return to experience; k0 = (C0/E0) = the initial invest-
    ment ratio which is assumed to decline linearly with time, kt =       k0-k0(t/T).
    A time T, investment is zero. If T = 10, the results in Table 1, col. 3
    yield k0 = 0.33 and r = 0.14; if T=7, k0=0.35, r=O.O6.
12. The 3% figure is a maximum because the 1907 study does not include information
     on prior occupations. To the extent that there was a return to experience on
     other jobs (see vars. 12, 13, and 14, cols. 1 and 2) the coefficient on the
     age at beginning work would include it.

13. See, for example, Joanne Salop and Steven Salop, "Self-Selection and Turnover
     in the Labor Market," Quarterly Journal of Economics (Nov. 1976), pp. 619-627,
     who state that "the firm could pay for piecework, thereby allowing the worker
     to receive the full value of his own marginal product and eliminating the
     firm's interest in this information [viz, turnover costs] (p. 627)."

14. Lucy M. Salmon, Domestic Service (New York: 1972; reprinted from 1897 edition),
     stated that:

            "In the two occupations the wages in which have been compared
            with those in domestic service [teaching and factory work] while
            the general average wages are low, it is possible to reach through
            promotion    a comparatively high point. The fact that the wage
            plane is a high one is one inducement for women of average ability
            to enter the occupation [servant]. On the other hand, the fact
            that the wage limit, high as it is, is soon reached must act as
            a barrier in the case of others (pp. 103-4)."
