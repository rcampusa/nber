                     Two Notes on Exchange Rate Rules
                  and on the Real Value of External Debt



                                ABSTRACT



     This report presents two unrelated, short papers on exchange rate rules
and on the real value of the external debt. The paper on exchange rate policy

uses the Taylor model of overlapping, longterm wage contracts to ask whether
accommodating or PPP oriented exchange rate policies tend to stabilize output.
In earlier work I had shown that exchange rate indexing, while
                                                               destabilizing
prices enhances the stability of output. The result is qualified here by
showing that the exchange rate not only affects aggregate demand directly
but operates also, through the cost of imported intermediates, on the price
level. It is shown that unless monetary policy is sufficiently accommodating
this latter effect may dominate with the consequence that increased exchange
rate indexation reduces output stability.

     The paper on the real value of external debt poses the question how to
integrate external debt holdings in the traditional framework used to evaluate
the effects on real income of changes in world prices. It is shown that inte-
grating debt service liabilities in a comprehensive income measure makes real
disposable income equal to the value of output less the real value of real
interest payments on the external debt. Furthermore, with the CPI being the
appropriate deflator for foreign debt, a rise in export prices raises income
in proportion to exports while a rise in import prices lowers real income in
proportion to Imports. The proper accounting of debt in a comprehensive
income framework, noting the intertemporal budget constraints, thus restores
the conventional treatment of the income effects of price changes.

 PPP EXCHANGE RATE RULES AND MACROECONOMIC STABILITY




          Taylor (1979) developed a model of longterm overlapping
wage contracts where, under rational expectations, disturbances
have persistent effects on output and prices because relative and
 absolute wages exhibit shortterm stickiness. This stickiness arises
because labor, in setting the money wage, is not only concerned with
enployment but also with the relative wage position compared to ongoing
and anticipated future contracts. This tendency for relative wage fixity
is reinforced if the government pursues an accoodating monetary
policy that dispenses with the need for wage—price discipline. In
Dornbusch (1979,1980) the Taylor model was extended to the open economy
to demonstrate that purchasing power parity (PPP) oriented exchange rate
rules operate in the same direction as accommodating monetary policy. They
stahilie output at the cost of increased instabilIty of prices.

         The present note takes up once more the question of exchange rate
rules in the context of the Taylor mcdel. We show here that the exchange
rate rule affects the output--price level stability trade—off through two
seperate channels. On one hand a PPP oriented exchange rate rule tends tc
maintain the real exchange rate constar; ,thereby stabilizing demand. Th
other channel, introduced here, considers the effect of exchange rate ru:s
throuzh the supply side on the price level, The exchange rate affects Costs
and prices through the domestic currency cost of imported intermediate goods.
To the extent that wage disturbances that tend to raise prices are accoma—
nied by exchange depreciation, because of a PPP rule, the impact of wage
movements on prices is amplified. Thus the second channel introduces the
pcssbility for e:change rate policy to dampers or amplify the impact of wage
disturbances on prices and output.


         This second channel, operating through the cost side of the eccno—y,
introduces the possibility that increased exchange rate accommodation lowers
rather than raises the persistence of disturbances while raising the impact
                                          —2—




of    unanticipated wage disturbances on prices and output. These results
are of interest in view of the          widely   shared belief that a PPP oriented
ec-iange rate policy is good policy advice for small countries. We now
pursue these issues in the context of the extended Taylor model.


1. The ModeL

          The   model is stated in terms of the deviations of output and prices
from their given trend. All          variables   are expressed in logs. The level of
output, y, is demand determined with demand depending on the real money
supply,    m—p, and on      the   real exchange rate, e—p:
(1)               y    a(m—p) + b(e—p)                    a,b> 0

        A rise in the real money stock raises demand as -does a depreciation
of the real exchange rate or a rise in e—p. A real depreciation raises
demand, given the elasticity condition which is assumed to be satisfied
with b positive, because it shifts demand from foreign goods to home output.

           ionetary and exchange rate policies are specified by rules which :he
authorities follow in setting nominal money and the nominal exchange rate:


(2)                =   p             ep                            0<    .< 1


The coeffjcients and              measure the extent to which monetary and exchange
rate policies are. accommodating. Unit values imply that output is maintained
constant because real money and the real exchange rate are held constant.
Values of and $ that are less than unity imply less than full accommodation
so    that a rise in prices lowers real balances and appreciates the real
exchange rate thereby inducing a fall in demand and output.              The extent   to
which a rise in prices leads to a contraction in demand and              output is
suarized by the parameter G

        We now turn to the. wage—price process. Pricas are determined by

 wage costs and the costs of imported intermediate gcods, the price of the
 latter being given by the exchange rate:

 (4)                  p     (c/2)(x+x1) + (i—$)e

 The price equation reflects the assumption that there are at any time two
 overlapping or concurrent wage contracts in force. They stipulate respectively
 x as the current wage in the first year of our contract and x_1 as the
 current wage on a two—year contract entered into last year. Current wage
 costs are taken as the average of the two contracts. The terms $ and l—$
 represent the cost shares of labor and intermediate goods. In combination
with the exchange rate rule in (2) we can rewrite the price equation as:

 (5)                 p     k( x +     x—l)                    $12
                                                              l—(l—$)

        It is apparent from (5)               that   a more acconodating exchange rate
policy—— a value of B more nearly equal to unity—— tends to raise the
impact of wage disturbances on prices. Conversely, maintaing a constant
nominal exchange rate in the face of wage disturbances tends to dampen
their impact on the level of prices, but raises the impact on the real
exchange rate. The extent to which the exchange rate can serve a stabili-
zing role on the supply side depends on th share of intermediate goods

       We complete the model by locking at wage formation. The current
wage is set by reference to ongoing and anticipated future contracts but
depends also on expected employment during the currency of the contract;

                                    (l—d)1     +   ,( d +   (l—d)1    )   +   ;d,l—d,1 >0

                                                               2(l—d)

              Using (7) in (5) yields the equation for the price level:

 and for output:

                                   =
                                       py1 —k(u+u)
 (9)                   y =   —Gp



              We now turn to a discussion of the effects of exchange rate

 indexation on the stability of output and prices, We remind briefly
 of the results in Taylor (1979) nd Dornbusch (1979,1980). In these
 models the term k was equal to k=.5, Therefore it is clear from the
 definitions of c and p in (6)' and (7) that increased monetary or

 exchange rate accoodation would reduce G and hence raise the inertia
 or persistence of wages and prices as measured by p.With more acccodá—
 ting policies output is more stable and that stability of output is taken
 into account in wage settlements and is reflected in a more protracted
phasing out o. disturbances. From here we proceed to the effect of
 increased excl.ange rate indexation in the extended model that allows for
exchange rat. .ffects both on the supply side and the demand side as ref-
lected in a value of k=($/2)/(1— (l—$))


2. The Effects of Exchange Rate Indexing


              In this section a investjate

                                                   the exchange rate plays

                       aggregate demand but also exerts direct cost effects.
Given the definitions of

extent of persistence as follows:

  where 6 is a (messy) positive
                                function of the parameters.
                                                             Equation (10)
  then implies that increased exchange rate accommodation
                                                          may raise or lower
  the persistence of disturbances
                                  depending on the relative size of the two
  channels through which the exchange rate operates.

            Suppose the elasticity of demand with respect to the real exchange
 rate is large and the share of labor
                                       costs is large. Under these Conditions
 the term in brackets in (10) is
                                  likely to be positive and we have the conven-
 tional result, in the spirit of Taylor's analysis, that increased
                                                                    accommodation
 raises persistence. The other
                               case, by no means unlikely, arises when the
 exchange rate exerts a substantial effect
                                            on the cost side and demand is
 relatively unresponsive to the real exchange rate. Unless monetary accommodation
 is complete we then have
                              a case where higher exchange rate indexation will
 reduce persistence.


            This latter case arises when the
                                                   gain in stability of output
 achieved by real exchange rate
                                stability is more than offset by the indexation
effect on the cost side that tends to reduce demand unless
                                                            money is fully
accommodating. This interpretarion becomes appar nt when we look at the effect
of a wage disturbance on output: dy/dx —k and ask how that effect
                                                                      varies
with the extent of exchange rate accommodation:

Labor, in setting wages, takes into account the output effects of
                                                                  wage settle-
ments. If higher exchange rate indexation
                                          implies a larger adverse effect of
high wage settlements on
                         output then relative wages will be more flexible and
persistence will be reduced. It is
                                    interesting to note that (10) and (11) show
the interdependence of monetary and exchange rate accommodation
                                                                once the
exchange rate operates also through the supply side. The increased cost
indexation following from a higher
                                      implies a larger adverse effect on real
balances and hence on output the smaller is the extent of
                                                           monetary accommodation.
Ccnvcrsely, if monetary accommodation
                                       is relatively complete the increased cost
effects of a high   do not have impcrtarit effects on demand and persistence.

       The analysis suggests that        monetary   and exchange rate policies

can,   in   certain cases, be coordinated to reduce both the impact of
price disturbances on output and at the same           time   reduce the persistence
or inertia in wages. If b—(l—)a is negative then is it apparent from
(10) that increasing indexation can be accompanied by some increase in
mcnetay accoodation and still not enhance persistence.

       An lirportant difference between the Taylor model and our analysis
here arises from the impact of changes in exchange rate indexation on the
impact of unanticipated disturbances. This is apparent in (8) and (9)
where the unanticipated wage movements (u+u_1) are multiplied by k which
now is not a constant but rather a function of      From (9),in conjunction
with (l1) it will be noted that a policy that reduces persistence will
also raise the impact of unanticipated disturbances on output. It therefore
appears that we cannot discuss the policy trade—off merely in terms of
persistence and the coefficient & but rather should look at the asymptotic
variances of output and prices. With prices and output following an ARNA(l,l)
process the variances are:


(12)
                   2   =   2(1+ 2)k2 2                        =   e22
                                         U               y          p
                           i—pa

        A numer: :al exercice, shown in Table 1, reports how the variances
behave as a function of the extent of exchange rate indexation. The two
cases reported correspond to different signs for the expressions in (10)
and (11). The table reveals that independently of the sign in (10) and (11)
an increase in exchange rate indexation raises the variability of prices.
As regards the variability of output there are two possibilities. With
the cost channel of exchange rates dominating the variability of output
is increased by a move toward more full indexation. Conversely, if the
aggregate demand role of the real exchange rate dominates more accommodation
implies a more stable behavior of output.

3. Concluding Remarks

           PPP oriented exchange rate policies have been widely adopted
ong developing countries as a way of isolating the foreign trade sector
frorn the vagaries of the macro economy. By and          large   the profession has
accepted such policies as sensible, impliicly placing high cost on the
                          —8—



variability of real exchange rates. Such policy advice is questioned
here by drawing atrention to the macroeconomic costs of higher exchange
rate indexation: increased instability of prices and potentially increased
instability of output. The analysis also draws attention to the fact
that higher monetary accommodation stabilizes output not onlydirectly,
but also by offsetting or dampening the adverse effects of exchange
rate indexati.on working through the cost side of the economy.
        The analysis then suggests that the search for optimal stabili—
sation poloicies should not take the target of a constant real exchange
rate as given hut rather consider the problem in broader context that
evaluates the relative costs of real instability, price instability and
target instability.

   VALUE OF THE EXTERNAL DEBT
                                                                       —1—




               Repeated oil price increases lave led developing countries to
build up large external debts and world inflation has reduced the real
value of these debts. Renewed shocks to the terms of trade will require
adjustments in trade flows to finance the debt service obligations. In
this setting the question of the appropriate deflator for foreign debt
has arisen. Suppose import prices rise. As debtors we are better off
because of the reduced real value of our debts, but as importers we are
clearly worse off. What is the deflator that strikes the balance between
these two effects and provides a meaningful measure of the welfare effects
of price changes ? Alternative deflators have been proposed. One would
be a weighted average of export and import prices reflecting in the
weighting the marginal shares of exports and imports in the adjustment
process. We argue here for a different measure, namely the consumer ex-
penditure deflator, and show that in combination with the comprehensive
income measure this deflator gives a very conventioRal statement of the
welfare effects of price changes.                 I




1.    The Concept of Income


                The center of the analysis is the proper concept of income.
We use the traditional Hicks -Bailey definition of comprehensive income
as the value of consumption that can be maintained without impairing
future consumption opportunities. Defining as c this value of sustainable
consumption or real disposable income it is equal to:


(I)              =   V -   i ED     - ED
                                           (e-)
                                p


where          P =   home consumer price index
               V =   home nominal value of output
               D =   external   debt in dollars
               E =   exchange rate, cruzeiros/$
                i*= world nominal rate of interest
                 =   rates   of depreciation and home inflation


               The definition of real disposable income in (1) recognizes
that debt service is a charge against resources and that capital losses,
if consumption opportunities are to be maintained, likewise diminish the
consumption level afforded by a given level of output.
                                                                         —2—

               Equation (1) is readily transformed into an alternative
 and suggestive form. For that purpose we define the home and foreign
 real interest rates, r =     i-
                               and rk       -    . We also assume for


 ciation are equalized, or i =
 in (2):
                                   i
 the present that nominal interest rates, adjusted for expected depre-
                                       + é.   These relations are summarized



 (2)              r=i-j;        r*=i*_ ; i=i*+
 Using these definitions, adding and substracting j5        in (1), and re-
arranging terms uields our expression for sustainable consumption or
real disposable income as;


 (W            c = V/P -   rd

where d ED/P is the real value of the external debt. Real disposa-
ble income thus equals the real value of output less the real value
of real interest.payments on the external debt.


              Let x and m denote the real value of exports and imports
both measured in terms of the consumer price index. We can then write
consumption as equal to output, less exports, plus imports:


(3)           c=Y/P-x+m

which in conjunction with (I) •    implies    that the sustainable current
account must be balanced, with a trade surplus equal to the real debt
service:


(Li)          x    =   m+rd

              Equations (1)' and (13)     describe   the average behavior of
consumption opportunities and the current account. They are therefore
the appropriate benchiiuark by which to judge the effects of changes in
the levels of prices in world trade. We now proceed to that analysis.
  2. Geometry


                    Before moving to an algebraic statement of the effects of
  price changes we provide here a geometric interpretation. In Figure 1 we
  show consumption of importables and exportables (CmCx) as well as pro-
  duction m'x Initial production equilibrium is at point A. (We take
  the case of a fixed production point, although the algebra and the footnote
  show that we could also look at an equilibrium on the transformation curve).
  The line QQ through A indicates the value of output at the initial relative
  prices. From the value of output we subtract the real value of debt service,
  being rD/P* in terms of exportables and rD/P in terms of importables. Sub-
  tracting these quantities from point A yields points on the consumption
  frontier CC. Point B is the preferred consumption point with imports BE
  equal to exports FA less debt service GA, both measured in terms of impor-
  tables at the prevailing relative price.


                    Suppose now a rise in the absolute world price of importables.
  In Figure 2 we show that the value of production changes as the budget line
  rotates through point A.' To determine what happens to consumption opportuni-

      ties we have to construct the new budget line C'C'. It is apparent
      that the value of debt service measured in terms of exportables does
      not change. Hence point G remains a point of the new budget line C'C.
      Through point G we draw a line with the slope given by the new relative
      price ratio. The value of debt service in terms of importables,of course,
         is seen to decline as shown by the reduced vertical distance between QQ
      and C'C'. The new consumption point will lie on the budget line C'C'.

               Now we can ask hot/ much of an increase in income we would have to
   give the consumers to allow them to buy the initial consumption basket B
   at the new prices. Measured in terms of importables the compensating varia-

   to price changes. For small
                               price changes this effect is second order;for
   large price changes the geometry and the algebra below overestimate the
   income effect of price changes.The
                                          same applies to the treatment of consumer
   adjustment below where the Slutzky approximation is exact for small changes.
                                                                     -5-




  tion in income is indicated by the vertical distance between C'C' and
 a parallel through point B,HB. It is readily shown that this compensa-
  ting variation is equal to:


          HB = BF - HF   =   P*(Q_rD/ -c)/ -(Q-rD/-C)/'
                         =


 where rn denotes the phyical level of imports and P and     are the initial
 and new levels of import prices. Thus the change in real income, measured
  in terms of importables, is equal to imports times the percentage change
  in import prices.1


                As shown in the diagram a rise in import prices reduces
 welfare, a measure of the reduction in real income being the compensating
 variation HB. It is apparent that we can use the same technique to show that
 a rise in export prices raises welfare. (Cc' now rotates through a point
on CC vertically below A, becoming steeper). Finally, an equiproportionate
change in export and import prices will only reduce the real value of debt
 service thus shifting CC upward, coming closer to QQ


                Having established an intuitive interpretation for our results
we now proceed to brief algebraic derivation of the change in real disposable
iincome induced by world price changes.




       P the price index we can define the change in consumption measured in
 terms of the index,rather than in terms of importables, as (P/p) F= m
 where m denotes the real value of imports.
3. The Algebra of Price Changes




               To determine the effects of price changes on real disposa-
ble income we start with the definitions of the value of output, the
consumer price index and import prices, all measured in home currency:

                                                   a 1-a
                 = xx     +
                                  mm     ;   r =
                                                               m=       EP *



               Equations (5) reflect the assumption that the home                      country
produces both importables and exportabies. In Lhe world market for
iinpoi-tables we are price takers, but not necessarily in the export market.
The price index is an expenditure weighted index of importable and
exportable goods prices.


               Using (5) the change in real disposable income is given by:


(6)          A c =
                        xx"            x +            p    -
                                                               (y/p)p    -
                                                                             rd(E-P)

which simplifies to the following expression:1



                                      m) + rd
             A c = x(P        -   P
(6)'
                       x


where x again equals the real value of exports.


               Price changes in world trade have two effects on real
disposable income. A terms of trade improvement raises real consumption
opportunities by the real vdlue of exports times the terms of trade
change. This is the converitiona income effect of a terms of trade
improvement. A rise in the world dollar price level, Ps', raises real
disposable income by reducing the real value of the debt and hence real
debt service. This is represented by the second term in (6)'


 .Ern (6) we   obtain     sixrlification by rxtiny that= (Y/P)P= a(Y/P)P +
                        the
  + (1-a) (y/p)P.  Next  cbsere   that a(Y/P) = a(c+rd) ard+PCjP where
     notes cansp1ic-i of carrtodity i. Further igte that the last term
  in (6) can be written as rd ( - = rd P '+ ard            and that on ave-
  rage the current acunt is ba1aiicd so IhaL real exports, x, equal
  real itrports, m, plus real interest paynErits: x=mfrd. Using all these
  sthstitutior in (6) yields the final form in (6)'.
                                                                          -7-

                  Another way of looking at the effects of price changes is
to distinguish the role of export and import prices. This is done in
(7) where we have substituted for the change in import prices m =E+P*
and rearranged Lerrns to obtain:


                  Ac =              -   mP*
(7)                      x(P-E)

In equation (7) the term P-E measures the change in the dollar price of
our exportables. The equation shows that a rise in the dollar price of
exportables raises real income in proportion to exports. A rise in the
dollar price of imports lowers real income in proportion to the level
of imports. There is thus a complete symmetry that is assured by the
fact that on average the inflation adjusted current account must baldnce
or x=m+ rd.

      Extensions


                   The analysis so far has made two assumptions that are
easily relaxed. The first is that depreciation adjusted nominal interest


that j =    j
rates are equaiized. An alternative is to assume a risk premium p such
                + è + p. With this assumption


(1)"               c = YIP -    (r+)d

is our defnitioi of real disposable income, the risk premium or uspreadll
p reduces the level of real disposable income for a given level of debt.
It does not, though, affect the result derived in (7) above.


                   A second generalisation concerns the role of home goods.
Suppose that in addition to exportables and import competing goods the
home country produces nontraded goods. This, of course, changes the
definitions of nominal income and the price index. Ii is readily
shown that the effects of price changes as derived in (7)
remain unaffected. This is so because the home country neither exports
                                        I
nor imports nontraded goods.
                                                                            -8-




  5. Concluding Remarks


                    This note has shown how to
                                                  integrate the presence of an
  external debt in the conventional
                                     treatment of the income effects of
  a price change. The analysis has shown that a rise in export prices
  raises real income in proportion
                                    to exports and that a rise in world
  prices of our imports reduced real
                                      income in proportion to imports.
  The income effects of changes in
                                    the real value of the debt service
  liability are implicit in these results since the difference between
 exports and imports is equal to the debt service. As noted earlier
 these measures are only
                          approximate. They are exact for small changes,
 but provide an overestimate when
                                   price changes are large and hence
 substitution along the transformation
                                        curve and along the indifference
 curve become important. Bearing this qualification in mind our measure
 provides an upper estimate of the income effect.
