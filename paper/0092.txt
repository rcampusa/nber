     Many studies have shown that the acquisition of schooling has a beneficial

effect on wage rates. Ben—Porath (1967), Hanoch (1967), Johnson (1970), Taubman

and Wales (1973), Griliches (1971), Griliches and Mason (1972), Lazear (l975a,

1975b)   and Mincer (1971-t), to   name   a few,   all find that the returns to schooling

(gross as well as net of costs) are positive where returns are measured in terms

of wage increases. Up to this point, however, no one has investigated the rela-

tionship between current schooling and current wage rates. The study that comes

closest to doing this is that of Parsons (l97)-). Parsons makes the point that

individuals who attend school also tend to work fewer hours per week, i.e., hold

"part—time" rather than "full—time" jobs. Since hours worked are negatively                 re-
lated to wage rates, it is contended that the cost of schooling is understated
when investigators ignore the lower wage rates of students.1 This story confuses
two effects. It is really a description of the relationship between hours and

wage rates (a supply curve, perhaps?) rather than one of the schooling effects

on wages per se. This paper is an attempt to get at the second relationship.

Casual observation seems to reflect a discontinuity in wage rate growth which

occurs when an individual completes school and joins the labor force as a perma—

nent member. This suggests that the time spent in work while attending school is

in some sense secondary. Here, the marginal value of the individual's time is

                                                   1
                                           2

 considerably lower than the average value of his time. When the individual

 leaves school, the marginal value of time jumps up to some higher level so that

 it is now closer to the average value. However, if the student can move to

this higher margin at will, why has he not done so in the past? The problem

is essentially one of "anti—coinplementarities" between the production of human

capital through formal schooling and working in the primary occupation. More

generally, the productivity of an individual's time in one endeavor is not in-

dependent of how the rest of his time is spent. If this is the case, students

will be willing to accept lower paying jobs which do not greatly diminish the

productivity of school time in lieu of jobs offering higher wages at the cost

of a greater reduction in school time productivity. One can imagine, for ex-

ample, that low effort jobs which do not greatly tax the worker's ability would

leave a student in better condition to complete his homework than would jobs

which required a great deal of concentrated thought or physical exertion. Al—

ternatively, some jobs may allow the student time during work hours to read and

complete homework.2 Others allow more flexible hours of work. Students will be

willing to accept lower wages for these jobs than for jobs which do not permit

this   kind of activity.   As will be shown, the wages of students, other things
constant, are about 12% lower than those of non—students. The magnitude of this
wage differential is surprisingly large and    warrants investigation on empirical

grounds alone. This paper explores the empirical relationship and examines

various   explanations for it. Finally, implications of the analyses are discussed.

        The point can be made more formally. Let us postulate that


(1)                             Wt/Wt* =   et"
where Wt is the individual's observed wage rate in cents per hour,

                                                                                      .

                is the individual's potential wage where potential relates to the

amount   that    could be earned if the individual were indifferent to the effect of

work on school productivity.3 (Temporarily assume that general human capital

in the form of on—the—job training equals zero.)

                is the grade of schooling completed in period t+l minus that

completed in period t.

         Suppose also      that

(2)                                         WT* = A Wt*e1(Tt)

where A is a shift parameter invariant across individuals, but unique to the

period t to t, and y is the wage growth rate which depends upon variables per-

taining to the acquisition of human capital, changes in worked hours and perhaps

demographic characteristics as race and marital status.

         Substituting (1) into (2), one obtains

       This relationship can be estimated easily.5                                    The data come from the

National Longitudinal Survey sample of young men 1—21 years old in 1966. The

original sample had 5225 individuals. This number was reduced to lL2)4                                            to   meet
the following criteria: First, it was necessary for the purpose that individ-

uals have wage rates reported in period t and T (1966 and 1968).6 Second, in—

dividuals who reported their wage rates as either less than 50 cents per hour or

greater than 10 dollars were dropped on the grounds that reported wages were un-

likely to be correct in those cases. Finally, observations
                                                                                                   were dropped for
which there was incomplete information on variables used in this analysis.

growth because students receive lower wages than do non—students, even holding

hours of work constant. The effect is large in an absolute sense. Equation (6)

         An   individual who has completed one           year of schooling between 1966 and

 1967, but who did not attend school between 1968 and 1969                              would anticipate a

 30.2 cents increase in hourly wages as               the   result of dropping out of school in

 addition     to the return from the year of schooling per se. This change amounts
 to about 15% of initial wages (or 12% of current wages)——a very significant com-
 ponent in     the measurement of the price of time.

         The importance of this effect is underscored by comparing it to the effect

 of a change in the stock of schooling. The size of the latter is given by

                                            6

 school appears to be about 7—1/2 times the size of the immediate effect of at-

 tending school. This exaggerates the difference for two reasons. First, since

             s66) is
         —
 (s68                  held constant,   is the effect of a change in the stock of

 schooling, given that the individual did not vary his school status between 1966

 and   1968.    But for the same reason that wages are unlikely to reflect the true

potential productivity of student workers, wage growth is unlikely to reflect

the true effect of schooling on the potential productivity of student workers.

Instead, it reflects schooling's influence on productivity in the "secondary"

job, which is understandably small.

              the effect of dropping out of school is a once—and—fox—all effect
         Second,

whereas that of schooling acquisition may not be. For example, if the stock of
schooling affects production of on—the—Job training by more than it does cur-
rent wages, regarding a change in schooling as a once—and—for—all phenomenon
leads to an understatement of the magnitude of the true effect. It should be
stated, however, that when the regression was run with multiplicative interac-
tion terms between previous levels of schooling and experience and current ac-

quisition of schooling and experience, no significant effect was observed.

         Be that as it may, it has been established that independent of the effect

of hours worked, individuals who are in school obtain lower (current) wages.

It was suggested that this was partially        the result of a conscious choice on
the    part of students who are willing to accept lower wages in order to conserve

energy or      maintain flexibility for human capital production. Alternative ex-
planations can be examined.
        First,   one might argue that since schooling and simultaneous acquisition

of on—the—job training are likely to be substitutes in the production of human

capital, using observed wages biases the results. This is, in fact, likely to

be the case, but the bias works in the opposite direction. That is, when an           S
                                            T

    individual   drops out of school and takes "real" employment, he may spend a

    greater proportion of his time investing in on—the—job training than he did

    when he was concurrently enrolled in school. If so, a smaller proportion of

    the total wages paid (including human capital) will be observed on his post—

    school job than was observed on his in—school job. This would imply that

    dropping out of school would have a negative effect on wage growth, i.e.,

    should be positive. The fact that it does not implies that the effect is suf-

    ficiently large to swamp the upward bias on 61.

          An alternative explanation may be offered. It may be the case that

    schooling productivity is not a function of other time at all. Instead,

    schooling may be correlated with a geographical limitation on job search which

    causes individuals to experience a wage gain when this search constraint is

    lifted. For example, an environmental engineer specializing in tropical cli—

    mates may find it difficult to obtain employment in his field while he is at-

    tending MIT. This explanation can be tested empirically. The NLS data contain

    information on the location of an individual's residence each time the survey

    is taken. One may therefore hold constant the effect of moving between 1966

    and 1968 in order to isolate the effect of leaving school per Se. Define G as

    a dummy set equal to one if the individual changes his residence between 1966

    and 1968. The results of estimation with G are contained in Table 1. In re-

    gression (12), note that the effect of a change in residence enters significantly

    and is roughly of the same magnitude as the effect of dropping out of school.

    However, the effect of dropping out of school is essentially unchanged. Moving

    and dropping out of school both affect wage growth, but the effect of one does

    not replace that of the other. This can be seen more clearly by examining re—

    gression (13).   The effects of schooling and moving imply that if an individual
,   were to drop out of school and move, the resultant change in the log of wages

        Nor can we argue that lifting of the moving constraint equalizes wages

across groups due to factor mobility. The results tell us that individuals

who do not move experience a smaller wage increase upon graduation than those

who do move. If the explanation for depressed student wages rested on some-

thing like a "glutt' of student workers in the school's vicinity, lifting the

moving constraint, i.e., graduation, should have no greater effect on those

who leave than those who remain. Factor mobility would now guarantee that

their prices should be equalized across communities. This result is not ob-

tained. School leaving, coupled with a geographical move, produces more rapid

wage grow-th than moving itself. This is probably because all movers also change

jobs and job changing is the primary way by which one changes from a "secondary"

to a "primary" worker. (This is discussed in more detail below.) Finally, the

"glut" explanation of depressed student wages has problems on theoretical

grounds as well. Although students may be constrained from relocating, in the

long run, firms   are   not. One expects a tendency for firms to move to these

"glutted" areas until wages per unit of productivity are equalized across areas.

        Before moving on, however, there is one piece of evidence found which is

quite consistent with the student glut hypothesis. If student gluts were im-

portant, one would expect the effects to show up more significantly in rural

than in urban schools. Dropping out of an urban school should have no effect

on wages since one could hardly argue, for example, that Columbia students glut

the New York labor force. Thus, let U be a dununy equal to one for individuals

whose 1966 and 1967 residences were in an SMSA. Regression (lit) in Table 2 re-

veals that the effect of (S68 —                  is much smaller (—.1968 + .l451t = —.05114

for urban than rural workers. This suggests that school leaving is not as

important for individuals who attend urban schools. This result is also con—
                                          10

sistent with the anticomplementarity explanation, however. Since students in

rural schools are more likely to move upon graduation, they are     also   more likely

to undertake the job switch through which the effort or flexibility change occurs.

      It is interesting to ask whether movers are intrinsically different from

non—movers. It can be argued, for example, that individuals who have a relative

preference for risk will be more inclined to move since changing location offers

a higher expected wage at the price of a higher variance in the potential wage.8

This proposition is testable and can be distinguished from the hypothesis that

movers are higher quality workers who are able to acquire human capital more

efficiently. If the latter is the case, moving between 1968 and 1969 will have

the same effect on wage growth between 1966 and 1968 as will moving during the

two—year period. On the other hand, if movers are in fact paid a premium for

moving which is unrelated to their "quality," but rather to their willingness

to take risk, a move between 1968 and 1969 should have no effect on wage growth

previous to 1968. Table 2, regressions (15),(l6) and (17) contain these results.

      The MOVED dummy which is set equal to one for individuals who changed

residence between 1968 and 1969 does not enter significantly into the regres-

sion, nor is there any effect on the other coefficients when the sample is

split up into movers (MOVED =   1) and non—movers (MOVED = 0).    (The F(1O, iO1)

is computed to be 1.205.) These findings suggest that the quality explanation

of movers' wage growth is invalid. Instead, the premium to moving is a direct

payment made to individuals who are willing to take risk and bear the costs

of dislocation.

      The most difficult alternative explanation to refute is that the causality

runs from high wages to school leaving rather than from the reverse. That is,

the negative       —        coefficient    reflects the fact that when an individual

                                                                                         .

receives a high wage offer, he is more likely to leave school. There is, how-

ever, no necessity that the individual leave school to accept the job. He

could just as well "leave" leisure. Put differently, the fact that employers

often discourage their employees from simultaneous attendance of school reflects

their belief that school attendance adversely affects current productivity at

work. Neither employers nor workers are indifferent with respect to the way in

which employees' off time is spent. Thus, in order for the reverse causality

argument to hold, one must implicitly believe that there is a reason why an in—

ftividual leaves school rather than leisure. The explanation offered here is

that of time anticomplementarities. Evidence below on summer employment sheds

additional light on this question.

      It is interesting to look at the actual mechanism through which the

cross—productivity effect works. The stylization contained in earlier para-

graphs was that individuals take low effort or highly flexible jobs while cur-

rently attending school and then switch to higher effort, less flexible, higher

paying jobs upon graduation. Job changing is therefore considered. Define J

as a dummy equal to one       when the first post—school job is   the same as the

school—time   job.9       First, only 11% of those who left school and were working

during school had the same post—school job,1° i.e., had J =         1.   Second, regres-

sion L9)in Table 3 reveals that individuals who drop out of school, but remain

in the same job, expeience a partial effect on 2n            — 2n        of — .102 + .116

— .028 = —. 01)4.     Those who switch jobs upon graduation expect a partial change

of .116. This suggests that incompatibilities between work and school operate

through the types of jobs an individual chooses. School leaving, when, accom-

panied by a job switch, results in little wage change. Caution must be exer-

cised, however, when interpreting the result since the coefficients on J and

68 —                are   not jointly significant.

        Some of the individuals who worked during school did so during the

summer only. If the effect being picked up by the coefficient °                 68    —


relates   to an optimal effort or flexibility allocation between work and school,

one would expect that school leaving would have a smaller effect for those

whose in—school job was worked during the suxmner only. That is, summer workers

are less likely to save effort for use at school since they are not simultane-

ously attending school. This prediction does not result from the reverse

causality    explanation. Regression (21)      in Table 14 bears    this   out. R is a dummy

equal   to one when the school job is worked during the summer only. The effect

of school leaving and having been employed during the summer is .1310 + .18142

— .21485 =   .o66i   compared to .1310 for individuals who were not in the summer

only group.11 This finding lends support to the incompatibility hypothesis.

Also note that correcting for summer jobs makes the effect of experience

(E68 — E66) much more important. This suggests that summer jobs produce less

on—the—job training than other jobs——a hardly surprising result.

        A restriction may be placed on the value of the coefficients in (6). it

is known that in the absence of direct costs, the marginal cost of a year of

schooling in year t is


(22)                   Ct =   t 5t

where H is the number of hours of school attendance (per year) and T =
                                                                        •T

                                                                                      8i60 is

the number of hours per year. The second term on the right—hand side of (22)

is the effect that attending school has on depressing the productivity of time
                        12
 during that period.

        The marginal returns to an additional year of schooling in year t are

where   N is the age at retirement and it is assumed that schooling is suffi-

ciently general human capital to cause a like increase in the productivity

of time in all uses. Further, assune for simplicity that

that this relationship holds only for the final unit of schooling since the

previous units are expected to yield a return greater than the cost and thereby

increase wealth. Only for the final unit of schooling is the individual indif-

ferent between investing and not investing.

The restriction is testable and the restricted version of the model is

estimated below.

       Table 5   contains      the results of regressions on groups of individuals for
whom the observed year of schooling was and was not the marginal year. (The
marginal year is defined as a year of schooling which is followed by a year of
non—school attendance.) Regressions (33)and (35) impose the linear constraint
that      = .0583 —   . 309     81. while regressions (32)           and   (31k) are unconstrained. The

result is that for the group for which the current year of schooling is the

marginal year, the constrained estimates do not differ significantly from the

unconstrained ones. Thus the constraint appears to be valid for this group. In

addition, for the group which is attending a non—marginal year of school, there

is a significant difference between the constrained and unconstrained estimation

as one would expect. (The two F—tests yielded, respectively, F(l,l21) = .362;

F(1,1277) =   8.65.)   On closer examination, however, one finds that the signs go

the wrong way! For the non—marginal investment group, it turns out that       is

significantly less than .0583 — . 31Q9 l rather than significantly greater. The

phenomenon discussed above can also be called upon to explain this finding.

Since individuals who are not in the marginal group and have positive values for

S68 — S66 are necessarily enrolled in school in 1968, their wages reflect pro-

ductivity in their secondary job. For the reasons discussed above, one would

not expect schooling to affect wages in the secondary job in the same way that

it will affect wages when school attendance is complete. Thus, the schooling

coefficient understates the true effect of schooling more for this group than

for the "margin" group. If the findings that          —.11 are correct, the con-

straint would imply that         .095. This number is not an unreasonable marginal

"rate of return" to schooling.

      The notion of the anticomplementarity between work and schooling can be

extended. It has been observed that women earn lower wages than do their male

counterparts having similar experience and schooling characteristics.'3 Since,

as an institutional fact, women are more likely to produce home—related com-

modities (as child raising, cooking, etc.), they may optimally choose to take

less demanding, more flexible jobs which offer lower salaries. This does not

suggest that no discrimination exists, or that discrimination does not cause

the relative concentration of women in the production of home—type goods. It

simply allows that given the constraints, part of the difference between male

and female wages results from optimization which depends primarily on the nature

of non—market time.

      Another extension relates to moonlighting. If an individual spends his

non—worked hours in work rather than in leisure, one might expect that his wage
                                                     20

rate would be lower on his primary job. Define T66 as a dummy equal to one if

the individual kept one job throughout 1966, but at some time during 1966, was

also employed on another job. Similarly define T68. Since moonlighting in

1966 should depress initial wages while moonlighting so in 1968 depresses final

wages, in the wage growth context, the sign on T68 should be negative while

that on T66 should be positive. The results are shown below:

No support of an important moonlighting effect is present.


Implications

       The most obvious implication of the previous analysis is that the cost

of schooling is seriously understated when foregone earnings are assumed to be

equal to the wage rates multiplied by hours of school. This is true for two

reasons: First, the observed wage rate does not include payment in human
                                             21

P
    capital. (This issue is discussed more thoroughly in Lazear (1975a).) Second,

    even if total payment were measured "correctly," this would understate the true

    potential wage rate since marginal productivity, and therefore the wage rate,

    is a function of how an individual spends the rest of his time. Nor is this

    latter effect second order in magnitude. Foregone observed wages in 1968 were,

    at   the mean, equal to $2.51 per   hour. It was shown that by dropping out of

    school,   an individual's hourly wage rate would rise by about 12 to 15%.
            The point may be generalized. Once it is recognized that the level of
    school    time affects the productivity of work time, it is not difficult to im-

    agine that other activities affect the value of time in alternative activities.

    The effect may be positive as well (e.g., sleep increasing the value of time

    used at work). This suggests that employers will be somewhat paternalistic and

    will   take an active   interest in how the worker spends his non—market time. It

    also   suggests that governmental programs such as the establishment of child
    care centers may    have   beneficial effects on GNP which are understated by the
                                                                               the
    wage rate based calculations. Similarly, programs geared toward increasing
    value    of an individual's leisure may also indirectly affect his ability to    pro-

     duce while   on—the—job. The notion of complementaritieS between various uses of

     time is not an especially surprising one. What is important, however, is that

     these complementarities (or anti—complementarities) have been shown, in the case

     of schooling and work, to be quite important in magnitude.

             A second and related implication is that estimates of the returns to

     schooling depend upon the age range of the group in question.      For example, if

     one were looking at very young workers, the effect of schooling tends to be

     understated for two reasons: First, as already mentioned, schooling may not

     have as large an impact on wages in jobs which are regarded as secondary. Since

     most young workers are attending school simultaneously, their wage rates do not
                                          22

truly   reflect   the schooling effect. Second, since dropping out of school

causes an increase in the observed wage rate, and since at very young ages it

is only the individuals with relatively few years of schooling who drop out

of school, less schooled workers (using a cross—sectional approach) will be

observed to have artificially higher wages, relative to highly schooled workers

which biases downward estimates of the returns to schooling. In a wage growth

context, the schooling coefficient is biased upward when those who experience

positive changes in schooling are on net school leavers rather than school

returners.

        A final implication is an empirical one. If there are systematic biases

such that the observed wage rate is a greater understatement of the true price

of time for individuals who are currently enrolled in school, a categorization

which lumps all individuals into a group, irrespective of school status, is

likely to mislead investigators.


Summary

        This paper shows that, other things constant, students' wage rates are

about 88% that of non—students. An explanation which operated through the

"anticomplementarity" of school and work was offered, but the emphasis of the

paper remains empirical. The magnitude of the student differential is large

and significant. It varies significantly between urban and rural environments.

Other findings were:

        1. Moving positively affects wage growth, but school leaving increases

wages even in the absence of a move. Furthermore, the return to moving is a

dlirect one: it does not result from intrinsic differences between movers and

non—movers.



                                                                                  S
                                     23

      2. It appears that 89% of students who work, change jobs upon graduation

and that capturing the return to school leaving may depend crucially upon the

switch.

      3. Individuals are not as likely to desire low effort jobs if they only

work during school vacations. Furthermore, it seems that less human capital is

produced in summer jobs than in less temporary employment.

      School attendance does depress wages, but it appears to be the result of

an optimal allocation of effort and time flexibility between labor and learning.

        1. The positive relationship between hours and wage rates is presumably

a reflection of employer preferences rather than the normal supply of labor

response.

        2. This situation differs from the first somewhat in that here school time

and work time are incorrectly measured. I.e., part of the time spent at the work

place is school time so that the observed hourly wage understates the true hourly

wage.

        3. The effect of taking an easier job on the margin      must cause the wage
rate to be reduced by the same amount as the value of time used in the production

of human capital is increased. If not, the individual would continue past (or

stop short of) this point of job effort reduction.

        4.   See Lazear (l9T5a) for a more complete discussion of this specification.

        5. Dummy     variables   for presence in school in 1968 and 1966 could be used

instead of S68 and               The regressions were run with the replacement and the

obtained results were virtually identical.

        6. Data are contained on 1969, but the analysis below requires information

from year T   + 1.
        7. This difference is jointly significant at the 5% level.

        8. H. Hall (1972) discusses the point in the context of unemployment

differences across cities.

        9. "Same" is defined as having the same employer and reported occupation

in both jobs without an interruption in employment.

      10.      Since most individuals leave school in June, and the survey is

taken in October, the duration between school leaving and the date of the

post—school job is for the most part four months.

      11. The joint test for significance of R and R(S68 —            yielded   an

F(2,11412) =    6.8.
      12.      This assumes that the effect of S on all units and types of time

throughout the period is the same.

      13. See, for example, Landes (l971). She finds that other things equal,

women receive wage rates which are only 16% lower than men's wage rates.
