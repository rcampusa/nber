                                              ABSTRACT

For several decades now a debate has raged about policy-making by litigation. Spurred by the way
in which tobacco, environmental, and other litigation has functioned as an alternative form of regulation,
the debate asks whether policy-making or regulation by litigation is more or less socially desirable
than more traditional policy-making by ex ante rule-making by legislatures or administrative agencies.
In this paper we step into this debate, but not to come down on one side or another, all things considered.

Rather, we seek to show that any form of regulation that is dominated by high-salience particular cases
is highly likely, to make necessarily general policy on the basis of unwarranted assumptions about
the typicality of one or a few high-salience cases or events. Two cornerstone concepts of behavioral
decision – the availability heuristic and related problems of representativeness – explain this bias.

This problem is virtually inevitable in regulation by litigation, yet it is commonly found as well in
ex ante rule-making, because such rule-making increasingly takes place in the wake of, and dominated
by, particularly notorious and often unrepresentative outlier events. In weighing the net advantages
of regulation by ex ante rule-making against those of regulation by litigation, society must recognize
that any regulatory form is less effective insofar as it is unable to transcend the distorting effect of
high-salience unrepresentative examples.

      I. INTRODUCTION


           The recent hearings on Judge Sonia Sotomayor’s nomination to the Supreme Court

vividly exemplify the enthusiastic concurrence between the Senators and the nominee that judges

make neither law nor policy. Judges decide particular cases between particular litigants, the

questioners and the responders agree, and in doing so they apply laws and policies made by the

allegedly more representative legislative, administrative, and executive branches of government.


           Thus goes the collusive charade played out before each Supreme Court nomination, one

designed simultaneously to reassure and mislead the general public. Denying the law- and

policy-making role of the courts is the standard mantra, and no nominee intelligent enough to

find herself in that position would dare acknowledge at the hearing that judges serve, at least in

part, as law-makers and policy-makers.


           Most of us, of course, know better. Courts make law and set policy all the time, an

inevitable consequence of the indeterminacy and open-endedness both of the common law and of

the vague language in which many constitutional and statutory provisions are drafted. When the

Supreme Court concludes that tying arrangements3 and resale price maintenance 4 violate the

Sherman Act’s prohibition on “[e]very contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy, in restraint of

trade or commerce . . .”,5 for example, the Court is establishing antitrust policy no less than if

those prohibitions had been explicitly set forth in the statute or adopted as formal regulations by

the Federal Trade Commission. And so too with the determination of which types of searches

and seizures will be deemed “unreasonable” and consequently in violation of the Fourth

Amendment, of what forms of discrimination constitute denial of “the equal protection of the

laws,” and of which varieties of non-disclosure to investors will count as “device[s], scheme[s],

or artifice[s] to defraud” for purposes of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 19336 and of Rule

10b-5 issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission.7


             Policy-making by appellate judicial interpretation is well-known to the cognoscenti, and

almost certainly to the Senators and nominees who in publicly denying it tell a form of white lie

to reassure a legally unsophisticated polity. But policy-making also occurs at the trial level when

decisions in particular cases influence the non-litigants who contemplate acting similarly to or

differently from those whose behavior has previously been the subject of litigation. When a jury

or judge convicts a particular defendant of negligent homicide for unintentionally killing

someone while driving under the influence of barbiturates, for example, it is likely to affect the

problematic, regardless of the degree of scrutiny, is a product of judicial law-making in the common-law style that the vague language of the
Sherman Act has plainly (and intentionally) spawned.

decisions and behavior of countless other drivers who might be considering taking barbiturates

before getting behind the wheel or getting behind the wheel after taking barbiturates. More

commonly, when a jury determines that a manufacturer of a chainsaw is negligent and

responsible for user injuries as a result of not having fitted its products with a particular safety

device or not having provided sufficiently vivid warnings of the dangers associated with using a

chainsaw, the verdict, especially if accompanied by a large damage award, will affect the future

conduct of chainsaw manufacturers as much (or more) as if the safety device or warnings had

been required by an Act of Congress or by the regulations of the Consumer Product Safety

Commission or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.


       Our goal in this paper is to examine policy-making in response to particular cases.

When commentators refer to “regulation by litigation,” this is what they typically mean, but we

shall argue that the problem is not one peculiar to litigation, because much legislation and some

administrative rule-making is shaped by particular cases – or highly salient examples -- as well.

Still, we focus initially on litigation, and suggest that litigation’s necessary and usually desirable

focus on the particular litigants and their particular actions is a flawed platform for more broad-

based policy-making. And this problem is not, we emphasize, a function of the errors that juries

or judges may make in the decision of cases. Although such errors are often the subject of

commentary and outrage, our claim is not dependent on the possibility of judge or jury error in

deciding the case before the court. Rather, the argument is premised on the distinction between

particular adjudication and the inherent generality of policy-making. This distinction would be

of little moment were the particulars of particular litigation representative of the kinds of

problems like to arise in the future. But that is not the case. Instead, the goals and incentives of

the litigation process are likely to contribute to aberrational rather than representative cases being


                                                                                                       3
the subject of lawsuits, and a collection of phenomena – most notably the availability heuristic –

will cause the policy that emerges from litigation to be systematically based on an imperfect

picture of the terrain that the policy is designed to regulate.


         Yet although it is tempting and not wholly inaccurate to see the problem as one caused by

litigation and intrinsic to it, in fact the problem is larger, and is a consequence of a focus on one

or a few particular events, regardless of the setting in which the stories about those events may

be told. Thus we will argue that even outside of the context of litigation, many regulatory

policies also flow from experience with one or a few cases, and that the same problems that flow

from case-based policy-making in litigation also flow from case-based policy-making with ex

ante rule-making. The thrust of our argument is that the individual cases that receive sufficient

attention to affect policy significantly are often both salient and highly unrepresentative, and so

the strategy of using such cases to provide the principles that inform policy is broadly misplaced.


    II. THE GENERALITY OF POLICY


         Policies are general, both by definition and necessity. Bobbie had a bowl of cereal for

breakfast this morning, but it is her policy to have a bowl of cereal for breakfast every morning.

Officer Smith may stop Susan Jones for driving at 47 miles per hour at a particular point on Main

Street on a particular day, but it is a policy if all police officers are expected to stop all drivers

driving more than 40 miles per hour at all points on Main Street. A policy is not an action.

Rather, it is a course of action. Policies, by their very nature, are decisions about what is to be

done in a multiplicity of cases involving a multiplicity of acts by multiple people at multiple

times.




                                                                                                         4
        The observation that policy is general is banal, but the banality is worth emphasizing

because doing so makes clear that policy-making involves setting a policy that will cover many

acts by many actors in many places at many times. Good policy-making, therefore, involves

making an aggregate determination of what ought to be done over a multiplicity of instances.8

But in order to make this aggregate determination, the wise policy-maker must be able to assess

initially just what these instances, in the future, are likely to be. The optimal speed limit is not

the speed limit that would be optimal for the worst driver, nor is it the one that would be optimal

for the best driver. Rather, it involves determining what the full range of driving abilities

covered by the policy will look like, as well as assessing the expected benefits and costs

consequent upon applying alternative policies to that range. But although the assessment of

benefits and costs is difficult and important, it is subsequent to the determination, our principal

concern in this paper, of just what the future array of applications of any policy will look like.

Thus, it is a necessary condition of good policy-making that the policy-maker be able to assess

the current range of relevant behaviors (and their consequences) and the range of behaviors

likely to exist under various different policy options.


    III. SURVEYING THE FIELD OF POLICY APPLICATIONS


        How, then, are policy-makers expected to survey the range of applications of any policy,

and predict the range of behaviors that one or another policy option will produce? There is of

course no single method of empirical assessment and prediction that will apply for all policies or

for all types of policies. Still, the goals of the assessment are clear, which are to gauge not only

what activities are now taking place, but also what change in those activities will be brought

                                                                                                           5
about by some policy, or indeed by other changes in society. If a policy-maker were

contemplating, to take an issue recently in the news, a prohibition on the use of cellular

telephones while driving, the policy-maker would want to know, among other things, what

percentage of drivers owned cellular phones, how many of those drivers used the phone while

driving and in what fashion, how many accidents and of what kinds and with what consequences

were caused by cellular phone use, and how cell phone use while driving will evolve in the

future, say through Blue Tooth and other methods of hands free calling, or, as is now the greatest

concern, with the capacity to send and receive text messages. Finally, it is crucial to be able to

predict with some accuracy what changes (and at what cost) in all of the foregoing would be

brought about by various different potential policy interventions. And we can imagine and

understand similar exercises with respect to workplace safety, misrepresentation in the sale of

securities, tobacco-related illnesses, environmental hazards, and much else.


       Whatever methods might be used to pursue an empirical survey of this type, it should be

clear that assuming too quickly that any one event or practice is representative of all of the

events or practices to be encompassed by some policy is a recipe not for accuracy but for

distortion. To be sure, an accurate evaluation of expected benefits and costs will of recognize

that it is often (or at least sometimes) desirable to engage in strategic over-regulation as regards

the average case as the only or most effective way of controlling low probability events with

serious negative consequences. Nevertheless, it is a mistake to assume that unrepresentative

events or practices are in fact typical or representative, and making that kind of empirical error at

the outset of a policy-making exercise is the path to ineffective and perhaps harmful policy.




                                                                                                       6
       IV. WHEN EASY AVAILABILITY MAKES FOR BAD LAW


           With this broad goal of empirical accuracy across multiple instances in mind, we are now

in a position to evaluate litigation and ex ante rule-making along the dimension of fostering or

impeding an accurate assessment of the terrain of potential policy application.9 And from this

perspective, litigation appears to present significant risks of distortion, and in at least two

different ways.


           At times, a court making a decision will announce a rule that is to be applied in cases

other than the one that is actually before the court. Typically, this is a feature of appellate

decision-making rather than decisions (by judge or jury) at trial, for an appellate court will justify

its decision with an opinion that implicitly or explicitly announces a rule of decision to be

applied in other cases. In part the extension of a decision beyond the immediate case is a

function of the logic of reason-giving, for to give a reason is to make a claim about a type or

category that is necessarily broader than the particular instance that the reason is a reason for.10

And the extension of application beyond the immediate case is even more apparent when an

appellate court explicitly announces a rule rather than simply giving a reason, for a rule, even

more than a reason, necessarily and by reason of its generality encompasses instances other than

the one that initially inspired the announcement of the rule.11 When an appellate court, for


9
  Some of the existing literature describes the relevant choice as one between litigation and regulation, e.g., W. Kip
Viscusi, ed., Regulation Through Litigation (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution Press, 2002), but this strikes
us as a poor characterization. Because the entire point of the inquiry is to understand and evaluate litigation as a
regulatory strategy, the real question is about the relative merits of regulation by ex post litigation and regulation by
ex ante rule-making, we will frame the issue in terms of litigation versus rule-making and not litigation versus
regulation.

example, upholds a trial court verdict against a franchisor which required its franchisees to

purchase napkins and cleaning products from the franchisor as a condition of being allowed to

use the franchisor’s trademark and food recipes,12 the appellate court will announce a rule

regarding tying arrangements that represents a policy about some general category of tying

arrangements, and not just about the particular tying arrangement at issue in this particular case.

Maybe it will be a policy about all tying arrangements involving non-food products in the food

industry, maybe about all tying arrangements in the food industry, maybe about all tying

arrangements within a particular market structure, and maybe about all tying arrangements, but

the rule will be about all of something, for that is just what a rule is and just what rules do.


         There is considerable debate in legal theory over the extent to which the court that

announces such a rule is or should be constrained by the rule in subsequent and different cases.

Some argue that the rule announced in the first case exerts genuine pressure on the determination

of a subsequent and different case that lies within the linguistic contours of the rule announced in

the first case, and others claim that it is the characteristic virtue of the common law that the so-

called rules it announces are little more than weak guides, rarely if ever requiring a court to reach

a result other than the one it would have reached on its all-things-considered best judgment about

how the particular case should be resolved.13 But even if this latter view is empirically and

jurisprudentially correct, the rule announced in the first case will still be a rule that lower courts

are expected to follow, and, more importantly, will still be a rule that primary actors and their

lawyers will look to in trying to predict what will happen in a case that appears to be

encompassed by the rule.


         Once we realize, therefore, that the rule announced by an appellate court is a policy, and,

further, that the rule is a policy that will affect numerous agents other than the ones before the

court, all of the above-mentioned considerations about assessing the terrain of policy application

come into play. The question, then, is whether the decision of a particular case involving a

particular dispute between particular parties is the optimal or even a desirable vehicle for

announcing a rule and a policy that will affect the behavior of parties other than the ones whose

dispute prompted making the rule, and will influence actions at least somewhat at variance with

the actions that were adjudicated in the initial case.


         There is a view, and one embodied in much of American constitutional doctrine, that

seeing a real “case or controversy” between real litigants is the best way for a court to understand

the actual landscape that will be affected by one of its rulings.14 By delving into the detailed

facts of a genuine controversy, so it is said and so it has been held countless times, a court can

truly know what the impact of its rulings is likely to be.15




14
  See, for example, Melvin Aron Eisenberg, The Nature of the Common Law (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard
University Press, 1988); Guido Calabresi, A Common Law for the Age of Statutes (Cambridge, Massachusetts:
Harvard University Press, 1982). See also Steven Shavell, “The Appeals Process as a Means of Error Correction,”
Journal of Legal Studies, vol. 24 (1995), pp. 379-423 (“appeals courts sometimes can learn about opportunities for
lawmaking only from disappointed litigants”).
15
  In Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464
(1982), for example, the Supreme Court noted that “a concrete factual context” will generate “a realistic
appreciation of the consequences of judicial action.” 454 U.S. at 472. See also Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962)
(concrete disputes “sharpen[] the presentation of issues” and thus aid “the illumination of difficult constitutional
questions”); William A. Fletcher, “The Structure of Standing,” Yale Law Journal, vol. 98 (1988), pp. 221-77 (a
concrete case will inform a court of “the consequences of its decisions”).


                                                                                                                     9
         With respect to making the best decision in the particular controversy, there is much to be

said for the traditional view. A judicial decision will produce, typically, a real winner and a real

loser, and only by serious immersion in the situation can the court appreciate the consequences

of its decision, as well as understand the fit (or lack thereof) between an outcome and the

relevant legal language and legal doctrine.


         As a result of understanding, however, that at the appellate level the consequences and

reach of a decision will extend beyond the particular parties and the particular decision,

substantial new problems become apparent. If a court is making a decision whose influence goes

beyond the particular case, and thus beyond the identical situation before the court, one might

think that the court should, ideally, have some sense of the range of instances encompassed by its

rulings. If the decision in this case is to have consequences for other cases, other disputes, and

other actions, it seems plainly desirable for the court to know what those other cases, disputes,

and actions are likely to look like before issuing a ruling that will affect them. One problem,

however, is that appellate courts are especially structurally ill-equipped to assess the full field of

potential applications of any ruling, even though it is entirely appropriate, at the appellate level,

for an appellate court to take account of the effect of a ruling on future cases. Typically, it would

not be in the interests of the parties themselves to provide information about other potential

cases, although there are exceptions.16 Moreover, apart from cases in the Supreme Court, and to

some extent even for Supreme Court cases, the information provided in amicus curiae

16
  One such exception would arise in the common situation in which an undesirable claimant of constitutional rights
has a strong incentive to show a court how many other and more desirable claimants would benefit from a ruling in
favor of the undesirable litigant before the court. When groups such as the American Nazi Party and the Ku Klux
Klan claim free speech rights under the First Amendment, for example, it is obviously in their interest to show how
rulings in their favor would benefit less repulsive dissident organizations. And when the generally guilty claimants
of criminal procedure rights under the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments argue that their convictions should be
overturned because of a violation of such rights, they similarly have an interest in informing the court of the
existence of innocent or less culpable defendants who would be among the beneficiaries of such a ruling.


                                                                                                                  10
submissions, even opposing ones, is likely to be incomplete. And most significant is the

absence of any way in which an appellate court, lacking an investigate arm and often even the

rudiments of non-case-specific factual research capabilities, can actually go out and find the

information it might need to understand the full import of one of its rulings.


        Even more serious, however, is the way in which the particular case, the particular facts,

and the particular litigants are likely to dominate a judicial assessment of the relevant terrain.

The particulars of the case are available, in the technical sense of that term,17 and the risk is that

their very availability will lead a court to assume, mistakenly, that future cases will resemble the

cognitively available case now before the court.18 Just as someone who has just learned about a

death from a rattlesnake bite is likely to overestimate the number of deaths caused by rattlesnake

bites compared to the number caused by bee stings,19 so too can we expect a court immersed in

the details of particular litigation with particular parties and particular facts to assume, possibly

mistakenly, that other and future events within the same broad category will resemble the events

involved in the case now before the court. The case before the court may indeed be

representative of the full population of cases of that broad type, but the availability of this case

may lead to an assumption of representativeness even when such an assumption is

unwarranted.20 Thus, although it is possible that the single case before the court accurately

represents the larger array, and although it is possible that a court will properly assess the

particular case as exemplary of many cases, it is precisely the ease of recall of the case before the

court that may lead the court to assume from the ease of recall that the case is representative

when in fact it is not.21


         Litigation is also especially likely to exacerbate the availability problem because the

judge or court is obliged not only to see the details of the case before it, but also, and more

importantly, because the judge or court must decide that case. Whatever possibility a decision-

maker may have of ignoring the most available event and thus transcending the availability-

produced mis-characterization of the larger array, that possibility is likely to decrease when the

decision-maker has a particular task to perform with respect to the available example. Because

tasks narrow a decision-maker’s focus, and because tasks thus make it more difficult for those

performing a task to see beyond what is necessary to perform that task,22 a decision-making

situation in which the primary task is to decide a particular case will narrow the focus of the

decision-maker on the facts of that case, and make it less likely that the decision-maker will

Individuals substantially underestimate the uncertainties in the world, and are overconfident about their ability to
predict ranges of outcomes, expecting that the outcomes will lie closer to our experiences to date than they actually
do. See Nassim Nicholas Taleb, The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable (New York: Random
House, 2007). Individuals often do not recognize that the world presents us with fat-tailed distributions (which
produce many extreme outliers), not the normal distributions found in most textbooks. And courts are likely to be
subject to the same bias, believing that the world will present us with situations that cluster reasonably closely, when
in fact many deep outliers are to be expected.

perceive the broader set of facts necessary to perform the secondary task of establishing a

precedent, setting forth a rule, making law, or making policy.


           A good example of this phenomenon in practice is the United States Supreme Court’s

1964 decision in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan.23 The case dramatically changed American

law with respect to libel actions brought by public officials, setting forth the rule that in all such

cases the plaintiff would henceforth be required to show with “convincing clarity” not only that

what was said or published about him was false, but also that it was published with knowledge

by the publisher (or writer or speaker) of its falsity at the time of publication. In placing such a

heavy burden on a public official libel victim, the Court set out a rule that has been followed by

no other country in the world, and that has brought about the virtual elimination of public official

defamation suits in the United States.


           Seeing such a result, it is logical to inquire how it came about. The answer is that it is in

many respects a celebrity case, and one with a quite uncharacteristic fact pattern. And it is the

combination of celebrity, or high salience, combined with the unusual fact pattern that led to an

extreme change in policy. The plaintiff was the Montgomery, Alabama, City Commissioner in

charge of the Montgomery police, and his libel suit was based on an advertisement placed in

1960 by a group of civil rights leaders in the New York Times charging Sullivan with, among

other things, hostility to the civil rights movement in his treatment of civil rights demonstrators.

The case arose in a context, therefore, in which it was highly questionable whether the plaintiff

had suffered any reputational damage at all, in which the factual errors in the advertisement were

largely trivial, in which the underlying substance of the issue was a matter of great national

social and political importance at the time, in which only 43 copies of the offending publication

were sold in the entire state of Alabama, and in which the jury-awarded damages -- $500,000 in

1964 uninsured dollars – were substantial. In short, this was both a celebrity case and an outlier

case.


        Despite the unusual nature of this case, however, unusual even when compared to other

libel cases brought by public officials against the media, a Supreme Court (and a Court highly

protective of the civil rights movement) set out a rule – made law, if you will – that governed the

full array of public official libel cases, even though most of the libel cases controlled by the rule

bear little resemblance to the actual events that, but for the rule, would have generated libel

litigation. Now it is possible that the so-called actual malice rule of New York Times v. Sullivan

is the best rule, or at least a good rule, but the case nevertheless presents a good example of a

rule whose content would almost certainly have been quite different had the case before the

Supreme Court been more representative of the typical libel case – a newspaper accusing a local

official of financial malfeasance, for example -- involving a public official.24


     V. SELECTION EFFECTS AND THE BATTLE OVER AVAILABILITY


        The availability problem in litigation would be substantial even if the cases that prompted

rule-making were ones that were randomly selected from the larger array, because there would

still remain the problem of assuming from a small sample size – typically a sample of one – a set

of characteristics for the full array.25 But the problem is actually greater, because the incentives

to litigate (or refrain from litigating) are likely to make unrepresentative cases especially likely to

be the ones that wind up before appellate courts.26 If ordinary events are disproportionately

unlikely to generate disputes, if ordinary disputes are disproportionately unlikely to generate

litigation, if ordinary litigated disputes are disproportionately likely to settle, if ordinary trial

court verdicts are disproportionately unlikely to be appealed, and if ordinary appellate cases are

disproportionately unlike to generate the published opinions that are the vehicles for appellate

rule-making, then the result will be that the cases that prompt rule-making are likely to be

especially unrepresentative of the events that the rules that emerge from appellate rule-making

will encompass.


        In the American legal system, all of the conditional “ifs” in the previous paragraph are

likely to be satisfied, in large part because litigation is costly. And thus the cases that make it to

the appellate level will represent an extreme selection. To illustrate, a tobacco manufacturer may

settle two dozen cases, accept the trial court’s verdict in a dozen more, but appeal the case in

which the warnings to the particular smoker were especially obvious and in which the smoker

persisted in smoking even after health problems emerged. And a plaintiff’s attorney who

represents numerous smokers (individually, and not part of a class action) who have incurred

smoking-related illnesses will similarly, say, settle two dozen cases, accept as unfortunate

another dozen dismissals or defendant’s verdicts, and appeal the case in which a sympathetic and

largely non-negligent smoker was not, because of a grant of a motion to dismiss, or grant of a

defendant’s motion for summary judgment, or grant of a motion for a directed verdict, even

allowed to present his case to a jury. Thus, the mere fact that a case is appealed suggests from

that alone that the case is an outlier.


        Although most of the foregoing analysis is about appellate rule-making, policy-making,

and law-making, the fact is that it is trial court verdicts that have generated most of the

controversy about regulation by litigation.27 Whether it be the widely reported verdict against

McDonald’s for failing to warn customers about its especially hot coffee, or the verdicts and

settlements in the tobacco litigation, or the extremely large punitive damage awards in some

environmental and products liability cases, or the potential policy impact of litigation about guns,

lead paint, breast implants, automobile insurance, fast food, and the managed health care

industry, much of the concern about policy-making by litigation turns out not to be so much a

function of rules set forth by appellate courts, but rather is directed at the opinion-free verdicts

by juries at the trial level, verdicts (or settlements) that are often not appealed, and which, even

when appealed, often have their behavior-influencing effects as soon as the verdict is issued, and

without regard to any ultimate resolution of the controversy or opinion on appeal.


        Because trial verdicts do not involve opinions and do not involve published statements of

reasons,28 it might seem as if the concerns about availability and selection effects (or, to make

the same point positively, about their representativeness) drop out with respect to such

judgments. In fact, however, the problem may be even worse for trial verdicts than it is with

appellate rulings. Large verdicts and settlements may be highly unrepresentative, but they are

the cases that get reported in the general press and in industry-specific publications. Given the

thousands of trial court decisions every year in this broad domain, only cases that are remarkable

in some way will get noticed. Thus, the set of reported verdicts will be an unrepresentative

sample of the set of verdicts and an even more unrepresentative sample of some larger class of

lawsuits, disputes, injuries, or simple events.


        Billion dollar awards, after all, get everyone’s attention.29 Restaurants considering what

kinds of warnings to issue in conjunction with serving hot beverages, for example, are unlikely

to know about hot beverage lawsuits that were dismissed, or that were settled for small amounts

because of the nuisance value of the lawsuit. These restaurants are even more unlikely to be

aware of an even larger number of hot beverage injuries that generated no litigation at all, to say

nothing about the literally billions of hot beverages consumed every year that produce no injury

whatsoever. So although a verdict against McDonald’s as a result of a hot coffee spill will be

especially available to public knowledge because of the various media incentives that lead to

reporting of the unusual story and not the routine event – man bites dog versus dog bites man –

what becomes known will be especially unrepresentative.


        Nevertheless, the unrepresentative but highly publicized verdict may still lead potential

defendants to assume because of ease of access that such a verdict is more representative than it

actually is.30 And when potential defendants overestimate the likelihood if such exceptional

verdicts, as the availability heuristic tells us they will, and when those potential defendants alter

their day-to-day behavior based on an inflated view of the likelihood of liability, then the policy

of potentially excess caution on the part of potential defendants is as much if not more a product

of an availability problem as is a distorted rule emanating from an appellate court.


        Just as the wise policy-maker assesses the full field of potential applications of a policy

before adopting it, so too would a wise primary actor considering serving very hot coffee, for

example, want to survey the full field of potential applications of that practice, in order to be able

to determine, inter alia, what percentage of customers would spill hot coffee, how many of those

would be injured as a result, how many of those would initiate a dispute, and what benefits the

company would reap by offering very hot versus hot versus tepid coffee. But if the availability

of a hot coffee verdict leads the same primary actor to overestimate the likelihoods of spilling, of

injury, of litigation, and of an unfavorable verdict, then that actor’s behavior will be no different

from, and no more optimal than, its behavior in response to an administrative regulation that

required a too-low temperature because of the administrator’s mis-assessment of the likelihood

of injury. Even if potential defendants could calculate accurately the likelihood of an extreme

award,31 they must also be concerned with the mindset of potential plaintiffs. If potential

plaintiffs believe large awards are possible, they will be more likely to bring suit, making it even

more important for defendants to try to limit their exposure. And thus we suspect that coffee

temperatures dropped across America after the McDonald’s decision, even for defendants who

knew the odds.

the context of serving hot rather than very hot coffee, or of selling serviceable and reliable tires

  Which will, ideally, take into account the way in which juries will also know something about outlier previous
awards, and thus will have outlier information about award size and possibly outlier information about a jury’s
belief that a defendant should have been on notice.


                                                                                                                   18
rather than ultra-high-performance tires for consumer use,32 these disadvantages may be more

apparent when the hyper-cautious actors are pharmaceutical companies, newspapers engaged in

investigative reporting, or physicians refraining from performing risky but potentially life-saving

operations, for in such cases the societal losses or public harms from inaction are more easily

grasped.33 But even if these harms are understood, hyper-caution is a concern because in many

psychological and legal contexts errors of commission count for more than errors of omission,

implying that there is a already background tilt in the direction of insufficient action.


            Still, our goal in this paper is not to enter into the debate about the socially optimal

degree of caution that a manufacturer or other primary actor should adopt, assuming that the

actor conducts an accurate empirical assessment of the expected social costs of the Type I errors

of engaging in too much harmful conduct and the Type II errors of failing to engage in sufficient

beneficial conduct. Rather, our two aims here are only to argue, (1) that such an assessment, a

prerequisite to any determination of the proper risk level, cannot proceed wisely if the frequency

of various potential events is mis-calculated or mis-estimated, and (2) that such mis-calculation

or mis-assessment is especially likely to occur when aberrational events are highlighted because

of the incentives of those – especially but not only the institutional press who report and the

plaintiff’s bar who litigate – who would be in a position to provide information about litigation.

  Breast implants represent a case in which medical device manufacturers essentially gave up, establishing a $4.25
billion compensation fund for “injured” recipients in the biggest class action settlement in history, even though the
best scientific studies showed no evidence of harm. As is commonly the case, the most salient lawsuits involved the
most sympathetic plaintiffs. See the book by former New England Journal of Medicine editor Marcia Angell,
Science on Trial: The Clash of Medical Evidence and the Law in the Breast Implant Case (New York: W.W. Norton
Co., 1997).


                                                                                                                  19
       Although it seems likely that the problem of mis-assessment is especially likely with

respect to non-representative verdicts for plaintiffs, from our perspective the mis-assessment

would be equally problematic where the informational availability of aberrational defendant’s

verdicts distorted the behavior of primary actors so that they underestimated the likelihood of

liability. Did the extreme availability of the verdict of acquittal in the trial of O.J. Simpson, for

example, lead potential spouse-killers to overestimate the possibility of acquittal? [Can we come

up with a widely-publicized defendant’s verdict in a products liability or class action lawsuit?]


       The problem we highlight is one that is likely to be exacerbated because of the incentives

that determine the identity of litigation parties as well. In class action lawsuits, for example, it

would be a foolish plaintiff’s attorney who selected a representative plaintiff rather than one who

is especially sympathetic. It is true that Rule 23(a)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure

requires the judge to determine that the class representative present claims that are “typical of the

claims . . . of the class,” but such a determination will take place on only one side of the range.

Some potential class representatives will in fact be typical of some class of plaintiffs, others will

be atypically sympathetic, and some will lie in between. But none, unless the plaintiff’s attorney

is an idiot, will be atypically unsympathetic, and thus a judge faced with determining

representativeness from candidates only on the sympathetic side of the typicality distribution can

be expected systematically to incline the class of all class representatives in the direction of the

atypically sympathetic. To the extent that this is so, the litigation-based policy-making that

ensues from class action judgments is especially likely to suffer from judge or jury mis-

assessments of the aggregate character of the class, thus compounding the perceptual mis-

assessments that are the product of the way in which only exceptional and thus unrepresentative




                                                                                                       20
verdicts are publicized, and even beyond the extent to which only unrepresentative disputes are

litigated and only unrepresentative suits get to verdict without dismissal or settlement.


   VI. ON CASE-BASED RULE-MAKING


       On the basis of the foregoing, it may be tempting to perceive litigation itself as the

problem, but in fact that is not so. Litigation does indeed present an example of the problem, but

the problem – or at least the availability/unrepresentativeness problem – is one that comes with

an over-emphasis on specific cases in the policy-making process, whether the policy originates in

a court of law, an executive agency, or a legislature, and whether it is formal policy or simply a

prescribed practice. Over-emphasis on unrepresentative specific cases in policy-making appears

across a wide range of regulatory/rule-making institutions, and is hardly restricted to litigation-

based policy-making.


       A good indication of the increasing tendency towards case-driven ex ante rule-making is

the proliferation of laws named after particular individuals, of which Megan’s Law, requiring the

registration with local authorities of released sex offenders, is perhaps the most famous.

Megan’s Law, first enacted by the California legislature and then copied in many other states, is

hardly unique, however, and federal laws dealing with missing children and adults include

Kristen’s Act, Jennifer’s Law, and Bryan’s Law, while among the federal laws dealing with sex

offenders are Aimee’s Law, the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sex Offender

Registration Act, and the Hillary J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Drug Prevention Act.

Although many of these laws deal with missing persons and sex offenders, there are also case-

generated laws dealing with drunk driving, including the Burton H. Greene Memorial Act, with

crime on campus, as with the federal Jeanne Clery Act and the Michael Minger Act in Kentucky,


                                                                                                  21
with physically abusive dating partners, the object of Idaho’s Cassie’s Law, with hit and run

driving in Brian’s Bill in Maryland, with conditions of release for violent offenders, exemplified

by Jenna’s Law in New York, and many others.


       These and similar named bills were drafted in response to celebrity cases, many of them

representing the extremes of the bad behavior that winds up being the subject of the law. The

Brady Law, for example, is a prime piece of federal gun control legislation, and it is named after

President Reagan’s press secretary, severely and permanently injured by a bullet meant for the

President. But although gun control is mostly targeted at professional criminals and domestic

violence, it is the celebrity attack on President Reagan and the injury to James Brady that spurred

the legislation. And although most of these laws were prompted by crimes committed against

the particular victims whose names are now on the laws, New York’s Son of Sam Law, after

which many other state laws restricting profitable activities by convicted felons are named,

draws its title from the nickname for David Berkowitz, the perpetrator of a particularly notorious

series of murders in New York in the 1970s.


       It is of course difficult to avoid feeling sympathy for the victims of horrendous crimes

and for their families, and it is understandable that many of these families view a law targeted at

the specific crime from which their loved ones suffered as a fitting and enduring memorial.

Nevertheless, the more a law, of necessarily general application, is designed in view of a specific

example or specific case, the more risk there is either that the problem that prompted the law is

itself rare or that the law is designed to deal with cases resembling the prompting case even

though the highly salient prompting case is in fact unrepresentative of the problems that the

ensuing law will in fact cover. Legislators who enact such laws are thus engaged in a two-level

game with their constituents. The legislators may recognize the case-based law as somewhat

                                                                                                    22
misdirected, but feel they have no choice but to respond to public outrage over a heinous act, and

a law enshrining a victim, even an uncharacteristic victim, is often the easy path to follow.


       Even when a law is not prompted by a specific event, it has increasingly become part of

the law-making process for legislative hearings to feature victims and case studies rather than

experts on the relevant fields. Using vivid examples is of course a good rhetorical and

persuasion strategy, and it is no surprise, for example, that President Obama’s speeches about

health care reform have invariably described at least several scenarios involving more or less

worthy citizens who through no fault of their own have found themselves in health-care related

difficulties due to absent or inadequate health insurance. But no public speaker of the

President’s caliber – o, indeed, well below his caliber -- is going to pick unsympathetic

examples, even if the unsympathetic examples may in fact be more representative. Moreover,

and most importantly, it is extremely unlikely that the ensuing legislation would fail to “solve”

the problem for the exemplar individuals, even though any law and any policy will of course not

solve every problem. By relying on specific examples in circumstances in which specific and

possibly unrepresentative examples are made salient and thus dominate the process, legislation

may increasingly resemble litigation in being beholden to the unrepresentative and distorting

example.


   VII.    THE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED


       In trying to draw together the lessons to be learned, a shadow metaphor may be useful,

and may illustrate the ideal situation for case-based policy-making. The policy can be thought of

as a light beam, and the case a specific object. The policy should apply to all situations that fall

directly in the shadow of the specific case, closely resembling the specific case in terms of the


                                                                                                    23
critical elements of some principle. The difficult, we have argued, is that salient cases tend to get

exaggerated, and thus to case perceived shadows that are far larger than the real shadows created

by a more careful extrapolation from any one case. The result is a policy applicable not merely

in the actual shadow, but across a much broader range of situations, and where the lessons from

the original case do not apply.


        Thus it is not a case’s actual shadow, but its penumbra, its space of partial but not

complete illumination, that winds up defining policy. And because the danger is that a case-

based policy will be applied to a case’s penumbra and not just to its shadow, it can be useful to

think of the area of misapplication as the penumbra problem.


        We have argued that the availability heuristic is the principal cause of the penumbra

problem. Because availability leads individuals to judge the frequency of an event by how

readily one can bring an instance to mind, it influences the extrapolation process. When a case is

easily brought to mind, as with a salient litigation instance or a prominent case that prompts

legislation, the availability heuristic tells us that there is a tendency to overestimate its relevance,

and thus to think it applies much more broadly than it does. When this happens, future events

merely falling in the penumbra will be mistakenly treated as if they were directly in the case’s

shadow.


        The problem of the penumbra is exacerbated when we encounter the phenomenon of the

celebrity case. Some situations gain prominence because of media attention, sometimes because

of their extreme and thus newsworthy facts, and sometimes because of the celebrity of the people

involved. Almost by definition, newsworthy events are outliers, and celebrities are unusual.

Basing policy on celebrity cases thus typically assures that their shadow will cover relatively few


                                                                                                     24
situations, but celebrity cases, like real world celebrities, appear larger than life, and their

shadows will be exaggerated.


        Consider a recent celebrity case in that gained international publicity even though no

crime was committed, few people were involved, no money was lost, and no physical injury was

suffered. In July, 2009, Sergeant James Crowley of the Cambridge, Massachusetts, Police

Department arrested Harvard Professor Henry Louis “Skip” gates in his Cambridge home.

Gates, an African-American and probably America’s leading professor of Afro-American

studies, was, with the help of his driver, trying to force the door to his own house, which

somehow had jammed. The two were reported by a passerby as possible burglars. Sergeant

Crowley responded to the call, and series of misunderstandings and missteps ensued, with

charges of racism and unruliness flying. As the encounter became increasingly angry , an

enraged Gates was arrested for disorderly conduct. Ultimately, the charges were dropped, with

the Cambridge mayor, the Massachusetts governor, and the President of the United States all

getting involved.


        Commentators of varying political stripes chimed in, including the aforementioned three

political leaders, all African-Americans. The thrust of their comments was that this case

provided an excellent learning opportunity for some of the most important lessons for achieving

an effective and peaceful multi-racial society. So far so good, but the difficult was that different

commentators tended (and intended) to draw extremely different lessons. To some, the case

illustrated the ever-present dangers of racial profiling, if even a small, neatly dressed, middle-

aged, cane-carrying extremely distinguished Harvard professor could be subject to such an

indignity in his own home. To others, however, the most important facts were that Sergeant

Crowley was a highly respected police officer, known to go by the book, and known not only as

                                                                                                     25
not a racist, but as someone who taught courses to other officers about avoiding racial profiling.

And thus many people understood the event not as an example of racial profiling, but rather as an

elitist attack on a dedicated police officer, or a reflexive response by black leaders – including

the President – who tended to see racism in every case of disagreement between people of

different races.


        The charges against Gates were dropped, and Gates dropped his threat to sue, so there

will be no formal legal precedent from these events. Nevertheless, Cambridge has appointed a

distinguished commission whose recommendations will surely influence future policy, quite

possibly in the form of administrative edicts or city ordinances. And Gates has stated his

intention to create a television series about racial profiling, this increasing the likelihood that the

events will have a major influence on policy more broadly, and possibly on specific legislation.


        Yet although the effects of this case are likely to be major, it is hard to imagine a more

unrepresentative case to address the twin issues of racial profiling by the police and respect for

the police in minority communities. Each of the two protagonists was an extraordinarily

appealing and extreme outlier on his side of any conceivable profiling situation. Gates is a

highly distinguished African-American whose profession and appearance are extremely

unthreatening. Crowley is a very well respected policy officer as deeply engaged in combating

racial profiling as any white officer. Moreover, the locale and circumstances of the arrest were

highly unrepresentative of typical racial profiling situations. The police officer was legitimately

responding to an act reasonably arousing suspicion, yet the professor was in his own home. And

thus the case is far afield from the much more common occurrence in which a white police

officer asks young blacks just hanging out to move along, or in which a black person driving in a



                                                                                                     26
white neighborhood is stopped on general suspicion, thus explaining the facetiously-named

crime of “driving while black.”


        In short, any policy that emerges from this celebrity case will be built on a highly

unrepresentative foundation. That failing, we have argued, is common to most policies that are

built on the salient cases that tend to be the basis for regulatory policy, whether that policy

emerges from litigation, from legislation, or from action by an administrative agency.34


        Although the pressures of politics and the ever brighter spotlights of the media have

increasingly caused ex ante rule-making, especially by legislatures and occasionally by

administrative agencies, to be plagued by the pitfalls of the available but unrepresentative case,

these pitfalls are more of an unfortunate tendency of some legislative and administrative policy-

making processes than something that is endemic or necessary to the process. By contrast,

however, litigation will always carry these risks, because having a real and present controversy

between real parties is a defining feature of litigation. In this respect, therefore, the problem of

the distortingly available example is almost always a problem with regulation by litigation, but

only sometimes – even if increasingly – a problem with ex ante rule-making.


        Still, the lesson is not that litigation is inferior to ex ante rule-making as a regulatory

strategy. Rather, it is that case-based regulation entails risks of regulatory mismatch between

regulatory goals and regulatory targets wherever case-based regulation appears, and that it is as

problematic when it influences legislative and executive policy-making as when it distorts the

policy-making that is an inevitable part of the litigation process.

  We recognize the irony, apparent throughout this paper, of using available and potentially unrepresentative
examples of unrepresentativeness to illustrate the problem of unrepresentativeness.


                                                                                                                27
           Our goal here, however, is not to compare the negative aspects of case-based policy-

making to the various positive features that it may possess, or with which it may contingently be

coupled. Litigation-based policy-making, for example, may occasionally or usually bring

advantages of non-bureaucratization – private versus public regulation35 -- that will outweigh the

disadvantages that a case-based approach to policy-making entail. Litigation may also at times

be a useful spur to agency-based or legislature-based ex ante rule-making.36 But some forms of

so-called regulation by litigation may avoid some of the desirable procedural constraints

incorporated in congressional rules or the Administrative Procedure Act.37 And regulation by

litigation can at times be unnecessarily complex, costly, unpredictable, and lengthy.38 Numerous

other factors also incline one way or another in the litigation versus ex ante rule-making debate,

and it is far from our aim to even survey all of those factors, let alone evaluate them in general or

in the context of particular policy-making topics. In short, any cost-benefit analysis would have

to tally many elements on the benefit and cost sides of the litigation and regulatory rule-making

approaches. But we leave that tally to others.


           Our conclusion, therefore, is not that regulation by litigation is superior to or inferior to

regulation by ex ante rule-making. It is simply that case-based policy-making is, ceteris paribus,

a risky strategy, and that any approach to regulation is less desirable insofar as it relies too
