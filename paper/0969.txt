  The Welfare Cost of Social Security's Impact on Private Saving




          Although there have been several studies of the effect of

social security on private saving, there has been no attempt to

measure the welfare cost of this distortion. The present paper

develops an analytic framework for this evaluation and presents

numerical calculations.

        The Welfare Cost of Social Security's Impact on Private Saving

                               Martin Feldstein*


          In recent years a substantial number of econometric studies have exa-

mined the effect of social security retirement pensions on the level of

private saving.1 Implicit in these studies is the presumption that reduced

saving implies a welfare cost. It is surprising therefore that there have been

no explicit attempts to evaluate the size of this welfare cost in a manner analo-

gous to the measurement of the welfare cost of distortionary taxes (e.g.,

Harberger 19614 and the studies cited in Atkinson and Stiglitz, 1980). The pur-

pose of the present study is to provide such an evaluation.

          The analysis here shows that in an important special case a social

security program can reduce private saving without imposing any welfare loss.

In more realistic cases, however, the welfare loss is large both absolutely and

in relation to the size of the social security program.

          The primary rationale for universal social security pensions is of

course to provide retirement income to those who lack the foresight to provide

for themselves. An evaluation of the net effect of social security therefore

requires balancing the welfare gain from this type of transfer payment against

the welfare loss caused by the savings distortion. A more complete analysis

would also include the distortion in retirement behavior and in pre—retireinent

labor supply caused by social security taxes and benefits. An evaluation of

the welfare loss of the induced reduction in savings is however a useful

starting place and a natural sequel to the econometric studies of the effect of

social    security on saving.
             The present paper therefore makes the extreme assumption that labor
supply and retirement behavior are exogenously fixed and that each dollar of
"social   security wealth't (i.e., the present value of social security benefits)

reduces private saving by one dollar. The latter assumption implies that social

security does not raise consumption during retirement. I want to emphasize that

this extreme assumption is not meant to represent reality1 but to focus the ana-

lysis on the welfare cost of reduced capital accumulation.

            The reduction in private saving could, of course, be offset or more

than offset by accumulating a large trust fund with which to pay future social

security benefits (Samuelson, 1975; Feldstein 1977). In practice, however, the

social security program in the United States and in most other industrial

countries is unfunded. I shall therefore assume that there is no funding and no

change    in other public capital accumulation to offset the reduction in private
capital   accumulation.

            The first section of this paper develops the analytic framework for

evaluating the net loss of reduced private saving. The second section presents

some illustrative numerical calculations. Then in the third section I examine

the effect of a finite horizon on the value of the welfare loss. There is a

brief concluding section that indicates the direction for future research on

this subject.



   1Empirical estimates of the extent to which social security benefits reduce
private saving vary but most of the estimates indicate that each dollar of
social security wealth reduces private wealth accumulation by between 50 cents
and one dollar.

1.   The Analytic Framework

           In a very important paper, Paul Samuelson (1958) extended the life

cycle theory by developing an explicit overlapping generations model and used

this framework to analyze the effect of social security. Since Samuelson

assumed an economy without a productive capital stock or other durable store of

value, social security could play the welfare—increasing role of permitting

individuals to finance retirement consumption.

          The absence of a capital stock is of course critical to Samuelson's

conclusion that an unfunded social security program increases the welfare of all

generations. In a model with a productive capital stock, the substitution of

unfunded social security for private saving raises the welfare of all genera-

tions only if the economy is initially producing with an inefficiently large

capital stock.1 When this is not true, the excess of the productivity of real

capital over the implicit rate of return earned on the taxes paid to an unfunded

social security program causes a loss to each generation of workers who par-

ticipate in the program. Since members of the initial generation of retirees

receive benefits without paying any taxes, their welfare is unambiguously

increased. The net welfare effect depends on balancing the gain to the first

generation of retirees against the loss to all future generations.

          The framework for the present analysis will be an extended version of

Samuelson's overlapping generations model. Each individual lives for two

periods, working in the first period and retiring in the   second period. All

   1Cass and Yaari (1967) show that if the economy's rate of growth exceeds its
marginal product of capital, the substitution of' social security for private
saving raises welfare in all generations. This is an application of the fami-
liar proposition that welfare can be unambiguously improved by reducing capital
intensity in an economy whose capital intensity is greater than the golden rule
level. Samuelson's economy without productive capital is a special case of the
growth rate exceeding the productivity of capital.
                                                --
individuals      are alike and earn a wage wt if ttiey work in period t. The labor

force grows at rate n per period and the real wage rate grows at rate g per

period. The basic difference from the Saimielson model is that savings may be

invested in real capital. Th avoid the complexities of an endogenous and time—

varying rate of return, I shall assume that the marginal product of capital

remains constant at rate p per period.

              The number of aged retirees in each period (At) is equal to the number

of workers in the previous period (Lti). Since the population grows at rate n

per period, Lt =      (l+n)Lt_i   and Lt =   (l+n)Ai.
              Consider a social security program that imposes a tax at rate 0 on

wage income in each period. The workers in period t pay a tax of

Tt = 0t1- and, because of the unfunded pay—as—you--go nature of the program,
receive benefits when they retire equal to the taxes paid by the next

generation: Bt+1 = bt+1A.t+i = Owt+1Lt+i where          bt is the benefit per retiree in
period   t.



              The implicit rate of return, 1, that individuals earn on their tax

"contributions" is defined by the ratio of the benefits that they receive to the

                                                                     =   (l+g)(l+n)   = 1+1
taxes that they previously paid: Rt+1/Tt =           Owt+iLt+i/tLt
since    l+n =          and l+g =    wt+l/wt.    The implicit rate of return is therefore

equal to the rate of growth of real income.

              If the workers of generation t had instead saved and invested Tt,

their savings would have earned the real marginal product of capital, p. If

there were no tax on capital income, the individual savers would also receive a

return of p. it even if a capital income tax reduces the net return to indivi-

dual savers, the nation as a whole earns the entire pretax rate of return. I
                                            —)—


shall   assume that the benefits of that tax revenue accrues to the generation of

savers who own the capital.1 Thus instead of receiving Bt+l = (1+Y)Tt in return

for their social security taxes, they would receive (1+p)Tt. The social security

program therefore reduces the retirement income of the workers of period t by

(P—y)Tt =   (P_I) OwtLt.
            The present value of this loss as of the first period of these worker's

lives is (p.-y) OwtLt/(1+d) where d is the rate at which individuals discount

income between the two periods. If there is no capital income tax, individuals

equate their rate of time preference to the marginal product of capital: d = P.

A capital income tax at rate t lowers the annual marginal rate of return to

individual savers2 from r to (1—t)r and therefore makes the net rate of return

per period N = Li+(i—t)r]Y—i where y is the number of years in a generation.
I shall define an effective "period tax rate" T by the identity N = (1—T)p.

Thus, with a capital income tax, the equality of the individuals' time preference

and the net rate of return implies d = (l—T)p.

            In the next generation the corresponding loss is

(p_y)ew+1L+1/(l+d) = (p_I) e(l+g)w(l+n)L/(1+d) = (1+Y)(p-Y)OwtLt/(l+d).

Thus the generational loss grows at rate I.       If the program is introduced with

workers of generation t0 and continues forever,3 the present value of the

infinite stream of' losses is given by


                           -
                               t=o   (l+d)(l+6)



   1This may be in the form of direct benefits for retirees, a lower tax rate on
capital income, or an equivalent reduction in the labor income tax. If instead
the revenue is used to reduce the tax burden on the next generation of workers,
the analysis would differ only slightly from the one that follows in the text.
   2     .    .
    A capital income tax reduces the marginal return to individual savers even
though the total return to savers as a whole is p.

   3The   possibility of a finite termination date is discussed in section 3.

where 6 is the appropriate discount rate for the intergenerational aggregation

of consumption.1 Since wtLt =          (l+g)t   w0(1+n)t L0 =     (1+y)t   w0L0,

If   the discount rate exceeds the growth rate (6> y), the sum                converges   and the

present value of the losses to all generations of workers is:


                Z        r 1+6                   00

                         L
           Although Z measures the loss to all generations of workers who par-
ticipate in the program, it ignores the benefit to the initial generation of

retirees who receive benefits without paying any tax. Their benefits are equal

to the taxes paid by the first generation of workers, Ow-0L0. The present value

net loss to all generations, including the first generation of retirees, is thus


               N =       Z -



                        r 1+6    .
                                                   OwL
                                     6—y            00


           The value of N depends critically on the value of 6, the social

discount rate used for the intergenerational aggregation of consumption. There

are two alternative theories of the appropriate definition of 6. The first

theory equates the social intergenerational discount rate with the private

intrageneration discount rate, i.e., 6 = d.                The rationale for this approach is



        shall return directly to the appropriate value of 5.
that the generations are linked by bequests and that the preferences of the

bequethers are accepted as normatively valid. The alternative theory rejects the

private discount rate as irrelevant for intergenerational comparisons and bases

the social discount rate on the presumed decline in the marginal utility of

income as the level of income grows. If per capita income grows at rate g and

the elasticity of the individual marginal utility function is C, the marginal

rate of substitution of income in successive periods is (l+g)    .   Conventional
assumptions put C between 1 and 3l

          Consider first the implication of equating the social discount rate

and the private discount rate, 6=d. In an econoir with no capital income tax,

the private discount rate should equal the marginal product of capital; thus d=p

and therefore &p. Substituting these values into equation       implies N=O. Thus

there is no net excess burden caused by the reduction in private saving if the

econoxxr has no capital income tax (or other savings distortion) and if the

marginal product of capital is used to discount future income reductions.2 In

this unique case, the benefit to the initial generations of retirees who receive

the unrequited transfer when the program is established just balances the inf i—

nite stream of losses sustained by all future generations.

          If we continue to accept the equality of the social discount rate and

the private discount rate but recognize the existence of a capital income tax,

the welfare neutrality of the savings reduction disappears. With &=d=(l—t)p,



   'Irving Fisher (1892) and Ignar Frisch (1932) purported to estimate C by
imposing certain separability assumptions and obtained c=2.

         conclusion also rests on the assmpt ion that changes in the rate of
saving do not alter the marginal product of capital on the marginal rate of
substitution.

It   is clear that N is an increasing function of the tax rate, the marginal pro-

duct of capital and the economy's rate of growth. A positive capital income tax

rate implies that the marginal product of capital exceeds the rate of time pre-

ference and therefore that any change in the rate of saving has a first—order

welfare effect.2 The higher the marginal product of capital, the greater the

welfare loss from any reduction in saving. A higher rate of growth of the eco—

nomy means that the annual losses grow at a faster rate and therefore have a

greater present value.

                The net value presented in equation 14 can also be interpreted as the

net gain of terminating an existing program in                    year. Terminating the

program implies that the retirees in the terminal period receive no benefits

while the workers in that period and all future periods pay no tax and receive

no benefits. If the terminating period is defined to be tO, the net present

value (as of t=o) of the welfare gain of termination is measured by N with Ow0L0

the amount of tax that would be collected in that period if the program were not

terminated.



   1Recall that T       is     defined so that (l—T)p is the after—tax rate of return per
period.

         is analogous to the fact that any tax change has a first—order welfare
effect if there is a pre—existing distortionary tax.

                 Although the absolute present value
                                                     measure is directly relevant for
  assessing the desirability of starting
                                                         or terminating a social security program,
  it is also interesting to
                                     restate this loss as a proportion of the present value

  of all taxes.' Since taxes at t=O
                                                    are Ow0L0 and benefits grow at rate I per
  period, the present value of taxes, discounting at rate 6, is

 The ratio of the net loss to this
                                   present value of taxes is therefore



 (7)                      N    =   ('+6)(y)         —
                                                        (l+d)(&.y)
                          v                (1+d)(i+6)(&.y)


 In    the important special case where the private and social discount
                                                                        rates are
 equal (6=d), this implies

                                   1+6


          It is interesting to compare this to the netloss
                                                            to a typical worker
per dollar of his tax payments. Since he
                                          receives a return of I on his social
security taxes rather than the total return of p,2 his loss
                                                            is p.-y. This loss
is a reduction in his retirement
                                 income. Its present value as of the time that
he 'works and pays      tax   is therfore (P—y)/(i+p).           Since y>   6   is   a necessary

condition for the convergence of N and V, it is clear that N/v is smaller than

the steady state loss per dollar of tax revenue. This difference reflects the

fact that N/V incorporates the extra benefit to the initial generation of

retirees.

              When the social and private discount rates are equal to the net—of—tax

rate of return, (l—T)p, equation 7 can be written



                       N   =
                       v       l+(l—T)p


The net loss per present value dollar of social security taxes is equal to the

tax revenue that is lost per dollar of foregone savings, discounted at the

individual's net of tax return.


2. Some Illustrative Calculations

              Some numerical calculations will indicate plausible iragnitudes for the

welfare losses derived in the previous section. To obtain values for y, p and

T,   I will   use the experience of the U.S. economy in the three decades beginning

in 1950. I will assume that the length of a "period" or generation is 30 years.

              During the thirty years beginning in 1950, the average annual rate of

growth of real personal income was 0.037, implying that y =        (1.037)30 —   i   =


1.97.    The average pretax marginal product of capital in the U.S. nonfinancial

corporate sector was 0.ll1 (Feldstein, Poterba and Dicks—Mireaux, 1981),

implying that p =     (i.iiI4)°   — 1 = 21.5O.    Finally, during the same period these

corporations, their shareholders and their creditors paid approxin.te1y 68 per-

cent of their pretax capital income in taxes to federal, state and local govern-

ments (Feldstein, Poterba and Dicks—Mireaux, 1981). Since this average tax rate
                                                —11—



 may   exceed    the corresponding marginal tax rate, I will make the conservative

 assumption that t=0.50. With r=0.l14 and t=0.50, (1—t)p = 11÷(1_t)r]3O — 1 =               .28.
 Since p =      2.50,   I   = 0.825.

                Substituting these values into equation 5 (based on the assumption
 that the social and private discount rates are equal to each other and to the

 net—of—tax return, (1—t)p) implies that the net loss is N=8.75 Oi0L0. The net

 welfare loss caused by the reduction in saving induced by the social security

 program is equal to 8.75 times the initial size of the program, i.e., 8.75 times

the unrequited benefits received by the first generation of retirees.

Alternatively, this calculation implies that reducing the existing social

security program by a fraction f, and thereby denying benefits of fOWTLT to the

"current" generation of retirees, would          generate      a net welfare gain of 8.75 0T1-r•
             These losses and potential gains can be restated
                                                              as a proportion of
the present value of social security taxes by using equation 9. With Ip =
                                                                          20.21
and (l—i)p = 14.28, equation 9 implies N/V =
                                                       3.83;   the net loss is 3.83 times

the present value of the taxes. This surprisingly high ratio reflects the fact

that the real pretax rate of return on the foregone investment is high relative

to the discount rate and that this difference
                                                         compounds substantially over the
30 year length of each period.1

            Although these calculations are only illustrative, the parameter

assumptions are not unrealistic and the derived values of N and N/V do indicate

the substantial size of the potential welfare loss caused by the reduced savings

that   result   from starting or continuing an unfunded social security pension

program.




   1Reducing the length of the period to 20 years lowers N and N/V but their
values remain high: N = 5.86        and N/V = 1.86.

nishing marginal utility of consumption to calculate 6, we obtain 6 = (1+g)

where g is the rate of growth of per capita real income and C                     is   the elasticity

of the marginal utility schedule. During the three decades after 1950, the

annual rate of growth of real per capita income was                  0.023.     Thus l+g =

(1.023)30 = 1.98.        It is clear from equation 2 that convergence to a finite

value of N requires 6 > y =           1.97 and therefore C > 1.6.
             With C    = 2,   6 =   2.92.   Equation          implies that with 6 =     2.92 and d =

(l—T)p   =   1.28, N =    i6.6i     Ow0L0, substantially greater than the value of N

obtained by assuming that 6 = (1—t)p.               Similarly N/V =      I.21   is larger than it

was with the higher discount rate. To reduce N to 8.75 O0L0, 6 must be equal
                                                    C
to (1—T)p =    1.28.     Since (1+ 6) =     (1+g)       the    elasticity of the marginal utility

function must be at least 2.45.

             Thus, both approaches to the selection of a discount rate indicate a

very substantial value for the net welfare loss.


3. Finite Horizons

             The derivations and calculations in section 1 and 2 all assume that

the social security program goes on forever. There is never a "last generation"

that pays a social security tax but receives no benefit. In Samuelson's words,

social security is "a Ponzi game that works,"1 at least in the sense that it

continues to command political support even if each new generation incurs a

 welfare    loss.'

              It is important, however, to consider whether the qualitative results

 and the general order of magnitude of the losses depends critically on the

 assumption of an infinite horizon. As I noted earlier, terminating the program

 in year T involves a net gain that is exactly equal in magnitude to the net

 loss implied by starting a program in that period, say

 in the special case in which d = 6            (l—T)p. The present value of this ter-.

mination gain (as of time t=o) must be offset against the loss calculated for

the infinite horizon.

             The present value of           as of time zero is G      (1_6)_T GT
                                                                                   (l+(l_T)p)_TGT.
Thus:

                                  [l+TP]
Since y <    (l—t)p,   the offsetting gain is of decreasing relative importance as T

increases.




   11f there vers only two generations, the workers would vote to terminate
                                                                            the
program and, because they are more numerous, would prevail. In reality, there
is a distribution of ages and some of those who are not yet retired would be net
losers if the program were terminated. The redistribution in the actual program
further complicates the voting equilibrium. See Feldsteiri and Pellechio (l9T9b)
for a brief discussion of these issues and some empirical estimates.

            If,   for example, the program is terminated after 3 generations (90

years), G = o.18N.     The present value loss of a program that lasts three genera-

tions is thus 82 percent of the loss of an infinite program.

            For plausible parameter values, the assumption of an infinite horizon

does not alter the qualitative or general quantitative conclusions.


14•   Conclusion

            The analysis and calculations presented in this paper make it clear

that a social security program that replaces an equal amount of private saving

can impose a welfare loss whose present value is many times the size of the

existing generation's benefit. The actual adverse welfare effect depends, of

course, on the extent to which social security benefits do depress private

saving as well as on the effect of social security programs on labor supply,

retirement behavior, etc. Moreover, because some individuals behave myopically,

the social security program not only reduces saving by less than the full amount

of taxes but also provides income to those who might otherwise have too little

in old age.

            Evaluating the magnitude of the welfare loss caused by reduced saving

is therefore just one part of the evaluation of the welfare effect of social

security. A similar analysis is required to evaluate the effects of changes in

retirement and labor supply. These adverse consequences must then be balanced

against the favorable effect of providing retirement income for those who lacked

the foresight to provide for themselves. The net welfare effect of variations

from the current level of benefits could then be assessed as a basis for

deciding the appropriateness of changing the existing program.
