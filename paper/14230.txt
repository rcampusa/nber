                                              ABSTRACT

This paper uses data from NBER surveys of over 40,000 employees in hundreds of facilities in 14
firms and from employees on the 2002 and 2006 General Social Surveys to explore how shared compensation
affects turnover, absenteeism, loyalty, worker effort, and other outcomes affecting workplace performance.
  The empirical analysis shows that shared capitalism has beneficial effects on all outcomes save for
absenteeism and that it has its strongest effects on turnover, loyalty, and worker effort when it is combined
with: a) high-performance work policies (employee involvement, training, and job security), b) low
levels of supervision, and c) fixed wages that are at or above market level. Most workers report that
cash incentives, stock options, ESOP stock, and ESPP participation motivate them to work harder.
 The interaction of the effects of shared capitalism with other corporate policies suggests that the various
shared capitalist and other policies may operate through a latent variable, "corporate culture".

         Cooperation aims to increase the margin from which the increment of gain is to be drawn. It
         makes industry more productive; it gives the employer somewhat more, and to the laborer
         much more than they now receive…All the workmen with their employers constitute
         collectively an exceptionally good entrepreneur... The survival of full cooperation in the
         long rivalry of systems depends on its power to excel other systems …If in the comparison
         with other systems, it is shown that it ought to survive, it will do so, and that regardless of
         initial failures -- John Bates Clark, The Philosophy of Wealth 1886



         One hundred twenty years ago John Bates Clark, one of the founders of the American

Economic Association, developer of marginal productivity theory, and the person for whom the

prestigious Bates Clark Award is named, developed a vision of shared capitalism – the cooperative

plan -- and laid out a key test for this form of capitalist enterprise, its ability to survive in

competition with other forms. In his 1886 book The Philosophy of Wealth, Clark said that he

wanted “to take the workman permanently out of the position in which his gain is his employer’s

loss” through profit sharing and stock ownership by the workers. His solution to workers’ risk

aversion and lack of credit and personal funds to invest in capital was that the firm would pay profit

shares to workers in the form of stock, which would make profit sharing a gradual vehicle for

employee ownership.1 Clark underlined the need for skilled management and committed investors

and stressed that access to new capital investment was critical to the success of such enterprises. He

also noted the need for a cooperative management culture in these corporations. Clark’s views

suggest that forms of shared capitalism that combine profit sharing and employee ownership

without personal worker financing in a cooperative corporate setting would positively affect

workplace performance and company success. Clark’s interest in shared capitalism was mirrored in

  Adam Smith (1776 ) credited the incentive of shared capitalism with improved economic performance for the French
Metayers or sharecroppers where the owner of the land and the sharecropper divided the produce equally after capital
investments: “Such tenants, being freemen, are capable of acquiring property, and having a certain proportion of the
produce of the land, they have a plain interest that the whole produce should be as great as possible, in order that their
own proportion may be so” (quoted in Laffont and Martimort 2002: 10). He stressed that sharecroppers would not risk
their own capital to improve the proprietor’s land without offering any resolution to this problem.

the first volume of the American Economic Review, which contained extensive articles on

cooperative economic relations in New England and Minneapolis in issues 4 and 5.2

        This paper analyzes the relationship of various forms of shared capitalist compensation to

six workplace outcomes—turnover, absenteeism, perceived effort of co-workers, loyalty to the firm,

willingness to work hard, and frequency of worker suggestions to improve productivity—from the

perspective of the “John Bates Clark vision” of shared capitalism. We also examine employee

responses to questions about their response to shared capitalist incentives. Our analysis uses two

datasets: one from the 2002 and 2006 General Social Surveys (GSS), which cover 2430 persons in

for-profit firms from a nationally representative sample; and an NBER sponsored firm based survey

of 41,206 employees at 320 worksites in 14 companies for whom profit/gain sharing, a wide variety

of employee ownership vehicles, and broad-based stock options are a key part of their compensation

systems. We conducted the NBER survey over the 2001-2006 period, adding firms as they agreed

to participate. We began our survey by selecting companies that varied in size, industry, and type

of shared capitalism program, but our final sample is non-representative. Many firms refused our

requests to run the survey; and we lost two large firms, which had agreed to participate, when other

firms bought them and decided against conducting the planned survey. Once a firm agreed to have

our research group administer the survey, we either ran the survey on all or a random sample of

employees, with an average response rate of 53% across the 14 companies. Thus, the survey can be

  Issue 4 included a 100-page article “Cooperation in a Western City” by Albert Shaw about such enterprises in
Minneapolis, which examined profit sharing by Charles Pillsbury in his mills and included an interview with Pillsbury.
Issue 5 had a 129 page article “Cooperation in the Northeast” by Edward Bemis on Massachusetts companies. In the
1880s a group of doctoral students was assembled at Johns Hopkins University who divided up the United States into
regions and studied forms of profit sharing and employee ownership in these regions. The University published these
studies as a book (Adams 1888). John Bates Clark worked closely with this group of researchers, several of whose
articles appeared in the new journal of the American Economic Association. Clark's views were similar to those of
another prominent 19th century economist, John Stuart Mill, who said “The form of association which if mankind
continues to improve must be expected in the end to predominate is not that which can exist between a capitalist as
chief and workpeople without a voice in the management but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of
equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, and working under managers elected
and removable by themselves” (John Stuart Mill, Principles of Political Economy, Books III-V and Appendices [1848],
in J.M. Robson, ed., Collective Works of John Stuart Mill, Vol. 3. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1965, p. 775).

viewed as a random sample of workers from a non-random sample of firms. The survey included

core questions common across all companies, and some questions of special interest or relevance to

that company. Six company surveys were conducted entirely by web, seven company surveys were

done on paper, and one survey was done using both the web and paper surveys. A total of 41,206

respondents provided usable surveys. Appendix A describes the variables used in this analysis.



                                  The Clark vision in modern eyes

       Modern theorists concerned with shared capitalism highlight the potential of corporate

culture in helping unify ownership and control with minimal agency costs and enabling shared

capitalism to fulfill its potential. In his 2000 address to the Industrial Relations Research

Association, Joseph Stiglitz defined the goal of shared capitalism as “to increase each worker’s

involvement in and identification with the firm so that there will be some unification of agent and

principal and a resulting tendency for higher effort… (in the belief that) a system of high

involvement, high rewards, and high levels of skill and information, integrated with a corporate

strategy that relies on front-line employees’ ideas and creativity, is capable of impressive

improvements in organizational performance.” Analogously, in their book on incentives, Laffont

and Martimort focus on “how the owners of firms succeed in aligning the objectives of various

members, such as workers, supervisors, and managers, with profit maximization” (2002, p. 2).

They emphasize that the decentralized nature of information and the cluster of transactions between

the principal and the agent require an interaction of cultural norms and incentives to obtain the best

economic institutions. Presaging our analyses of the importance of worker co-monitoring in shared

capitalism (Freeman, Kruse, Blasi, 2007), they stress that the multitude of tasks performed by the

worker means that “a worker is not only involved in productive tasks but also must sometimes



                                                   3
monitor his peers.” In both cases, as well as in the analyses of others3, the implication is that shared

capitalist compensation needs an appropriate corporate culture to reduce free rider and moral hazard

problems and that low intensity incentives that substitute for wages and increase worker risk would

have problematic effects on performance.

        The other issue that theorists have identified as critical to the working of shared capitalism is

the allocation of the risk of ownership and the problem of credit barriers keeping workers from

becoming real capitalists. Echoing back to Adam Smith, Stiglitz (1974) argued that the key issue in

the use of sharecropping, as opposed to having employees renting capital, is the balance between its

incentive effects and risk-sharing features. Though the rental system “has greater incentive effects,

it forces the worker to bear all the risks, and although the wage system allows the landlord, if he is

risk neutral, to absorb all the risk, it may force heavy supervision costs on him.” He asserted that

the end of sharecropping was best explained by the development of capital markets that allow

diversification of risk, capital intensity in production, and a faster rate of technological change.

These analyses highlight the other distinct aspect of the John Bates Clark solution to the problem:

share ownership arising from profit sharing as a way to allow workers to obtain ownership without

taking on risk beyond their means. Akerlof’s concept of a gift exchange carries this line of thinking

a step further, with the exchange of ownership or profit-sharing above fixed pay for reciprocating

effort serving as the risk-reducing mechanism for shared capitalism. In the U.S. today, ESOPs,

stock options, and company stock matches for contributions to retirement savings plans offer

workers ways to get equity in their company without buying it with their savings (though there is a

small but growing number of cases in which employees use 401(k) assets to create ESOPs).

  Barnard (1938) defined incentives as involving a package of monetary and non-monetary items saying material
incentives were too weak unless enforced by other incentives. Even the bete noir of employee empowerment, Frederick
Taylor, argued for paying fair wages along with generous performance-based pay and careful training to keep workers
committed to maximum effort, although consultants selling Taylorism dropped this component (Kanigel 1997).

        Existing research on shared capitalism has generally found better workplace performance for

firms with profit sharing and employee ownership.4 However, many of these studies were based on

large administrative datasets and shed little light on the mechanisms through which shared

capitalism functioned “inside the black box.” Here we use new data to go inside the black box.



                                       Measures of Shared Capitalism

        Were Clark to return to the U.S. in 2006, the first question he would ask about shared

capitalism is the extent to which enterprises based on financial sharing and decision-making are

found in the market—their “survival … in comparison with other systems.” The GSS provide the

best evidence for answering this question. The overall prevalence of shared capitalist compensation

is presented in Table A-1, with fuller presentation in the companion paper by Kruse, Blasi, and Park

(2008). For our purposes here the most important result is that 45% of the for-profit private sector

employees in the GSS sample report participating in some kind of shared capitalism program (36%

in profit sharing, 25% in gainsharing, 19% in employee ownership, and 11% in stock options),

which gives us good variation for examining the relation of these programs to worker outcomes.

The prevalence is of course higher in the NBER sample, since these firms were selected on the basis

of having these programs.

        As a first step in assessing the relation of shared capitalism to employee outcomes, we

constructed a thermometer-style index of shared capitalism, which assigns points based on coverage

by shared capitalism programs and the size of the financial stakes. This index is described in



4
  Evidence from over 60 studies indicates a positive association on average between shared capitalism programs and
company performance, but with substantial dispersion in results (see Doucouliagos, 1995, Kruse and Blasi, 1997, and
Kruse, 2002, for reviews; also see Black and Lynch, 2001, Boning, Ichniowski, and Shaw, 2001, Core and Guay, 2001,
Ittner et al., 2001, Lee, 2003, Robinson and Wilson, 2006, and Sesil et al., 2002). The average estimated increase in
productivity associated with employee ownership and profit sharing is about 4.5%, and is maintained when using
pre/post comparisons and attempts to control for selection bias.

Appendix B. We also present results breaking out the different forms of shared capitalism types

and intensities using the NBER data.



                                        Workplace Outcomes

       We measure six workplace outcomes: 1) turnover (looking for another job vs. staying with

the company), 2) absenteeism, 3) workers’ perception of the discretionary effort of co-workers; 4)

worker loyalty to the firm, 5) workers’ willingness to work hard for the firm 6) the frequency of

suggestions to improve efficiency. These outcomes are related to each other—e.g. looking for

another job predicts increased absenteeism, as does reduced willingness to provide discretionary

effort to the company, and lower loyalty. Reduced willingness to provide discretionary effort to the

company and lower loyalty relate to looking harder for another job. Increased absenteeism, looking

hard for another job, and lower loyalty are linked to less discretionary effort. Because there are

large literatures studying most of these outcomes separately, we decided against forming an index

of these variables and instead look at each by itself. The summary statistics in Appendix A show

variation in the measures among respondents in our surveys in the form of large standard

deviations. The absenteeism variable is the only one with a “peculiar” distribution since many

people report zero absences while there is a long tail of persons absent for different time periods.

       We use basic multivariate statistics to assess the link between shared capitalist compensation

and the outcomes. We estimate OLS models of the impact of shared capitalist compensation on the

workplace outcomes where appropriate, and ordered probit models when the outcomes have several

values with a natural ordering (e.g., "not at all true, not very true, somewhat true, and very true").

Because more than half of the values of absenteeism are zero, we use the tobit model to analyze that

outcome. We run the regressions with the same independent variables for the national and NBER

data sets and then probe our results in the NBER data set by adding measures of other human

                                                   6
resource policies that may independently affect the workplace outcomes, such as participation in an

employee involvement team, training, and job security.

       We interpret the results from the two surveys differently in light of the difference in their

sample designs. Since the GSS is a nationally representative survey, it will have few if any workers

in the same firm, so that it provides information on workers across firms. The variation in shared

capitalist incentives and behavior reflects differences in firm policies. By contrast, the NBER

survey covers a representative sample of workers in a non-representative sample of firms. To deal

with the non-representative firm problem, we include company fixed effects in most calculations.

This focuses on the effect of variation in shared capitalist incentives on attitudes and behavior

within companies. However, we analyze some ESOP variables across companies as well as within

companies because ERISA rules require virtually all workers in a firm to be covered, so that the

cross-firm variation in the data is potentially more informative than within-firm variation, which

may reflect peculiarities between groups of workers within the firm.

       Table 1 summarizes the empirical results of regression analyses of the relationship between

the shared capitalism index and outcomes in our data sets. It shows that in both the NBER and GSS

surveys, the likelihood of searching for another job is lower the higher is the shared capitalism

index. When the controls in the national survey and in the NBER survey are the same, the

coefficient on the index is the same. Addition of measures of other human resource policies reduces

the coefficient in the shared capitalism variable in the NBER data, but it still remains significant

(line 2b). In addition, the NBER asked workers if they would turn down a higher-paying job to stay

with their firm. The shared capitalist index raises the likelihood that workers would do so (line 3),

which implies that they value these policies either for the additional income they are likely to bring

or for the stake they give workers in the company.



                                                   7
       The NBER survey asked workers how many days they were absent in the previous six

months – a question that was not included on the GSS. Here, the estimate in line 4 of Table 1

shows that the shared capitalism index alone—without looking at the impact of the firm’s corporate

culture—raises absences. This is the only outcome variable that is adversely associated with the

index. Why? Reviewing absenteeism and turnover research, Johns (2002) emphasizes that

persistent absenteeism signals a break in the psychological contract of trust and deeper problems in

the corporate culture. This perspective sees absenteeism as part of a withdrawal continuum

involving lateness-absenteeism-lack of loyalty-intended turnover-ultimate withdrawal of

membership in the firm. Thus, the finding that shared capitalism has a different effect on

absenteeism than on prospective turnover, loyalty and other factors runs against the basic analysis

of absenteeism. Studies of the relation between unionism, which also reduces turnover, however,

often also find a positive association with absences. It may be that a greater sense of job security

underlies both results. Another possibility is that absenteeism is a form of free riding that avoids

co-worker scrutiny and criticism. Yet another possibility, which we explore later, is that the result

is related to interactions with other firm policies and corporate culture.

       Both the GSS and the NBER surveys ask workers how hard they believe their co-workers

work. The estimates show that perceptions of co-worker effort are significantly positively related to

the shared capitalism index, though the NBER result is no longer significant after controlling for

several human resource policies (lines 5, 7). The NBER survey has two other measures that reflect

perceptions of the extent to which co-workers are committed to the firm: the extent to which co-

workers have enough interest in company issues to get involved in the firm, and whether co-

workers generally encourage each other to make extra efforts. Again, the results show that shared

capitalist programs raise the likelihood that workers report positively on these outcomes, both

before and after controlling for human resource policies (lines 8-9).

                                                   8
        Interpretation of the positive coefficients of a worker's receipt of shared capitalist

compensation in predicting their perceptions of the work attitudes of co-workers is not, however,

simple in the presence of the company dummy variables. The regressions reflect how workers paid

with shared capitalist compensation view their fellow workers (with a glow) rather than how shared

capitalism affects the workplace. Since we have many establishments or facilities within firms,

they could also be telling us that facilities with greater shared capitalist compensation have workers

who are willing to do more for the firm. One way to deal with this issue is to eliminate the

company dummies from the regressions. This strengthens the estimated effects. Another way to

deal with the problem is to aggregate the data by facilities so that we relate the average shared

capitalism index at a workplace to the average perception of co-worker effort within that worksite.

This asks the question most relevant to our analysis: whether respondents perceive greater effort in

worksites with more shared capitalism, rather than whether workers with greater personal shared

capitalist compensation perceive greater effort in their fellow workers. Figures 1 to 3 display the

scatter plot of observations for the site averages and the regression line for them. They show that

the shared capitalist index at a worksite is positively associated with workers saying that co-workers

give greater effort to the firm.

        Finally, we turn from perceptions of how co-workers behave to questions in which workers

report on their own attitudes and behavior and relate these responses to the workers’ own shared

capitalist compensation. Both surveys asked questions relating to worker loyalty. The GSS asked if

workers were proud to be working for their employer: shared capitalism raises positive responses on

this item (line 6). The NBER asked about loyalty to the firm: this measure is positively related to

the shared capitalism index before and after controlling for high-performance policies in the NBER

survey (line 10). The NBER survey also asked how willing workers would be to work harder to

help the company, and the frequency with which they make suggestions about improving the

                                                    9
workplace. The higher the shared capitalist index the more likely are workers to say that they

themselves would work hard for the firm (line 11), and the more likely are workers to say that they

make many suggestions (line 12).

Particular programs

       The NBER survey contains sufficiently detailed information and a large enough sample to

allow us to disaggregate the shared capitalist index into its component parts to see which policies or

programs contribute more/less to the estimated effects in Table 1. Table 2 gives the results of these

calculations for variables in which the individual reports on their own behavior or attitudes. Column

1 shows that the likelihood of not searching for a new job is strongly related to profit sharing and

gain sharing eligibility, employee ownership, and having a larger stock option grant last year, and

that workers who receive individual bonuses are also less likely to look for another job.

       Column 2 shows that the aberrant finding that shared capitalism increases absenteeism is

higher among those who are eligible for profit sharing and who hold stock options. This goes

against the findings of lower absenteeism in profit sharing companies in UK and French firms

(Wilson and Peel, 1991; Brown et al., 1999) and with a study of U.S. firms that found employee

ownership alone did not affect absenteeism (Hammer, Landau, and Stern 1981) though it is

consistent with the finding by Brown et al. that absenteeism increased slightly when profit sharing

was introduced after employee ownership. The regression finding that absenteeism is lower among

those who are eligible for individual bonuses lends some support to the possibility that higher

absenteeism among those paid by group incentives reflects free rider behavior.

       The next two columns show that loyalty and willingness to work hard are positively related

to the size of the profit-sharing and gain sharing bonuses, and to holding employer stock purchased

through a 401(k) plan or on the open market (cols. 3-4). Loyalty is also positively linked to

receiving a stock option grant last year, while willingness to work hard is linked to the size of one's

                                                   10
ESOP stake. The frequency with which workers report making suggestions is, by contrast,

significantly related only to employee ownership (col. 5).

       Overall, the forms of shared capitalism that appear to have the strongest effects on outcomes

are profit sharing and employee ownership.

       The bottom panels in Table 2 disaggregate the ownership variable and report coefficients

when the company dummy is removed from the regression. The results for the disaggregation of

the shared capitalism index show that the largest ownership impacts come with 401k plans and

when workers buy shares on the open market. The sizable 401k effect compared to the ESOP

ownership effect may reflect the greater individual ownership of the 401k (although the company

stock match for which workers do not pay with their savings in 401k plans is comparable to an

ESOP) while the impact of buying shares on the open market may reflect individual’s positive

assessment of the future of the firm. Finally, the regressions that exclude company dummies to pick

up differences in shared capitalist compensation across companies as well as across facilities and

individuals within facilities find stronger ESOP effects than the regressions that include the

company dummy variables.

ComplementaritiesÆ Corporate Culture?

       A critical issue in analysing a distinct organizational or institutional form is whether its

impact on behavior and outcomes operates independently of other practices or policies or whether

its impact depends interactively on them. The thrust of theoretical analysis of shared capitalist

compensation, from Clark to the present, is that changing the monetary incentives by itself is

unlikely to occur or work well independent of other policies. Firms that introduce profit sharing or

employee ownership must give workers the authority to make decisions that increase performance




                                                  11
to change their behavior in ways that raise output and profits.5 Research on “high performance

work systems” have found that they work best as a package of complementary policies regarding

recruitment, training/information, performance management/sharing, and work redesign, and so on.6

Based on these considerations and evidence we expect that shared capitalist incentives should also

work better when combined with other firm policies.

         To examine the interaction or complementarity of shared capitalist compensation with high-

performance workplace policies, we constructed an index of high-performance work policies that

gives one point each for being in an employee involvement team, receiving formal training in the

past 12 months, and having high job security.7 We interacted this index with the shared capitalism

index in regressions for the likelihood of searching for a new job, absenteeism, loyalty to the firm,

willingness to work harder, and frequency of suggestions. In addition, we examined the interaction

between shared capitalism and a measure of employer supervision of employees. Evidence

presented in our companion paper (Kruse, Freeman, and Blasi, 2008) shows that workers covered

by more shared capitalist policies are less closely supervised than others, suggesting that shared

capitalism substitutes for supervision in motivating workers. Combining shared capitalism with

  Research often finds an interaction between participation and ownership on output but most data sets contain little
information on the mechanisms for this. The General Accounting Office study (1987), which matched survey data with
records on company finances, found an interaction between employee participation in management and employee
ownership on productivity, as did the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health study (Rosen, Klein, and Young 1986)
and its follow up study (Rosen and Quarry 1987). Freeman and Dube (2002) found that employee involvement had a
larger impact on indicators of worker productivity, job satisfaction, and attitudes toward the firm than did participation
in financial rewards, but that the highest outcomes occurred when firms combined pay for company/group performance,
ownership stake in the firm, and employee involvement committees. Analyzing UK establishments, Conyon and
Freeman (2001) found that the companies that adopted profit sharing, employee ownership, and broad stock option
schemes had higher productivity and more information and decision sharing practices. Studies of ESOPs and other
forms of employee ownership generally find a positive relationship between ownership and performance (Levine 1995:
81) that is strongest with worker participation.

and Becker, Huselid, and Ulrich 2001. Cappelli and Neumark found that high performance work practices such as self-
directed work teams only significantly predicted increased productivity when combined with profit/gain sharing
(1999:34).

   We experimented with indices that also included measures of information sharing, job rotation, and rigorous
selection and obtained similar results. We focus on the index based on employee involvement, training, and job
security since the sample sizes are smaller for job rotation and rigorous selection, and the grade of the company on
sharing information reflects an employee evaluation of the policy's success rather than the existence of a policy.

close supervision may reduce the effect of shared capitalism by sending a mixed message to

employees: "We want you to work harder and be more committed to the company because of your

(profit share/employer stock/stock options), but we're still going to keep a close eye on you."

       Finally, we also examine whether the extent to which shared capitalism substitutes for fixed

wages may also be an important determinant of its effects. We expect that employees will react

better to shared capitalist compensation when it is a gift-exchange add-on to existing compensation,

rather than a substitute for which they sacrifice certain income flows for greater risk in

compensation. While we do not have measures of alternative wages available to employees, the

NBER survey asked how employees’ fixed wages compare to market levels, from which we

constructed a dummy variable indicating that the worker feels s/he is paid at or above market levels.

We interact this variable with the shared capitalist index as well.

       Table 3 summarizes the results of these calculations. The regression coefficients on the

interaction terms show that other firm policies measured by the high performance practice index

affects the impact of shared capitalism—representing possible complementarities on most outcome

variables—and that supervision intensity and wage relative to market wage also have some

interactive effects. Column 1 shows that the positive effect of shared capitalism on not searching

for a new job exists only for those who are covered by the high performance policies and reveals a

strong negative interaction of shared capitalism with close supervision. While column 2 finds no

significant interactions for any of the three new variables with the shared capitalism index in

affecting absenteeism, the high performance indicator reduces absences while close supervision

raises them. With these variables and interactions the strong positive relation between shared

capitalism and absenteeism is weakened and no longer significantly different from zero, suggesting

that the effect found in Table 1 may be masking that of high performance, supervision, and pay



                                                   13
relative to market. Columns 3 and 4 show substantial shared capitalism interactions on loyalty and

willingness to work hard. These outcomes are enhanced when shared capitalism is combined with

high performance policies and fixed pay at or above the market level, and are hurt when shared

capitalism is combined with close supervision.

         Finally, column 5 shows that shared capitalism has a negative interaction with high

performance policies and a positive link to supervision in affecting frequency of suggestions. The

positive effect of shared capitalist policies among workers who are not covered by high

performance policies might reflect the fact that those in high performance work places already have

the means and motivation to provide suggestions. One interpretation of the positive interaction with

supervision is that shared capitalism provides motivation to closely supervised workers to try to

make changes in their work environment to relieve supervisory intensity. Whether these or other

explanations account for the observed interactions, the important point is that the interactions are

substantial, implying that analyses that treat shared capitalist compensation as a single innovation

will invariably miss some of the ways in which it works and the conditions for it to work

successfully.

         As a graphic demonstration of the importance of the interactions, we show in Figure 4 the

relation between workers’ likelihood of looking to leave the firm with the shared capitalist index

contingent on different values of the interacting variables.8 Each line shows how the potential

leaving variable changes with shared capitalism given the specified interaction. What is striking is

the fanning out of the lines. Shared capitalism increases likely turnover when workers are very

closely supervised and are not covered by any high performance policies (top line)—this may


8
  To enable a more straightforward interpretation, Figure 1 is based not on an ordered probit but on a linear probability
regression with the same independent variables as in col. 1 of Table 5 , with the dummy dependent variable taking the
value of 1 if a worker said s/he is very likely to look for a new job with another organization or is already looking, and 0
otherwise. This regression closely reflected the pattern of results in Table 5.

                                                            14
reflect workers becoming cynical and wanting to leave when they learn that management espouses a

shared capitalism philosophy but still treats them like ordinary employees. In contrast, shared

capitalism decreases likely turnover when workers have average or low levels of supervision, or are

covered by high performance policies. The strongest effects of shared capitalism are when it is

combined with high performance policies and low levels of supervision, causing likely turnover to

be cut from 12.8% to 2.4% as the shared capitalism index goes from 0 to 10 (bottom line of Figure

4). The average results shown in Table 2 reflect these diverse effects, weighted by the proportion of

workers in the various interactive categories.

        Finally, we view the interactions shown in Table 3 and Figure 4 as suggesting that the

concept of “corporate culture” may provide a useful way to understand the relation between shared

capitalism and the workplace outcomes. Analysts sometimes use the corporate culture term loosely

without any operational measurement/definition that risks making it a catch-all phrase to describe

residuals or puzzles. But when interaction or complementarity effects are demonstrably important,

it seems natural to think that some underlying latent variable – corporate culture – may more

usefully describe reality than analyses of separate interacting variables.

Worker views

        As an alternative way to assess the impacts of shared capitalist incentives and of their

interrelation with other aspects of corporate policy/culture, we asked workers the following

hypothetical question on the NBER survey:

       To what extent would each of the following affect your motivation to improve the business
success of the company? 9
       You receive a cash incentive
       The company grants you stock options
       You receive some stock in the company ESOP
       You can buy some company shares in the ESPP

9
  Employees were asked the stock options, ESOP, and ESPP questions only if the company provided these programs,
and were asked the open market purchase questions only if they worked in a public company.

                                                       15
       You buy some company shares in the open market

       The upper panel of Table 4 reports the responses to these questions. Close to three-fourths

of workers said that their motivation would be improved to a "great" or "very great" extent by

receiving a cash incentive (78%) or stock options (77%), while about two-thirds of workers said the

same about receiving ESOP stock (69%) or buying shares through an ESPP (63%), and less than

one-third said this about buying company stock on the open market (30%). This pattern fits well in

an analysis of risk in employee response to shared capitalism, with the cash incentive and options

being the least risky forms of compensation, and buying shares in the open market placing the

workers’ capital at greatest risk. The small response to buying shares in the open market conflicts,

however, with the significant impacts of that activity on some of the outcome variables in Table 2.

       To see whether worker responses to the hypothetical are influenced by other aspects of

company policy/practice, we estimated ordered probit regressions using the variables found to have

important interactions with the shared capitalism index in Table 3. The results of these regressions,

summarized at the bottom of Table 4, show positive effects of the high performance policy index in

four of the five questions (cols. 2-5), supporting the notion of a major complementarity between

high performance policies and shared capitalist compensation. Three of the regressions show

positive effects of having fixed pay at or above market levels (cols. 2, 4, and 5), likewise supporting

a complementarity, but only one regression shows a negative effect of closer supervision (col. 2).

The regression that shows a different pattern from all others is the one assessing the effects of

receiving a cash incentive (col. 1). In this case, close supervision and perceiving one's pay as below

market raises its impact. The positive supervision interaction may be because workers believe that

they are more likely to receive the incentive if their supervisor pays close attention to their effort.

The stronger effect among those with below-market pay may reflect the view that cash incentives

can help make up the perceived pay gap more quickly than by receiving company stock. Finally,

                                                    16
we note that the ease of seeing how well co-workers work positively affects each response,

supporting the idea that an environment of worker co-monitoring is a component in the

effectiveness of shared capitalism plans.

Additional issues

        Our analysis cannot rule out some potentially different interpretations of the results. The

first is that the findings reflect the selectivity of workers into shared capitalist enterprises rather than

or in addition to their response to the way those firms operate. Selectivity could affect the analyses

of workers in shared capitalist firms versus others in the GSS survey and would limit generalizing

the NBER results to workers who do not work in such firms. Even within a firm, moreover, there

may be something special about those who choose greater participation in shared capitalism—for

instance, by buying stock through an ESPP or 401(k)—or who management places in positions with

more shared capitalist incentives. To get some notion of the possible effects of worker selectivity

on our results, we examined the sensitivity of the results to two possible factors that might be

associated with self-selection of workers into shared capitalism: a measure of self-rated risk

aversion, and family wealth. Neither of these variables made noticeable changes in the relationship

of the shared capitalism index either alone or with interactions to the outcomes in Tables 2 and 3.

        A second problem relates to the selectivity of firms into our NBER sample and the

endogeneity of the decision to offer shared capitalist compensation in both the NBER and GSS

samples. Since our NBER results hold constant firm policies and characteristics by comparing

workers with greater and lesser shared capitalism in the same firm, we doubt that they are seriously

affected by selectivity of firms, but there is the selectivity or endogeneity of the specific policies

that the firms have chosen, which still makes causal interpretations of the type we have offered open

to criticism. In addition, because the NBER sample does not include firms with no shared capitalist



                                                    17
arrangements and is based on firms’ willingness to participate, we cannot rule out serious selectivity

problems along the firm dimension that might interact with other factors.

       Even substantial selectivity among workers or firms, however, does not gainsay the

importance of shared capitalist compensation, for it is presumably the interaction between shared

capitalist incentives and mode of operating and worker characteristics that underlies the selectivity

of workers, and the interaction between other firm policies and their choice of shared capitalist

compensation that underlies the selectivity of firms. What selectivity does is weaken our ability to

infer what might happen if additional firms adopted shared capitalist arrangements from the

successes of existing firms with those practices.



                                             Conclusion

       The principal finding of this paper is that shared capitalism affects workplace performance.

The robustness of the finding is increased by the fact that the results from the NBER sample are

broadly similar to the results from the nationally-representative GSS. Shared capitalism is linked to

lower turnover and greater loyalty and willingness to work hard, particularly when combined with

high-performance policies, low levels of supervision, and fixed pay at or above market levels.

Workplaces where workers average more shared capitalist compensation report greater employee

effort along several dimensions. The only outcome with which shared capitalist compensation is

adversely related is absenteeism, but this result largely disappears when controlling for interactions

with high performance policies and closeness of supervision.

       Looking at particular programs, the strongest effects of shared capitalism are for profit

sharing and gain sharing. The largely positive results are corroborated by worker views: most

workers report that cash incentives, stock options, ESOP stock, and ESPP participation motivate

them to work harder. The less risky forms of shared capitalist programs– profit sharing, gain

                                                    18
sharing, stock options, and ESOPs – have greater effects than the riskier programs in line with

concerns about workers being averse to risking their own capital. (For a closer look at the role of

objective and subjective risk in shared capitalism program, see the companion paper by Blasi,

Kruse, and Markowitz, 2008.)

       Finally, we find important interactions between shared capitalist programs and other aspects

of company policies that affect workplace performance. High performance policies are positively

linked to good workplace outcomes, and are driven by certain types of shared capitalism. This

evidence, combined with our companion paper that finds that shared capitalism increases worker

monitoring (Freeman, Kruse, and Blasi 2008), challenges the critique that the motivations of the

average worker interfere with the introduction of basic shared capitalism principles. The interaction

of the effects of shared capitalism with other corporate policies suggests that the various shared

capitalist and other policies may operate through a latent variable, “corporate culture.” Practically

speaking, the most important implication of this paper is that shared capitalism and high

performance policies appear to work together, with greater impacts when they are combined than

when they are used separately.

constructed a thermometer-style index of shared capitalism. This index assigns one point each

when the worker was covered by any of the shared capitalist forms of compensation about which

the survey asked, with additional points for recent bonuses or grants, and for large bonuses or stock

holdings. For questions with a continuous numeric answer, we gave the item a value of 1 if the

respondent had a value greater than the median value. Because there is no natural ordering of

shared capitalist systems in the sense that a firm first introduces profit-sharing, then adds employee

ownership, and then gain-sharing, the index is not a Guttman scale. It is a simple summated rating

(Bartholomew et al, 2002; Bartholomew, 1996), using dichotomous scoring.

       In the GSS, there are eight variables in the index: profit sharing eligibility, gain sharing

eligibility, owning any company stock, holding stock options, receiving a profit sharing bonus in the

past year, receiving a gain sharing bonus in the past year, having an above-median profit- and gain

sharing bonus as a percent of pay, and having an above-median company stock holding as a percent

of pay. In the NBER data there are ten variables in the index: all of the above items plus one point

each for receiving a stock option grant in the past year, and having above-median stock option

holdings (including unvested options if they could be exercised today) as a percent of pay.

       Indices of this style have both advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, they provide

a quick and ready measure of the extent of shared capitalist arrangements that makes it easy to

compare results across surveys and to summarize the broad thrust of findings. Since our firm

surveys covered only firms with some shared capitalist arrangements, the index allows us to

differentiate workers with differing degrees of incentive to their firm’s programs. On the negative

side, the index treats different programs the same even though they potentially have different effects

on particular outcomes. It postulates a single scale with equal weights rather than using factor

                                                  24
analysis or other statistical modelling to obtain weights for given factors. To deal with these

problems, in Table 2 we also estimated the relationship of the outcomes to the different types of

shared capitalism, introduced as dummy or continuous variables in regressions.10 By comparing the

results using the shared capitalism index to the results using the disaggregated measures, we can

assess the loss of information due to the amalgamation of the measures into a single index.

         Figure B1 shows the distribution of our shared capitalism index in the GSS. This survey

estimates that 40% of US workers have some form of shared capitalist program. This estimate is

close to that obtained by Dube and Freeman in the WRPS. The mean score of the index is 1.48 – a

figure greatly affected by the substantial number of workers without shared capitalism systems.

Conditional on having a program, most workers report scores in the range of 2 to 5, with 6%

reporting scores of 6 or greater. Figure B2 gives the distribution of the index in the NBER survey

data. It also shows a non-normal distribution, with the most common scores as 2 to 4 but a sizeable

number of workers scoring 7 or above. There is sufficient variation in the index to differentiate the

extent of the shared capitalist “treatment” on workers.

  There are statistical techniques to deal with the formation of latent variable indices from questions of the sort that we
are amalgamating into a single summated rating. See Bartholomew et al. (2002) and Spector (1992).
