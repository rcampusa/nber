Do Management Interventions Last? Evidence from India

                                         ABSTRACT

Beginning in 2008, we ran a randomized controlled trial that changed management practices in a
set of Indian weaving firms (Bloom et al. 2013). In 2017 we revisited the plants and found three
main results. First, while about half of the management practices adopted in the original
experimental plants had been dropped, there was still a large and significant gap in practices
between the treatment and control plants. Likewise, there remained a significant performance gap
between treatment and control plants, suggesting lasting impacts of effective management
interventions. Second, while few management practices had demonstrably spread across the firms
in the study, many had spread within firms, from the experimental plants to the non-experimental
plants, suggesting limited spillovers between firms but large spillovers within firms. Third,
managerial turnover and the lack of Director time were two of the most cited reasons for the drop
in management practices in experimental plants, highlighting the importance of key employees.

                                      I. INTRODUCTION

After an early recognition of management as a driver of differences in firm performance (e.g.
Walker, 1887 and Marshall, 1887), economists are again paying increasing attention to the role
of management in firm and economy-wide performance (Roberts, 2018). Whereas the size and
profitability of the management consulting industry is often cited as a revealed preference
measure of the importance of management, recent academic work has also established a credible
causal link between changes in management practices and performance in medium and large
firms (Bloom et al, 2013; Bruhn et al, 2017). The longer-term persistence of management
improvements caused by consulting interventions, however, remains an open question. The
received wisdom at a leading global management consulting firm when two of the authors were
employed there was that such innovations lasted approximately three years.

Competing views of management offer differing predictions about the persistence of consulting-
induced improvements in management practices. One view, best exemplified by the “Toyota
way” (Liker, 2004) views management improvements as launching a continuous cycle of
improvement, as systems put in place for measuring, monitoring, and improving operations and
quality enable constant improvement. A related idea is that management practices are
complementary to one another, so that the costs of adding new practices fall as others are put in
place. For example, in our context of cotton weaving, scientific management of inventory levels
will only be possible once the firm has put in place systems to record all yarn transactions and to
regularly monitor stock levels. Some evidence for the lasting impacts of changes in management
practices on firm performance comes from Giorcelli (2017), who finds that Italian firms that
received Marshall Plan sponsored management training trips to the U.S. in the 1950s
experienced significantly better performance over the next fifteen years (relative to firms that
applied for, but did not receive, the training).

A countervailing view argues that maintaining good management is difficult, with many of the
companies extolled in business books as paragons of good management subsequently failing
(The Economist, 2009, Kiechel, 2012). This may be even harder when changes are introduced
externally, with the Boston Consulting Group reporting that two-thirds of transformation
initiatives ultimately fail (Sirkin et al, 2005). One reason may be that these practices are
inappropriate and will be abandoned as firms learn that they are not suitable in their setting. Both

                                                                                                       2
Karlan et al. (2015) and Higuchi et al. (2016) find that light consulting engagements in smaller
firms than the ones we studied led to firms' gradually discarding practices over the subsequent
three years.

This paper examines the persistence of management practices adopted after an extensive
consultant-supported intervention that we undertook in a set of multi-plant Indian textile weaving
firms from 2008 to 2010 (see Bloom et al, 2013 for a more detailed description). The
intervention took the form of a randomized controlled trial. Firms were randomly allocated into
treatment and control groups, and the intervention was done at the plant level within each firm.
Both treatment and control plants were given recommendations for improving management
practices in several areas, and the treatment plants received additional consulting help in
implementing the recommendations. The intervention led to a substantial uptake of the
recommended practices in the treatment plants and a modest one in the control plants, with
corresponding improvements in various measures of performance.

We stopped observing the firms in 2011, but we wondered --- as did many in our audiences when
we presented our work --- about whether these changes would last. As a result, we returned to
the study firms in 2017 with the same consulting team and collected data on management
practices and basic firm performance. We found that both treatment and control experimental
plants had in fact dropped some practices, though fewer than we and the consultants had
forecast. Since the control plants also dropped practices, the treatment effect on practices is
constant over time, at 20 percentage points. Meanwhile, the plants in the treatment firms that had
not been part of the experiment (treatment firms typically had multiple plants) had adopted many
of the recommendations, so their package of current practices were very close to those of the
treatment plants.

We were also able to collect information on the reasons for the dropping of management
practices, as well as some basic performance indicators. We find that practices are more likely to
be dropped when the plant manager changes, when the directors (the CEO and CFO) are busier,
and when the practice is one that is not commonly used in many other firms. The first two
reasons highlight the importance of key employees within the firm for driving management




                                                                                                     3
practices,1 while the latter emphasizes the importance of beliefs. Despite their dropping some
practices, we find treated firms show lasting improvements in worker productivity, which is 35%
higher than in the control group after 8 years, that treated firms have gone on to use more
consulting services of their own accord, and that they have supplemented the operational
management practices introduced by the consultants with better marketing practices.

This paper is related to several literatures, including the drivers of firm and national productivity
(see, e.g., Syverson 2011), on management randomized control trials (see, for example,
Anderson et al. 2017; McKenzie and Woodruff 2014) and the large literature on the importance
of management for firm performance (e.g. Osterman 1994, Huselid 1995, Ichniowski et al. 1997,
Capelli and Neumark 2001, Braguinsky et al. 2015, and Fryer 2017). Section II of the paper
discusses the original consulting experiment, section III the follow-up and section IV offers
concluding remarks.




                 II. THE 2008-2010 CONSULTING EXPERIMENT

II.A. The Experimental Design
To investigate the impact of management on firm productivity we initiated a randomized
controlled intervention on management practices in a set of large textile companies near Mumbai
in 2008. This experiment involved 28 plants across 17 firms in the woven cotton fabric industry.
These firms had been in operation for 20 years on average, and all were family-owned and
managed. They produced fabric for the domestic market (although a few also exported). Table 1
reports summary statistics for the textile manufacturing parts of these firms (a few of the firms
had other businesses in textile processing, retail and real estate). On average the study firms had
about 270 employees, assets of $8.5 million and annual sales of $7.5 million. Compared to US
manufacturing firms, these firms would be in the top 1% by employment and the top 4% by




1      This links to the literature on management and CEOs – for example, Bertrand and Schoar
(2003), Bennesden et al. (2007), Lazear et al. (2016) and Bandiera et al. (2017).
                                                                                                        4
sales, and compared to Indian manufacturing firms they are in the top 1% by both measures
(Hsieh and Klenow, 2010). Hence, these are large manufacturing firms.2
       These firms are complex organizations, with a median of 2 plants per firm (in addition to
a head office in Mumbai) and 4 reporting levels from the shop-floor to the managing director.
The managing director was the largest shareholder in all firms, and all directors belonged to the
same family. Two firms were publicly listed on the Mumbai Stock Exchange, although more
than 50% of the equity in each of these was held by the managing family.
    The field experiment aimed to improve management practices in the treatment plants and we
measured the impact of doing so on firm performance. We contracted with a leading
international management consultancy firm to work with the plants as the easiest way to change
plant-level management practices rapidly. The full-time team of (up to) 6 consultants had been
educated at leading Indian business and engineering schools and most of them had prior
experience working with U.S. and European multinationals.
       The intervention ran from August 2008 until August 2010, with data collection
continuing until November 2011. The intervention focused on a set of 38 management practices
that are standard in American, European, and Japanese manufacturing firms and which can be
grouped into five broad areas: factory operations, quality control, inventory control, human-
resources management, and sales and orders management (for details see Appendix Table A1).
Each practice was measured as a binary indicator of the adoption (1) or non-adoption (0) of the
practice. A general pattern at baseline was that plants recorded a variety of information (often on
paper sheets), but had no systems in place to monitor these records or use them in decisions. For
example, 93 percent of the treatment plants recorded quality defects before the intervention, but
only 29 percent monitored them daily, or by the particular sort of defect, and none of them had
any standardized system to analyze and act upon this data.
       The consulting intervention had three phases. The first phase, called the diagnostic phase,
took one month and was given to all treatment and control experimental plants. It involved
evaluating the current management practices of each plant and constructing a performance
database. At the end of the diagnostic phase the consulting firm provided each plant with a




2     Note that most international agencies define large firms as those with more than 250
employees.
                                                                                                      5
detailed analysis of its current management practices and performance and, crucially,
recommendations for change.
       The second phase was a four-month implementation phase given only to the treatment
experimental plants. In this phase, the consulting firm followed up on the diagnostic report to
help introduce as many of the 38 management practices as the plants could be persuaded to
adopt. The consultant assigned to each plant worked with the plant management to put the
procedures into place, fine-tune them, and stabilize them so that employees could readily carry
them out.
       The third phase was a measurement phase, which lasted until November 2011. This
involved collection of performance and management data from all treatment and control plants.
In return for this continuing data, the consultants provided light consulting advice to the
treatment and control plants (primarily to keep them involved).

II.B. The Initial Experimental Results – Management Practices
       The intervention led to increases in the adoption of the 38 management practices in the
treatment plants by an average of 38 percentage points by August 2010 (approximately one year
after the start of the intervention). This adoption rate dropped by 3 percentage points in the
second year of tracking, showing persistence in practices after the consultants had exited the
firms. Not all practices were adopted equally, with firms adopting the practices that
(unsurprisingly) were the easiest to implement and/or had the largest perceived short-run pay-
offs, e.g. the daily quality, inventory and efficiency review meetings. This adoption also occurred
gradually, in large part reflecting the time taken for the consulting firm to gain the confidence of
the firms' directors. Initially many directors were skeptical about the suggested management
changes, and the intervention often started by piloting the easiest changes around quality and
inventory in one part of the factory. Once these started to generate improvements, these changes
were rolled out and the firms then began introducing the more complex improvements around
operations and human resources.
       In contrast, the control plants, which were given only the one-month diagnostic and
corresponding recommendations, increased their adoption of the management practices, but by
only 12 percentage points on average. This is substantially less than the increase in adoption in
the treatment firms, indicating that the four months of the implementation phase were important


                                                                                                       6
in changing management practices. Table 2 Column 2 reflects this and shows a statistically
significant 25 percentage point treatment effect on management practices in 2011. We note that
the change for the control firms is still an increase relative to the rest of the industry around
Mumbai (more than 100 non-project plants), which did not change their management practices
on average between 2008 and 2011.
       Finally, since these are multi-plant firms and the consulting firm worked at the plant
level, the treatment and control firms also had plants that were not part of the intervention, which
we label “non-experimental plants.” For example, if a treatment Firm has three plants A, B and C
and the diagnostic and implementation intervention was performed on plant A this would be a
“Treatment Experimental plant” while plants B and C would be “Treatment Non-Experimental
plants”. Likewise if a control firm had plants D, E and F and the diagnostic intervention was only
performed on plant D, then D would be an “Control Experimental plant” while E and F would be
“Control Non-Experimental plants”. Appendix Table A2 reports the breakdown of the plant
count into these four groups.
       Although the consulting firm did not provide consulting services to the non-experimental
plants, it was still able to collect bi-monthly management data and some basic plant data for
these other plants. The non-experimental plants in the treatment firms saw a substantial increase
in the adoption of management practices. In these 5 plants the adoption rates increased by 17.5
percentage points by August 2010, without any drop back in the second year. This increase
occurred because the executives of the treatment firms copied the new practices from their
experimental plants over to their other (non-experimental) plants. Interestingly, this increase in
adoption rates is similar to the control firms’ 12 percentage point increase, suggesting that the
copying of best practices across plants within firms can be as least as effective at improving
management practices as short (1-month) bursts of external consulting.

II.C. The Initial Experimental Results – Firm Performance
       Treatment firms experienced a significant increase in output of 9.4% relative to the
control firms, which came about both by decreasing quality defects (so that less output was
scrapped); and by undertaking routine maintenance of the looms, collecting and monitoring
breakdown data, and keeping the factory clean, which reduced machine downtime. Total factor
productivity (TFP) increased by 16.6% due to both the increase in output and a reduction in


                                                                                                       7
inputs due to reduced inventory and reduced labor inputs for mending defective fabric. These
improvements were estimated to have increased profits per plant by about $325,000 per year. We
estimate that this represented, on average, a doubling of profitability.



    III. THE 2017 FOLLOW UP

III.A. The Follow-up Process
    In January 2017, working with the same consulting firm with which we had worked in 2008-
2011, we re-contacted the 17 textile firms from the original study. Fortunately, all 17 firms
agreed to work with the research team again on a follow-up study. This 100% uptake was aided
by a combination of three factors: (A) the positive impact of the intervention in the first wave on
the firms’ management and performance; (B) the stability of the firms, which had maintained the
same address and contact details, and (C) the engagement of the same three consulting company
partners and project manager as the 2008-2011 intervention.3 One complication is that one
single-plant treatment firm was in the midst of closing down after the owner's death. Without any
close male relatives to continue the business, the owner’s wife had decided to sell the business,
which, given its location, meant the business would stop trading and the site would be converted
into residential housing.4
    One weakness of this follow-up wave is that our budget allowed us only two months of the
consultants' time, which was sufficient to collect management data for all production sites and a
basic set of firm performance indicators (e.g. on employment and looms), but not to collect
detailed weekly output data that would allow TFP estimation, because that would have required
extracting data on a firm-by-firm basis from log-books and accounting software. Consequently,
our analysis is confined to management practices and basic performance indicators like
employment or looms/employee, along with an imputed measure of labor productivity.
    This follow-up data collection corresponds to an average period of 9 years since the
implementation phase of the consulting intervention started and 7 years since it ended. It

3       These personal contacts are very important in our context. In fact, we delayed the start of
this project to ensure we could staff the project with the same senior consulting team as the
2008-2011 wave.
4       The firm was over 30 years old, and due to the expansion of Mumbai was now located in
a residential area so the land was more valuable as housing than for production.
                                                                                                      8
therefore enables us to examine the long-term persistence of these large changes in management
practices.

III.B. Results on Management Practices
In Figure 1 we plot the management scores over time after re-visiting the plants in January 2017
evaluated on the same 38-management practice scoring grid as in the prior experiment. We find
substantial persistence of the management intervention, which we summarize below with four
main results.
    Treatment Experimental Plants: First, the management scores in the treatment plants fell
from 0.60 at the end of the last wave to 0.46 eight years later. This drop of 0.14 points in the
management score reverses 40% of the original 0.35 increase (noting these firms started pre-
treatment with an average management score of 0.25) over an eight-year period. This fall in the
management practice score is equivalent to about an annual depreciation rate of 6% in the
original increase in management practices.
    Control Experimental Plants: Second, the control plants also saw a drop in their
management scores, falling by 0.08 points from 0.40 at the end of the last wave to 0.32. This is
smaller in absolute terms compared to the fall in scores in the treatment plants, but the increase
in management practices in the control plants was only 0.12 points (from an original score of
0.28), so that the drop in practice scores is 66% of the intervention gain, implying about a 13%
depreciation rate of the original management increase.
    Together this indicates that, even eight years after the initial intervention the treatment firms
still had higher management practices. Table 2 reports the results from running the Ancova
specification for plants (i) at time (t):
Managementi,t = a + b1*Treatmenti*Year=2011 + b2*Treatmenti*Year=2017 + c*Managementi,2008 +ei,t
Indeed, we see that the long-run treatment effect in 2017 of 19.7 percentage points is similar in
magnitude to the short-run effect in 2011 (20.6 percentage points), and we cannot reject equality
of these treatment effects over time (p=0.802). These effects are individually statistically
significant both using conventional (large-sample normality-based) inference as well as
permutation procedures with exact finite sample size (the corresponding p-values are also
reported in Table 2). Thus, the intervention generated persistent impacts on the treatment plants.
Moreover, the greater percentage depreciation of the improvements in the control plants (66%)
versus the treatment plants (40%) suggests that small improvements in management may be less
                                                                                                        9
stable than large improvements. One possible reason which we discuss further below is that
bundles of management practices are complementary, so that adopting only parts of them may be
less stable than adopting all of them. Of course, given the small sample sizes in this experiment
this could also reflect sampling noise - something that should be remembered when evaluating
all our results from this experiment.
    Non-experimental plants: Third, the non-experimental plants in the treatment firms showed
no net change, with their management practice adoption rates remaining constant at 0.47. Indeed,
by 2017 their management scores were very similar overall to the treatment experimental plants
(indeed slightly higher, although not significantly so). Similarly, in the control firms the non-
experimental plants also converged with the experimental plants (again slightly higher but not
significantly). This suggests (as we discuss further below) that the practice improvements in the
experimental plants spilled over to the non-experimental plants during the eight years after the
experiment.
    Expectations on durability of the intervention: Finally, before we re-contacted the firms in
December 2016, each member of the consulting team from the original intervention and the
academic team provided predictions for the management scores we expected to find on revisiting
the firms in 2017.5
    These expectations were informed by the contrasting views of management improvements
noted in the introduction: under the “Toyota way” of continuous improvement we would expect
the management practices to not only persist, but to continue to improve in treatment plants so
that the gap with the control plants would widen; whereas under the “inappropriate technology”
view, we would expect many practices to be dropped and the treatment group to converge back
to the control group. The average values of the estimates of the seven team members are shown
for the treatment experimental, treatment non-experimental, control experimental plants and
control non-experimental plants with the symbols TE, TN, CE and CN respectively on the
graph.6 These predicted values are all below the actual outcomes, indicating that the project team




5      Other examples of getting experts to provide ex ante predictions of the results of an
experiment can be found in Hirschleifer et al. (2016), Groh et al. (2016) and Dellavigna and
Pope (2017).
6      The predictions of the individual consultant and academic team members were made
independently – Bloom estimated first and then the other team members individually e-mailed
                                                                                                     10
expected steeper declines in management practices relative to what actually occurred, particular
for the non-experimental plants. While some of the practices were dropped, the majority of the
interventions remained in place eight years later and the gap with the control group remained
steady. The results therefore lie between these two extreme views of constant improvement and
of no long-run impact.
    To delve further into the management changes, we also analyzed the 38 individual practices
as highlighted in Figure 2, which plots the average score for the experimental plants in the
treatment firms on each practice on the X-axis against the average scores for the non-
experimental plants (in the same firms) on the Y-axis, for the years 2008 (pre-intervention), 2011
(post-intervention) and 2017 (long-run follow-up). We observe that initially the experimental
and non-experimental plants in the treatment firms had similar practice scores, with a correlation
of 0.91. After the intervention, the scores for the experimental plants improved considerably,
leading to an eastward shift in the points and a drop in the correlation to 0.81 (top-right figure).
Finally, in the bottom left figure we see the experimental plants and non-experimental plants
again have very similar scores (correlation of 0.91), with a reversion of the scores towards the
45-degree line.
    Figure 3 complements this by showing the long-difference of management practices in the
experimental and non-experimental plants (in the treatment firms) between 2008 and 2017 (left-
panel) and 2011-2017 (right panel). What this highlights is, first, that between 2008 and 2017
both sets of plants adopted similar bundles of management practices. But, secondly, looking at
2011-2017 we see the timing of these practice adoptions were not the same. The experimental
plants adopted most of these practices between 2008-2011, so that from 2011 to 2017 they
mostly had negative practice changes. The non-experimental plants, in contrast, were still
heavily adopting a number of practices post 2011, so they show a balanced mix of drops and
additions post 2011.
    So, in summary, Figures 1 to 3 paint a picture of the treatment (and to a lesser extent the
control) experimental plants adopting a slew of management practices during the initial
intervention phase in 2008-2010, so by 2011 they have substantially higher management scores.
These scores subsequently subside as some practices are dropped. The non-experimental plants


him their predicted scores. The average predicted scores were not particularly different across the
two groups (hence we present them averaged together).
                                                                                                       11
adopted fewer practices in 2008-2010 but continued to adopt practices, and by 2017 had
comparable scores with the experimental plants. Thus, by 2017 the management practice
improvements appear to have equalized over across plants within treatment firms.


III.C. What Drives Changes in Management Practices
    We next explore the proximate causes for the adoption or non-adoption of management
practices on a practice-by-practice basis in Table 3 using directors' and plant managers' stated
reasons for adding or dropping practices. In the “Treatment experimental” column we report the
percentage of practices added (top panel) and dropped (bottom panel). In the second, third and
fourth panels we report similar figures for the “Treatment non-experimental”, “Control
Experimental” and “Control Non-experimental”, while reporting all plants in the final column. A
few results are worth noting.
    First, we see that, while a significant fraction of practices remains unchanged from 2011,
there is notable churn in management practices across all plants. In particular, 4.1% of practices
have been added and 12.4% of practices dropped since the end of the experiment. We are
reasonably confident that these are accurately measured, derived as they are from detailed
interviews with firm directors and plant managers. Second, in the non-experimental plants in the
treatment firms, spillovers from other plants (in the same firm) is the single largest reason for
practice adoption and accounts for 4.2% of improvements (out of a total improvement rate of
6.9%). In the control firms, spillovers from other firms outside the experimental group7 were the
most important driver of management improvements, driving 2.2% on average of the practice
upgrades (out of a total of 2.6%). These two figures highlight the importance of within and
across firm spillovers in improving management practices over the long run.
    Third, in the experimental plants (in the treatment firms) the major reason for dropping
practices was the introduction of a new plant manager (9.9% out of a total of 16.7%, so well over
a half). The plant manager was evidently a critical part of the management improvement in the
intervention plants, and if he left the firm then many of the practice improvements subsequently




7      Qualitatively these improvements appear to be from copying other firms in the industry,
outside of those in our experimental sample. We did not come across cases of the control firms
saying they had learned from the treated firms.
                                                                                                     12
collapsed.8 Another major factor across all the plants was director time – overall 3.6% of
practices were dropped when directors had to reduce the time they spent managing the plant,
often because of other business commitments (e.g. finance, marketing, or other businesses like
retail or real-estate). This highlights the importance of CEO time for firm management,
consistent with the work of Bandiera et al. (2017). Finally, we see that 4.2% of practices were
dropped because of “perceived negative benefits,” which means the firms decided the practices
were actually not worth adopting and decided to drop them.
    Table 4 analyzes the drivers of the changes in management practices by looking at each
practice-by-plant cell between 2011 and 2017 in a regression format. Hence, we examine the
change in each practice (-1, 0 or 1) for each plant between 2011 and 2017 (for plants present in
both years). In column (1) we see the constant term of -0.083 indicates that, on average across
plants (experimental and non-experimental plants in treatment and control firms) and practices,
the average practice dropped by 8.3% over this period. In column (2) we control for
experimental plant status and see this accounts for all the drop, highlighting that management
practices scores were roughly constant after 2011 in the treatment non-experimental plants. In
column (3) we instead add a treatment dummy and find this is completely insignificant – as can
be seen from Figure 1 on average treatment firms did not change (treatment experimental plants
dropped their management score and treatment non-experimental plants increased their
management score). In column (4) we control for having a new-manager,9 split this by treatment
and control, and see for treatment plants a large significant negative effect (which is driven by
the treatment experimental plants) with nothing significant for control plants. This highlights the
role of managerial turnover in the drop in management practices in well managed plants.
Moreover, presumably given that management practices will have only recently improved in the
experimental plants they are particularly susceptible to managerial turnover as good practices
may not have had time to become established norms.


8       See also Fryer (2017) who argues that principal turnover was the primary reason for
declines in school performance improvements following an experimental intervention aimed at
changing school management practices in the United States.
9       We test if having a new plant-manager is differential across treatment and control,
experimental or non-experimental, or correlated with management score in 2011, and find no
significant difference. The point-estimate (standard-errors clustered at the firm-level) are 0.050
(0.234), 0.086 (0.222), 0.654 (0.517) respectively. Of course, we should as always be cautious of
inference given the small sample size.
                                                                                                      13
    In column (5) we focus instead on the correlation of changes in practices with the frequency
of usage across all plants of the practices in 2008, which is valued from 0 to 1, measuring the
share of plants in the pre-experimental period that had adopted this practice. This proxies for
how widespread their adoption was prior to the intervention, and the positive coefficient
indicates that common practices were more likely to be maintained (so uncommon practices
were more likely to be dropped). This highlights that the intervention was more successful at
getting badly managed plants to adopt relatively standard practices – such as basic measurement
systems – than getting plants to adopt more advanced practices like data review meetings and
performance rewards. In column (6) we add these all together and the results look similar,
suggesting these are reasonably independent relationships.
    Finally, in column (7) we include the management score in 2011 to look for mean reversion,
finding a negative but insignificant coefficient. This is confirmed in Figure 4 which shows that
both the initial treatment increase in management practices from 2008 to 2011 and the
subsequent drop are uncorrelated with initial levels of management practices. So, changes in
management practices appear not to be strongly correlated with initial levels, implying that, like
TFP, a highly persistent auto-regressive (or random-walk) form of stochastic evolution. Figure 4
is also useful in showing the distribution of changes in management practices among treated
plants. We see that every single treated experimental plant improved its practices between 2008
and 2011, and every one of these plants subsequently saw a drop in its management practice
score between 2011 and 2017. It is therefore not the case that there were some treated
experimental plants in which a “Toyota way” virtuous cycle of continuous improvement
occurred.
    Finally, we examine the practices that were adopted to see which were the least likely to be
retained, and which were the stickiest. Table A3 reports the number of firms which ever adopted
a practice (i.e. were not using it in 2008, and then used it in at least one of 2011 or 2017), the
number who after adopting were no longer using the practice in 2017, and the proportion of
adopters who dropped the practice. We see two types of practices that were most likely to be
dropped. The first are a set of visual displays and written practices that very few firms were
using before the intervention and then were discarded afterwards. These include displaying
written procedures for warping, drawing, weaving and beam gaiting; displaying standard
operating procedures for quality supervisors; and displaying visual reports of daily efficiency by

                                                                                                     14
loom and weaver. The second set of practices most likely to be dropped were ones that required
daily attention from management: monitoring defects on a daily basis; meeting daily to discuss
quality defects and gradation; and updating visual aids of efficiency on a daily basis. They were
thus costly, and presumably seen as not very valuable.
     In contrast, we see that many of these practices are very sticky. Of our 38 practices, once
adopted, 14 are not dropped by a single plant, and a further 8 are dropped by at most one-quarter
of those adopting. Particularly noticeable among these sticky practices are that those which were
adopted by 10 or more plants and then never dropped. These relate very closely to the most
immediate improvements in quality and inventory levels that we saw from the original
consulting intervention: recording quality defects in a systematic manner (defect-wise); having a
system for monitoring and disposing old stock; and carrying out preventative maintenance.
Finally, we note that not all daily activities were susceptible to being dropped, with those most
closely tied to keeping machines running quite persistent: firms still maintained daily monitoring
of machine downtime and had daily meetings with the production team.


III.D. Results on Long Run Performance
     The other question we investigated when returning to the plants was the long-run
performance impact of the original management interventions. Because of budget limitations and
the reluctance of firms to share financial data, we are not able to undertake a detailed analysis of
TFP.10 We were able, however, to collect basic information on plant size and looms in 2014 and
2017 to supplement our original data for 2008 and 2011. Since there were changes over time in
the number of plants per firm, and the management practices have converged across plants
within firms, we examine performance at the firm level.
     We run Intention to Treat (ITT) panel regressions over four years (2008, 2011, 2014 and
2017) at the firm level with firm and year fixed effects and standard errors clustered at the firm-
level:
         OUTCOMEi,t = aTREATi,t + bt + ci +i,t




10
   In our original study the consulting firm spent many months extracting production data from
firms’ log books and production records, which were used to construct a measure of TFP. We
were not able to extract this data in our longer-term follow-up.
                                                                                                       15
where OUTCOME is one of the key outcome metrics of looms, looms/employee, etc. We report
statistical significance using both conventional inferential procedures based on normal
approximations as well as using permutation tests that have exact finite sample size to allay
sample size concerns.11
     We start in column (1) of Table 5 in the top panel looking at the number of looms (in logs),
which is a basic measure of production capacity. In panel A, we regress this on a dummy for the
year being greater or equal to 2011 - a post-intervention dummy - finding a statistically
insignificant coefficient of -0.032. In panel B, we break down this impact by year, with the point
estimates suggesting a 16.1 percent increase in capacity by 2017, but this is also not statistically
significant.
     In column (2) we examine employment. The point estimates suggest a relatively large drop
in employment, of 23 to 24 percent on average over the full period, and in 2017. However, this
drop is also not statistically significant. There are two reasons why employment may have fallen.
The first is that, at baseline, firms employed many workers fixing quality defects and would need
less of this sort of labor as quality improved. Second, production processes improvements and
fewer breakdowns can enable the same worker to be in charge of more looms.
     Column (3) then combines these measures to focus on our main measure of long-term firm
productivity, which is log looms per employee. This is a classic productivity measure in the
literature (see, for example, Clark 1987 or Braguinsky et al. 2015). One reason is that employees
spend much of their time dealing with malfunctioning looms, so that a higher number of looms
per employee indicates fewer breakdowns and higher rates of production uptime (the time the
loom is producing output rather than being repaired). As such, column 3, panel A, shows that the
average treatment effect over the full post-intervention period was to increase looms per
employee by a statistically significant 26.7%. Panel B suggests this efficiency improvement was
rising over time in that the coefficients are generally larger for 2017 that 2011, with the long-run
impact a statistically significant 51.0 percent increase in this productivity measure. However,
despite the trend of rising coefficients, we cannot reject that this productivity impact is constant
over time.
     We also want to investigate the impact on labor productivity. While we did not collect
information on labor productivity in 2017, we can use the survey data from the initial wave to

11
        We also estimate the regression at the plant level and the results are qualitatively similar.
                                                                                                        16
impute a labor productivity impact. In particular, we use data from a survey we ran in 2011 of
113 firms in the broader textile industry around Mumbai (see details in Appendix A2), in which
we collected data on physical production, employment, and looms. Using this, we show in
Appendix Table A4 and Figure A2 that there is a strong correlation between labor productivity
(output per worker), and looms per worker in both the cross-section and the panel. Taking the
fitted coefficient of 0.734 from column (4) of Table A4, we impute labor productivity from
looms per employee for our experimental firms. The average imputed increase in labor
productivity since 2011 is then 19.0% (exp(0.237*0.734)), and the long-run impact is 35.3%
(exp(0.412*0.734)). These impact figures are remarkably similar to the 15.3% and 31.2% 1-year
and 10-year productivity impacts respectively reported for management interventions in post-war
Italy reported in Table 3 of Giorcelli (2017).12
          In column (4) we asked the plants if they had used any consultants since 2011, and if so
how many days. Many of these firms had, and indeed, as column (5) shows, this use of
consultants was significantly higher in the treatment plants. These consultants were local firms
offering very practical advice on loom-changing practices, fabrics, human resources, or textile
marketing, rather than the types of expensive international-firm management consulting provided
by our intervention. We interpret this as a revealed preference indicator that treatment firms
found the intervention useful and were more willing to pay for commercial consulting in the
future. This was more likely to occur once some time had passed since their previous consulting
experience in our project (panel B).
          Finally, in column (5) we look at the adoption of marketing practices. Marketing
practices were not part of our initial intervention, and so this enables us to examine whether
changes in the specific practices on which our intervention focused are accompanied by broader
management changes. Our measure is a score given for the adoption of seven practices: (1) does
a director regularly attend trade shows; what is the frequency of systematically analyzing
markets, products and prices to assess policies (and make changes wherever necessary) ((2), (3)
and (4)); (5) does the firm have a dedicated brand; (6) does the firm have a sales and marketing
professional; and (7) does the firm use any e-commerce (for sales) and social media (for
advertising). Panel A shows that treatment firms are significantly more likely to adopt these
marketing practices. Discussions with firms highlighted their attempts to be more systematic in

12
     The results are also similar to the 1-year impact of 17% reported in Bloom et al. (2013).
                                                                                                     17
management across a range of activities. So, in this sense, there were cross-practice management
spillovers. Improving production and human-resource management practices led firms to value a
more data-driven, systematic management approach, and hence apply this to other areas like
marketing.



                                    IV. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, the intervention in 2008-2010 did have lasting effects, but not the multiplier effect
of on-going further improvements that the "Toyota Way" theory would have predicted. Indeed, a
significant fraction of the induced improvements were dropped, especially if the plant manager
changed, the directors were short of time, or if the practices were not common before the
intervention. Still, many of the changes persisted, and spread throughout the treatment firms.
There was also some persistence and some drop in the control plants' set of practices. Thus, the
"inappropriate technologies" view does not find much support. Beyond that, the "three-year life"
conventional wisdom described in the introduction is also decisively rejected, at least for the sort
of practices changes our intervention induced.

The treatment firms were still much better managed in 2017 than the control, and key practices
around quality control and inventory management were maintained. Moreover, the treatment
firms used more consulting and did more marketing, suggesting that the more systematic
approach to management introduced by the intervention was spreading to areas the intervention
had not addressed, and we see long-term benefits in terms of a measure of worker productivity.
These lasting impacts highlight the importance of management in explaining persistent
productivity differences amongst firms. Understanding why more firms do not invest in
improving management, and what types of policies can change this, is therefore an important
question for future research.

AI) Plant sample:
Table A2 reports the sample of plants by the four types (treatment and control, experimental and non-
experimental). As noted in the text, one treatment firm exited because of the death of the owner without
any male heirs, which led to the closure of one plant. Two more treatment plants closed because they
were amalgamated into other plants within the same firm – that is, all the looms and equipment were
moved onto one site for production economies of scale. We count these as a plant closure (since that plant
stopped operating) but the output of that plant will still be included at the firm-level. Finally, both
treatment and control firms opened some plants over this period due to demand growth.

AII) Management survey in 2011 and Imputing Labor Productivity:
Between November 2011 and January 2012 we ran an in-person survey of textile firms around Mumbai
with 100 to 1,000 employees, using the Ministry of Commercial Affairs registry of firms plus a
combination of industry lists, internet searches, and referrals as a sample frame (see online Appendix A2
of Bloom et al, 2013 for more sampling details). We identified 172 such firms, and were able to interview
113 of them (17 project firms and 96 non-project firms). The main purpose of this survey was to
benchmark the management practices of our experimental sample against the industry as a whole, and we
found that our project firms did not differ significantly in management practices from the non-project
firms interviewed.

The interview followed a relatively standardized script, asking background questions about the firm (age,
ownership, family involvement, markets etc), followed by questions about plant size (employees, output,
plant numbers, production quantity), management practices, organizational structure, computerization,
prior consulting, prior knowledge of the Stanford-World Bank project (we skipped this question for firms
involved in the experiment), and any potential interest in future consulting waves. The full survey is
available at www.stanford.edu/~nbloom/Template.xlsx.

In this paper, we use the data collected in this survey on the annual physical output of the firm (in meters
or production picks), the number of employees (permanent plus contract), and the number of looms in the
firm. We attempted to collect this for four years 2008-2011, and we were able to collect this information
for all four years for 87 firms, and for two or three years for a further 7 firms. Using this data, we
construct labor productivity as the log of physical production units per worker. This is similar to the sales
per worker term often using to measure labor productivity, but has the advantage of not incorporating
price effects.

Appendix Figure A2 shows the strong correlation (0.561) between labor productivity and looms per
employee. Appendix Table A4 presents the corresponding regression relationship. Column 1 shows the
strong cross-sectional relationship, which persists after adding year fixed effects (column 2), firm fixed
effects (column 3), and both year and firm fixed effects (column 4). Column 4 then shows that annual
changes in looms per employee are associated with changes in labor productivity. This yields the fitted
relationship:

Log production per worker = 0.734 (s.e. 0.114) * Log looms per worker + year effect + firm fixed effect.

We use this fitted relationship to impute labor productivity impacts from our impact on looms per worker
in Table 5.

Notes: Data provided at the plant and/or firm level depending on availability. Number of plants is the total number of textile plants per firm including the non-
experimental plants. Number of experimental plants is the total number of treatment and control plants. Number of firms is the number of treatment and control
firms. Plants per firm reports the total number of other textiles plants per firm. Several of these firms have other businesses – for example retail units and real-
estate arms – which are not included in any of the figures here. Employees per firm reports the number of employees across all the textile production plants, the
corporate headquarters and sales office. Employees per experiment plant reports the number of employees in the experiment plants. Hierarchical levels displays
the number of reporting levels in the experimental plants – for example a firm with workers reporting to foreman, foreman to operations manager, operations
manager to the general manager and general manager to the managing director would have 4 hierarchical levels. BVR Management score is the Bloom and Van
Reenen (2007) management score for the experiment plants. Management adoption rates are the adoption rates of the management practices listed in Table A1
in the experimental plants. Annual sales ($m) and Current assets ($m) are both in 2009 US $million values, exchanged at 50 rupees = 1 US Dollar. Daily meters,
experimental plants reports the daily meters of fabric woven in the experiment plants. Note that about 3.5 meters is required for a full suit with jacket and trousers,
so the mean plant produces enough for about 1600 suits daily. Age of experimental plant (years) reports the age of the plant for the experimental plants.

Notes: Notes: Robust standard errors in () parentheses and permutation test p-values in [] parentheses. Both are clustered at the firm level. *, **, and *** denote
significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels respectively on the robust standard errors. Permutation tests report the p-value for testing the null hypothesis that the
treatment had no effect by constructing the permutation distribution of the estimator using 4000 possible permutation of firm-level random assignment. The second
column limits the sample from column 1 to plants that were present in both years with no missing management scores.

Notes: Lists the shares of practice by plant cells in terms of reasons for change between 2011 and 2017 in terms of practices added, dropped or left unchanged.
Calculated as a share of 1,042 practices, which are comprised of the 38 practices across the 28 plants (11 treatment experimental, 9 treatment non-experimental, 6
control experimental and 2 control non-experimental) in operation in both 2011 and 2017, except for the inventory practices which are missing in plants which
hold no inventory because they make to order.

Notes: Data for pre-treatment (2008) and post-treatment (2011, 2014 and 2017) years, except firms for which basic performance data was missing. Sales and
marketing practices is an indicator from 0 to 10 defined as the count of ten 0/1 Sales and Marketing practices like “Attending trade shows”, “Hiring sales and
marketing professionals”, “Analyzing product portfolios”, “Setting up a firm brand”. Regressions clustered at the firm level and standard errors in parentheses. ***
denotes 1%, ** denotes 5%, * denotes 10%. F-test reports p-value of the joint test testing the equality of the treatment effects over all three post-treatment periods.
Permutation tests in [ ] below report the p-value for testing the null hypothesis that the treatment had no effect by constructing the permutation distribution of the
estimator using 4000 possible permutation of firm-level random assignment.
