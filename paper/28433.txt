                                          ABSTRACT

We study a production network where quality choices are interconnected across firms. High-
quality firms are skill intensive and trade more with other high-quality firms. Using data from
Turkish firms, we document strong assortative matching of skills in the production network. A
firm-specific export demand shock from a rich country increases the firm's skill intensity and
shifts the firm toward skill-intensive domestic partners. We develop a quantitative model with
heterogeneous firms, endogenous quality choices, and network formation. An economy-wide
export demand shock of 5 percent induces exporters and non-exporters to upgrade quality, raising
the average wage by 1.2 percent. This effect is about nine times the effect in a special case of the
model with no interconnection of quality choices.

1     Introduction
The space shuttle Challenger exploded because one of its innumerable components, the
O-rings, malfunctioned during launch. Using this as a leading example, Kremer (1993)
studies production processes in which the value of output dramatically decreases if a single
task fails. In his model, just one mistake of an unskilled worker is enough to destroy a
product. Thus, firms that produce complex, higher-quality products hire skilled workers
for all their tasks.
    If we extend this rationale across firm boundaries, a high-quality, skill-intensive firm
sources its inputs from other high-quality firms and sells more to high-quality firms that
value its output. In addition, a firm's decision to upgrade quality depends critically on
the willingness of its trading partners to also upgrade or on its ability to find new higher-
quality partners. This mechanism applies to the quality of products as well as to the
quality of inventory controls, research and development, and internal communications.
Improvements in these areas generally allow for a wider product scope and render the
firm more flexible to respond to shocks. A firm profits from these improvements if its
suppliers also offer scope and flexibility and if its customers value these characteristics.
    We study this interconnection in firms' quality choices theoretically and empirically.
Our data cover all formal Turkish manufacturing firms from 2011 to 2015. We merge
value-added tax (VAT) data with matched employer-employee and customs data. We
observe the value of trade for each buyer-seller pair of firms; exports by firm, product and
destination, and the occupation and wage of each worker in each firm.
    We document a novel strong assortative matching of skills in the network. As an
example, Figure 1 graphs firms' average wage (adjusted for industry-region) against the
average wage of their suppliers.1 A 10 percent increase in a firm's wage is associated with
a 2.5 percent increase in its suppliers' wages. This number is large given that firms have on
average eleven suppliers. This increasing relationship between buyer and supplier wages
may arise from the extensive margin--with high-wage firms matching more with each
other--or from the intensive margin--with high-wage firms spending relatively more on
their high-wage suppliers. A decomposition indicates that the extensive margin accounts
for 59 percent of the relationship and the intensive margin accounts for 41 percent.
    We use shift-share regressions to evaluate firms' responses to shocks and movements
along the schedule in Figure 1. Consider a Turkish firm that in 2011 exported a particular
product category to a high-income country, say Germany. An increase in German imports

     The figure has only manufacturing firms, which are later used in our structural estimation, but an
equally strong pattern holds if we include all sectors. See Table 1, column (4).

Notes: We define the wage as the firm's wage bill divided by the number of workers. The supplier wage
is the average wage across the firm's manufacturing suppliers, weighted by the firm's spending on each
supplier. Both the x- and y-axis variables are demeaned by 4-digit NACE industry and region. The
fitted curve is a local polynomial regression with an Epanechnikov kernel. The shaded area shows the 95
percent confidence intervals. The regression corresponding to this figure is in Table 1, column (2).


of that product category from countries other than Turkey from 2011 to 2015 is associated
with an increase in the Turkish firm's wage and in the average wage of its suppliers and
customers. The new employees, suppliers and customers that the firm adds over the
period, from 2011 to 2015, had on average higher wages in 2011 than the firm's original
employees and partners. Our proposed mechanism combined with evidence from the
literature that high-income countries demand relatively more skill-intensive goods explains
these patterns:2 An increase in the relative demand for high-quality goods increases a
firm's quality and skill intensity. The firm shifts toward skill-intensive trading partners
and may prod its existing partners to upgrade.
    The interconnection in firms' quality choices implies that a shock that is common to
a significant share of firms may have a larger effect than the sum of idiosyncratic, firm-
specific shocks. We develop a model to study these types of shocks. The model is in
the spirit of Kremer (1993), but to allow a quantitative analysis, we base it on Melitz's
(2003) model of heterogeneous firms. We add to Melitz (2003) the assumptions on quality
from Verhoogen (2008) and Kugler and Verhoogen (2011), and an endogenous network
formed through search and matching, similar to models of labor.3 Firms post costly ads to

                                                                               2
search for other firms. More productive firms post more ads and have more customers and
suppliers. A firm's quality determines its production function. We assume that higher-
quality firms are skill intensive, and we allow them to be intensive in high-quality inputs.
When posting ads, firms imperfectly target other firms with similar quality levels.
    We estimate the model for Turkish manufacturing firms using the method of simulated
moments. We focus on manufacturing firms because the shift-share regressions above
apply only to them. The moments describe assortative matching on wages and the joint
distribution of firm revenue, wages, and number of customers and suppliers. Targeted
search in the model captures differences in matching across firms with different wages (the
extensive margin of assortative matching). Only 8 percent of the ads posted by buyers in
the lowest quintile of wages are directed at suppliers in the highest wage quintile and vice-
versa. Differences in marginal productivity capture the spending patterns (the intensive
margin). The marginal product of an input in the top quintile of the quality distribution
is always larger than that of an input in the bottom quintile. But it is 46 percent larger
for the production of output in the top quintile of quality and 10 percent larger for the
production of output in the bottom quintile.
    In the data and in the model, exporters are large and skill intensive and have many
network connections, especially connections to other large, skill-intensive firms. Export
intensity generally increases with exporter wage. This pattern holds in the estimated
model because the relative demand for higher quality is higher abroad. A firm-specific
export demand shock in the model increases the firm's quality and skill intensity. The
responsiveness of firms' quality choices to these idiosyncratic shocks in the model is es-
timated to match the shift-share regressions. In the data and in the model, a 5 percent
increase in export demand increases the firm's wages by 0.21 percent.
    We use a counterfactual to study the general equilibrium effect of an export shock of the
same magnitude, but applied to all exporters instead of individual firms. The probability
that any firm matches with a high-quality firm in the network increases with the shock.
Matching with a high-quality supplier decreases the relative cost of producing high-quality
output, and matching with a high-quality customer increases the demand for high-quality
inputs. This demand effect accounts for about two-thirds of the counterfactual increase
in profit from producing high- relative to low-quality goods, and the cost effect accounts
for one-third. Non-exporting firms not directly impacted by the shock upgrade quality
and increase their wages by 1.0 percent on average. The wages of exporters increase by
1.92 percent, almost an order of magnitude larger than the effect of firm-specific shocks.
    To highlight the importance of assortative matching, we consider a special case of the
model in which all firms equally value the quality of their inputs. The same counterfactual


                                             3
in this special case increases the wages of exporters by 0.23 percent, almost the same as
the 0.21 percent response to the firm-specific shocks. In contrast, manufacturing output
responds similarly in the special case and in the general model. The predicted increase of
about six percent is larger than the prediction in Hulten (1978) but in line with Baqaee
and Farhi (2019a) because the elasticity of substitution between varieties is larger than
one.
    The network literature has focused on Hicks-neutral shocks, while quality in our model
changes the types of material and labor inputs that firms use. We relax Hicks neutrality
through log-supermodular shifters. We follow Teulings (1995) and Costinot and Vogel
(2010) for labor and Fieler et al. (2018) for material inputs, and we apply these functions
anew to search.4 Our novel search-and-matching set up is tractable and yields a closed-
form solution in the special case of the model with only one quality level. We abstract,
however, from the following aspects of the network highlighted in the literature: Dynamics
in Lim (2018) and Huneeus (2018), asymmetries in network centrality in Acemoglu et al.
(2012), and market distortions in Baqaee and Farhi (2019b), Bigio and La'O (2020), Jones
(2011), and Liu (2019). The model features roundabout production and technologies
with constant elasticities of substitution, and each firm has a continuum of suppliers and
customers. Some of these theoretical elements and the study of shocks to international
trade appear in Lim (2018), Dhyne et al. (2018), Bernard et al. (2019a,b), Eaton et al.
(2018), Huneeus (2018), and Lenoir et al. (2019).
    The estimated model is consistent with well-established facts in the quality literature.
Higher-quality production is intensive in skilled labor as in Schott (2004), Verhoogen
(2008), and Khandelwal (2010) and in higher-quality inputs as in Kugler and Verhoogen
(2011), Manova and Zhang (2012), and Bastos et al. (2018). Fieler et al. (2018) combine
these elements to study, as we do, the general equilibrium effect of international trade on
demand for skills and quality. These papers all use data on prices. We complement this
work with direct information on the extent to which skill-intensive firms trade with each
other. Our main finding on assortative matching is akin to the finding in Voigtl¨      ander
(2014) that skill-intensive sectors use intensively inputs from other skill-intensive sectors
in the United States.5
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data sources and facts. We

      The production function in Dingel (2017) aggregates workers with heterogeneous skills in the same
manner that our production function aggregates material inputs with heterogeneous qualities. See also

to economics and international trade.

                                              ander (2014) is that firms are more likely to match with the
suppliers of their suppliers. They interpret this finding in terms of information frictions.

model in Section 4. The estimation procedure is in Section 5. Section 6 reports the esti-
mation results and connects them to the empirical facts from Section 2. In Section 7, we
experiment with counterfactual export shocks. Alternative counterfactual specifications
guide a policy discussion in Section 8. Section 9 concludes.


2     Data and Empirical Facts
2.1    Data Sources
We combine five data sets from Turkey: (1) VAT data on domestic firm-to-firm trade, (2)
data on firms' balance sheets and income statements, (3) the firm registry, (4) customs
data, and (5) linked employer-employee data. These data sets are all maintained by the
Ministry of Industry and Technology. They all use the same firm identifier and cover all
formal firms in Turkey from 2011 through 2015.
    The VAT data report all domestic firm-to-firm transactions whenever the total value
of transactions for a seller-buyer pair exceeds 5,000 Turkish liras (about US$1,800 in 2015)
in a given year. From the balance sheet and income statement data, we use information
on each firm's gross domestic and foreign sales. From the firm registry, we extract the
firm's location (province) and industry. The industry classification is the 4-digit NACE
code, the standard in the European Union. From the customs data, we use information
on annual exports by firm, destination country, and 4-digit Harmonized System (HS)
product code.
    The employer-employee data are collected by the Turkish social security administra-
tion. We observe the quarterly wage of each worker in each firm. We also observe the
worker's occupation (4-digit ISCO classification), age, and gender. The worker identifier
is unique, allowing us to track workers across firms and over time.
    We restrict most of the analysis to the more tradable manufacturing sector. Unless
otherwise noted, facts about the network refer to trade between firms within manufactur-
ing. We drop firms that do not report their balance sheet or income statement. These are
usually very small firms that use a single-entry bookkeeping system. The cross-sectional
facts refer to the year 2015. The final sample has data on 77,418 manufacturing firms
from 2015.
    Section 2.2 describes the assortative matching in the firm-to-firm network. Section 2.3
associates firm-specific trade shocks with systematic changes in firm outcomes, including
wages and network connections. To estimate these trade shocks, we use annual bilateral


                                             5
trade data from BACI, disaggregated at the four-digit HS product code level.6 Section
2.4 describes other salient features of the data. These features are not novel, but they
justify some elements of the model.


2.2     Assortative Matching in the Cross-Section
Kremer's (1993) O-ring theory, when applied to interfirm production chains, yields the
prediction that skill-intensive firms disproportionately buy from and sell goods to other
skill-intensive firms. We use a firm's average wage as a proxy for its skill intensity, under
the assumption that firms observe skills better than we econometricians and that wages
reflect differences in skills. We use other measures of skills for robustness in Section 2.2.1.
    Define wagef as firm f 's total monthly wage bill divided by its number of workers.
Define the wage of firm f 's suppliers as:

                                log wageS
                                        f =           sf log wage                                       (1)
                                                 S
                                                 f



where S  f is the set of suppliers to firm f and sf is the share of supplier  in firm f 's
total spending on inputs.
   Table 1 reports the results from the regression:

                             log wageS
                                     f =  log wagef + Xf + ef                                           (2)

where ef is the residual and Xf are control variables that vary across columns. Columns
(1) through (3) contain only the manufacturing sub-sample. Column (1) has no control
variables. Column (2) includes fixed effects for each industry-province pair. The coefficient
decreases from column (1) because firms match more within province and industry and
some industry-province pairs have higher skill shares. Still, the decrease is small, from
0.294 to 0.259, suggesting that most of the variation across firms occurs within industry-
province. A 10 percent increase in the average buyer wage is associated with a 2.5 percent
increase in the average supplier wage.
    Column (3) controls for the buying firm's employment. Since employment and wages
are correlated, the coefficient on wages decreases. But its magnitude is comparable to
other columns. Column (4) repeats specification (2) with the sample of all firms.7 The
   6
      We aggregate these data from 6- to 4-digit HS codes for two reasons. First, it is less likely for any
single country to have significant market power in a given destination at the 4-digit product level than
at the 6-digit level. Second, the value of trade at the country-product level is excessively volatile at the
6-digit product level.
    7
      We exclude finance, insurance, utilities and public services firms.

coefficient of 0.241 is similar to 0.259 in specification (2).

Decomposition into Margins The positive coefficients on Table 1 could be driven
by high-wage firms having more high-wage suppliers--the extensive margin--or by such
firms spending relatively more on their high-wage suppliers given the same matches--the
intensive margin. We decompose the coefficient of our preferred specification (2) into
these margins.
    Define the extensive margin as the unweighted average wage of firm f 's suppliers:

Define the intensive margin as the difference between log wageS

              IMf = log wageS     S

The intensive margin is large if firm f 's spending shares sf are particularly large for
high-wage suppliers  .

respectively. Equations (3) and (4) define the extensive (EMf     ) and intensive margins (IMf   ). They
capture, respectively, the extent to which firm f matches with high-wage suppliers or tilts its spending
toward high-wage suppliers. Robust standard errors are clustered at the 4-digit NACE industry level.


for 59 percent (= 0.152/0.259) of the partial correlation between the firm's wage and its
suppliers' wages, while the intensive margin accounts for 41 percent. Since these margins
are both large, the model allows for both.
    Figure 2 illustrates assortative matching using the raw data. We split firms into
quintiles of wagef . Panels (a) and (b) describe firms' upstream links. The height of the
bars in panel (a) is the supplier quintile's share in the number of suppliers to firms in each
buyer quintile. The height in panel (b) is the supplier quintile's share in the spending of
firms in each buyer quintile. Thus, by construction, the sum of bars of the same color
across supplier quintiles is one for each buyer quintile. Suppliers in the highest quintile
of wages generally have larger sales and more buyers. Their shares are hence larger for
all buyer quintiles. However, in both panels, the difference between sellers in quintiles 1
and 5 is much larger when the buyer has a high wage. In addition, due to the intensive
margin, these differences are more pronounced in panel (b) than in panel (a). In panel
(a), high-wage suppliers account for 35 percent of links to buyers in the lowest quintile
of wages and 55 percent of links to buyers in the highest quintile. In panel (b), the
corresponding numbers for spending are 43 and 83 percent. Panels (c) and (d) describe
the corresponding patterns for firms' downstream links. The shares across buyers now
add up to one for each supplier quintile. Panels (c) and (d) are almost the mirror images
of panels (a) and (b).

Notes: The sample includes manufacturing buyers and suppliers. Firms are sorted according to the
average value of their monthly payments per worker and grouped into five equal-sized groups. The buyer
and supplier quintiles are shown on the x- and y-axis, while the z-axis shows the corresponding shares.
Panels (a) and (b) illustrate buyers' upstream connections. In panel (a), the values on the z-axis is the
share of suppliers that belong to the wage quintiles on the y-axis for each buyer quintile on the x-axis. In
panel (b) the shares in the z-axis are spending shares. Panels (c) and (d) illustrate suppliers' downstream
connections. In panel (c) the values on the z-axis is the share of buyers that belong to the wage quintiles
on the y-axis for each supplier quintile on the x-axis. Panel (d) the shares on the z-axis are sales shares.

2.2.1    Robustness of Assortative Matching

Other Measures of Skill Intensity In addition to differences in skills, wages may con-
tain rents and differences in profit-sharing policies across firms. To address this concern,
in Appendix A.1, we decompose the variation in wages into firm and worker components
as in Abowd et al. (1999) using our employer-employee data from 2014 to 2016. Follow-
ing Bombardini et al. (2019), we then take a firm's skill intensity to be the average fixed
effect of its workers. When we repeat the regressions in Table 2 with this measure of
skill intensity, the coefficients are about half the size of the originals. This decrease is not
surprising since the measure excludes the firm fixed effect and the skills of workers who
never left the firm. Still, the coefficient is highly significant, and the decomposition into
the extensive and intensive margins remains close to Table 2.
    We do not observe worker education in our data. But we observe the share of workers
with tertiary education in the EU15 countries for each one-digit ISCO occupation code.
Using this share as a measure of occupational skill intensity, Appendix A.2 confirms that
firms with relatively more workers in skill-intensive occupations buy and sell more inputs
to other firms with skill-intensive occupations.

Geography In Appendix Table A3, we investigate whether positive assortative match-
ing on wages arises because firms trade more with other firms physically close to them
and some labor markets are more skill abundant than others. We conduct three exercises.
In panel A, we control for firm location at a finer level, i.e., the district instead of the
province level as in the baseline.8 In panel B, we construct average supplier wages in
equation (1) excluding suppliers located in the same province as the firm. In panel C, we
use a subsample of single-establishment firms. Our VAT data aggregate transactions at
the firm (instead of establishment) level, limiting our ability to control for the location of
firms with establishments in multiple provinces. The positive assortative matching and
decomposition into the extensive and intensive margins in Table 2 are robust to all three
tests, although the total coefficient decreases from 0.259 in Table 2 to 0.214 in panel B
and to 0.161 in panel C of Table A3. In panel A, it is 0.245.

Other Firm Characteristics Appendix Table A4 repeats the regression from column
(2) in Table 1 substituting wages with other firm characteristics. Assortative matching on
sales is positive but less pronounced than that on wages, and the sorting is insignificant
   8
     Turkey is divided into 81 provinces. Each province is further divided into districts, the total number
of which is close to 1,000. We use provinces in our baseline results because a province better represents
a local labor market.

wages in sorting, Appendix A.5 conducts a horse-race between sales and wages following
the empirical approach in Johnson and Wichern (1988), in the spirit of Becker (1973).
Both wages and sales matter for the positive assortative matching, but wages are about
3 times more important than sales for a firm's downstream linkages and 8.5 times more
important for its upstream linkages.10


2.3     Trade Shocks
We use shift-share regressions to show that firms respond to firm-specific trade shocks by
changing their skill intensity and network connections.11
   Define two shifters associated with country c and product category k :

                        u
                       Zck =  log Importsck                                                             (5)
                        a
                       Zck = ( log Importsck )  log(GDP per capitac,2010 )

where  log Importsck is the log change between 2011-2012 and 2014-2015 in the total
imports of country c in product category k from all countries other than Turkey and
GDP per capitac,2010 is the income per capita of country c in 2010.
   We measure the export shock to firm f during the period of our data as:

                                    ExportShocku
                                               f =
                                                                     u
                                                               xckf Zck
                                                          ck

                                    ExportShocka
                                               f      =              a
                                                               xckf Zck                                 (6)
                                                          ck


where xckf is the share of firm f 's revenue in 2010 that is exported to country c in product
                             u
category k . We interpret Zck  as a change in the demand for product category k in country
c. The underlying assumption is that shocks to imports of product k by country c from
countries other than Turkey are uncorrelated with other unobserved shocks to Turkish
firms that export k to c. Under this assumption, ExportShocku      f is a standard shift-share
shock that captures the increased demand for firm f 's exports. But we are interested
in shocks that increase the incentives for firm f to upgrade its quality, and it is well
   9
      Lim (2018) also finds assortative matching on sales using data on large firms in the United States
(Compustat). This pattern arises in our estimated model because of a positive correlation between firm
sales and wages.
   10
      These numbers are from a canonical correlation analysis. This method is often used in marriage
markets to evaluate which individual characteristics are most relevant for matching.

Notes: Wagef is the average value of monthly payments per worker in firm f . The suppliers' average wage
log wageS f is defined in equation (1). The  operator denotes changes between 2011-2012 and 2014-2015.
ExportShocku   f is a weighted average of changes in imports at the country (c) and 4-digit HS product
(k ) level between 2011-2012 and 2014-2015, where the weights are constructed as the share of firm f 's
exports of product k to importer c in its total sales in 2010. ExportShocka
                                                                          f adjusts these shocks by giving
higher weights to rich destinations. See equation (6). Ind and prov refer to 4-digit NACE industries and
provinces, respectively. Robust standard errors are clustered at the 4-digit NACE industry level.


documented that the relative demand for higher-quality, skill-intensive goods is higher in
rich countries.12 Then, export shocks that originate in rich countries should induce larger
changes in quality. ExportShocka f is an adjusted measure that gives higher weights to rich
countries.
    To compare these two measures, we separately use them in the regression:

                             log wagef =  ExportShockf + sr +                  f


where sr is industry-province fixed effects.
    Columns (1) and (2) of Table 3 report the results. The unadjusted ExportShocku     f has
an insignificant effect on firm wages, while the adjusted ExportShocka  f has a positive and
                   13
significant effect. Thus, as anticipated, increased demand for a firm's exports increases
the firm's skill intensity only if the demand originates in rich countries.14
    The mean of ExportShocka     f is 0.12. To understand the magnitude of the coefficient
0.042 in column (2), consider two firms. They both export a quarter of their sales (the
mean export intensity among exporters in the data). One firm exports to a country at the
90th percentile of the per capita GDP distribution (US$41.3 thousand, France), and the
  12
      See footnote 2 for references.
  13
      These results hold when both shocks are in the same regression in Appendix Table A7(1).
   14
      A related finding is in De Loecker (2007). For Slovenian firms, the productivity gains from exporting
are larger when the firm exports to high-income destinations than to low-income destinations.


                                                        12

change in imports over the sample period, Zck     = 5 percent, the implied ExportShocka  f for
the two firms is 13.3 percent (= 0.25 × 0.05 × log(41, 300)) and 8.3 percent, respectively,
and the estimated wage increase is 0.56 percent (= 0.042 × 0.133) and 0.35 percent.
     Given these results, we henceforth use the adjusted export shock in all exercises. In
column (3), we replace the dependent variable in column (2) with domestic sales. The
insignificant coefficient is reassuring, since we assume that ExportShocka  f is uncorrelated
with domestic shocks to firm f . It is also reassuring that the shock is not spurious but
associated with an increase in the firm's export intensity (export sales divided by total
sales) in column (4).
     Columns (5) and (6) regress the change in the wage of firm f 's suppliers on the change
in firm f 's own wage:

                             log wageS
                                     f =   log wagef + sr +             f


where sr is again industry-province fixed effects. In column (6), we instrument the
change in the firm's wage  log wagef with the export shock.15 The coefficient is 0.434
with standard error of 0.185. The interpretation is that when a firm's average wage
increases by one log point relative to other firms in response to an export shock, then
the average wage of its suppliers increases by 0.4 log points. The coefficient in the OLS
regression in column (5) is smaller at 0.085. It is difficult to predict ex ante the direction
of the bias. The OLS coefficient is confounded by unobserved shocks that affect the wage
growth of firms in the same industry and province.
    In sum, Table 3 suggests that demand for a firm's exports from rich countries increases
the firm's own wage as well as that of its suppliers. Table 4 shows that these increases
arise, at least in part, through new workers and network connections. Recall that the
export shock is constructed from changes between 2011-2012 and 2014-2015. Take the
workers that a firm f added between 2013 and 2015. Using matched employer-employee
data, we regress the log difference between these new workers' wages in 2011-2012 (before
they entered the firm) and firm f 's average wage in 2011-2012 (before the shock) on
ExportShocka  f in the first column. The second and third columns repeat the exercise for
the firm's new suppliers and new customers. The coefficients on all columns are positive
and statistically significant.16
  15
      This approach follows Hummels et al. (2014). To study the effect of exports on wages, they use a
shift-share variable similar to ExportShocku
                                           f as an instrument for firm exports.
   16
      We use the unweighted average in (3) because we cannot measure the weights sf that the firm
would have placed on new suppliers in the initial year or the equivalent weights of new customers on
initial sales. In Appendix Table A9, we obtain similar results when we compare the the wages of new

Notes: The wage is defined as the average value of monthly payments per worker. ExportShockf is a
weighted average of changes in (real per capita) income-adjusted imports at the country (c) and 4-digit
HS product (k ) level between 2011-2012 and 2014-2015, where the weights are constructed as the share
of firm f 's exports of product k to importer c in its total sales in 2010. Time t = 0 represents the
period before the export shock, 2011-2012. Ind and prov refer to 4-digit NACE industries and provinces,
respectively. Robust standard errors are clustered at the 4-digit NACE industry level.


Identification and Robustness Checks Recent papers discuss shift-share regressions
similar to ours. Borusyak et al. (2018) and Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2020) propose
methods to study, respectively, which shifts or shares matter most for consistency. Fol-
lowing the recommendation in Borusyak et al. (2018), we check three key conditions in

Appendix B. First, shifts are numerous. To calculate Zck    , we use 208 distinct destination
countries c and 1,242 4-digit HS codes k , generating 153,186 ck pairs. Second, the shifts
are dispersed within industries. The average Herfindahl-Hirschman index within indus-
tries is 5 × 10-5 . The standard deviation of Zck  a
                                                     is 3.26 across all firms and industries
and 3.24 across firms within industries. Third, the shifts are relevant. We obtain a coeffi-

    Appendix Table A7 presents additional checks to Table 3. The results in column (2) do
not change when we add the export shares xck weighted by destination income per capita
as a control. This exercise addresses the concern in Ad~  ao et al. (2019) that observations
with similar shares have correlated residuals. Separately, we add the export shares to the
same regression to address the concern in Borusyak et al. (2018) that shares xck do not
add up to one. Last, we add to column (6) the weighted average of the suppliers' export
shock. These shocks have a positive effect on supplier wages (as we would predict), but
they do not affect the coefficient of interest on the buyer's wage.
connections relative to those of workers, suppliers and customers that left the firm between 2010 and
2015. Appendix Table A8 associates the export shock to the share of newly hired workers after the
shock, who received higher monthly wages than the firm's average worker before the shock. Thus, Table
4 is not driven by a few outliers among new connections.

2.4     Other Characteristics of the Network
Three other features of the data govern our modeling choices. First, sales is the most
important indicator of the number of suppliers and customers of a firm. Table 5 reports
the endogenous elasticity of the number of customers and suppliers with respect to sales.
Firm sales explain about a third of the variation in the number of buyers and 60 percent
of the variation in the number of suppliers (R-squared in columns (1) and (4)). Columns
(2) and (5) add industry fixed effects, and columns (3) and (6) also add wages. The
coefficients on wages are insignificant and do not change the coefficients on sales or the
R-squared.
    Second, service firms, mostly wholesalers and retailers, account for almost half of
the domestic sales and material purchases of manufacturing firms. We do not, however,
observe the skill intensity of the materials purchased through these service intermediaries.
Thus, we introduce to the model a service sector that aggregates manufacturing inputs
into a homogeneous good. The service good is used as an input into manufacturing and
as a final good.
    Third, imports account for only 4 percent of spending on material inputs by a typical
manufacturing firm in our data, compared to a 10 percent share of exports in its total
sales. Accordingly, in the open economy model in Section 4, we model manufacturing
firms' decisions to export, but for simplicity, only service firms import.17
    We conclude with a brief point on quality measures. Quality in our model is a latent
variable that changes the firm's production function, increasing the relative marginal
  17
     We replicate the moments in Section 2.3 for import shocks in place of export shocks and find mostly
insignificant effects. This null finding possibly arises because only a small share of the manufacturing
firms in our data import their inputs directly.


                                                  15
product of skilled workers and of skill-intensive inputs. Kremer (1993) refers to this
variable interchangeably as quality or complexity. But our emphasis, like his, is the
complementarity between skilled workers in production. Even if we observed unit values
in our data, it is not clear that standard measures of quality would be superior to wages
in capturing this complementarity. Since we cannot answer this question with our data,
we leave it for future work. Nevertheless, we do observe unit values for a small subset
of the data: the foreign sales of exporting firms. For this subset, Appendix A.3 confirms
the positive relation between wages and the quality measure of Khandelwal et al. (2013),
which uses information on unit values and quantities by destination.18


3        The Closed-Economy Model
To highlight the novel features of the model, we first present the closed economy case.
There are two sectors: services and manufacturing. The service sector is perfectly compet-
itive. It produces a homogeneous good with constant returns to scale using manufacturing
inputs. The manufacturing sector has heterogeneous firms.
    Each manufacturing firm chooses its quality q from a line segment Q  R+ . This
choice determines the firm's production function. All tasks performed in a firm of quality
q  Q are also indexed by q , whether the worker is in production or posting ads. Earnings
per worker and the marginal product of higher-q inputs may be higher in the production
of higher-q output. Firms post ads to find suppliers and customers. The matching of ads
forms the firm-to-firm network. As in Lim (2018), each firm is matched with a continuum
of suppliers and customers, and it charges the monopolistic-competition markup. More
productive firms endogenously post more ads and have more customers and suppliers.
Firms imperfectly direct their ads toward other firms with similar quality levels.
    Differences in input intensity in the production function allow skill-intensive firms to
spend more on each others' inputs­the intensive margin of assortative matching. Directed
search increases the probability that skill-intensive firms match with each other--the
extensive margin.
    We present the manufacturing sector in Section 3.1. Section 3.1.1 sets up the firm's
problem, and Section 3.1.2 aggregates firm choices to form the network. The service sector
is in Section 3.2, and the equilibrium is in Section 3.3. Section 3.4 presents key properties
of the model. The less-technical reader may skip to Section 3.4. Whenever convenient, we
assume functions are continuous, differentiable, and integrable. Parametric assumptions
    18
     In our estimation, we use moments based on quintiles of firm wages, and the appendix documents
significant overlap between firms grouped on the basis of this quality measure and on the basis of wages.

3.1     Manufacturing
3.1.1   The Firm's Problem

The revenue of a firm with quality q , price p and a mass v of ads to find customers (v
stands for visibility) is:
                                       p1- vD(q )                                   (7)

where  > 1 is the elasticity of substitution between manufacturing varieties and D(q ) is
an endogenous demand shifter.
    The cost of a bundle of inputs to produce quality q when the firm posts a measure m
of ads to find manufacturing suppliers is:

                        C (m, q ) = w(q )1-m -s Pss [m1/(1-) c(q )]m                      (8)

where (m , s )     0 are Cobb-Douglas weights with (m + s )  (0, 1), Ps is the price of
the service good, w(q ) is the wage rate per efficiency unit of task q , and c(q ) is the cost
of a bundle of manufacturing inputs when the firm posts a measure one of ads to find
suppliers. The marginal cost of the firm is C (m, q )/z , where z is its productivity.
    The costs of posting v ads to find customers and m ads to find suppliers are, respec-
tively:

                                               v v

where fm , fv , m , and v are positive parameters with m > m and v > m /(m - m ).
   From (7), the firm charges markup /( - 1) over marginal cost. Given q and z , she
chooses v and m to maximize profit:

    A firm is characterized by a vector  = (0 , 1 )  R2 that determines its productivity
for each quality level:

                        z (q,  ) = exp 0 + 1 log(q ) +  2 [log(q )]2                     (13)

where  2 is a parameter common to all firms. Parameter 0 captures the firm's absolute
advantage in production, and 1 captures her comparative advantage in producing higher
quality. These two dimensions of heterogeneity capture the joint distribution of sales and
wages in the estimation. Since profit (10) is a share 1/( ) of revenue, firm  chooses q
to maximize revenue:

                q ( ) = arg max {x(z (q,  ), q )} = arg max {z (q,  ) (q )} .            (14)
                             q Q                          q Q


If wage w(q ) is continuous in q , then function (q ) (below) is continuous in q , and (14) is
the maximization of a continuous function in a compact set Q. Firms' quality choices are
interconnected through the endogenous terms in (q ). Manufacturing firm-to-firm trade
determines the input cost c(q ) and the component of demand D(q ) that comes from other
firms.

3.1.2   Manufacturing Firm-to-Firm Trade

Production Function The quantity produced by firm  producing quality q is:

                                  z (q,  )l1-m -s ys
                                                   s
                                                     Y (q )m

where l is efficiency units of labor, ys is units of the service good, and Y (q ) is an aggregate
of manufacturing inputs. This production function yields unit costs in (8). Following
Fieler et al. (2018), we assume:

                                                                       /( -1)
                    Y (q ) =        y ( )(-1)/ y (q, q ( ))1/ d                             (15)
                                 


where y ( ) is the quantity of input  and function y (q, q ) governs the productivity of
an input of quality q in the production of output of quality q . The ratio of the firm's
demand for any two inputs 1 and 2 with prices p(1) and p(2) and qualities q (1) > q (2),
                                                  -
                                y (1)     p(1)        y (q, q (1))
                                      =                            ,                        (16)
                                y (2)     p(2)        y (q, q (2))

is strictly increasing in the producing firm's quality q if y is log-supermodular.
    We parameterize:
                                              exp(q - y q )
                                y (q, q ) =                   .                             (17)
                                            1 + exp(q - y q )
It is increasing in input quality, and if y > 0, it is also log-supermodular and decreasing in
output quality. Figure 3A illustrates y as a function of supplier quality for two producing
firms (buyers). One can see how, given the same prices and matches, the buyer with higher
           2
quality qbuyer   spends relatively more on high-quality input suppliers than the buyer with
           1
quality qbuyer .

Directed Search Buyers can only see sales ads that target their own quality level. The
ads posted by a seller with quality q are distributed across buyer qualities q  Q according
to function v (q, q ). We parameterize v (q, q ) as the density of a normal distribution
with variance parameter v and mean q , the quality of the seller posting the ads. Figure
3B illustrates the distribution of ads across buyers for two sellers (suppliers). Clearly, the
                                              2
ads posted by the higher-quality supplier qsupplier are disproportionately targeted toward
higher-quality buyers. Here, the direction of ads is exogenous for simplicity. In Appendix
I, we modify the model to allow firms to choose the direction of their search (the mean
of v ), and we obtain similar estimation and counterfactual results.

                                                     20
Aggregation There is a fixed set of firms . Firm choices in (14) give rise to the
measure:
             J (z, q ) = |{   : z (q ( ),  )  z and q ( )  q }| .            (18)

Assume J has a density denoted with j (z, q ). Directed search implies that there is a
continuum of matching submarkets, one for each buyer quality. In the submarket of buyers
with quality q  Q, the measures of ads posted by buyers and sellers are, respectively:

                                       M (q ) =             m(z, q )j (z, q )dz                        (19)
                                                        Z

                                        V (q ) =            v (q, q )V (q )dq                          (20)
                                                        Q


where V (q ) is the measure of ads posted by sellers of quality q :

                                        V (q ) =            v (z, q )j (z, q )dz.
                                                        Z


   A standard matching function determines the measure of matches with buyers of
quality q :19
                      ~ (q ) = V (q ) [1 - exp(-M (q )/V (q ))]
                      M                                                     (21)

where parameter  > 0 captures efficiency in the matching market. The success rate of
                ~ (q )/V (q ) for sellers and m (q ) = M
ads is v (q ) = M                                      ~ (q )/M (q ) for buyers.
   Using (20), for each ad posted by a buyer of quality q , the probability of finding a
supplier with productivity-quality (z , q ) is:

                                                  v (q, q )v (z , q )j (z , q )
                                       m (q )                                   .                      (22)
                                                            V (q )

Combining with the CES price associated with (15), a bundle of manufacturing inputs
used by a firm of quality q with a measure one of buying ads costs:

                                                                                          1/(1- )

   We now turn to demand. A firm with quality q posts price p and a measure v of sales
ads. From (19), the measure of buyers with (z , q ) matched to the firm is:

                                                         m(z , q )j (z , q )
                                     vv (q )v (q , q )                       .
                                                             M (q )

Conditional on the match, the firm's sales to a buyer with (z , q ) are:

                                                      1-
                                              p            m ( - 1) x(z , q )
                              y (q , q )                                      .

3.2     Service Sector and Final Demand
Service firms aggregate manufacturing inputs into a homogeneous good sold in a perfectly
competitive market. Their production function is given by Y (0) in (15). There is a fixed
set of service firms, each endowed with a fixed measure m of manufacturing suppliers.
The probability that any of these suppliers has productivity-quality (z, q ) is:

                                                  v (z, q )j (z, q )
                                                         VT
   20
    We may also derive Dm (q ) from buyer connections. Using (23), the share of spending on materials
by buyers of quality q allocated to a supplier with price p, quality q , and v ads is:

                                                  y (q , q )v (q , q )vp1-

                                                      V (q )c(q )1-

Multiplying by domestic spending on materials [m ( -1)/ ]X (q ) and integrating over buyers q , demand
is:
                           m ( - 1)      m (q )
                     vp1-                         y (q , q )v (q , q )c(q )-1 X (q )dq
                                       Q  V ( q )
which is the expression above since m (q )/V (q ) = v (q )/M (q ).




                                                         22

                                       VT =         V (q )dq.

   Then, the price index of the service good is:

                                                                  1/(1- )

   Total sales to the service sector by a manufacturing firm with price p, quality q , posting
v ads in the home country to find customers are:

where Xs is the total absorption of services. Using (26), these sales are:

They do not depend on m.
   Take total manufacturing absorption to be the numeraire. Households consume only
the service good. Then, service absorption Xs is the share of service and labor inputs and
profits in manufacturing absorption:

                                    Xs = 1 -            m .
                                                   

3.3     Equilibrium
The demand shifter faced by a manufacturing firm in (7) is the sum of demand from other
manufacturing firms (25) and from services (27):

                                   D(q ) = Dm (q ) + Ds (q ).                                (28)

    We take the supply of efficiency units of labor to produce task q as an exogenous
function L(q, w), where w is the whole wage schedule w(q ) for all q  Q. Labor markets
clear if for all q :

                                1                            1
                  L(q, w) =         (1 - m - s )( - 1) + 1 -   X (q )                        (29)

where the constant is the labor share in manufacturing production in (10).
     We have derived aggregate variables as functions of equilibrium wages w(q ) and firm
outcomes. Measure J (z, q ) is in (18). The success rates of ads are m (q ) = M     ~ (q )/M (q )
and v (q ) = M~ (q )/V (q ), where M (q ), V (q ) and M
                                                      ~ (q ) are in (19), (20) and (21). Costs
c(q ) and C (m, q ) are in (8) and (23), and demand D(q ) is in (28). Firms maximize profits
in (10) given wages w(q ) and other firms' actions summarized in c(q ) and D(q ). Denote
with  a set of firm outcomes, specifying for each    its quality, productivity, sales,
measures of upstream and downstream ads and price.
     An equilibrium is a set of wages w and of firm outcomes  such that the functions
D(q ) and C (1, q ) exist and that the following conditions are satisfied:

   1. The labor market clears (29).

   2. Firms maximize profits. Firm  chooses q ( ) in (14) and has productivity z  ( ) =
      z (q ( ),  ) at the optimal. Its sales, measure of ads, and prices are x(z  ( ), q ( )),
      m(z  ( ), q ( )), v (z  ( ), q ( )), and p(z  ( ), q ( )) in (11).


3.4     Properties of the Model
The model has two novel features: The use of log-supermodular functions to capture as-
sortative matching and the search-and-matching setup of network formation. We explain
these features in Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2, respectively.

3.4.1   Assortative Matching

In the estimation below, we assume that the wage per worker is increasing in firm quality.
Then, assortative matching in wage per worker in the network arises through buyers' and
sellers' quality levels.
    For a firm with quality q , the measure of its suppliers that have quality q1 relative to
quality q2 is (integrating (22)):
                                      v (q, q1 ) V (q1 )
                                                         .                               (30)
                                      v (q, q2 ) V (q2 )
The firm's average spending on its suppliers of quality q1 relative to its suppliers of quality
q2 is (integrating (16)):
                                                  1-
                              y (q, q1 ) P (q1 )      V (q2 )
                                                              .                           (31)
                              y (q, q2 ) P (q2 )      V (q1 )
Multiplying these expressions (or using equation (23)), the ratio of the firm's total spend-



                                               24
ing on the two qualities is:
                                                                     1-
                                   v (q, q1 ) y (q, q1 )   P (q1 )
                                                                          .                            (32)
                                   v (q, q2 ) y (q, q2 )   P (q2 )

These expressions summarize the extensive margin (30), intensive margin (31) and total
(32) assortative matching in the network. Since the terms V (q ) and P (q ) are common to
all buyers, functions y and v alone govern assortative matching. By definition, a function
 is log-supermodular if (q, q1 )/(q, q2 ) is increasing in q whenever q1 > q2 or equivalently
 2 log((q, q ))/qq > 0. Function v (q, q ) governs the distribution of sales ads posted
by suppliers with quality q across buyers of quality q . We parameterize v as the density of
a normal random variable with variance v . Its derivative  2 log(v (q, q ))/qq = 1/v is
positive. Then, higher-quality firms have relatively more higher-quality suppliers in (30).
Function y (q, q ) governs the marginal product of an input of quality q in the production
of output quality q . It is log-supermodular if y > 0 in (17). Then, higher-quality firms
spend relatively more on their higher-quality suppliers in (31).

3.4.2    Search and Matching

We consider a special case of the model to highlight its search and matching setup.21
Assume that there is only one quality and v = m   . Set v = y = 1 without
loss of generality. Take wages as the numeraire, and drop the quality arguments from
functions. We refer to a firm by its productivity z instead of  . The mass of firms N and
the distribution of z are exogenous. Appendix D has the complete, closed-form solution
to this special case and analyzes its efficiency properties.22
    With v = m , the ratio of ads to find suppliers and customers in (11) is m(z )/v (z ) =
(m fv /fm )1/ , independent of firm productivity. Then, the success rates of ads m and
v are exogenous functions of parameters. The number of customers and the number of
suppliers of firm z are the same:

                                              1/                      1/
                                      x(z )                m x(z )
                                 v                 = m                        .
                                      fv                   fm
   21
      This special case relates to the setup of Miyauchi (2019), who incorporates matching frictions in
firm-to-firm trade in a version of the multi-location multi-sector Melitz (2003) model.
   22
      There are two externalities for each ad in the decentralized equilibrium. A positive externality is
that ads increase the total mass of matches M ~ . A negative externality is that ads decrease the probability
of matching for firms in the same of side of the market as the ads (sellers for v ads and buyers for m ads).
The negative externality is always greater than the positive externality, so the planner posts fewer ads
than in the market equilibrium. There is no inefficiency from the allocation of ads across heterogeneous
firms. The allocation of labor for production is also efficient. Markups are constant in manufacturing,
and the service sector has no labor.

                                                     25
They increase log-linearly with firm sales, as in Table 5.
    The probability that a firm with productivity z is the buyer or the seller in a match
is:
                              m(z )   v (z )      z  (-1)/
                                    =        =                 .
                               M       V       N E (z  (-1)/ )
It does not depend on the other firm in the match. Thus, there is no assortative matching
in the network: All firms are more likely to match with more productive firms.23
    The market share of a firm with productivity z in total manufacturing sales is:

                                                    z  (-1)
                                        x(z ) =                 .
                                                  N E(z  (-1) )

The expression is the same as Melitz (2003) except for the added parameter  > 1. The
effect of productivity on sales is augmented because more productive firms post more ads
to find suppliers and customers. Thus, the model needs a smaller dispersion in firms'
fundamental productivity z to generate the same distribution of sales as Melitz (2003).


4        Open Economy
We embed the model above into a small open economy setup. The prices of foreign
varieties and foreign demand for domestic goods are exogenous. Manufacturing firms may
export by paying a fixed cost and posting ads abroad. Service firms combine domestic
and foreign varieties with a constant elasticity of substitution  . We focus here only on
the differences from the closed economy case. Appendix E presents the full model.
     The manufacturing firm  has productivity z (q,  ) in (13). The firm chooses q  Q and
then draws a random fixed export cost of fE units of the service good from a common
distribution. She then decides her export status and posts ads to search for domestic
suppliers, for domestic customers, and if exporting, for foreign customers. We introduce
randomness in the fixed cost of exporting because firms in the data with similar size and
wages have different export statuses. The timing simplifies aggregation in the estimation.
     The revenue from foreign sales of an exporter with quality q , price p and v sales ads
to find foreign customers is:
                                       p1- ve DF (q )                                  (33)

where DF (q ) is an exogenous demand function and e is the real exchange rate. The cost of
    23
     Bernard et al. (2019b), Lim (2018), and Huneeus (2018) generate an increasing relation between a
firm's sales and number of network connections by imposing a fixed cost for firms to trade. Their setting
generates strong negative assortative matching because only more productive firms pay a fixed cost to
trade with less productive firms.

                                                   26
posting v ads in Foreign is the same as the domestic cost in (9), w(q )fv v v /v . Assuming
the same curvature v is important to maintain the log-linearity in the firm's problem.
The cost parameter fv is the same as that for domestic ads to simplify the notation only,
since we do not observe foreign trading partners.
    By backward induction, we start with the problem of the firm after it has chosen
its quality and export status. A firm with quality q , productivity z and export status
E  {0, 1} chooses a mass of ads to find suppliers m, a mass of ads to find customers v
and the share rv  [0, 1] of the sales ads that are posted domestically:

                                             1-
                     vmm  C (1, q )
              max                                 [rv DH (q ) + (1 - rv )Ee DF (q )]
              m,v,rv     -1 z
                                                 v v           mm
                   - w(q )fv [rv + (1 - rv ) ]       - w(q )fm                                 (34)
                                                 v             m

where C (1, q ) is the input cost in (8) and DH (q ) is the endogenous domestic demand
shifter, denoted with D(q ) in equation (7). The optimal share of ads rv is a function of
quality q and export status E :

                                                             1/(v -1)
                          1 - rv (q, E )      Ee DF (q )
                                         =                              .                      (35)
                            rv (q, E )         DH (q )

Given the optimal rv , problem (34) differs from the closed economy case (10) only in the
level of demand and of the cost of posting v sales ads. Then, the relationship between
sales, ads and prices takes the form of (11). Total sales are:

                                x(z, q, E ) = (q, E )z  (-1)                                   (36)

where
                                                           1-               -m /m

     (q, E ) = [w(q )]       D(q, E )      C (1, q )                                fv         (37)
                                        -1                       m
                                                             (v -1)/v
     D(q, E ) = DH (q )v /(v -1) + E (e DF (q ))v /(v -1)                   .                  (38)

Exporting increases the firm's profit by more than the sum of the profits from operating
separately in each market. The firm uses the same input suppliers to produce all its goods,
regardless of destination. Thus, exporting increases the firm's incentives to search for
suppliers, which lowers price and increases the firm's incentives to search for customers in
both markets. The exponent in the CES term D(q, E ) and  capture these magnification

    The firm exports if its fixed exporting cost parameter fE  f E (z, q ), where

                                              z  (-1)
                              f E (z, q ) =           [(q, 1) - (q, 0)] .                            (39)
                                               Ps

    Denote with  the cumulative distribution function of fE . After observing its produc-
tivity z (q,  ) but before observing fE , the firm chooses its quality:

                     z (q,  ) (-1)
q ( ) = arg max                    (q, 1) f E (z (q,  ), q ) + (q, 0) 1 -  f E (z (q,  ), q )
             q Q           

                        - Ps E(fE |fE  f E (z (q,  ), q )) .                                         (40)

    Appendix E makes exactly the same assumptions on production and network formation
as in the closed economy case. The only difference is that because sales, ads and prices
depend on export status, aggregation in the open economy model is over two measure
functions:

                               ~(z, q, 1) = J (z, q ) f E (z, q )
                               J
                               ~(z, q, 0) = J (z, q ) 1 -  f E (z, q )
                               J                                                                     (41)

where J (z, q ) is defined in (18). The equilibrium is also similarly defined with the exchange
rate e as an additional equilibrium variable and a trade equilibrium condition, in which
we allow an exogenous trade imbalance.


5        Estimation and Identification
The key estimation assumption is that the wage per worker (w(q )× labor endowment per
worker) is strictly increasing in q . Using a Roy (1951) model, Teulings (1995) provides a
micro foundation for the labor supply function L(q, w) and for this estimation assump-
tion.25 We also prove that we can construct a set of labor endowments that exactly
matches the distribution of wage per worker across firms in the data. See Appendix C for
details.
    We calibrate some parameters and estimate others using the method of simulated mo-
    24
      The interconnection between a firm's decisions on sales, prices and purchases in the domestic market
and its participation in other markets (export or not) does not appear in standard models of exporting
a la Melitz (2003) but does appears in models of importing such as Antr`
`                                                                          as et al. (2017).
   25
      See Costinot and Vogel (2010) for an application of Teulings (1995) to international trade.


                                                    28
ments. A closed economy is defined by parameters {m , s , , fm , fv , m , v , m, , y , v ,  2 },
the labor supply L(q, w), and the set of firms , itself specified by a mass N and a distri-
bution of firm productivity parameters (0 , 1 ). In addition, the open economy has the
price of the bundle of imported goods PF , foreign demand DF (q ), and the distribution of
fixed costs of exporting fE .


5.1    Calibrated Parameters and Normalizations
We calibrate production parameters {m , s , , v , m }. We set m = 0.33 and s = 0.38
in (8) to the cost shares of manufacturing and services in the Turkish manufacturing
sector. The elasticity of substitution  = 5 is from Broda and Weinstein (2006). We
set m = 1/0.59 and v = 1/0.46 to match the endogenous elasticity of the number of
suppliers and customers with respect to firm sales in Table 5.
    We also normalize the mass of firms to N = 1. We set fm = fv = 1. Since search
efforts are not observable, we cannot separately identify the cost of one ad, fm and fv ,
from the matching efficiency  in (21). Similarly, parameter m is not identified because it
governs the theoretical price index Ps in (26) but not the observable sales of manufactures
to services in (27). We pick m so that Ps = 1.
    We set equilibrium efficiency wages w(q ) = 1 for all q and real exchange rates e = 1.
While these variables endogenously respond to counterfactuals, they may be normalized
in the cross-section. We observe the wage per worker in the data, but we can always
normalize the endowment of efficiency units of labor per worker so that the efficiency
wage w(q ) = 1. Similarly, we can set e and adjust the foreign demand DF (q ) and price
PF accordingly.


5.2    Parameterization
Assume (0 , 1 ) are distributed according to a bivariate normal with standard deviations
0 and 1 and correlation . The fixed export costs fE are log-normally distributed
with mean µE and standard deviation E . We parameterize:

                                       DF (q ) = b1 q b2

where b1 and b2 are parameters.




                                              29
5.3     Moments and Identification
We use 39 moments to estimate the remaining 11 parameters: {, y , v ,   ¯ 2 , 0 , 1 , , µE , E , b1 , b2 }.
To exploit information on the joint distribution of firm wages, sales, number of network
links, and export activities as well as the novel sorting patterns, we summarize most
moments conditional on the 5 quintiles of firm wage per worker:

   1. The mean number of suppliers (5 moments) and mean number of customers (5
      moments)

   2. The share in total network sales (5 moments) and the standard deviation of sales
      (5 moments)

   3. The share of firms exporting (5 moments) and the average export intensity for
      exporting firms (5 moments)

   4. The average log-wage of suppliers, unweighted (4 moments) and weighted by spend-
      ing shares (4 moments)26

   5. The shift-share regression coefficient of the wage response to an idiosyncratic export
      demand shock (1 moment)

     Although all parameters are estimated jointly, some parameters are associated with
some moments more closely. The average number of trading partners per firm identifies
, the efficiency in transforming ads into matches in (21). Total sales and the standard
deviation by quintile of wages identify the parameters 0 , 1 , and . Parameter µE gov-
erns the share of firms exporting, and E governs how this share changes across quintiles
of firm wages. If E is large, then the share of firms exporting does not vary much across
quintiles because it depends more on firm draws of fE than on quality choices (wages).
Parameter b1 governs the level of export intensity, while b2 governs how export intensity
changes across quintiles of firm wages. If b2 is large, DF (q )/DH (q ) is increasing in q , and
export intensity increases with the wage quintile.
     The moments on suppliers' wages summarize the total and extensive margins of assor-
tative matching in the network. As per Section 3.4, parameter y governs the intensive
margin in (31), and parameter v governs the extensive margin (30).
     Finally, the shift-share coefficient of Table 3, column (2), identifies  2 . Consider a
shock that increases a single firm's export demand DF (q ) by 5 percent. If DF (q )/DH (q )
is increasing in quality as in our estimated model, the firm increases q ( ). This increase
  26
     This set includes only four moments (and not one per quintile) because we normalize the wages in
the lowest quintile to 0 and match the log difference from the lowest quintile in the data and model.

                                                 30
is associated with an increase in the wage per worker since each quality in the estimated
model is associated with an average wage per worker in the data (the ranking is the same).
The parameter  2 governs the concavity of z (q,  ) in (13). If  2 is large and negative,
then z (q,  ) is very concave, and the firm does not respond much to the export demand
shock. If  2 is small, the response is large.27


5.4      Model Computation
We solve the equilibrium of the model for each guess of parameters. We discretize the
quality space into a grid of 100 equally spaced choices in [0, 8]. Given a guess of 0 , 1 , ,
we sample 50,000 firms from the bivariate distribution of  = (0 , 1 ) and calculate each
firm's productivity at each quality, z (q,  ) in (13).
    The solution algorithm, detailed in Appendix G, is composed of two blocks. The inner
block takes the equilibrium distribution of productivity-quality J (z, q ) as given. It solves
the equilibrium in the matching and product markets given J (z, q ) and the optimal export
status, search and production decisions for each (z, q ). From this inner block, we obtain
the aggregate functions (q, 0) and (q, 1) that govern each firm's export cutoff f E (z, q )
in (39) and quality choice in (40). The outer block solves the optimal quality choice for
each firm  and updates J (z, q ) used in the inner block. We iterate over these two blocks
until firms do not change their quality choices.28


6        Estimation Results
The targeted moments are in Table 7. The estimated parameters in Table 6 are split
into three sets. The first set {v , y , } governs network formation. Parameter v is
the standard deviation of the distribution of ads v in Figure 3B. The estimated value
v = 3.09 implies, for example, that 65 percent of the ads posted by sellers in the top
    27
       In Appendix F, we prove that we can non-parametrically identify the joint distribution of (0 , 1 )
using the joint distribution of sales and wages and that  2 is not identified in the cross-section. We also
show its identification through idiosyncratic firm-specific shocks.
   To construct the model's response, we sample firms and estimate the expected effect from the idiosyn-
cratic demand shocks as the average change in wages per worker weighted by firms' export probabilities.
    28
       The estimated function (q, E ) is concave in q because all buyers' (service and manufacturing firms')
valuation of quality, y in (15), is concave. Then, the quadratic form of z (q,  ) in (13), together with
¯ 2 < 0, implies that all firms' problem of choosing quality (14) is concave and that quality choices are
bounded even for firms that have a comparative advantage in producing higher quality, 1 > 0.
   Although we cannot guarantee the uniqueness of the equilibrium, we conduct 500 Monte Carlo sim-
ulations, each with random starting choices of firm quality. In all simulations, the algorithm converges
to the same equilibrium. We conduct these simulations for the parameter estimates and the baseline
counterfactuals.

quintile of quality go to buyers also in the top quintile and 8 percent go to buyers in the
lowest quintile. Parameter y = 0.35 governs the complementarity in production, i.e., the
log-supermodularity of function y in Figure 3A. Take two suppliers, one in the highest
quintile of quality and one in the lowest quintile. The marginal product of the first input is
46 percent higher when output is in the top quintile of quality and 10 percent higher when
output is in the bottom quintile.29 Parameter  = 8.7 × 10-4 implies a low probability of
finding a trading partner per ad. This is not surprising given that the number of partners
per firm in the data is a tiny fraction of all manufacturing firms. The average number
of suppliers and customers per quintile of wages ranges from 5.6 to 25.8 in Table 7. The
model fits these averages well. With only two parameters, v and y , to govern assortative
matching, it also fits the increasing relation between buyers' and sellers' wages, weighted
and unweighted, reasonably well.
    The second set of parameters {0 , 1 , } are those of the joint distribution of (0 , 1 ),
where 0 determines a firm's productivity level and 1 its comparative advantage in higher
quality. This distribution governs the joint distribution of wages and sales. There is a
large dispersion of sales across quintiles of wages in Table 7. Firms in the highest quintile
account for 78 percent of network sales in the data and in the model.
    The third set {µE , E , b1 , b2 } governs export patterns. The log of the export cost has
mean µE = -3.95 and standard deviation E = 1.52. The share of firms exporting is
  29
       We use the median of each quintile to calculate these numbers.

higher among high-wage firms, but still about 10 percent of low-wage firms export in
the data and in the model. Parameters b1 = 93 and b2 = 0.49 govern export intensity
by wage quintile. Conditional on exporting, export intensity is increasing in firm wages
in the data. The model captures this pattern with an estimate of DF (q )/DH (q ) that is
increasing in q .
    This increasing ratio DF (q )/DH (q ) matters because a firm-specific shock that increases
DF (q ) leads the firm to upgrade its quality and thereby increase its wage per worker. This
prediction is consistent with the shift-share regressions in Table 3. In the data, a 5 percent
export shock on average increases the wage per worker by 0.21 percent for exporting firms,
and we pick    ¯ 2 = -0.103 to exactly match this response. In column (6) of Table 3, a 1
percent increase in the firm's wage in response to the shock increases its suppliers' wages
by 0.434 percent (with a standard error of 0.185 percent). Out-of-sample, this number is
0.219 percent in the model.
    Overall, the moments of the model and the data are similar in Table 7. As further
validation, Figure 4 illustrates the predictions of the model for the non-parametric pat-
terns of assortative matching of Figure 2 above. These figures are related to targeted
moments, but they were not directly targeted. The model matches well the extent to
which firms with similar wages disproportionately transact with each other, upstream
and downstream, on the intensive and extensive margins.
    Equipped with these estimates, we investigate how a counterfactual increase in export
demand affects firm quality. Such a shock potentially has a large indirect effect through
the production network, because in the data and the model, exporters are large and
skill-intensive and have many domestic trading partners.


7     Counterfactual Analysis
Starting with the equilibrium of the estimated model, our baseline counterfactual increases
export demand DF (q ) by 5 percent. It maintains the efficiency wages w(q ) = 1 for all q , the
real exchange rate e = 1 and the price of services Ps = 1. We allow gross manufacturing
output and the trade balance to increase with the shock. We choose this as the baseline
because it captures the effect of the shock on manufacturing but shuts down the interaction
between manufacturing and the rest of the economy by assuming that (i) labor supply in
and out of manufacturing is perfectly elastic (w(q ) = 1), (ii) the export expansion does
not lead to a real exchange rate appreciation (e = 1), and (iii) the price of the inputs that

manufacturing firms use from distributors does not change (Ps = 1).30 Relaxing each of
these assumptions, as we do in Section 8, requires out-of-sample assumptions.
    Figure 5 plots the density of quality choices. The counterfactual first order stochas-
tically dominates the initial equilibrium. By assumption, the rankings of quality and
average wage per worker (efficiency wage w(q )× labor endowment per worker) are kept
constant in the counterfactual, and the model exactly matches the distribution of wage
per worker across firms in the data. Thus, the wage per worker in the top x-axis of Fig-
ure 5 lends an economic interpretation to quality. Since w(q ) = 1 in the counterfactual,
changes in firm wages reflect only quality upgrading (shifting to higher-quality tasks).
    Table 8 reports the changes in wages, sales and number of trading partners for ex-
porters and non-exporters by ex ante quintile of the quality distribution. The wage per
worker increases in all groups of firms, especially among the ex ante high-quality firms.
For example, wages in non-exporting, high-quality firms increase by 2.5 log points.
    The network propagates the shock from exporting to non-exporting firms. Profit
shifter (q, 0) summarizes the benefit of upgrading quality for non-exporters. As per
equations (57) and (8), (q, 0) is proportional to a demand component D(q, 0) and a
cost component c(q )m (1-) . Figure 6(a) plots the counterfactual changes relative to
the initial equilibrium of (q, 0) and each of these components. First, take the demand

      The price stays at Ps = 1 in a limiting case in which domestic manufacturing is a small share of
inputs into services. Other inputs may be imports or other (not modeled) domestic goods or factors.

The baseline counterfactual is in the left panel, and the special case with no complementarity (y = 0,
v = ) is in the right panel.



                                                                                                         37
component D(q, 0) on the red dotted curve. Exporters upgrade quality and increase their
posting of ads. Then, the probability of matching increases for high-quality suppliers
who direct their ads toward high-quality market segments. At the intensive margin,
conditional on the match, exporters increase their spending on high- relative to low-
quality domestic suppliers. Second, take the cost component c(q )m (1-) on the blue
dotted curve. The increased search effort and quality upgrading among exporters decrease
the cost of manufacturing inputs for all firms. This decrease accrues disproportionately to
high-quality firms whose production is intensive in high-quality inputs (estimated y > 0).
The more firms respond to these shifts by upgrading their qualities, the more they augment
the effect of the shock. Overall, the profitability for non-exporters increases by 7 percent
in the high-quality segment (q  6), and it decreases by about 7 percent in the low-quality
segment (q  1). Both c(q ) and D(q, 0) significantly contribute to these changes.
    Exporters (not in the figure) experience similar indirect effects. Their profit shifter
(q, 1) is proportional to the same cost component c(q )m (1-) , and their demand compo-
nent D(q, 1) is a CES aggregate of domestic demand D(q, 0) and foreign demand DF (q )
in equation (38). In all, the average wage increases by 1.0 percent for non-exporters, 1.92
percent for exporters and 1.22 percent for all firms. This increase in exporters' wages is an
order of magnitude larger than the increase of 0.21 percent induced by the idiosyncratic
export demand shocks of the same magnitude.
    The effect of the counterfactual on sales and network connections is more heteroge-
neous. The domestic market for inputs becomes more competitive (c(q ) decreases), and
the appeal of low-quality inputs decreases because their marginal product is low in the
production of high quality. As a result, lower-quality, non-exporting firms decrease their
sales and search efforts. In Table 8, the number of suppliers and customers decreases by
4 log points, and sales decrease by 7.7 log points for these firms. In spite of the positive
cross-sectional correlations, the counterfactual simultaneously predicts reductions in sales
and network connections and increases in quality for non-exporting firms.
    To further probe these mechanisms, we study a special case of the model without the
complementarity in matching v and in production y . The value of high- and low-quality
inputs in production is independent of the output quality (y = 0), and all firms' ads are
uniformly distributed across the quality set Q (v  ). We re-estimate the model
with these parameter restrictions in Appendix H. By assumption, the special case cannot
match the increasing relation between buyer and supplier wage. For all other moments,
the fit is similar to the general model. Importantly, the ratio DF (q )/DH (q ) is increasing
in quality so that exporters upgrade quality when DF (q ) increases.
    We experiment with the same 5 percent counterfactual increase in export demand


                                             38
DF (q ) in this special case. The average wage increase for exporters is 0.23 percent,
very close to the average firm response to an idiosyncratic export demand shock of 0.21
percent. Figure 6 panel (b) plots the change of (q, 0) and of its cost c(q )m (1-) and
demand D(q, 0) components. The shock decreases the price index P (q ) in the domestic
market. Competition tightens decreasing demand and costs. However, these changes are
independent of quality. Profit shifter (q, 0) increases by 0.5 percent for all non-exporters.
In the model, firms choose quality before observing their exporting cost. The flattened
(q, 0) mutes the quality response of all firms in this special case, especially those with a
low probability of exporting.
    Manufacturing output increases by 6.03 percent in the general model and 5.78 percent
in the special case. These effects are larger than the classical Hulten (1978) prediction
because the positive shock increases exporters' search efforts and leads other firms to
tilt their input purchases toward exporters, whose prices decrease. Baqaee and Farhi
(2019a) highlight this role of an elasticity of substitution greater than one ( = 5 in the
estimation). Despite similar predictions on output, the dramatic differences in quality
upgrading between the general model and the special case indicate that economies of
scale are not sufficient to explain the effect of international trade on developing countries.


8      Alternative Counterfactuals and Discussion
In all of the counterfactuals below, foreign demand DF (q ) increases 5 percent, as in the
baseline counterfactual. We experiment with four specifications:
    1. We allow the real exchange rate e (wages in Foreign relative to Home) to move to
       balance trade. In Appendix E, trade balances if

                      1-                            v /(v -1)
               ePF                      e DF (q )
                           Xs =                                     x(z, q, 1)j (z, q, 1)dz dq.
                Ps                q Q    DH (q )                z


       Clearly, imports on the left-hand side decrease with e, and exports on the right-
       hand side increase. In the baseline, we kept e = 1 and allowed the trade surplus to
       increase with the export shock.

    2. We incorporate free entry. In the baseline, average profits increase with the for-
       eign demand shock. Here, we allow the mass of firms to increase, which tightens
       competition and maintains the average profit as in the initial equilibrium.

    3. We allow the wages of skilled workers to increase. In the baseline, we maintain the
       wage schedule w(q ) = 1 for all q , assuming that the labor supply is perfectly elastic.

                                               39
         There, labor demand for high-quality tasks increases. Here, we allow the wage w(q )
         to rise relative to the initial equilibrium and to rise proportionately with quality.
         In particular, we assume w(q ) is linear, set w(0) = 1 and pick w(q max ) so that the
         average counterfactual quality change across firms is zero.

   4. We increase the productivity of the highest-quality firms under the assumption that
      the agglomeration of skilled workers in manufacturing increases firm productivity,
      as estimated in Diamond (2016). In the baseline, the stock of labor in the ex ante
      top quintile of quality rises by 0.846 percent. Diamond (2016) estimates that an
      increase in college graduates of one percent in a location increases their productivity
      by 0.854 percent. Using these numbers, we increase the productivity z (q,  ) of firms
      in the ex ante top quintile of quality by 0.72 percent (= 0.854 × 0.00846).31

    Table 9 summarizes the results. With free entry (2), the number of firms increases by
1.13 percent, but the remaining results are close to the baseline. With balanced trade (1),
the real exchange rate appreciates by 1.15 percent, and in counterfactual (3), wages at the
top quality w(q max ) increase by 0.79 percent. Both of these price changes decrease the
incentives for firms to upgrade quality. Although they are small, they have a significant
effect, because both the positive and negative effects are magnified in general equilibrium.
The average wage per worker increases by 0.20 percent with balanced trade (1) and by 0.16
with the increase in the skill premium (3) in comparison to 1.22 percent in the baseline.
    Agglomeration effects increase the productivity of high-quality firms in specification
(4). By the same general equilibrium effects, even a small increase, of 0.72 percent, has a
large effect: The average wage per worker increases by 3.17 percent and output by 13.7
percent, roughly double the baseline numbers.32
    Shifter DF (q ) summarizes the foreign market size, price index, and frictions in match-
ing with foreign customers. Thus, the counterfactual increase in DF (q ) may be interpreted
as a foreign shock or as a policy to promote exports through decreases in search frictions,
e.g., export fairs and conferences.33 Counterfactuals (1), (3) and (4) highlight critical
factors in the effectiveness of these export-promotion policies. In counterfactual (3), the
   31
        In Diamond's (2016) model, the inverse demand function for college graduates is

                                     log wH =  log LH - (1/ ) log LH

where LH is the supply of college graduates in a location,  is the elasticity of substitution between skilled
and unskilled workers and  is the external scale parameter. She estimates  = 1.6 and  - 1/ = 0.229,
yielding  = 0.854.
   32
      This exercise is akin to Jones (2011), who emphasizes the roles of complementarity and economies
of scale in economic growth.

      Rauch (2001) surveys case studies of this type of export-promotion policies.

rise in the skill premium dampens the incentives for firms to upgrade to skill-intensive
qualities. This points to the importance of ensuring an elastic supply of skilled workers
into manufacturing, perhaps through education and training. In counterfactual (1), the
effects of export promotion in quality upgrading are dampened when a real exchange rate
appreciation prevents the country from running a trade surplus. In addition, in coun-
terfactual (4), output grows when the agglomeration of skilled workers in manufacturing
increases firm productivity. These counterfactuals together rationalize the concomitant
increases in the trade surplus and in manufacturing production and upgrades commonly
observed in fast-growing emerging markets, notably in East Asia.


9     Conclusion
We document novel facts about firm-to-firm trade using data from Turkey. High-wage
firms are more likely to match with each other in the network, and the value of transactions
is larger when the trading partners' wages are both high. Over time, a firm-specific
demand shock from a rich export destination is associated with an increase in the firm's
wage and in the average wage of its suppliers.
    We rationalize these findings in a model where firms' choices of quality and skill
intensity are interconnected through the production network. Higher-quality production is
intensive in skilled labor and in higher-quality inputs, and higher-quality firms direct their
search toward other higher-quality firms. Counterfactuals show that even a small export
shock leads to large and widespread quality upgrades in manufacturing firms because of
the complementarity in their quality choices.
    These findings are broadly consistent with those of Goldberg and Reed (2020), who

                                                        41
show that exporting even a small amount of output to developed countries is associated
with economic growth in developing countries. Alternative counterfactual scenarios in
Section 8 point to other economic factors that interact with the effects of international
trade on manufacturing firms: education, trade imbalances, and agglomeration effects.

            Online Appendix: Not For Publication
    We provide complementary results on the descriptive analysis of the data; details of
the model, computation, and counterfactuals; and alternative model specifications. In
Appendix A, we document a battery of robustness checks and facts that support the
positive sorting of worker skills and firm quality across business partners in our data.
Appendix B provides details of the identification and robustness of the shift-share IV
regressions. We develop a micro-foundation for the wage schedule using a Roy model
of labor supply in Appendix C. Appendix D uses a simplified model with homogeneous
quality to investigate the efficiency property of endogenous network formation. Details
of the open economy model are in Appendix E. Appendix F discusses the identification
of the parameter  2 . The computation algorithm is described in Appendix G. Finally,
Appendix H and Appendix I report estimates and moments of the model extensions with
no complementarity and with endogenous targeting of ads, respectively.


A     Robustness of Sorting Patterns
We check the robustness of the positive assortative matching of firm skill intensity in
the network. In Subsection A.1, we decompose firm-worker wages into firm and worker
components and show that the sorting pattern holds for the worker components. In
Subsection A.2, we use occupational categories to measure skill intensity. In subsection
A.3, we estimate exporters' quality using information on export destination, prices and
quantities. The quality of firm exports is increasing in the firm's own wage and in its
suppliers' wage. The robustness checks in Subsection A.4 confirm that the results are not
driven by the geographic clustering of similar firms. Finally, Subsection A.5 investigates
other firm characteristics and finds that wage is the dominant factor in sorting.


A.1     Alternative Measure of Worker Skills
Our measure of firm skill intensity in the main text, wages, contains information about
worker skills as well as firm rents. Here, we use an alternative measure of firm skill
intensity proposed by Bombardini et al. (2019) that extracts firm rents.
    First, using Turkish linked employer-employee data for the 2014-2016 period, we de-
compose the variation in firm-worker wages into firm and worker components as in Abowd
et al. (1999). We estimate the following specification for worker earnings:

                         ln wageef t = Xef t + e + f + eef t                         (42)

                                           49
where e and f are worker and firm fixed effects, respectively, and Xef t is a vector
of controls. For workers, the controls are age (squared) and dummies for 1-digit ISCO
occupation codes. For firms, the controls are dummies for each industry-region-time
triplet and size (proxied by gross sales).
    Our sample includes more than 3.2 million firm-worker-year observations. It is well
known that the fixed effects in equation (42) are identified from workers moving between
jobs. As with our baseline results, we estimate (42) using only manufacturing firms. Given
this industry restriction and the short time span (i.e., 3 years), this sample corresponds
to about 65 percent of all workers.
    We measure firm f 's skill intensity using the worker fixed effects:

                                               1          ^e
                                        f =                                                        (43)
                                               Nf   eEf


where Nf denotes the number of workers in firm f and Ef the set of workers employed
by the firm in the year 2015.
    There is significant overlap between the quintiles of firm average wage and the measure
f : 62 percent (42 percent) of firms in the highest (lowest) quintile based on wages are also
in the highest (lowest) two quintiles constructed based on average worker skills. When
the middle quintile is included, the respective shares rise to 85 percent and 62 percent.

Notes: f denotes average worker skills for firm f in (43). The dependent variable, suppliers' skills,
are constructed as a weighted average of  , where the weights are the share of supplier  in firm f 's
total spending on inputs, in equation (1). Ind and prov refer to 4-digit NACE industries and provinces,
respectively. The extensive and intensive margins are defined in (3) and (4). Robust standard errors are
clustered at the 4-digit NACE industry level.


    Table A1 presents the results of our sorting regressions using f as a proxy for firm
skill intensity. The coefficient is economically and statistically significant. It is about half
as large as our baseline estimate, even though the measure f does not include the firm
fixed effect f in (42) or the skills of workers who never left the firm. The decomposition
into the extensive and intensive margins remain close to the baseline.

A.2        Wages and Occupational Categories
In our data, we observe workers' occupations but not their educational level. From the
EUROSTAT dataset, we obtain information on the share of employees with tertiary ed-
ucation for each 1-digit ISCO occupation code for the EU15 countries.34 Assuming the
ranking of skill intensity across occupations is similar in the EU15 and in Turkey, we use
these EU15 shares as a measure of occupational skill intensity. We measure firm f 's skill
intensity as:

                                                                9

                                                                           o                        (44)
                                                              o=1


where of is the employment share of occupation code o for firm f and EducEU-15  o    denotes
the share of employees with tertiary education for the same occupation code in the EU15.
           occupation
Measure Ef            is the expected share of workers with tertiary education of a firm in
Europe with the same distribution of workers across occupations as firm f .
                                                                   occupation
   Figure A1 plots firm wages and occupational skill intensity Ef             with both vari-
ables adjusted for province-industry fixed effects. The relationship is positive and tight.

                                                     Occupational measure of skill intensity


Notes: We define the wage of a firm as the firm's wage bill divided by the number of workers. The
occupational measure of skill intensity is defined in equation (44). It is the expected share of workers
with tertiary degree of a firm in the EU15 with the same mix of occupational categories as the Turkish
firm. Both the x- and the y-axis variables are demeaned from the 4-digit NACE industry averages.


    Table A2 presents the main assortative matching regressions, replacing wages with

       The shares are quite stable across years; we used data from 2015.

                                                                    51

occupational skill intensity Ef           . The coefficient is positive and significant but much
smaller than that in the wage regressions. This is not surprising since occupation is
measured at the one-digit level and the educational shares are based on European data,
potentially masking large cross-firm heterogeneity. It is still reassuring to observe a clear
                                             occupation
positive sorting relationship. Because Ef               is in shares, not logs, it is not amenable
to the decomposition of assortative matching into the extensive and intensive margins.

Notes: We measure a firm's skill intensity Ef               in (44). It is the expected share of workers with
tertiary education of a firm in the EU15 with the same occupational mix as firm f . The dependent
                      occupation
variable, Supplier Ef            , is defined analogously to supplier wages. It is the weighted average of
                     occupation
firm f 's suppliers E           , where the weights are firm f 's spending on each supplier as a share of its
spending on manufacturing inputs. All specifications include industry-province fixed effects (ind-prov).
Robust standard errors are clustered at the 4-digit NACE industry level.



A.3      Wages and Quality of Exports
As in Kremer (1993), the focus in our paper is on complementarity in firms' skill intensity.
Quality in the model is a latent variable that captures the type of labor and material
inputs that a firm uses. A firm's quality varies one to one with its wage per worker in the
estimation. Here, we check the relationship between wage per worker and the measure of
quality proposed by Khandelwal et al. (2013). Since this quality measure uses prices, we
can only construct it for exporting firms. We estimate the following regression:

                              ln Xf pc +  ln U Vf pc = c + p +         f pc                            (45)

where Xf pc is the quantity of exports of product p by firm f to country c and U Vf pc is its
unit value. We set  = 5. The estimated (logarithm of) quality is given by ^f pc /( - 1).
We aggregate it to the firm level by taking its simple average across all varieties (product-
country pairs) exported by the firm.
   Figure A2 plots this measure of firm quality against average firm wages (left panel)


                                                      52
and against the wages of the firm's suppliers (right panel). In both plots, each circle
represents the average value of the variables on the axes for each bin, where the bins are
constructed from the x-axis. All variables are adjusted for their industry averages (4-digit
NACE level). The relationship is positive, especially in the upper deciles. There is also
considerable overlap in the classification of firms by wage quintile, which is used in the
estimation. When the quintiles are constructed based on wages, almost half of the firms
(45 percent) in the lowest (highest) quintile fall into the lowest (highest) two quintiles of
firm quality. When the middle quintile is included, both shares rise to 65 percent.

Notes: We define the wage of a firm as the firm's wage bill divided by the number of workers. Quality is
estimated from equation (45). Both the x- and the y-axis variables are demeaned from the 4-digit NACE
industry averages.



A.4                                  Geographic Clustering of Business Partners
We confirm that the baseline results of assortative matching in Table 2 are not driven by
geographic clustering of similar firms. In the baseline, we control for the firm's province,
because each province in Turkey roughly reflects a labor market. Turkey has 81 provinces,
each divided into districts. The total number of districts is close to 1,000. In panel A of
Table A3, we add to our baseline estimates district fixed effects. The coefficients on the
total, extensive and intensive margins of assortative matching are all very close to the
baseline.
   An additional concern is that labor market shocks may affect both a firm's average
wage and its suppliers' wages if firms are more likely to match within provinces. To
address this concern, we construct a firm's suppliers' wages by excluding suppliers in the
province of the firm. We repeat the assortative matching regressions and present the



                                                                        53
results in panel B of Table A3. The results are again close to the baseline.35 We obtain
similar estimates from this sample to the baseline estimates. This tells us that our results
are not driven by local trade links or common local labor market conditions.
    The VAT dataset that we use to identify domestic buyer-supplier links aggregates
transactions at the firm (instead of establishment) level. We investigate whether positive
assortative matching on wages is driven by firms with establishments in more than one
province. In panel C of Table A3, we repeat the assortative matching regressions ex-
cluding these firms as buyers and suppliers. The estimates again indicate strong positive
assortative matching on wages, and the coefficient on the extensive margin is close to
the original. The coefficient on the intensive margin is smaller than the baseline. Single-
establishment firms generally have few trading partners, and so it is more difficult in this
subset to establish the extent to which skill-intensive firms spend relatively more on their
skill-intensive suppliers.

Notes: The wage is defined as the average value of monthly payments per worker. The suppliers' average
wage log wageS f is defined in equation (1). Ind and prov refer to 4-digit NACE industries and provinces,
respectively. Equations (3) and (4) define the extensive and intensive margins. They capture, respectively,
the extent to which firm f matches with high-wage firm or tilts its spending toward high-wage suppliers.
All specifications include industry-province (ind-prov) level fixed effects. In panel A, we include fixed
effects at the district-level (geographic units within provinces). Robust standard errors are clustered at
the 4-digit NACE industry level.

     The sample size is smaller than the baseline sample because we drop firms that source all their inputs
locally.

A.5      Other Characteristics and Canonical Correlation Analysis
Appendix Table A4 repeats the regression from column (2) in Table 1, substituting wages
with other firm characteristics. Assortative matching on sales is positive but less pro-
nounced than that on wages, and it is driven by the intensive margin. Sorting on the
number of firm network links is insignificant.

Notes: The market share is the share of a firm's sales in total sales of its 4-digit NACE industry, and
indegree is the number of domestic suppliers of a firm. Both variables are in logarithms. Denoting the
set of suppliers of firm f by S  f , the average supplier market share in panel A is defined as follows:
log market shareSf =       S log market  share sf , where  indexes suppliers and sf is the share of f 's
                           f

purchases from supplier  . log outdegreeS
                                        f is defined similarly using the number of buyers of a firm. The
extensive margin in panel B is the simple average across a firm's suppliers. Ind and prov refer to 4-digit
NACE industries and provinces, respectively. Robust standard errors are clustered at the 4-digit NACE
industry level.


    We conduct a canonical correlation analysis to gauge the relative importance of firm
sales and wages in driving assortative matching in Tables 1 and A4. This approach
was first proposed by Becker (1973) to evaluate the attractiveness of suitors in marriage
markets when multiple dimensions of individual characteristics are observed. We follow
the method in Johnson and Wichern (1988).
    We construct indices that summarize the attractiveness of buyers and suppliers, Ab


                                                   55
and As , as linear combinations of sales and quality:

                                         b               b
                                   Ab = k1 log salesb + k2 log wageb
                                         s               s
                                   As = k1 log saless + k2 log wages                               (46)

Since the number of variables is equal to two in both Ab and As , the maximum number
of (independent) canonical variate pairs is two. The coefficients on sales and wages are
estimated by maximizing the correlation between the two attractiveness indices, subject
to two normalization restrictions.
    More formally, let Xb = (log salesb , log wageb ) and Xs = (log saless , log wages ) denote
the vectors of buyer and supplier characteristics and k b = (k1 b    b
                                                                  , k2               s
                                                                       ) and k s = (k1    s
                                                                                       , k2 ). The
                     b     s
estimated weights k and k solve:

                                        max k b E [Xb Xs ] k s
                           subject to   k b E [Xb Xb ] k b = 1, k s E [Xs Xs ] k s = 1

If the buyer and supplier characteristics have Gaussian distributions, the estimated weights
are consistent.36

Notes: The wage is defined as the average value of monthly payments per worker.


    To carry out the analysis, we first demean the wage and sales variables from their
4-digit NACE industry averages and then standardize them so that all four variables
(ln salesb , ln wageb , ln saless , and ln wages ) have zero mean and unit variance. Thus, the
estimated weights for the different variables are directly comparable. Table A5 presents
the results. All canonical coefficients are positive and statistically significant at the 1
percent level. For buyers, the weight of the wage variable is 2.8 times larger than the
weight of the sales variable, and for suppliers, it is 8.5 times larger. This preeminence of

firm wages in matching is consistent with the bivariate correlations in the raw data: The
bivariate correlation between the wages of buyers and suppliers is 0.15, in comparison to
a correlation of 0.08 between their sales. Figure A3 shows a strong positive correlation
between the predicted buyer and supplier attractiveness indices.

B      Identification and Robustness of Shift-Share IV
       Regressions
Our empirical strategy relies on exogenous variation in import demand shocks for the
consistency of the estimates in Table 3. To validate this assumption, we follow Borusyak
et al. (2018) and verify that shocks (shifts) are numerous, sufficiently dispersed, and
relevant. First, our shift-share design relies on a large number of shocks. To calculate
  a
Zck , we use 208 distinct destination countries c and 1,242 4-digit HS codes k , generating
153,186 ck pairs.
    Second, as presented in Table A6, our shocks are highly dispersed. The average shock
is 0.30, with a standard deviation of 3.26 and an interquartile range of 2.52. More im-
portantly, the observed dispersion cannot be explained by firms' industry of operation.
In column (2), when the shocks are residualized on 4-digit NACE industry codes, their
standard deviation and interquartile range are almost unchanged. In addition, we have
a large number of "uncorrelated" shocks. To show this, we construct, as suggested by
Borusyak et al. (2018), a measure of shock importance, xck = f (1/N )xckf . This measure
aggregates shares at the level of shocks and captures the average importance of a shock

                                                                              57
for a firm. It is reassuring that even the largest value of xck in the data is tiny (0.003).
For consistency, shocks should not be highly concentrated. The inverse of the Herfind-
ahl­Hirschman index is informative about the effective number of shocks. As reported in
Table A6, the effective number of shocks in our data is close to 20,000, implying that the
distribution of export sales is highly dispersed across a large number of country-product
markets.

    Third, we check for relevance. As a placebo test, we construct firm-level export de-
mand shocks using randomly generated "shifts" drawn independently for each destination-
product pair from a normal distribution that has the same mean and standard deviation
as the actual distribution of  log Importsck . Then, we substitute them into equation
(5) to construct our firm-level placebo export demand shocks: ExportShockrandom   f     . The
results are in Appendix Table A7, column (2). The coefficient is quantitatively and statis-
tically insignificant. In addition, we confirm in column (1) that putting the adjusted and
unadjusted export shocks together in the first stage yields coefficients of similar magni-
tudes as columns (1) and (2) of Table 3. Since the unadjusted shock is a weak instrument,
the F-statistic decreases from 44 in our baseline regression to 13. This result reinforces
our focus on the adjusted shock, i.e., shocks weighted by the income per capita of the
destination country.
    Appendix Table A7 contains additional exercises. In column (3), we add a weighted
average of destination GDP per capita measured as of 2010, where the weights are xckf
(without the shocks). As discussed by Ad~   ao et al. (2019), observations with similar shares
may have correlated residuals, resulting in invalid standard errors. Therefore, adding this

variable is a useful robustness check for both the consistency of  and for inference. With
the additional control, the estimated coefficient on the adjusted export shock is reduced
slightly from the baseline estimate, but it is still economically and statistically significant.
    Next, column (4) adds the initial share of exports in total sales as a control for "in-
complete shares" as in Borusyak et al. (2018). Since we use total sales rather than total
export sales in the denominator of xckf , the shares do not add up to one when aggregated
at the firm level. This implicitly assigns a value of zero for demand shocks in the domestic
market. However, we account for shocks in the domestic market by including industry-
region-level fixed effects in the baseline specification. The results show that both the
size and the standard error of the coefficient on the adjusted export shock remain almost
unchanged in comparison to column (3).
    Finally, we add the weighted average of export shocks directly faced by a firm's sup-
pliers to column (6) of Table 3. This exercise checks whether the results are driven by
a correlation between foreign demand shocks faced by firms and those faced by its sup-
pliers. If they were, then the exclusion restriction on our instrument would be violated.
As expected, foreign demand shocks faced by a firm's suppliers raise their wages. More
importantly, the coefficient on the instrumented variable, buyer's wage, is very close to
the baseline, thus raising our confidence in the instrument.

Export Shocks and New Connections Table A8 verifies that the results in Table 4
are not driven by a few outliers in firms' new connections. We regress the share of newly
hired (i.e., after the shock) workers, who receive higher monthly wages than the firm's
average worker before the shock, on the export shock. The second and third columns
have the corresponding shares for the firm's new suppliers and new customers. The coef-
ficients are all positive and statistically significant. That is, the shares of new connections
with wages higher than those of existing workers, suppliers and customers are positively
associated with the export shock after including industry-province fixed effects.
    Table A9 relies on an alternative reference level for firm-level wages to investigate the
changes in the composition of inputs due to the export shock. It replaces the outcome of
interest in the first column of Table 4 with the average wage of new workers relative to
workers who left the firm (instead of all workers in the initial year) after the shock. The
positive and statistically significant coefficient conveys a similar message to the one from
Table 4: A positive export shock is associated with a higher skill intensity of the firm's
new connections relative to its previous connections.37 Columns (2) and (3) present the

    We also check whether the average wage of incumbent workers increased in firms that faced increased
demand for their exports from rich countries. The size of the estimate is about half of what we find for

C       Roy Model of Labor Supply
In the main text, the supply of efficiency units of labor of task q is L(q, w), an exogenous
function of the task quality q and the full equilibrium wage schedule w(q ) for all q  Q.
This appendix provides a micro-foundation for labor supply based on the Roy model
in Teulings (1995). It provides sufficient conditions for the ranking of average earnings
per firm to equal the ranking of task quality q (also in Teulings (1995)), and it shows
that we can construct a set of worker endowments such that labor markets clear and
the distribution of earnings per worker across firms exactly matches the data. These
claims hold for any fixed continuous and differentiable w--assumptions that hold in the
estimation where w(q ) = 1 for all q  Q.
    A measure H of workers have heterogeneous skills indexed with s  [0, 1]. The dis-
tribution of workers across skills has density h(s). A worker with skill s is endowed with
e(q, s) efficiency units of labor if she works at a firm of quality q . She observes the wage
the average wage of firm's new workers relative to its all its workers in 2011-2012, and it is insignificant.
Thus, in our data and for our measure of the export shock, firms seem to respond more by changing
the skill composition of their workers than by sharing rent. Alfaro-Urena et al. (2019) find a different
response to shocks to Costa Rican firms' direct or indirect exposure to foreign multinational firms. Their
findings suggest significant pass-through of positive shocks to the wages of incumbent workers.

schedule w(q ) and chooses task quality q to maximize earnings:

                                             max{w(q )e(q, s)}                                                 (47)
                                                 q Q


Let s (q ) be the set of skills that choose quality q . To ease notation, assume that s (q )
is a function or the empty set.38 The mass of workers supplying task q is h(s (q )), where
we define h() = 0.
    Then, the supply of efficiency units of labor of task q is:

                                      L(q, w) = Hh(s (q ))e(q, s (q ))

where we can define e(q, s (q )) = 0 if s (q ) = . The earnings per worker in firms for task
q is w(q )e(q, s (q )).
    In the estimation, we assume that earnings per worker are strictly increasing in q .
This assumption holds if e(q, s) is increasing in s and strictly log-supermodular. That is,
skilled workers have larger effective endowments of labor and a comparative advantage in
higher quality.
    Given these assumptions, each q in the model is associated with earnings per worker
y in the data, where y is such that the share of firms with qualities smaller than or equal
to q in the model is equal to the share of firms with earnings per worker less than or equal
to y in the data. To show that we can construct a set of endowments e(q, s) that clear
the labor market and that deliver the distribution of average earnings across firms in the
  38
     Correspondence s (q ) is a function in the interior or Q, assuming that functions w(q ) and h(q ) are
continuous and differentiable and that e(q, s) is continuous, differentiable and strictly log-supermodular.

data, it suffices to show that for any quality-earnings pair (q  , y  )  Q × R++ , we can
find an endowment function e(q, s ) such that q  is the choice and y  is the maximum in
problem (47) when the worker skill is s . We parameterize:

                         e(q, s ) = exp(s                             2

where s2 and (s           2

Parameter s2 is not identified for the same rationale as that behind the lack of identi-
fication of  2 in the firm's problem (see Appendix F). For any value sufficiently small
(possibly large and negative) that satisfies (50), we can find s       
                                                                1 and s0 that satisfy (48)
and (49). Equation (49) implies that the worker chooses q  , and (48) implies that her
earnings are y  , as we wanted to prove.


D      Special Case: One Quality, v = m
We solve the special case of the model in Section 3.4.2. Assume that there is only one
quality level and v = m   . We set v = y = 1 without loss of generality and drop
the quality arguments from functions. We take wages to be the numeraire. Labor income
is:
                            1                          1+
                       L=      (1 - m - s )( - 1) +          X
                                                         
where X is aggregate manufacturing absorption and L is the total labor force. We nor-
malize the size of the labor force so that X = 1.
    With v = m , the ratio of ads to find suppliers and customers in (11) is the same for
all firms. Then, the probabilities of success of ads to find suppliers and customers reduce

The demand functions Dm in (25) and Ds in (27) become:

                                        m ( - 1)
                               Dm = P -1

so that D = P -1 , as in Melitz (2003). Combining this expression with (7) and (24):

                                                                   1/(1- )

This yields the expression for sales in the main text.
    To get the price index, we write V as a function of price and substitute it in the
definitions of C (1) and P . Using (11) and (20), we have:

                                                         E(z  (-1)/ )
                           V = (fv )-1/ N ( -1)/                        1/
                                                                                      (53)

The fraction of expectations is less than one, and it is an inverse measure of dispersion.
If firm productivity is dispersed, the total mass of ads V decreases because the mass of
ads is a concave function of firm sales, i.e., 1/ . We substitute V , Ps and c in (51) into

    The first two terms are standard: The markup /( - 1) decreases real wages, and
expected productivity E(z  (-1) ) increases real wages, where productivity is adjusted
for the elasticity of sales with respect to productivity. The fraction in expectations,
[E(z  (-1) )]1/ /E(z  (-1)/ ) > 1, is a measure of productivity dispersion. Dispersion in-

creases real wages because the variety gains from having more suppliers and customers
accrue disproportionately to more productive firms. With search frictions, the variety
gains depend on the number of sellers per buyer, not on the total sellers in the market.
An increase in N decreases sales per firm and decreases variety per buyer. Hence, it
decreases welfare. This result arises because we assume constant returns to scale in the
matching function M  ~ . The variety gains increase in N with sufficiently increasing returns
to scale in M~ . Estimating such returns to scale is beyond the scope of this paper. We
refer the reader to Miyauchi (2020), who provides evidence and estimates of increasing
returns in matching.


D.1     Efficiency in the Special Case
We consider the problem of a planner investing in ads m(z ) and v (z ) to maximize consumer
welfare. Since markups are constant, there is no distortion from the allocation of labor
across production given network links.39
   The input cost as a function of consumer prices is:

                                            1/(1- )                    1/(1- )
                                  M~                              ~
                                                                  M
                         c=                           P =                             Ps
                                  MV                             mM

   Without markups, the consumer price is:

                       1/(1- )                                   1/(1- )

   The planner chooses ads for all firms m(z ) and v (z ) to minimize the price index subject
  39
     The service sector has no labor. Thus, although it does not have markups, the planner cannot
reallocate labor between manufacturing and services.

The first lines of (54) and of (55) are equal at the market solution, from the first-order
conditions of the firm. Since these are the only terms with firm-specific productivity z ,
there is no misallocation of ads across firms.
    There are four externalities. The first two are the elasticity of M~ with respect to M
in (54) and with respect to V in (55). They both imply a positive externality of ads
on the mass of matches, which increase welfare. But ads also create competition. More
ads decrease the probability of success of competing ads. This negative externality is
the negative one terms subtracting the elasticities. One can easily show that the two
                ~
             M dM      V dM~
elasticities M
             ~ dM and M ~ dV are in (0,1). So, the negative externality is always larger than
the positive one, which pushes the planner to post fewer ads than the market equilibrium.

E       Open Economy Model
We present the parts of the model that were missing from Section 4. A manufacturing firm
with productivity z , quality q and export status E has the following sales x, a measure
of ads v to find customers (domestic and abroad) and m to find suppliers, and price:

                              x(z, q, E ) = (q, E )z  (-1)
                                                             1/v
                                               x(z, q, E )
                              v (z, q, E ) =
                                               fv w(q )
                                                            m      1/
                                             x(z, q, E )
                              m(z, q, E ) =
                                            fm w(q )/m
                                             C (m(z, q, E ), q )
                              p(z, q, E ) =                                                 (56)
                                            -1           z

where
                                                             1-          -m /m           
                         1-                                         fm            -1/v
      (q, E ) = [w(q )]        D(q, E )       C (1, q )                          fv         (57)
                                           -1                       m
                                                              (v -1)/v
      D(q, E ) = DH (q )v /(v -1) + E (e DF (q ))v /(v -1)               .

   With the fixed exporting cost, profit is no longer a constant share of revenue. The
expected profit of a firm that draws a productivity parameter  upon entry is (equation
(40)):

                z (q,  ) (-1)
  ( ) = max                   (q, 1) f E (z (q,  ), q ) + (q, 0) 1 -  f E (z (q,  ), q )
          q Q         

                   - Ps E(fE |fE  f E (z (q,  ), q ))

Free entry implies:
                                          Ps f = E ( ( ))                                   (58)

    The firm choices give rise to the measure functions:

                    ~(z, q ) = N Prob { : z (q ( ),  )  z
                    J                                              and q ( )  q }
                               ~(z, q ) f E (z, q )
                 J (z, q, 1) = J
                               ~(z, q ) 1 -  f E (z, q )
                 J (z, q, 0) = J                                                            (59)

J (z, q, E ) is the measure of functions with export status E  {0, 1} and productivity-


                                                68
quality pairs less than or equal to (z, q ). Denote the density of J as j (z, q, E ) for E = 0, 1.
   The production function (15) and network formation are the same as in the closed
economy, except that the expressions for some aggregate variables change. The mass of
ads posted by firms of quality q to find suppliers and sellers is, respectively:

                          M (q ) =                       m(z, q, E )j (z, q, E )dz                              (60)
                                        E =0,1       Z


                          V (q ) =               rv (q, E )         v (z, q, E )j (z, q, E )dz                  (61)
                                        E =0,1                  Z



The mass of ads directed at buyers of quality q , V (q ) and the mass of matches M          ~ (q )
are in (20) and (21). The success rate of ads is v (q ) = M        ~ (q )/V (q ) for sellers and
m (q ) = M~ (q )/M (q ) for buyers, as before.
   The cost function c(q ) and demand function Dm (q ) are in equations (23) and (25),
respectively, where the price index P (q ) and total sales X (q ) are now:

                                                                                                      1/(1- )
                                                                    1-

   The cost of domestic services is defined as before:
                                                                                     1/(1- )

                                                               Q

The bundle of services is a combination of domestic and foreign services. It costs:

                                             1-                               1/(1- )

   We experiment with different assumptions on the response of the trade balance and
exchange rate adjustment in our counterfactual. Thus, we close the equilibrium here in a
generic way. Let B be the exogenous trade deficit, i.e., the difference between consumer




                                                              69
spending and income. Then, total spending on services is:

                                                   m ( - 1)
                                    Xs = 1 -                +B                                       (65)
                                                      

where we have taken gross manufacturing output again as the numeraire. Similar to in the
closed economy case, the revenue from sales to service firms of a domestic manufacturing
firm posting v ads and price p is:

                                              p1- vDs (q )

where
                                                                               -1
                                                                    1-

                                    Ps

XHs is spending on domestic services. The total demand shifter D(q ) = Dm (q ) + Ds (q )
as in (28).
    Home's exports of manufacturing to Foreign is

        X =           (1 - rv (q, 1))e DF (q )           p(z, q, 1)1- v (z, q, 1)j (z, q, 1)dz dq.
                q Q                                  z


   Trade equilibrium implies that the difference between imports of services and exports
of manufacturing equals the exogenous trade deficit B (consumer demand for savings):

                                                         1-
                                              ePF
                                    B=                        Xs - X  .                              (67)
                                               Ps

Hence, from (65), independently of the trade deficit, spending on domestic services is:

                                                   m ( - 1)
                                   Xs = 1 -                 - X .
                                                      

This equation confirms that the market for manufacturing goods clears: Gross manu-
facturing absorption (normalized to one) equals spending on services plus manufacturing
inputs into manufacturing plus manufacturing exports.




                                                     70
    Labor markets clear if:

               1                            1
 L(q, w) =         (1 - m - s )( - 1) + 1 -                             x(z, q, E )j (z, q, E )dz . (68)

    As in the main text, the aggregate functions are functions of wages w(q ), the real
exchange rate e and firm outcomes. The success rate of ads m (q ) = M           ~ (q )/M (q ) and
         ~ (q )/V (q ), where M
v (q ) = M                    ~ (q ) is in (21), V (q ) is in (20), and M (q ) and V (q ) are in
(60) and (61). Cost c(q ) satisfies (23), and D(q ) satisfies (28), where P (q ) and X (q ) are
in (62) and (63). Firms again best respond to each others' actions through demand and
cost aggregators D(q ) and c(q ).
    An equilibrium is a set of wages w and exchange rate e and of firm outcomes  such
that functions D(q ) and C (1, q ) exist and that the following conditions are satisfied:

    1. The labor market clears (68).

    2. Firms maximize profits. Firm  chooses q ( ) in (40) and has productivity z  ( ) =
       z (q ( ),  ) at the optimum. The firm export status is E = 1 if its fixed cost of
       exporting is less than f E (q ( ), z (q,  )), and E = 0 otherwise. Its sales, measure
       of ads, and prices are x(z  ( ), q ( ), E ), m(z  ( ), q ( ), E ), v (z  ( ), q ( ), E ), and
       p(z  ( ), q ( ), E ) in (56). The direction of selling ads µ(q ( )) solves (25).

    3. Trade is in equilibrium (67).


F      Identification of  2
The key parameter  2 governs the efficiency-quality trade-off in the firm's quality choice.
We discuss the identification of  2 below.
  Recall that we parameterize firm productivity in equation (13) as:

                            log z (q,  ) = 0 + 1 log(q ) +  2 [log(q )]2

where 0 and 1 are firm-specific and  2 is common to all firms. Substituting z (q,  ) into
the firm's quality choice in (14), we have:

            q ( ) = arg max  ( - 1) 0 + 1 log(q ) +  2 [log(q )]2 + log (q )
                         q Q


Consider any productivity-quality pair (z  , q  ) with q  in the interior of Q. The firm  


                                                 71
that corresponds to this pair satisfies z (q  ,   ) = z  and the first-order condition:

                                     
                             exp 0 + 1 log(q  ) +  2 [log(q  )]2 = z                         (69)
                                                                   
                                                         log (q )
                         ( - 1) [1 + 2 2 log(q  )] +              =0                         (70)
                                                         log(q  )

The second-order sufficient conditions are:

                                       2 log (q )
                         2 ( - 1) 2 +             0             for all q .                  (71)
                                       (log(q ))2

For any  2 satisfying (71) and any (z  , q  ), we can find (0   
                                                                 , 1  
                                                                        ) that satisfies (69) and
                                                                       
(70). So, firm  produces output of quality q with efficiency z in equilibrium.
    Two points are in order. First, the parameter 1 governs the firm's quality choice
in (70), and 0 governs its productivity at the chosen quality in (69). Thus, these two
dimensions of firm heterogeneity allow us to non-parametrically fully match the joint
distribution of wages (quality rank) and sales in the data.
    Second, the parameter  2 is not identified with the cross-sectional distribution of
sales and wages. We identify it with the elasticity of firms' choices of q with respect to
idiosyncratic shocks to the economy. Denote the model fundamentals of the economy as
, and consider a shock that affects an element i for a single firm  . The first-order
condition (70) implicitly defines the firm's optimal choice q ( ) as a function of parameter
i :
                                                  2 log (q ( ))
                          log q ( )                 log q i
                                    =-                      2                                 (72)
                             i           2 ( - 1) 2 +  log (q(     2
                                                                     ))
                                                              (log(q ))

where the denominator is the second-order condition (71) evaluated at the optimal q ( ).
The firm is infinitely elastic to the shock if the second-order condition holds with equality
and infinitely inelastic as it approaches negative infinity. In the open economy, we interpret
the export shocks in Table 3 as such idiosyncratic shocks. Our regression coefficients of
how exporter wages responded to the export shocks can be mapped into  log q ( )/ i .
We can also use our model-based economy to compute the derivatives of (q ). We can
then apply (72) to estimate  2 . A key assumption is that the shock does not affect other

We report the parameter estimates and the fit of moments for a special case of the model,
where we shut down the two sources of complementarity in matching (v  ) and in
production (y = 0). We match the exact same set of moments conditional on average
firm wage quintiles, except for the wage sorting patterns that the special case cannot
match by assumption. In particular, since all firms distribute their spending equally
across suppliers' qualities in the special case, the predicted sorting moments are all zero.
    Table A10 reports the parameter estimates, and Table A11 reports the data and model
moments. Except for the excluded sorting moments, the fit of this special case is very
similar to the general model. Due to the lack of sorting, we need slightly larger standard
deviation of the quality capability 1 to account for the overall concentration of network

I       Model with Endogenous Targeting
I.1      Theory with Endogenous Targeting
We modify the model to allow firms to endogenously choose the direction of their search.
In the main text, the ads posted to find customers are distributed according to a normal
density v (q , q ) with a mean equal to the firm's own quality level q . Here, the firm
chooses the mean. We also add an iceberg-type cost for firms to post ads far from their
own quality. For each v , the mass of ads directed at quality q posted by a firm of quality
q centered around  is:

                               v (q, , q ) = ~v (q,  ) exp[-c ( - q )2 ]


where ~v (q,  ) is the density of a normal distribution with mean  and variance parameter
v as before and exp[-c ( - q )2 ] is an added iceberg cost that the firm incurs if it posts


                                                   78
ads far from its own quality, where c is a parameter.
   Using the same derivation of (25), the sales to other manufacturing firms of a firm
with price p, quality q , v sales ads to find customers centered around  is:

                       ~ m (q,  )
                 p1- v D
               ~ m (q,  ) = m  - 1
         where D
                                               v (q )
                                                      y (q , q )v (q ,  )c(q )-1 X (q )dq
                                           Q   M (q )

All firms with the same quality choose the same mean so that the demand shifter is:

                                                  ~ m (q,  )}
                                    Dm (q ) = max{D
                                                


I.2   Estimation and Counterfactual with Endogenous Targeting
We find it hard to separately identify the variance parameter v and the iceberg cost
parameter c . The model simulations are unstable if c  0 because all firms want to
target their ads to more productive firms and more productive firms locate where the
ads are concentrated. But for a wide range of positive cost parameter c , there is a
corresponding variance parameter v that allows the model to match the data moments
almost equally well. The intuition is that while an increase in the iceberg cost makes it
more costly to target qualities further away, it can be partly offset by an increase in the
variance parameter of directed search. To see this, we report moments for two calibrated
models in Table A12, one with c = 1, v = 3.04 (Endogenous target 1) and the other
with c = 0.20, v = 2.87 (Endogenous target 2), while the remaining parameters are fixed
at the baseline estimated value. The cost parameter can be interpreted as the following:
When targeting one standard deviation away from its own quality, a seller loses 68 percent
of its ads if c = 1, and it loses only 20 percent of its ads if c = 0.20. Clearly, in Table
A12, despite the difference in c and v , the two endogenous targeting models generate
very similar moments. These model moments are also close to the moments implied by
the exogenous targeting model and the data in Table A12. Given the lack of identification,
we restrict our baseline model and estimation to the simpler exogenous-targeting case.
    We further investigate the robustness of our baseline counterfactual results. After
a 5 percent increase in export demand, the average wage of all firms increases by 1.26
percent and 1.39 percent in the endogenous targeting models, which is very close to the
1.22 percent increase in the exogenous targeting case. The average changes for exporters
and non-exporters in Figure A4 also confirm that our counterfactual results are robust to
endogenous targeting.
