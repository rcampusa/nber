                                              ABSTRACT

This paper identifies factors associated with takeoff -- a sustained period of high growth following
a period of stagnation. We examine a panel of 241 "stagnation episodes" from 146 countries, 54 %
of these episodes are followed by takeoffs. Countries that experience takeoffs average 2.3% annual
growth following their stagnation episodes, while those that do not average 0% growth; 46% of the
takeoffs are "sustained," i.e. lasting 8 years or longer. Using probit estimation, we find that de jure
trade openness is positively and significantly associated with takeoffs. A one standard deviation increase
in de jure trade openness is associated with a 55% increase in the probability of a takeoff in our default
specification. We also find evidence that capital account openness encourages takeoff responses, although
this channel is less robust. Measures of de facto trade openness, as well as a variety of other potential
conditioning variables, are found to be poor predictors of takeoffs. We also examine the determinants
of nations achieving sustained takeoffs. While we fail to find a significant role for openness in determining
whether or not takeoffs are sustained, we do find a role for output composition: Takeoffs in countries
with more commodity-intensive output bundles are less likely to be sustained, while takeoffs in countries
that are more service-intensive are more likely to be sustained. This suggests that adverse terms of
trade shocks prevalent among commodity exports may play a role in ending long-term high growth
episodes.

1. Introduction and overview


       The purpose of this paper is to identify factors associated with growth acceleration from

economic stagnation – a process dubbed by Rostow (1960) as Economic Takeoff. Understanding

economic takeoffs remains the cornerstone of macro development – closing the income/capita

gaps between the poorer countries and the OECD may be predicated on their ability to transition

towards higher growth rates, potentially leading to a “takeoff.” Rostow (1960) was among the

first to put stagnation and the transition to growth at the center of macro-development,

articulating conditions leading to a takeoff. He conjectured that economies evolves in stages –

“The take-off is the interval when the old blocks and resistances to steady growth are finally

overcome. The forces making for economic progress, which yielded limited bursts and enclaves

of modern activity, expand and come to dominate the society. Growth becomes its normal

condition.”

       Despite the proliferation of cross country growth regressions and the recent studies on

“miraculous” growth of emerging markets, empirical investigations of takeoffs have provided

mixed results. Easterly (2005) recently investigated takeoffs, using a benchmark definition of a

takeoff as going from about zero growth (between -0.5 and 0.5 percents) to “permanent” stable

positive per capita growth (above 1.5 percent). He found that, examining the experience of 127

countries, there are only 9 takeoffs, deducing that “The idea of the takeoff does not garner much

support in the data. Takeoffs are rare in the data, most plausibly limited to the Asian success

stories.” Instead, he concluded that “gradual accelerations” are more prevalent than takeoffs.

Parente and Prescott (2005) offer a different perspective. They take a political economy view of

the obstacles to growth – “a country will catch up to the leading industrial countries only if it

eliminates constraints preventing its adoption of leading technologies. Removal of these



                                                  1
constraints is likely to meet resistance, as the constraints are typically constructed to protect

specialized groups of factor suppliers and corporate interests.”1

         Other explanations of stagnation in the literature suggest that factor endowments may

inhibit adoption of leading technologies and result in stagnation. Basu and Weil (1998) develop a

model where stagnation can result from emerging market countries possessing factor proportions

too different from leader countries where technological innovation occurs. This leads

technological innovations to be “inappropriate” for countries that are too far behind, so that

divergence occurs. Benhabib and Spiegel (2005) introduce a model where insufficient

endowments of human capital preclude technology adoption from advanced countries. Similarly,

Easterly (2005) notes that a poverty trap could emerge in a Lucas-type (1988) model where low

skill levels in the labor force might discourage new entrants into the labor force from acquiring

higher skills.

         In a recent paper, Hausmann, Pritchett and Rodrik [HPR (2005)] examine episodes of

sustained rapid acceleration in economic growth. They study a cross-country panel with

potential acceleration dates ranging from 1957 through 1992. In contrast to the takeoff results for

permanent takeoffs in Easterly, they find that episodes of sustained acceleration are quite

frequent. They identify more than 80 such acceleration episodes, with the unconditional

probability that a country will experience a growth acceleration during a decade estimated to be

at around 25%.

  Applying Maddison’s data, they find evidence that late starters of takeoffs have been able to double their incomes
in far shorter time periods compared to earlier starters. For “early starters,” which are those achieving 10 percent of
the 1985 U.S. GDP/Capita level before 1950, the median length of the time to double their GDP/Capita is 45 years.
For “late starters,” defined as those achieving 10 percent of the 1985 U.S. level after 1950, the median length of the
doubling period is 15 years.



                                                           2
         HPR find that changes in the political regime, identified as a significant changes in a

nation’s polity score [Marshall and Jaggers (2002)], the death of a national leader, or the end of a

war, are important predictors of acceleration episodes. In contrast, they find economic reforms,

proxied in their panel as transitions towards open trade policy using the Wacziarg and Welch

(2003) update of the Sachs-Warner (1995) data set, have no significant impact on the probability

of an acceleration.2 They conclude that accelerations, while by no means rare, tend to be caused

predominantly by idiosyncratic changes difficult to reconcile with country characteristics

commonly associated with superior long-term growth in the literature.

         Our analysis identifies “takeoffs” as intermediate phenomena between Easterly’s more

permanent takeoff definition, which revealed only 9 takeoffs in the experience of 127 countries

(5 in the 44 country Maddison data set), and HPR’s measures of accelerations, which include

already fast-growing nations – for example China in 1990, which accelerated from 4.2% to 8.0%

growth - and identify 80 accelerations. We define takeoffs as transitions from stagnation to

robust growth, where stagnations are defined as five-year periods with average real per capita

GDP growth below 1% and significant growth is defined as experiencing a period of real per

capita GDP growth exceeding 3% over a minimum of 5 years within 10 years of the stagnation

period. Of the 241 stagnation episodes in our full sample of 146 countries, 1950-2000, 54 % are

followed within 10 years by takeoffs. The average duration of takeoffs in our sample exceeds 9

years. Moreover, the takeoffs that we examine in our study are phenomena that merit interest.

For example, countries that experienced takeoffs according the base definition in our study

averaged 2.3% annual real per capita GDP growth from their stagnation episodes, while those

 However, they found that economic reform is a statistically significant predictor of growth accelerations that are
sustained.



                                                          3
that did not averaged 0% growth.3 Average growth increases from -0.6% during stagnation

episodes to 3.6% during takeoffs; 46% of the takeoffs are relatively “sustained,” i.e. lasting 8

years or longer -- the fortunes of countries that either did or did not experience takeoff episodes

are therefore markedly different.

           Our motivation for examining this intermediate type of takeoff is two-fold: First, relative

to the growth accelerations studied by HPR, our definition reflects the view that the first step of

the economic takeoff, from stagnation to growth, is likely to differ from an acceleration in a

country that is already growing at a significant base. This is consistent with Parente and

Prescott’s and Rostow’s conjecture that the political economy transformation and the hurdles

needed to overcome stagnation potentially differ from general growth accelerations. As such,

there might be greater scope for economic policy to influence outcomes among these types of

takeoffs.

           Second, we adopt a takeoff definition that is less stringent than that in Easterly because

economic stagnations are themselves costly phenomena that merit attention. While we accept

Easterly’s conjecture that permanent takeoffs from poverty traps are too rare to be systematically

studied, our analysis below demonstrates that takeoffs of substantial duration from stagnation

episodes are still relatively common. The data demonstrate that countries that exhibit these long

periods of robust growth sometimes fall back into stagnation periods. While such a pattern might

preclude the Easterly definition of a takeoff as a permanent increase to robust growth, it is still

the case that welfare in the country is increased for having experienced the takeoff episode. As

such, the determinants of takeoff episodes warrant attention.

           The methodology we adopt is inspired by Hausmann, Pritchett and Rodrik (2005),

refocusing on issues dealing with takeoffs. Our baseline criterion for a takeoff is more stringent
3
    These growth figures are calculated from the stagnation episode date to the end of the sample for each country.


                                                            4
than Easterly (2005) in terms of the post takeoff growth, but less stringent in terms of the

duration of significant growth needed to be counted as a takeoff. This reflects our conjecture

that the capacity to takeoff may differ from the capacity to sustain such a takeoff. It also implies

that we may end up with more takeoffs than the one identified by Easterly (2005), some

sustainable and some not. Of course, the discrete definition of a takeoff episode is arbitrary, so

we subject our findings to a battery of robustness tests.

       Our summary statistics below demonstrate that countries that do and do not experience

takeoff episodes within 10 years of stagnation dates differ markedly in the degree of openness

that their countries exhibited during their stagnation episodes. Episodes that yield positive

takeoff responses have measurably higher levels of de jure and de facto trade openness, lower

average tariff rates, and higher capital account openness. All of these differences are significant

at least a 10% confidence level, with the difference in de jure openness being significant at a 1%

confidence level. Positive takeoff responses are measurably more likely to occur following the

end of a war, among countries with higher average education levels in the population, and have

measurably lower shares of commodities in their output bundles relative to GDP. We then turn

to parametric evidence, conducting probit estimation concerning the presence or absence of a

takeoff within ten years of a stagnation episode. de jure trade openness is again positively and

significantly associated with takeoffs. We also find that capital account openness encourages

takeoff responses, although this channel exhibits less robustness.

       In contrast to our results on the determinants of whether a takeoff occurs, we fail to find

much of a role for openness in determining whether or not the takeoffs that countries experience

are sustained. We again conduct probit estimation over the set of takeoffs to examine the

determinants of whether or not a takeoff was sustained, defined as equal to or exceeding eight




                                                 5
years in length. We find that takeoffs sustainability is harder to achieve for countries with high

shares of commodities in their output bundle, but easier for countries with high shares of services

in their output. This suggests that a commodity-intensive economy is more likely to suffer from

swings in terms of trade that may forestall a high growth episode, while the service sector is

likely to be more stable.

       The low explanatory power of our regressions concerning the duration of takeoffs does

not negate the importance of our earlier results concerning the presence or absence of takeoffs,

but it does suggest that more research is needed to understand the factors terminating takeoffs.

Better understanding of these issues may require looking at non-linear interactions between

shocks, social structures and institutions of conflict management, as Rodrik’s (1999) study of the

growth collapse after the mid-1970s.

       The remainder of the paper is divided into six sections. Section 2 discusses the data and

methodology. Section 3 overviews the parametric results. Section 4 reviews the robustness

checks. Section 5 summarizes the determinants of sustained takeoffs, and Section 6 concludes.



2. Data and methodology

2.1 Data

       Our data is an unbalanced panel of 146 countries from 1950 through 2000. Based on our

definition of stagnation episodes, outlined below, we end up with 114 countries with potential

takeoff dates ranging from 1960 through 1995.

       Our main explanatory variables of interest are policy variables associated with national

openness. We estimate our de jure measure of trade openness, de jure openness, using the update

of the Sachs-Warner (1995) openness index constructed by Wacziarg and Welch (2003). This




                                                 6
variable takes value 1 during periods identified as open and 0 otherwise. As discussed in

Rodriguez and Rodrik (2001), the index considers not only trade openness, but also structural

features such as the presence of marketing boards and socialist economic regimes. As such, we

follow HPR (2005) in interpreting a country’s score on this index as being indicative of broader

economic reforms.4 We estimate de facto openness in terms of exports plus imports over GDP,

measured in local currency using IMF International Financial Statistics data. We also examine

tariff averages, Avg. tariff rate, using the Dollar-Kraay (2004) data.5 Finally, capital account

openness, provides a de jure measure of capital account openness from Chinn and Ito (2006).

           Data on national output and population was taken from the Penn World Tables. We use

chain-weighted per capita GDP estimates. Output and population are measured in logs, lgdp and

lpop respectively. These variables, combined with regional dummy variables, Latin America,

Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and OECD, form our base specification.6

           We then subject our base specification to the addition of a number of alternative

conditioning variables. We condition for changes in the net barter terms of trade using data from

the World Development Indicators, or the IMF International Financial Statistics price indices of

exports and imports for countries that are missing in our primary data source. Our measured




4
  We measure de jure openness as whether a country is open or closed on the stagnation date. As such, the positive
coefficient we obtain below suggests that holding all else equal, being open raises the likelihood of going from
stagnation to takeoff. In contrast, HPR (2005) measure changes in de jure openness, concentrating on changes in the
level of openness as indicators of reform. Our use of the level of openness treats countries that have been open for a
long time equivalently to those that have just opened, but it distinguishes these countries from those that remain
closed.

    Tariffs are measured as average tariff rates within 10 years of stagnation date.

 All OECD countries are classified as in OECD. Non-OECD Latin American and Caribbean countries are classified
as in Latin America. Sub-Saharan African countries are classified as in Sub-Saharan Africa. Non-OECD South and
East Asian countries are classified as in Asia, and remaining non-OECD countries are classified as in Other.

change in the terms of trade dTOT is then measured as the average percentage in the terms of

trade measure over the five year period beginning in the current year.7

         We condition for human capital average years of education in the population above the

age of 25 from the Barro and Lee (1993) data set.

         Following HPR, we estimate political regime changes, regchange, as a three-unit change

in the Marshall-Jaggers (2002) Polity IV data set. We also examine the Lead_Death political

variable from the Jones and Olken (2005) data set, which takes value 1 if the country’s leader has

died within the previous five years newly-deceased leader. We also use the War_End and

Civil_War variables, from the Correlates of War (2002) data base. The former takes value 1 if

there has been a cessation of conflict within the previous five years and 0 otherwise, while the

latter takes value 1 if there has been an end of a civil war within the previous five years and 0

otherwise.

         To condition for financial development, we examine the ratios of domestic credit, liquid

liabilities, and cash to GDP, respectively named DomCredit, Liquid, and Money. Data is obtained

from the World Development Indicators.

         Finally, we also condition for the overall structure of the economy, by introducing

measures of manufacturing, commodities, and services as a share of GDP. These variables are

labeled Manuf/GDP, Comm/GDP, and Serv/GDP respectively. Data for these variables was also

obtained from the World Development Indicators.

  To maximize the sample size, in cases where terms of trade data where unavailable in the initial year, but were
available within four years of the initial year, we used terms of trade changes over the five year interval beginning in
the first year for which data was available. This interval remains within the ten year interval over which we searched
for takeoffs.


                                                           8
 2.2 Takeoff Definitions

         To examine takeoff episodes, we first identify dates during stagnation episodes where

 takeoffs can potentially occur. These dates are defined as the last year of a five-year interval

 where real per capita GDP growth is below 1.0%. It is therefore possible (and indeed occurs) that

 a country in our sample can have more than one potential takeoff date. However, we don’t want

 potential takeoff dates to overlap across five-year episodes or occur during takeoffs.

 Consequently, we assume that for a country to have a second potential takeoff date, it must

 achieve at least moderate growth (above 1%) subsequent to the initial stagnation episode date.

 We also rule out potential takeoff dates during takeoff episodes, as defined below.

         A takeoff is then defined as occurring if there is a consecutive five year interval of high

 growth (more than 3%) within ten years of the potential takeoff date. We are also interested in

 the determinants of the duration of takeoffs. We time the end of a takeoff episode as occurring in

 the first year where average growth since the start of the takeoff falls below 3%. The duration of

 a takeoff is then measured as the time from the first to last years of the high growth period. The

 full set of takeoffs and non-takeoffs in our sample are listed in the appendix.

         We understand that to some extent these values are arbitrary, so we subject our results

 below to a battery of robustness tests to ensure that our results are not driven by these definitions.



2.3 Characteristics of Takeoffs:

         Summary statistics for takeoff episodes by region are shown in Table 1. The data reveal

 some interesting patterns: First, it can be seen that takeoff episodes are relatively common,

 similar to the findings for accelerations by HPR. Of the 241 stagnation episodes in our full

 sample, 54.4%, or 131 are followed within 10 years by takeoffs. Average growth increases from




                                                   9
-0.6% during stagnation episodes to 3.6%. 46.4% of the takeoffs in our sample meet our

definition of being “sustained,” i.e. lasting 8 years or longer.

           The distribution of takeoffs is shown in Figure 1. There are a large number of takeoffs at

or close to the minimum takeoff length of five years, but there are also a significant number of

takeoffs of much longer duration, with three exceeding 30 years in duration.8 The average

duration of takeoffs in our sample exceeds 9 years.9

           The distribution of takeoffs across time in our sample is shown in Table 2. While there is

a bit of clustering at the initial potential takeoff date, 1960, by and large the takeoffs are

distributed relatively evenly across the sample.

           The breakdowns by region reveal a significant amount of heterogeneity at the regional

level. The Sub-Saharan Africa region contains the greatest number of stagnation dates and

exhibits the smallest share of stagnation dates followed by takeoffs (41.1%). The Asia and Other

regions exhibit the highest takeoff percentages, at 70.8% and 88.5% respectively.10 The OECD

nations as a group also exhibit a relatively high incidence of takeoff (66.7%) suggesting that

once a level of development is reached, countries are unlikely to become mired in very low

growth episodes for significant periods of time before returning to robust growth.

           There are also notable differences in takeoff characteristics across regions. The Sub-

Saharan Africa region exhibited the smallest share of sustained takeoffs, with only 31.6% of


8
    The three countries with takeoffs equal to or exceeding thirty years in duration are the Congo, Israel, and Morocco.
9
  There are also 41 takeoffs in our sample that last beyond the end of our data, precluding measurement of their
duration. These takeoffs have lasted an average of 13.4 years by the end of our sample, so our estimate of average
takeoff duration would be increased if these episodes could be included. Takeoffs are considered unsustained if we
have data that demonstrates that the takeoff ended within eight years of its beginning and sustained if data exists that
demonstrates that the takeoff lasted at least eight years. Takeoffs with missing data that precludes them from
inclusion into either category are treated as missing in our examinations of takeoff sustainability below.
10
   Countries included in the “Other” region in our sample include Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Hungary, Iceland, Iran,
Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Poland, Romania, Syria, and Tunisia.


                                                           10
takeoffs exceeding the 8 year threshold, while the Other region exhibited the highest share of

sustained takeoffs at 76.5%. However, the Sub-Saharan African region exhibited the highest

average growth during takeoff episodes, averaging around 3.8% during takeoff episodes, a major

jump from the -0.8% average growth the observations from that region exhibit during stagnation

episodes.

       Table 2 summarizes the differences in summary statistics for sub-samples of countries

that do [dubbed positive] and do not experience [dubbed negative] takeoff episodes within 10

years of stagnation dates. It can be seen that positive and negative takeoff responses differ

markedly in the degree of openness that their countries exhibited during their stagnation episodes.

Episodes that yield positive takeoff responses have measurably higher levels of de jure and de

facto trade openness, lower average tariff rates, and higher capital account openness. All of these

differences are significant at least a 10% confidence level, with the difference in de jure

openness being significant at a 1% confidence level.

       Among the other explanatory variables, only three exhibit significant differences.

Positive takeoff responses are measurably more likely to occur following the end of a war,

among countries with higher average education levels in the population, and have measurably

lower shares of commodities in their output bundles relative to GDP. All of these measurable

differences appear to enter as one would predict.

       Whether or not a country responds to stagnation episode with a takeoff has significant

implications for its subsequent growth experience. Figure 3 displays the histograms of average

growth rates subsequent to the stagnation date for countries that did and did not achieve takeoffs.

These distributions are quite different, as countries that experienced takeoffs according the base




                                                 11
definition in our study averaged 2.3% annual growth following their stagnation episodes, while

those that did not averaged 0.0% growth.



3. Parametric results

         To examine the relationship between openness and takeoffs more formally, we next turn

to parametric evidence. Since the presence or absence of a takeoff within ten years of a

stagnation date is a qualitative variable, we estimate our specifications using probit estimation

with White’s heteroskedasticity correction. As we have some countries in our sample with more

than one stagnation episode, we cluster our standard errors to allow for correlations by country.

We also estimate our specifications with regional dummies to control for fixed effects by region.

Our base specification also conditioning variables for GDP per capita and population, both

measured in logs.

         Our baseline parametric results are shown in Table 3. Models 1 through 4 introduce each

openness measure one at a time. Model 5 introduces all four variables at once. It can be seen in

Models 3 and 5 that the introduction of the average tariff variable results in a substantial

reduction in our sample size. We therefore drop this variable in Model 6, which serves as our

base specification.11

         Looking at the results as a whole, it is apparent that there is significant explanatory power

associated with openness. De jure openness is particularly robust, consistently entering at a 1%

confidence level with a coefficient estimate around 1. Our coefficient point estimate also

suggests that the variable has economic significance. For example, given the variable’s standard



11
  We also ran all of the specifications reported in Table 4 with the average tariff variable included as the openness
measure. This measure was fairly robust, usually entering at at least a 10% confidence level despite the reduced
sample size. These regressions are available from the authors on request.


                                                          12
deviation of 0.45, a one standard deviation increase in de jure openness results in an increase in

the probability of a takeoff of 55% in our default specification (Model 6).

        In contrast to the de jure results, our de facto openness variable is constantly insignificant

at standard levels, suggesting that de facto openness is a poor predictor of takeoffs. However, our

other measure of de jure openness, average tariff levels, does enter marginally significant at

exactly a 10% confidence level when entered on its own. Nevertheless, the variable is

insignificant when introduced in a specification including our other openness measures.

        Our capital account openness measure is also statistically significant at at least a 10%

confidence level in all three specifications in which it is included, with its predicted positive sign.

Moreover, as was the case for the de jure openness variable, we also obtain an economically

significant point estimate, as a one standard deviation increase in capital account openness is

predicted to result in a 29% increase in the probability of a takeoff.

        Concerning our other regressors, the log of GDP tends to enter significantly negatively,

with the exception of Model 3 with its reduced sample size. Population also usually receives a

negative point estimate at statistically significant levels, again with the lone exception being a

specification (Model 5) in which average tariff levels are introduced and the sample size is

markedly smaller. Among the regional dummies, the Sub-Saharan Africa variable is robustly

significant, which would be expected given our results above that showed this region as having

the lowest takeoff incidence. The other regional dummies that exhibit robust results include Latin

America, which is robustly negative at statistically significant levels, and the constant term,

which reflects the Other regions and obtains a consistently positive coefficient estimate at

           Overall, our results strongly indicate that “policy matters” for takeoffs, in the sense that

de jure measures of both trade and capital account openness were found to be positively

associated with takeoffs after stagnation episodes at statistically and economically significant

levels.



4. Robustness checks.

4.1 Additional conditioning variables

           In this section, we subject our default specification to a variety of robustness checks. First,

we introduce a variety of additional conditioning variables in Table 4. These include a measure

of changes in the terms of trade; an indicator of years of schooling in the population; a measure

of political regime change; indicators of political changes, such as being at the end of a civil or

other war or the death of a national leader; indicators of levels of domestic financial development,

and finally indicators of economic structure as measured by the share of manufactures,

commodities and services.

           Overall, our results for the openness policy variables are quite similar to those we

obtained in our default specification. de jure openness enters at at least a 10% confidence level in

all specifications with similar coefficient magnitudes to those obtained in Table 3. de facto

openness continues to be insignificant. Capital account openness tends to enter significantly

positive at at least a 10% confidence level, with the lone exception being Model 4, which

introduces the War End, Civil War and Leader Death indicators of political changes.

           For space reasons, coefficient estimates for the other regressors have not been reported.12

However, these results were largely similar to those reported in Table 3. The Sub-Saharan Africa

dummy and the constant term reflecting the Other region again enter robustly at statistically
12
     These estimates are available on request from the authors.

significant negative and positive coefficient estimates respectively. There was some reduction in

the robustness of the lgdp and lpop variables, although these continue to tend to enter with

negative coefficient estimates.

        Concerning the additional conditioning variables, most are insignificant, with the

exception of the regchange variable, which enters negatively at a 10% confidence level.



4.2 Alternative samples

        Table 5 considers a number of different sample populations. For space considerations, we

again suppress the coefficient estimates on the GDP and population variables, as well as the

regional dummies, and concentrate on the coefficient estimates for the openness coefficient

estimates of interest. To highlight the implications of sample changes, we run our default

specification throughout.

        We first drop countries with large (greater than 100 million) and then small (less than 5

million) populations. We next drop wealthy countries, those earning more than $20,000 in GDP

per capita, and then drop poor countries, those earning less than $1,000 per capita. Finally, we

drop each of the four regions from the sample one at a time.

        As before, the de jure openness variable is positive and significant at a 1% confidence

level for all of the sample permutations, usually with a coefficient value around 1. The one

exception is when we drop the countries in the Latin America region, which results in the

variable losing its statistical significance, although it still enters with a point estimate of 0.77,

which is also insignificantly different from 1. It is also noteworthy that we obtain a very large

coefficient estimate of 2.33 when we drop the smaller countries below 5 million in population,




                                                   15
suggesting that the probability of a takeoff among the larger countries in our sample is quite

sensitive to a countries openness policy.

       For all of the alternative samples we again fail to find a significant impact of de facto

openness, except for the sub-sample which excludes the OECD countries. For this alternative

sample, de facto openness enters negatively at a 10% confidence level.

       Capital account openness obtains a positive coefficient estimate for all of the alternative

samples we consider. However, the estimate is only statistically significant at a 10% level for

three of samples where one of the regions is dropped, the exception being when the OECD

observations are dropped. Overall, the results are in keeping with the rest of our specifications, in

that the capital account openness variable consistently enters with a positive coefficient estimate,

but demonstrates less robustness than the de jure openness variable.



4.3 Alternative takeoff definitions

       We next examine some perturbations of our takeoff definitions. First, we consider a

stricter definition of stagnation episodes. As in Easterly (2005), we limit our stagnation episodes

to those periods with growth below 0.5%. Second, we again follow Easterly by reducing the

threshold for takeoff episodes to growth periods exceeding 1.5%. Finally, we consider a tighter

definition of takeoffs, only considering growth episodes which average over 4% growth in real

per capita GDP over five years as takeoff episodes.

       We then increase the minimum duration of takeoff episodes to eight years, the time

period considered by HPR. We first examine takeoffs and stagnation episodes with the same

parameters as those above, so that only the minimum takeoff duration is changed. Next, we




                                                 16
examine the combination of the perturbations considered above with minimum eight year takeoff

durations. In all, Table 6 examines 7 alternative takeoff definitions.

        Our primary openness measure de jure openness, consistently enters with a positive

coefficient estimate at or above 1 at at least a 5% confidence level for all specifications except

the final one, which considers minimum eight year takeoff episodes averaging at least 4%

growth. This is the most restrictive takeoff definition, and as such results in the fewest

designated takeoff episodes.

        The de facto openness variable still tends to enter insignificantly with a negative point

estimate, with the exception of the specification with stagnation episodes limited to five-year

periods below 0.5% average growth where it enters at a 5% significance level. However, this is

the only specification in our study in which this variable is significant, so we still consider this

result very fragile.

        The capital account openness variable is insignificant throughout the seven alternative

specifications, entering with a positive point estimate for all but the final specification, the one

with eight year minimum takeoff episodes exceeding 4% in average growth.



5. Determinants of sustained takeoffs

        This section examines the determinants of sustained takeoffs, defined as those lasting at

least eight years at high average growth rates. We examine a qualitative specification based on

the set of observations that yielded positive takeoff responses. As such, our samples are much

smaller than those in the main portion of the study. To compensate for this, we introduce only

one conditioning variable at a time.




                                                  17
         Our results are shown in Table 7. It can be seen that our openness variables do not seem

to be robust predictors of whether or not takeoffs will be sustained. The de jure openness

variable usually enters with a positive point estimate, but is only statistically in one of the eight

specifications reported (Model 3). The de facto openness variable is insignificant, as it was

generally for the takeoff response specifications above. However, the most interesting change is

that the capital account openness variable now tends to enter negatively, and usually (but not

always) at statistically significant levels. This provides some support for the contention that open

capital accounts can be associated with greater output growth volatility, as countries with open

capital accounts in our sample appears to be less likely to experience sustained takeoffs

conditional on the occurrence of a takeoff.

         The conditioning variables tend to enter insignificantly, but there are some notable

exceptions. The regchange variable enters negatively at a 5% confidence level, suggesting that

takeoffs that take place after political regime changes tend to be of shorter duration than those

that do not. The domestic credit variable enters positively at a 10% confidence level, providing

some evidence that sustained takeoffs are associated with more developed domestic financial

systems.

         However, the most interesting results among the conditioning variables concern the

proxies for the composition of the country output bundle. Because we were particularly

interested in this variable for the determinants of the presence or absence of a sustained takeoff,

we introduced the three variables considered above one at a time.13 Two of the composition

variables, the share commodities and the share of services, enter at least a 5% confidence level,

with commodities entering negatively and services entering positively. These signs are intuitive

13
  When the three variables are introduced simultaneously, all enter insignificantly, but this is probably attributable
to the small sample with this specification (45 observations) and the high correlations among thes output share
measures.


                                                          18
if one thinks that a commodity-intensive economy is more likely to suffer from swings in terms

of trade that may forestall a high growth episode, while the service sector is likely to be more

stable.



6. Conclusion

          This paper examines the characteristics of nations that experience takeoffs, long periods

of high growth subsequent to stagnation episodes. Given the marked difference in growth

experiences countries exhibited subsequent to their stagnation episodes depending on whether or

not they achieved a takeoff, the determinants to such takeoffs are of important policy concern.

          Our results indicate that policy clearly does matter in determining whether or not

countries move from low growth episodes to takeoffs, with de jure trade openness policies

playing a prominent role in determining whether or not a takeoff occurs. We also found some

evidence that capital account openness encouraged takeoff responses, although this channel

exhibited less robustness.

          We failed to find much of a role for openness policy in determining whether or not

countries experienced sustained takeoffs, conditional on a takeoff having occurred. However, we

did find some role for economic structure. Countries with output bundles that were more

commodity-intensive exhibited a smaller share of sustained takeoffs, while those that were more

service-intensive exhibited a greater share of sustained takeoffs. This analysis suggests that

adverse terms of trade shocks prevalent among commodity exports may play a role in ending

long-term high growth episodes.

          The results in our study re-raise the question of what is the meaning of a takeoff episode.

We obtained different results than some of the previous literature in part because of the




                                                  19
difference in takeoff definitions used in our study. We do not intend to suggest that our definition

is superior; in many ways we are measuring different phenomena than, for example, the

permanent takeoffs studied by Easterly (2005). Still, as we discussed in the introduction, the

takeoffs that we examine in our study are important phenomena that merit interest. Countries that

experienced takeoffs in our study averaged 2.3% growth following their stagnation episodes,

while those that did not averaged 0.0% growth. Regardless of the fact that the definition of a

takeoff episode is somewhat arbitrary, then, these are certainly phenomena that merit attention.

Note: Countries not appearing in this table either did not experience stagnation episodes in our
sample, or experienced stagnations episodes, but not takeoffs. The later group is listed in
Appendix 3 as non takeoff.

† indicates takeoffs that did not end prior to end of sample for that country. Takeoff duration
reported for countries with ongoing takeoffs at end of sample indicates length of duration up to
the sample end. Stagnation year corresponds to last year of stagnation episode.
