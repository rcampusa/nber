                                            ABSTRACT

This paper shows that general equilibrium effects can partly rationalize the high correlation between
saving and investment rates observed in OECD countries. We find that once controlling for general
equilibrium effects the saving-retention coefficient remains high in the 70’s but decreases considerably
since the 80’s, consistently with the increased capital mobility in OECD countries.

1     Introduction

The Feldstein-Horioka puzzle is one of the six major puzzles in International Macroeco-

nomics (Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2000). Domestic saving and investment rates are highly

correlated both within and between OECD countries: in countries where and in years

when saving is high, so is investment. This fact seems incompatible with the Intertem-

poral Theory of the Current Account. Assuming perfect capital mobility, such a theory

predicts that the determinants of saving and investment are not the same. Hence,

countries should borrow and lend abroad whenever they need to invest or disinvest,

without being constrained by domestic saving decisions. Feldstein and Horioka (1980)

interpreted their finding as evidence of low capital mobility among OECD countries.

Although the relation with capital mobility is not straightforward (see Frankel, 1992,

for a critical discussion), the saving retention coefficient has been used as an indicator

of capital mobility in the world capital market. However, in the decades following the

publication of Feldstein and Horioka results, capital mobility among OECD countries

has kept on increasing while the correlation between saving and investment rates has

only slightly decreased1 .

    On the other hand, the Intertemporal Theory of the Current Account fails to con-

sider general equilibrium effects which, it has been argued, could provide an explanation

for the puzzle (see Ventura, 2003). Since the world, as a whole, is a closed economy,

world saving and investment have to be equal. Consequently, a common shock which,

say, positively affects saving decisions of most countries, tends to create imbalance in

world capital markets and decreases the world interest rate. This, in turn, increases

world investment and generates a positive correlation between saving and investment

in all countries.
   1
     This finding is relatively robust for OECD countries as a whole. However, some studies have found
evidence of a reduction of the correlation between saving and investment limited to specific groups of
countries and sub-periods (for a survey, see Coakley, Kulasi, and Smith, 1998). Recently, Blanchard
and Giavazzi (2002) finds that the correlation between saving and investment rates has decreased in
the 90’s but only in euro area countries




                                                  2
   Partial equilibrium predictions of the theory are more likely to hold in response to

idiosyncratic sources of fluctuations whose effect on world capital markets is likely to

be negligible. Since global shocks are acknowledged to be an important force driving

the world business cycle (see, for example, Gregory and Head, 1999; Kose, Otrok, and

Whiteman, 2003), general equilibrium effects should reconcile theory and evidence.

However, general equilibrium explanations of the Feldstein-Horioka finding never found

adequate empirical support since the saving-investment correlation does not decrease

when controlling for global shocks (see, for example, Glick and Rogoff, 1995; Ventura,

2003). Consequently, a belief has risen that the high saving - investment correlation can

only be explained by introducing frictions in international good or financial markets

(Ventura, 2003; Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2000, are two examples of this view).

   This paper revisits the general equilibrium explanation and shows that, unlike what

claimed by existing empirical studies, it does help to rationalize the puzzle. Previous

attempts to control for the effects of global shocks in saving and investment regressions

assume homogeneity of their transmission mechanisms across countries. However, there

are no theoretical reasons to focus only on global shocks that have homogeneous effects.

In fact, also global shocks with heterogenous effects can create imbalance on the world

capital market, unless the nature of the heterogeneity is such that the effect in a group

of countries is perfectly offset by the opposite effect in the rest of the world.

   We propose a new methodology, factor augmented panel regression, to isolate id-

iosyncratic sources of fluctuations. It improves on existing studies since countries are

allowed to react with specific sign and magnitude to global shocks. We show that

the homogeneity restriction is rejected by the data and biases the estimation of the

saving-retention coefficient. Indeed, allowing for heterogeneous propagation mecha-

nism of global shocks, the saving-retention coefficient drops significantly from the 80’s

on, consistently with the increase in capital mobility across OECD countries.

   The structure of the paper is the following. In section 2, we review commonly

used methods to control for global sources of fluctuations and propose the novel fac-


                                             3
tor augmented panel regression. Section 3 presents the empirical results. Section 4

concludes.



2        General Equilibrium and the saving-retention coefficient

Many studies document the existence of strong cross country linkages in macroeco-

nomic fluctuations (for a survey see Kose, Otrok, and Whiteman, 2003). This suggests

that international fluctuations are driven by few common sources which can generate

positive correlation between saving and investment through general equilibrium mech-

anisms. Such positive correlation is not in contradiction with the partial equilibrium

Intertemporal Theory of the Current Account, whose predictions are conditional on

idiosyncratic (country specific or regional) shocks which, not affecting all the countries,

are unlikely to generate imbalance in the world capital market.

        Formally, consider the following representation for saving (Sj,t ) and investment (Ij,t )

rates2 of country j at time t:


                                Sj,t = λS1,j f1,t + . . . + λSr,j fr,t + Sj,t
                                                                          id
                                                                                                      (1)


                                Ij,t = λI1,j f1,t + . . . + λIr,j fr,t + Ij,t
                                                                          id
                                                                                                      (2)

where fi,t, i = 1, . . . , r are few global factors affecting saving and investment rates of all
                 id and I id are the idiosyncratic components of saving and investment
countries while Sj,t     j,t

rates that are assumed to be driven by non pervasive (idiosyncratic) shocks. The

factor loadings λSi,j , λIi,j (j = 1, . . . , N , i = 1, . . . , r) are country specific and capture

the heterogeneity in the transmission mechanisms of global shocks. In particular, each

variable can react with a specific sign and intensity to the global factors fi,t (i = 1, .., r)3 .
    2
     Saving and investment rates are computed, respectively, as the ratio of saving and investment to
GDP
   3
     Heterogeneous dynamic responses of saving and investment rates of each country are also allowed
since some factors can be the lagged version of others. For example, a model with one global factor
with contemporaneous and lagged effects is a particular case of (1) and (2) with r = 2 and f2,t = f1,t−1 .




                                                     4
   For the reasons outlined above, the Intertemporal Theory of the Current Account

refers to idiosyncratic components of saving and investment rates. We consider the

following relationship
                                       id           id
                                      Ij,t = αj + βSj,t + εj,t                                (3)

where β is the saving-retention coefficient conditional to idiosyncratic shocks or, in

terms of long run fluctuations,

                                 T                     T

                              T t=1                 T t=1 j,t

   Equations (1) and (2) imply that (3) and (4) can be rewritten in terms of observable

saving and investment rates as


                      Ij,t = αj + βSj,t + δ1,j f1,t + . . . + δr,j fr,t + εj,t                (5)

where δi,j = λIi,j − βλSi,j            L = λI − β λS . Notice that the coefficients δ

     L can vary along the cross section dimension since they are function of factor
and δi,j

loadings of domestic saving and investment rates in different countries. Assume, for
                                                                                      L ’s
example, that β = 0 or βL = 0, in equation (3) and (4); in that case, the δi,j ’s or δi,j

would be equal across countries only if the λIi,j were equal across countries or, in other

words, if the response of the investment rates to common shocks was the same in all

countries.

   Let us investigate the consequences of equation (5) and (6) for the methodologies

commonly used in the Feldstein-Horioka debate. We argue that, indeed, all of them

are not robust to the introduction of heterogeneity in the transmission mechanisms of

global shocks.



                                                 5
      In their seminal paper, Feldstein and Horioka performed the following “long run”

regression:
                                     T                   T
                                  1X                  1X
                                        Ij,t = µ + βL       Sj,t + η̄j                                 (7)
                                  T t=1               T t=1

Temporal aggregation averages out from the data short and medium run fluctuations.

Therefore, the long run regression (7) is able to control for short and medium run

effects of global shocks on saving and investment. On the other hand, time aggregation

does not average out the long run effects of global factors. Whenever these effects

are significantly different across saving and investment rates in different countries, the
                                                                 PT                            PT          

will not be captured by the constant term µ and, hence, will be contained in the error

η̄j . Since observed saving is also affected by global shocks, the estimation of βL is not

consistent.

      Estimation methods alternative to the long run regression of Feldstein and Horioka

have been proposed in order to investigate the relation between saving and investment

rates and, invariably, they end up with results that point to a high correlation. Let us

start considering the consequences of estimating β by a “baseline panel regression” or,

more precisely,

                                        Ij,t = αj + βSj,t + ηj,t                                       (8)

when the data generating process is given by (1) and (2). From (5) it can be easily

seen that the error term ηj,t contains the common factors and is correlated with the

regressors. Then, the estimates based on equation (8) are not consistent.

      A method generally proposed to correct for this problem consists in adding time

dummies to the ”baseline panel regression” (8) by specifying the following regression

equation

                                     Ij,t = αj + γt + βSj,t + ζj,t                                     (9)

where γt is the so called ”time effect”4 . However this method is not always appropriate.
  4
      For an application of this methodology to the Feldstein - Horioka debate, see, for example, Ventura


                                                    6
In fact, comparing equation (9) with equation (5), it is possible to see that time effects

can properly capture comovement only if each global factor has the same effect across

countries (i.e. δi,j = δi,h for each j, h). Otherwise, the estimate of β remains inconsis-

tent. Again, this specification doesn’t take into account the possibility of heterogeneous

transmission mechanisms of global shocks5 .

    In conclusion, if global shocks propagate heterogeneously across countries, the re-

lationship between idiosyncratic components of saving and investment rates cannot

be consistently estimated by the regressions commonly used in Feldstein and Horioka

type of analysis. However, equation (5) suggests that we can relax the homogeneity

assumption by plugging directly the common factors into the baseline panel regres-

sion, without imposing any restriction on the country specific coefficients (δi,j , j =

1, . . . , N, i = 1, . . . , r). The idea is to control for the factors that affect all countries, for

example oil shocks or global productivity shocks, and that could create an imbalance

on the world capital market.

    This goal could be achieved by controlling for those variables that are mainly af-

fected by global shocks and capture the closed economy constraint for the world econ-

omy, for example world investment and world interest rate.

    An alternative approach consists in extracting the global factors directly from saving

and investment rates by cross country aggregation. The latter capture the factors

affecting saving and investment rates in all countries since the idiosyncratic components,

driven by non pervasive (country specific or regional) shocks, are averaged out by

worldwide aggregation. More precisely, as shown by Forni, Hallin, Lippi, and Reichlin

(2000) and Stock and Watson (2002), the components of the factor model in (1) and

(2) are identified and the unobserved global factors (fi,t , i = 1, . . . , r) can be estimated,

provided that the number of countries under analysis is large. Hence, we plug estimated
(2003).
   5
     Idiosyncratic components of saving and investment can also be estimated as the deviation of saving
and investment from their OECD wide counterparts as Ostergaard, Sorensen, and Yosha (2002) that
studies the excess sensitivity of consumption in US states and provinces. However, it can be shown
that this methodology is equivalent to estimate equation 9 with time dummies as in Ventura (2003).



                                                  7
factors in equation (5), obtaining the following factor augmented panel regression:


                       Ij,t = αj + βSj,t + δ1,j fˆ1,t + . . . + δr,j fˆr,t + εj,t                (10)


In order to implement this methodology, we need to estimate r, the number of global

factors and the global factors f1,t , . . . , fr,t themselves.

       Forni and Reichlin (1998) and Pesaran (2006) have proposed to estimate the com-

mon factors by means of cross country aggregates. As pointed out above, data ag-

gregates converge to the common factors as the cross-sectional dimension increases,

because the idiosyncratic components are averaged out. However, this approach may

be problematic if there is more than one common factor. Forni, Hallin, Lippi, and

Reichlin (2000) and Stock and Watson (2002) have proposed to estimate the common

factors, f1,t . . . , fr,t , by means of the first r principal components. Consistency of this

estimator is achieved as both the number of series and observations increase. These

estimates are robust with respect to some form of non-stationarity in the data6 . More-

over, the estimated factors can be considered as they were known provided that the

number of countries is not too small relative to the sample size7 .

       The number of the common factors, r, should be set in order to fully capture the

closed economy constraints on saving and investment. In other words, we need to isolate

idiosyncratic sources of fluctuations in saving and investment which are less likely to

generate general equilibrium effects.

       For what concerns specifically principal components, there have been different pro-

posals essentially based on the ability to capture global comovement. A rule of thumb

proposed by Forni and Reichlin (1998) suggests to retain only principal components

that explain more than a certain threshold percentage of the panel variance. Bai and
   6
     For time varying factor loadings and structural breaks see Stock and Watson (2002) while for unit
roots in the factors see Bai (2004).
   7
     More formally, authors’calculations based on Bai (2003) and Bai and Ng (2006) show that factors
can be treated as known if the number of countries is larger than the square root of the sample size
since there is no generated regressor problem (Pagan, 1984; Bernanke and Boivin, 2003; Bai and Ng,
2006)



                                                   8
Ng (2002) formalize this idea by constructing a criterion based on a data-dependent

threshold.

        Finally, while studying in depth the heterogeneity in the transmission mechanisms

of global shocks, we maintain throughout this and the next section the assumption of

a fixed saving retention coefficient (β) across countries. Such coefficient is meant to

provide an overall assessment of the correlation between saving and investment left over

after properly controlling for global shocks, that is all we need to evaluate the general

equilibrium explanation of the Feldstein - Horioka puzzle.



3        Empirics

3.1       Global fluctuations

This section studies the features of the International Business Cycles focusing on their

implications for the saving and investment debate. Our database consists in annual data

on saving and investment rates of 20 OECD countries for the period 1970 - 20078 . The

extent of cross-country linkages can be measured by the correlation of domestic saving

and investment with respect to their OECD wide counterparts. By regressing domestic

saving and investment rates onto the global OECD investment rates, we capture about

half of the panel variance9 . Another option is to look at OECD wide aggregates that

maximize the explainable variance. Principal components of the covariance matrix of

the data have this property.



                                   INSERT TABLE 1 HERE



        In Table 1, we show that the first principal component explains about 50% and the

second principal component slightly more than 15% of the variance of domestic saving
    8
    More details on data sources can be found in the data appendix at the end of the paper.
    9
    It is worth noticing that the difference between OECD wide saving and investment is insignificant
since the OECD countries as a whole can be seen as a closed economy.



                                                 9
and investment rates, on average. Then, at least two principal components explain

significantly more than 10% of the panel variance and capture, overall, about two

thirds of the panel variance. Consequently, the rule of thumb proposed by Forni and

Reichlin (1998) would suggest at least two common factors10 . On the other hand, the

Bai and Ng (2002) criterion proves inconclusive in our panel. These results show that

cross country linkages in saving and investment rates of OECD countries are strong.

Following Forni, Hallin, Lippi, and Reichlin (2000) and Stock and Watson (2002), we

can conclude that the factor model representations (1) and (2) describe our data well.

       Moreover, the global factors have also a strong long run effect on saving and in-

vestment rates of OECD countries: one aggregate accounts for more than 67% of the

long run panel variance11 . In addition, by looking at the percentage of the variance

of domestic saving and investment rates explained by global factors, it is evident how

their impact varies considerably across countries (see Figures 1 and 2).


                              INSERT FIGURES 1 and 2 HERE


       These findings are consistent with Kose, Otrok, and Whiteman (2003), who high-

light both strong persistence and heterogeneity in the transmission mechanisms of

global shocks. This suggests that, in order to properly control for general equilib-

rium effects, it is important to take into account that countries react with specific sign,

magnitude and lag structure to global shocks.

       As stressed in section 2, aggregates like those used above provide consistent esti-

mates of the global factors for large sample size and cross section dimension. Given

the existence of two global factors, a single aggregate like the OECD investment rate is

not sufficient to fully capture the effect of global shocks. Hence, the first two principal

components are appropriate estimators.
  10
     Since the third principal component explains about 10% of the panel variance, we perform robust-
ness checks of our empirical results in the next sub-section assuming the existence of three common
factors
  11
     The aggregate we consider is the first principal component of the spectral density matrix at fre-
quency zero. The latter represents the covariance matrix of the sample mean.


                                                 10
   On the other hand, principal components have an important drawback with respect

to aggregates like, say, the global OECD saving or investment rate: they miss a clear

intuition. While well suited to assess the strength of cross country linkages and to

estimate the factor space, in general they do not have an economic interpretation. In

order to get an intuition on the nature of the principal components, we look at their

relation with economic aggregates. In Figure 3, we plot the first principal component

and the Global OECD investment rate.



                              INSERT FIGURE 3 HERE



   These two aggregates are very similar and their correlation coefficient is 0.93. A

good candidate for the second principal component should be a variable mainly driven

by common shocks and not collinear with the global investment rate. For example, the

Global OECD Saving rate is not appropriate because it satisfies the first but not the

second requirement. The world interest rate, on the other hand, is a good candidate

because, given its role of clearing the world capital market, it is expected to react to

shocks that tend to create imbalances between world investment and saving. Unfor-

tunately, a measure of the world interest rate is not available and its construction is

problematic (see Barro, 1991). For this reason we use two proxies, the long run US

interest rate and the average long run interest rate of the G7 countries. The correlation

between the second principal component and the US long run interest rate is 0.78 while,

for the average of the G7 long run interest rates, it is 0.82. In Figure 4, we plot these

variables against the second principal component.



                              INSERT FIGURE 4 HERE



   It is apparent how the two proxies of the world interest rate and the second principal

component have a similar dynamic behavior and, notably, they peak at the same time

                                           11
at the beginning of the 800 s. These results highlight the ability of our estimates of the

common factors to capture the global forces driving prices and quantities in the world

capital market.


3.2   Saving-Investment regressions

In this subsection, we estimate the saving-retention coefficient. Results are summarized

in Table 2.

   As stressed above, the saving-retention coefficient should be estimated by appro-

priately taking into account general equilibrium effects due to the closed economy

constraint. In fact, our empirical evidence highlights that global shocks are a relevant

driving force for saving and investment and they propagate heterogeneously and with

persistent effects across OECD countries. Results also indicate that in order to capture

the effects of global shocks we need both measures of equilibrium quantities and prices

in international capital markets.

   For these reasons, in the first row of Table 2, we report results from the panel

regression augmented with the global factors proxied by the OECD global investment

ratio and the average G7 interest rate (Equation 10a). In the second row, we report

results obtained by augmenting the panel regression by principal component estimates

of the global factors (Equation 10b).

   Results from sub-samples allow us to study the evolution over time of the saving

- retention coefficient in connection with the process of integration of international

financial markets.



                               INSERT TABLE 2 HERE



   Outcomes from the estimation of the panel regressions augmented by the OECD

Investment rate and the G7 interest rate show that the saving-retention coefficient is

high significant in the 700 s and then steadily declines becoming not significant in the

                                           12
last two decades. These results are confirmed when the factors are estimated by the

first two principal components12 . The temporal path in our estimates of the saving -

retention coefficient is consistent with the widely documented evolution in the degree

of international capital mobility that was low during the 70’s and has been steadily

increasing since the 80’s.

       In order to assess the effect of misspecification due to neglecting general equilibrium

effects and the heterogeneity of the propagation mechanisms of global shocks, rows from

three to six of Table 2 reports the results for all the methods previously used in the

Feldstein-Horioka debate and for the panel regression (Equation 10c) augmented only

by the Global OECD investment rate.

       The baseline regression (Equation 8) further confirms the puzzle: the estimated

saving-retention coefficient in the last two decades only slightly decreases relative to

the previous two decades and it remains high and significant. These results indicate

that the general equilibrium effects provide an explanation for the Feldstein-Horioka

puzzle. However, this fact remains hidden if the closed economy constraint on aggregate

saving and investment is not fully captured as it is the case with the panel regression

augmented only with the global OECD investment ratio (Equation 10c, which does

not capture the effects of global shocks on interest rates), with time effects (Equation

9, which does not take heterogeneity into account) or with the long run regressions

(Equation 7, which neglects persistent effects of global shocks)13 .

       Summing up, the empirical evidence suggests that, as originally claimed by Feldstein

and Horioka in their seminal paper, the Intertemporal Theory of the Current Account
  12
     We performed two sets of robustness checks. First, results in Table 2 refer to the full cross-section
of countries. However, Korea was not part of the OECD for a large span of our sample. Excluding
Korea from our panel does not affect the results. Second,we performed regression 10b considering also
a specification with three common factors estimated by means of principal components. Except for a
reduction of the correlation in the 700 s relative to the specification with two global factors, the results
are not affected by the inclusion of the third factor.
  13
     In Table 3 in the appendix we show that (i) a high number of coefficients (δ’s) on the second
principal component in Equation 10b is statistically significant, which provides further evidence that
the OECD wide investment rate is not able, alone, to account for the effects of global shocks on saving
and investment rates in OECD countries and that (ii) we cannot reject the hypothesis of heterogeneity
in the coefficients on the two factors



                                                    13
failed to explain the relation between saving and investment rates before the 80’s.

Instead, in the last decades the relation between saving and investment has become

closer to what predicted by the Intertemporal Theory of the Current Account. Given

the partial equilibrium nature of this theory, if we do not isolate idiosyncratic sources

of fluctuations taking heterogeneous responses of saving and investment rates to global

shocks into account, this fact remains hidden.



4    Conclusions

This paper shows that, unlike what claimed by previous studies, general equilibrium

effects can partly rationalize the high correlation between saving and investment rates

observed in OECD countries. We develop a factor augmented panel regression that en-

ables to isolate idiosyncratic sources of fluctuations. Contrary to existing studies, our

approach allows for heterogeneous responses of saving and investment rates to global

shocks. Empirical results show that the homogeneity restrictions bias upwards the es-

timated correlation between saving and investment rates. By relaxing this assumption

we find that the correlation among saving and investment rates decreases over time be-

coming very small in the last two decades. This finding is consistent with the empirical

evidence that international capital mobility has increased in the last decades.

The null hypothesis of the F and Chi Square tests reported in the last two rows of table 3 is

                               H0 : δi,j = δi,h for each j and h

and the tests are conducted, separately,on the coefficients of both factors estimated from equa-
tion 10b.
