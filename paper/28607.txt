Aspirations and Financial Decisions: Experimental Evidence from the Philippines

                                           ABSTRACT

A randomized experiment among poor entrepreneurs tested the impact of exogenously inducing
higher financial aspirations. In theory, raising aspirations could have positive effects by inducing
higher effort, but could also reduce effort if unmet aspirations lead to frustration. Treatment
resulted in more ambitious savings goals, but nearly all individuals fell far short of reaching these
goals. Two years later, treated individuals had not saved more, and actually had lower borrowing
and business investments. Treatment also reduced belief in the amount of control over one's life.
Setting aspirations too high can lead to frustration, leading individuals to reduce their economic
investments.

1. Introduction
Can raising the aspirations of the poor help them escape poverty? Theoretically, sub-optimally low
aspirations could arise through a behavioral bias (Dalton et al., 2016). Aspirations spur individuals
to work harder, but when determining their effort level, people fail to account for how realized
outcomes will affect future aspirations and hence future effort. This "aspirations failure" may
cause a behavioral poverty trap: poverty begets lower aspirations, which keeps individuals in
poverty. In the absence of other binding constraints, simply inducing the poor to set higher
aspirations can help them break out of the poverty trap. This "mindset" approach has been the
focus of bestselling financial self-help books such as Secrets of the Millionaire Mind (Eker, 2005)
and Rich Dad, Poor Dad (Kiyosaki, 2017). In the developing country context, Ray (1998) was
first to highlight the potential for poverty traps due to sub-optimally low aspirations (see also
Appadurai (2004), Ray (2006), and Duflo (2012)).
There is, however, a potential downside to encouraging higher aspirations. If aspirations are set
too high, individuals may fail to reach their goals, and become frustrated. This frustration could
lead people to reduce their economic investments (Genicot & Ray, 2017, 2020). Furthermore,
frustration could have lasting negative consequences if it affects consequential psychological
factors, such as the perceived ability to control one's life outcomes.
We conducted a randomized experiment with over 2,400 small-scale entrepreneurs, who were
clients of a microfinance institution in the Philippines, to study how raising aspirations affects
financial decision-making and outcomes. The financial aspirations treatment was implemented
with microcredit borrowing groups in eight weekly sessions. It encouraged participants to set
ambitious life goals, and choose savings targets associated with those goals. We also cross-
randomized a "knowledge" treatment that provided financial education about savings, budgeting,
and planning. This enables benchmarking the impact of the aspirations treatment against impacts
of an intervention that is more traditional in the microfinance context.
We measure impacts of the aspirations and knowledge treatments with a survey two years later,
alongside administrative microfinance institution data. We find the aspirations treatment leads
individuals to set higher savings goals. However, individuals achieve only small fractions (on
average 5 percent) of their savings goals, and the aspirations treatment does not increase savings.
Instead, the aspirations treatment leads to less borrowing (a 15 percent reduction in debt) and
business investment (a 37 percent reduction). The finding of zero impact on savings and reductions
in borrowing is consistent across self-reported survey outcomes and administrative data. These
results provide evidence for the theorized possibility of Genicot & Ray (2017, 2020) that if
aspirations are set too high, they could lead to frustration and reductions in economic investments.
We also find an additional mechanism not included in their model: the survey data reveals a




                                                 2
reduction in respondents' beliefs that they are in control of their own life outcomes, as measured
by an index of internal locus of control.4
Our paper is related to several studies of the impact of raising aspirations on poverty. Prior research
has shown that inducing higher aspirations can positively affect educational investments (Beaman
et al., 2012; Bernard et al., 2019; Carlana et al., forthcoming; Mukherjee, 2017; Riley, 2020), and
induce savings and productive investments (Macours & Vakis, 2014; Seshan & Yang, 2014).
Relative to this literature, our paper has several distinguishing features. First, ours is the first study
of an intervention explicitly aimed at raising aspirations to influence financial decision-making
regarding savings and credit. Second, we provide empirical confirmation of a "frustration" effect
from increasing aspirations, which can lead to reduced economic investment.5 Finally, our results
reveal an additional mechanism through which a failure to reach aspirations may have enduring
consequences on financial decision-making, even after aspirations may have returned to their
original levels: a reduction in internal locus of control. If people respond to the experience of trying
and failing to reach high aspirations by believing that they have less control over their own lives,
this may change their financial decision-making in the future, potentially for the worse.
Our work is also related to the literature on locus of control (Judge et al., 2002; Rotter, 1954, 1966).
Internal locus of control is positively associated with many economic outcomes, such as labor
market performance and financial decision-making (Cobb-Clark, 2014; Ng et al., 2006; Salamanca
et al., 2020). A smaller set of studies has found that locus of control is a pliable individual
characteristic. Randomized treatments have been found to increase internal locus of control
(Gottschalk, 2005; Pederson et al., 2015), while negative shocks in early life lead to lower internal
locus of control in adulthood (Shoji, 2020). Relative to this literature, our contribution is to show
that well-meaning interventions (such as the aspirations treatment we study) can inadvertently lead
people to have less internal locus of control, with potential consequences for future financial
decision-making.
This paper also contributes to a large literature on financial literacy. Poor financial knowledge is
argued to be a key barrier to savings (Brown & Gartner, 2007; Lusardi, 2001), but research
examining the impacts of financial literacy training alone has found mixed impacts on financial
behaviors (Fernandes et al., 2014; Knowles, 2018). On the other hand, training combined with
monetary incentives and subsidies have been shown to increase take-up and utilization of savings
products (Cole et al., 2011). A few studies also combined financial education with goal setting and
personalized financial counseling, and found significant impacts on real financial outcomes
(Carpena et al., 2019). Our study tests the approach of trying to increase financial aspirations and
compares it to the traditional financial education approach of improving financial knowledge.

  The knowledge treatment, on the other hand, has little impact on most of the outcomes examined, and we find little
evidence of interactions between the two treatments.

  Galiani et al. (2018) find that that exogenously raising aspirations does not affect housing investment; they do not,
however, find reductions in investments, as we do.

2. Intervention and Experimental Design

2.1 Study setting and partner institution
Our study takes place in Sorsogon province, Philippines. Our partner institution, Peoples'
Alternative Livelihood Foundation of Sorsogon, Inc. (PALFSI), is a microfinance institution that
operates throughout the province. It offers savings accounts and group-based microfinance loans
to a client base mostly consisting of female subsistence entrepreneurs. Typical businesses are
raising livestock (primarily hogs); small retail businesses selling items such as baked goods, fish,
or sodas; tricycle and boat rentals; hair dressing; and reselling scrap metal. Loans are typically one
year in duration, with borrowers paying 2 percent fixed interest on the initial value of the loan each
month throughout the duration of the loan.6
For every new loan, 4 percent of the total value is withheld and deposited in a compulsory savings
account, which the client can only access on graduation from PALFSI's microcredit services. In
addition, clients have access to a voluntary savings account that offers a five percent annual interest
rate vested quarterly conditional on maintaining a 500 pesos balance. Before this savings account,
clients had no formal access to free, flexible savings accounts. At baseline in 2012, take up of this
product was low, with 43 percent of clients having 0 dollars in savings, 31 percent between 0 and
$2.50 (105.5 pesos), and 26 percent had more than $2.50 in savings.7


2.2 Treatment assignment
Our sample consists of PALFSI's universe of 3,757 microfinance clients, who belong to 190
microcredit borrowing groups, ranging in size from 6 to 47 members. We stratified these groups
by: (i) PALFSI's three branch locations; (ii) whether the group had more than 16 members (57%
did); and (iii) whether the group had 80 percent or more of its members with voluntary savings
balances of 100 pesos ($2.37) or less (59% did). Out of these 12 potential strata, one was empty.
Groups were then randomly assigned by computer within each stratum using a 2x2 design into a
control group or one of three treatment groups ­ aspirations training only (T1), knowledge training
only (T2), or both aspirations and knowledge training (T3).
Before launching the intervention and randomization, we conducted a short baseline survey
collecting self-reported savings (in PALFSI and other institutions), follow-up contact information,
and basic demographics. The 2,593 clients from 190 groups who completed the baseline survey
are the sample of interest for this experiment. Randomization resulted in 48 groups in T1, 48 in
T2, 48 in T3, and 46 in control (Appendix Figure A1). We were then able to re-interview 94.7
percent of these (2,464 clients) in a follow-up survey two years later. Sample attrition is

  For a year-long loan, this is equivalent to a 48 percent APR since the principal is paid back in weekly installments
over the year.

  For all currency conversions, we use the average nominal exchange rate for the year 2012, US$1 = 42.2 Philippine

uncorrelated with treatment status.8 We use this sample of 2,464 clients for all analyses: 586 in
T1, 618 in T2, 634 in T3, and 626 in control.


2.3 Baseline characteristics and balance tests
We present summary statistics and tests of balance with respect to treatment assignment in
Appendix Table A1. 92 percent of the participants in the control group were female and they were
on average 47.1 years old. 81 percent are married, and 56 percent have high school education or
above. The average client in the control group reported having 8,320 pesos in savings ($197). This
represents 7.3 percent of GDP per capita of $2,694 in 2012 (World Bank, 2020). Almost 60 percent
of savings are held in PALSFI accounts. 38.7 percent of the clients said that they made weekly
deposits. Across all variables shown in Appendix Table A1, means in treatment groups are not
statistically different from the control group means, with the exception of client gender (column
5): those in the knowledge group are statistically significantly more likely to be female (by 2.6
percentage points). This is roughly what would be expected to happen by chance. Overall,
randomization appears to have succeeded in achieving balance with respect to baseline
observables.


2.4 Treatment contents and delivery
The two treatments were designed by PlaNet Finance, an international non-profit organization
working to develop the microfinance sector that operates in over 60 countries. Each treatment
consisted of eight one-hour sessions. Here we summarize the contents of each treatment and
provide further details in Appendix II.
The aspirations treatment sought to encourage and inspire clients to develop a long-term approach
to personal and business finance. It used games to build self-confidence and exercises to help
participants articulate long-term aspirations and define intermediate steps to reaching those
aspirations. The first session helped participants identify obstacles to savings and empowered them
to overcome these obstacles. The next two sessions asked participants to define their dreams and
the steps required to reach these dreams. The fourth session introduced participants to the famous
marshmallow experiment (Mischel & Ebbesen, 1970), to highlight the importance of delaying
gratification to achieve future rewards. The next three sessions reviewed concepts from prior
sessions, and asked participants to reflect on and express the motivations behind their dreams.
Finally, the last session emphasized positive thinking and "thinking rich". The training specifically
focused on getting participants to dream and set big goals. Exhibit A1 in Appendix II provides an
example of a presentation slide used in the training ­ participants were told that if dreams are too
small, one will only see barriers, but a big dream will overcome barriers.

                                                 5
The knowledge treatment aimed to teach participants the financial skills needed to make savings
and loan decisions. It emphasized learning about assets, liabilities, budgeting, and life-cycle
planning. The first session introduced clients to assets and liabilities to prepare them for the second
session on assessing net worth. The third session reviewed simple savings and interest rates
calculations ("what happens if you save 1 dollar a day for 5 years and what happens if you save
using a bank account instead of your piggy bank?"). The fourth session focused on saving in
advance for retirement. The fifth session extended the retirement planning course to life events
including weddings and college education. This was followed by two sessions on budgeting, and
a final overview session putting budgeting and savings together.
To maximize participation and integrate trainings into clients' interactions with PALFSI, the
training sessions were conducted at every fourth weekly meeting of borrowing groups. PlaNet
Finance, together with World Bank and Innovations for Poverty Action staff, trained PALSFI's 19
loan officers, who then conducted trainings for their own groups. The aspirations module started
in November 2012 and concluded in August 2013. The knowledge module started in June 2013
and concluded in December 2013. Appendix Figure A2 presents the study and intervention
timeline.


3. Intervention Take-up, Data and Empirical Strategy

3.1 Take-up of the interventions
Take-up of the interventions was high. In T1 (aspirations only), 95 percent of clients attended at
least one session, with a mean of 73 percent of sessions and median of seven out of eight sessions.
Thirty percent of clients attended all sessions. In T2 (knowledge only), 80 percent attended at least
one session, with a mean of 64 percent of sessions and median of seven out of eight sessions, and
36 percent attending all sessions. Clients in the third treatment group (both aspirations and
knowledge treatments) attended a median of 11 out of 16 sessions, with 93 percent attending at
least one aspirations training session, and 79 percent at least one knowledge training session, and
a mean attendance rate of 64 percent of all sessions. 13 percent in this group attended all 16
sessions.9
The fact that the treatment sessions were held during regular PALFSI group meetings likely
contributed to high attendance rates, especially relative to many standalone financial education
programs (Ibarra et al., 2019). Attendance rates are comparable to business training attendance
rates when training has been provided by microfinance credit officers: 71 percent in Field, et al.
(2010), 50 percent in Giné and Mansuri (2020) and 76-88 percent in Karlan and Valdivia (2011).

3.2 Survey and administrative data
The primary outcomes of this study are savings and loan balances of study participants. We use
both self-reported outcomes from our endline survey, as well as administrative outcomes from
PALFSI's financial records. The outcomes from administrative data are important to rule out
possible reporting biases (experimenter demand effects) in survey data.10 The survey data provide
insights into savings and borrowing from institutions other than PALFSI, helping to check whether
any changes in these outcomes at PALFSI reflect shifting of financial activity to and from other
institutions (we find no evidence of such shifting).
The administrative data come from PALFSI's electronic financial accounting system and are
processed to measure average savings and loan balances during time periods relevant for the study.
The correlation between the savings account balance in the administrative data and in our self-
reported survey data is nearly one (summary statistics reported in Table 2 and Appendix Table
A1).
We fielded our endline survey from May to September 2015, approximately two years after the
end of the intervention. The survey collected detailed data on savings goals, financial knowledge,
savings and borrowing (at PALFSI and other institutions), business activity, and household
expenditures and assets. We also collected information on time preference and locus of control.
The survey was fielded to all 2,593 clients who had valid baseline data, with a completion rate of
94.7 percent.


3.3 Empirical Specification
We estimate intention-to-treat (ITT) effects by estimating the following regression equation:

       yij = 1 + 1  {T1 = 1 or T3 = 1}ij + 2  {T2 = 1 or T3 = 1}ij + s + ij                               (1)

where y denotes the outcome of interest for client i in group j. () denotes an indicator function
that takes a value of 1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise. We include fixed effects for the
eleven stratification cells (s ) in all regressions. ij is the individual error term. Standard errors are
clustered at the group level.
This specification maximizes statistical power by using what Muralidharan, et al. (2021) refer to
as the "short model". 1 and 2 give the effects of being offered the aspirations and knowledge
treatments (respectively) in a sample in which half the individuals have also been offered the other
treatment. We are underpowered to detect interaction effects, but Appendix I reports results from
the "long model" in which separate indicators are included for each treatment.



10
  We will see that findings turn out to be very similar across these survey-reported and administrative outcomes,
suggesting that reporting biases in the survey data are not significant in this context.

4. Empirical Results

4.1 Impacts on Retention of Training Concepts and Savings Goals
We begin by examining participants' retention of concepts taught in the training. We fielded the
endline survey two years after the interventions, so the impacts we measure are those that persist
over this timeframe. We are therefore capturing lasting impacts, rather than immediate recall right
after training.
We asked participants questions on material covered in the two treatments and calculate the percent
of correct responses (the full list of these questions is in Appendix III). We do this separately for
questions related to the aspirations treatment (e.g., definitions of limiting beliefs and dream
timelines) and those related to the knowledge treatment (e.g., definitions of assets, liabilities, and
net worth).
We estimate equation (1) for these outcomes and report results in Table 1, Panel A. Each treatment
did lead to retention of concepts related to the training. The aspirations treatment leads to 1.99
percentage points higher share of correct responses on the aspirations questions, representing a 9
percent improvement relative to the control mean. The knowledge treatment raises the share of
correct responses on the knowledge questions by 3.1 percentage points, an 8 percent improvement
over the control mean. As one should expect, the aspirations treatment does not raise correct
responses to the knowledge questions, and vice versa.
We turn to examining impacts on savings goals in Panel B. The aspirations treatment specifically
focused on getting participants to "dream" and set more ambitious savings goals. The knowledge-
based treatment emphasized the importance of planning for the future and considering future needs
such as saving for children's education, which could also lead to changes in respondents' financial
goals. We find that the aspirations treatment led to higher savings goals, and higher goals
specifically for education. Education is the most frequently mentioned savings goal, accounting
for more than half of stated goals in money terms. The coefficient on the aspirations indicator is
positive and large in magnitude for both outcomes, and statistically significantly different from
zero at the 5% level for education savings goals. Savings goals as a share of household income are
also higher among individuals assigned to the aspirations treatment (coefficient significant at the
10% level). By contrast, there is no large or statistically significant impact of the knowledge
treatment on these savings goal outcomes.
These savings goal outcomes were measured roughly two years after treatment. Respondents could
have changed their aspirations by the time we surveyed them, compared to their aspirations
immediately after treatment, two years before. We did not collect information about savings goals
immediately after the treatment, so we cannot comment on the dynamics of the treatment effect on
goals over time. But the results we discuss next suggest that these goals measured two years after
treatment might be lower than the goals respondents originally set right after treatment. We will
return to this point at the end of Section 4.2.

                                                  8
4.2 Impact on Financial Outcomes
The aspirations treatment led individuals to set more ambitious savings goals, so we now examine
impacts on the primary financial outcomes: savings and borrowing. Most participants are very far
from meeting their stated savings goals. In Table 2, Panel A, the average fraction of savings goal
met in the control group is 0.050, and the average fraction of education savings goal met is 0.017.
Panel B of Table 2 shows that neither treatment had a sizeable or statistically significant impact
on meeting these goals, with point estimates below 1 percentage point. Low achievement of goals,
and the negligible impact of treatments on goal achievement, can also be seen in histograms of the
distribution of the savings goal met by treatment status (Figure 1). The distributions are visually
similar, and all have a significant probability mass at zero.
We next turn to examining treatment effects on savings and borrowing. Panel B of Table 2 reports
impacts on savings balances, and Panel C on loan balances. The endline survey collected detailed
loan and saving information for all accounts held at PALSFI, other banks and microfinance
institutions, ROSCAs, money lenders, and with informal sources such as family members and
friends. From these survey responses, we calculate study participants' savings and loan balances
(the latter variable is the total remaining unpaid balance of loans outstanding). We also construct
corresponding savings and loan balance outcomes from PALFSI's administrative data for the same
individuals, on average for the 4 months during which the endline survey was fielded (May to
August 2015), so that the survey and administrative data refer to the same time period.
Individuals in the control group report having 7,424 pesos in total savings, 6,010 of which is they
report holding at PALFSI. The corresponding administrative data on PALFSI savings in the
control group has a mean (5,619 pesos) very close to the survey-reported outcome, which provides
confidence in the survey-reported data. Corresponding figures for loan balances are 11,262 in total,
7,842 at PALFSI, and 9,318 in the administrative data. For loan balances, it appears that there is
slight underreporting of loan balances in the survey compared to the administrative data.
Neither treatment has large or statistically significant effects on savings, in either survey or
administrative data. Point estimates are in fact slightly negative. These findings concord with the
absence of treatment effects on meeting savings goals in Panel A.
By contrast, we find that the aspirations treatment leads individuals to have smaller outstanding
loan balances. The aspirations treatment lowers survey-reported total loan balances by 1,734 pesos
(a 15.4 percent reduction from the control mean) and PALFSI loan balances by 1,202 pesos (both
these coefficients are statistically significantly at the 5% level). The coefficient estimate for
PALFSI loan balances calculated from administrative data is very similar, -1,257 pesos
(statistically significant at the 10% level).
Similar patterns emerge when looking at the number of outstanding loans respondents have, in the
last three rows of Panel B. In the control group, respondents have 1.35 loans in total, about 1.0 of
which is at PALFSI (in either survey or administrative data). The aspirations treatment leads to

                                                 9
0.12 fewer total loans, and about 0.087 or 0.084 fewer PALFSI loans (in the survey and
administrative data respectively). The treatment effect on total loans is significant at the 5% level.
A slight aside is in order, returning to the results on savings goals. Genicot & Ray (2017, 2020)
would also predict that people respond to failure by reducing their aspirations, so as to reduce the
pain of frustration. While we do not have the data to explore how aspirations have changed over
time, we speculate that savings goals could have been even higher immediately after the aspirations
treatment, in which case the aspirations treatment effects on savings goals in Table 1 would be
lower bounds of the immediate post-treatment impacts on savings goals.


5. Mechanisms and channels of impact
The aspirations treatment led participants to raise their savings goals, but most individuals failed
to meet those goals. The aspirations treatment did not increase savings, and in fact led respondents
to borrow less. These results are consistent with the possibility highlighted in Genicot & Ray
(2017, 2020). If people set aspirations too high, they may fail to reach their goals, and become
frustrated or discouraged. As a result, they subsequently reduce their economic investments. In
light of this model, our finding that the aspirations treatment causes respondents to reduce their
borrowing could be due to discouragement stemming from the failure to reach their goals.


That said, other explanations for these results are possible. We conducted the endline survey two
years after treatment. One might speculate that perhaps savings did increase at some point after
treatment, and respondents withdrew these savings at some point prior to the endline survey to
invest in their businesses. We would thus see no increase in savings in the endline survey, and a
reduction in borrowing because entrepreneurs were now able to finance their investments via
savings instead of credit. In what follows, we conduct additional analyses to rule out this
competing explanation, as well as to further understand the impact of the aspirations treatment.


5.1 Dynamic impacts on savings and borrowing
To address the alternative hypothesis that savings did increase (and then was withdrawn) prior to
the endline survey, we examine administrative data on saving at PALFSI from before and after
treatment. Appendix Figure A4 show that savings held in PALFSI accounts evolve similarly for
clients in treatment and control groups. In January 2014, the first month after all training was
completed, average savings in the aspirations group was 5,837 pesos, compared to 5,829 in the
control group and 5,637 in the knowledge group (the differences are not statistically significant).
Similarly, savings in August 2015, the last month for which administrative data are available, are
similar for the two treatment groups and control. It is thus not the case that treated individuals built
up large savings that they then withdrew before the endline.



                                                  10
Appendix Figure A4 also shows the corresponding administrative data on PALFSI loan balances
over the same time period. This examines a related hypothesis that perhaps individuals receiving
the aspirations treatment increased their borrowing immediately after treatment, achieved their
investment goals, and subsequently decreased their borrowing by the time of the endline survey.
The data are not consistent with this alternative explanation, with treated individuals having similar
debt levels as the control group right after training, before borrowing declines for the treated
towards our endline period.
Further, if treated respondents were able to finance their investments through increased savings
between treatment and endline, we might observe positive impacts on business and non-business
investments at endline. In Appendix Table A4, we show that the treatment did not lead individuals
to start new businesses. There are no differences in total business value or household assets. In
sum, there is no evidence for the alternative hypothesis that respondents in the aspirations
treatment achieved their savings and investment goals in the time period before the endline survey.


5.2 Impact on expenditures
Mean monthly household income reported by households in our follow-up survey is 11,283 pesos
($267), which is less than mean monthly household expenditures of 13,124 pesos ($311). Even
allowing for some underreporting of incomes, this suggests households are spending all they earn.
Both training programs emphasized that a key way to increase savings was through reducing
expenditure. The knowledge training highlighted the value of forgoing typical temptation goods
like lottery tickets, cigarettes, alcohol and soft drinks, while the aspirations training emphasized
the value of delaying gratification in the short-term to build long-term opportunities.
We examine in Table 3 whether individuals followed this advice by modifying their spending
habits. We examine impacts on total household expenditure, as well as expenditure subcategories:
food consumed outside the home, temptation goods, celebrations, durable goods, and education.
Estimated effects of both the aspirations and knowledge treatments are small in magnitude, and
none are statistically significantly different from zero.
Given that both aspirations and knowledge treatment encourage clients to reduce temptation
spending, the absence of impacts on temptation spending is striking. This is despite clients saying
they do spend on goods that they regret later. In the control group, 84 percent of clients said they
regretted spending on alcohol, 84 percent on tobacco, and 63 percent on gambling and lotteries.
That we find no effect of the aspirations treatment on temptation spending suggests that
consumption habits are very "sticky" and hard to break (Berry et al., 2018; Bruhn et al., 2014).
The last row of Table 3 does show one area in which spending significantly fell: there is a negative
effect of the aspirations treatment on business investments. The aspirations treatment leads
business investments in the last six months to be lower by 630 pesos (37 percent below the control
group). PALFSI's microloans are typically made with business uses in mind, so this finding

                                                 11
concords with interpreting our negative treatment effects on loans as due to less desire on the part
of individuals to invest in their businesses.
This analysis helps explain why households are not saving more: they spend almost all they earn,
and are unable to cut back on spending, despite saying they regret some of the spending that they
do. Instead, they reduce borrowing and investments in their business. All told, these results are
consistent with the Genicot & Ray (2017, 2020) model, in which frustration stemming from not
achieving goals leads individuals to scale back their economic investments.


5.3 Impacts on locus of control and time preferences
We now explore an additional reason why individuals may reduce their economic investments:
their preference parameters or beliefs may change in such a way as to lead them to be less willing
to invest. This mechanism is separate from but complementary to the mechanism in Genicot &
Ray (2017, 2020). Their model does not contemplate additional effects resulting from changes in
individuals' preferences or beliefs. In our endline survey, we measured two such factors: locus of
control and present bias. We consider these in turn.
Locus of control measures how strongly people believe they have control over situations and
experiences that affect their lives (Rotter, 1954, 1966). Those who believe that events in their lives
are primarily a result of their own actions have higher scores and are referred to as having "internal
locus of control", whereas those who attribute life events to outside factors have "external locus
of control." Locus of control plays a central role in our aspirations treatment, as well as other
mindset-based approaches to financial education. The aspirations treatment emphasizes that
personal obstacles can be overcome through a positive mindset, seeking to convince individuals
that they are in control of their future through their savings decisions. In Secrets of the Millionaire
Mind, Eker (2005) argues that rich people believe "I create my life" while poor people believe
"life happens to me". This content is explicitly included in the culminating "rich mindset" session
of the aspirations treatment.
In the endline survey, we use a seven-item set of questions that measure economic internal locus
of control, derived from Furnham (1986). We ask individuals to say how much they agree or
disagree on a Likert scale with statements like "Whether or not I get to become wealthy depends
mostly on my ability" and "If I become poor, it's usually my own fault".11 We code each of the
seven items so that higher scores indicate internal locus of control and sum the total. Table 4 shows
that the aspirations treatment has a negative effect on internal locus of control that is statistically
significant at the 5% level. The knowledge treatment also has a negative effect, also significant at
the 5% level. Both treatments significantly reduce the extent to which individuals believe their
own actions determine their financial lives.



11
     The full set of questions can be found in Appendix III.

                                                               12
Why did training have the opposite effect on locus of control than intended? We have seen that
training resulted in clients setting substantially higher savings goals than individuals in the control
group, but that the average individual had only saved a tiny fraction (5 percent) of this goal, and
that treatment did not make individuals any more likely to achieve their goals. It is possible that
encouraging people to have big dreams and set ambitious goals in a context where they are not
able to meet these goals might have eventually demotivated or frustrated them and lead them to
conclude that their actions do not determine their financial outcomes.
Taking the above evidence as a whole, we then speculate that the fall in loans and in business
investment in the treated groups may be explained as follows: training caused participants to set
ambitious savings goals and make budgets, but they did not change their spending behavior, and
as a result, they were far from meeting these savings goals. This led to frustration, and reductions
in economic investments. These effects could have been compounded by individuals in the
aspirations treatment coming to believe that their own actions would have little influence in
determining their financial success (lower internal locus of control). Such a change in beliefs could
have reinforced the discouragement effect, further lowering individuals' desire to invest in their
businesses.
We also explore whether the treatments affect present bias. Alan and Ertac (2018) show that an
educational intervention that gets children to better imagine their future selves was able to increase
patience. The aspirations treatment explicitly tries to get individuals to be less present-biased. The
fourth aspirations session presented participants a video of the "marshmallow" experiment to
highlighting the gains from making current sacrifices for future gains. The knowledge intervention
gets individuals to think of their future selves through lifecycle planning and an emphasis on
reducing temptation spending.
We measure present bias using by asking individuals to make hypothetical choices between
different money amounts tomorrow versus in one month, and in two months versus three months,
and seeing whether there are preference reversals.12 Table 4 shows that, on average,13 percent of
choices in the control group are present biased, and that neither the aspirations nor the knowledge
treatment has a large or statistically significant effect on present bias. This lack of impact on time
preferences is consistent with individuals not changing their temptation spending and suggests that
while high discount rates may help explain why individuals undersave, the treatments did not
change this preference parameter.


6. Conclusions
Encouraging small-scale entrepreneurs to increase their financial aspirations did lead individuals
to set higher savings goals, but most individuals failed to achieve their goals. Two years after the
treatment, treated individuals had no higher savings, and ­ strikingly ­ were borrowing

12
     Our procedures for measuring present bias are detailed in Appendix III.

                                                           13
substantially less (in total and from the partner microfinance institution). The aspirations treatment
also led to lower business investment. Genicot & Ray (2017, 2020) emphasize that, in theory,
setting higher aspirations may lead to higher economic investments, but failure to achieve
aspirations may lead to frustration, and a decline in economic investments. Our results provide
empirical support for this theory. Aspirations should therefore be set high, but not too high. The
aspirations treatment we study may have set individuals' goals too high to be achievable, leading
to discouragement and a decline in investments. We also find that the aspirations treatment reduced
internal locus of control. This is an outcome of interest in itself, and it may also be an additional
mechanism through which the ultimate negative impacts on investment arose.
This study suggests several avenues for future research. Perhaps most prominently: would an
intervention that encouraged individuals to set more modest aspirations have had a more positive
impact? Aspirations that were more modest would have been more achievable, reducing the
negative consequences from frustration and discouragement. Future studies could investigate
multiple treatment arms where individuals are encouraged to set different-sized financial goals, to
explore whether lower, more manageable goals have more positive effects.

Notes: Each row (dependent variable) reports results from two separate regressions. The first regression result is in Columns (3) and (4) where the main independent variables are binary indicators of receiving aspirations or knowledge treatments
(Aspirations = T1 or T3, and Knowledge = T2 or T3). The second regression is in Columns (6)-(9), with three treatments (T1, T2 and T3) as separate independent variables. All regressions include a constant and dummies for the sampling
strata. Robust standard errors clustered at the center level are reported in parenthesis. *** Significant at 1%, ** Significant at 5%, * Significant at 10%.

Notes: Each row (dependent variable) reports results from two separate regressions. The first regression result is in Columns (3) and (4) where the main independent variables are binary indicators of receiving aspirations or knowledge
treatments (Aspirations = T1 or T3, and Knowledge = T2 or T3). The second regression is in Columns (6)-(9), with three treatments (T1, T2 and T3) as separate independent variables. All regressions include a constant and dummies for
the sampling strata. Robust standard errors clustered at the center level are reported in parenthesis. *** Significant at 1%, ** Significant at 5%, * Significant at 10%.

Appendix II: Contents of the Two Training Programs
Often the content of training programs is a black box, making it difficult to compare across studies.
We provide session-by-session details here to enable the reader to more clearly see what was
emphasized in the two training programs.

Knowledge Training
Session 1: Calculating Your Net Worth Part 1

Session goal: introduce clients to a structured framework for understanding their financial status, and advise
clients to save more as it will add to their assets and increase their net worth.

This session introduces the clients to the general notion of Assets, Liabilities and Net worth by asking the
clients to write down their assets and liabilities and estimating their total values. Assets were defined as
`something you own that you could resell'; Liabilities as `something you owe'; and Net Worth as `how
much is left after deducting your liability from your assets'. This session emphasized that one could increase
her net worth by saving and that the PALFSI Flexible Savings Account is one of their options to accumulate
savings.

Session 2: Calculating Your Net Worth and Understanding PALFSI's Flexible Savings Account

Session goal: teach clients how to calculate their net worth by methodically estimating the value of each
asset and liability.

This session is a continuation of the previous session. The clients were asked to assign values to their assets
and liabilities which they listed in the previous session. They were then asked to subtract the value of their
assets from the liabilities to come up with their net worth.

In this session the advantages and the disadvantages of formal and informal savings were also discussed
and the clients were given the handout about the comparison. In addition the PALFSI Flexible Savings
Account Fact Sheet handout was also distributed so that the client will better understand the PALFSI
Flexible Savings Account. The clients were also asked to create an inventory of their assets and liabilities
by filling out the handout Asset and Liabilities calculation.

Session 3: Calculating Savings

Session goal: introduce clients to the concept that saving a little bit everyday can turn into a lot of money,
to the idea that saving in a bank account is preferable to saving at home because it rewards people with
interest, and to simple math on savings accumulation.

The interest rate was introduced as `a financial reward for saving in a bank (or a formal institution like
PALFSI) or a cost for taking out loan. Saving at home vs. saving in an interest-bearing account was also
discussed in this session. The clients were given the `Computing for Savings' handout. It was stressed that
forgoing with some typical temptation goods (like `Jueteng' [a local lottery which is illegal], cigarettes,
alcoholic beverages and soft drinks) can be a source of money for savings. Saving a little a day will
accumulate savings if done regularly, was also emphasized in this session.

Session 4: Calculating Simple Long Term Financial Goals


                                                      31
Session goal: create knowledge and awareness of long-term expenses like retirement, education and
marriage, and of the importance of saving a little bit everyday to help reach these expenses.

The clients were given a copy of the `Simple Long Term Financial Goals Calculator' handout. As an
example, retirement was discussed as a long term financial goal. They were asked to compute for the
amount they should save daily or weekly to successfully retire. It was emphasized in this session that if
they save in an interest bearing account they would have to set aside smaller amounts daily or weekly for
their long term financial goals such as retirement, education etc., compared to saving at home. The clients
were advised to save more on PALFSI savings account where their savings can grow.

Session 5: Introduction to Budgets

Session goal: Introduce clients to the concept of budgeting, help them understand where they are spending
their money, their flow of income, and where opportunities lie to cut down on spending and increase
savings.

Clients were introduced to the concept of Budgeting. They were taught how to compare their earnings from
their expenses using the Budget Table Handout. Clients were asked to identify where they could cut down
on certain spending and translate it into savings. They were also asked to check if their expenses are greater
than their income and what expenses they could forgo to at least equalize their income and expenses or
better yet cut on expenses to save. It was emphasized in this session that in order to save effectively they
should first set aside a portion of their income for savings as opposed to spending first and save whatever
is left from their income. Setting aside an amount from the income will make sure that they can save and
PALFSI Flexible Savings Account is a place to accumulate these savings.

Session 6: Budgets and Savings

Session goal: Delve deeper into the concept of budgeting introduced in previous session, and help identify
opportunities to cut down on spending and increase savings.

This session is the second part of the topics on budget. The clients were asked to fill out the Last Week's
Budget and the Next Weeks' Budget Handout. They were asked to recall all their expenses in the past week
to help them think about their expenses for the coming week. It was emphasized in this exercise that
knowing about where they spent on in the last week will help them plan for the succeeding week and make
adjustments on their expenses so that they can save. This exercise will help them identify opportunities to
cut down on expenses to increase savings.

Session 7: Budgets Part 3

Session goal: Continue to learn more about budgeting, and help clients understand how hindsight and
foresight can differ.

This is part 3 of the budgeting sessions. The loan officers reviewed the concept of budgeting as a `financial
plan for a long term and short term future'. The clients were asked to fill out another Last Week's Budget
Handout and ask them to compare the Next Week's Budget handout they filled out in the preceding week.
The disparities between the two were highlighted as the difference between hindsight and foresight.




                                                     32
The difference between hindsight and foresight was emphasized in this session. It was also emphasized that
if their carefully plan and practice more on budgeting they could have a better control of their future
expenses and this would help them identify opportunities for saving.

Session 8. Financial Knowledge Quiz

Session goal: Reinforce learning of first seven sessions and review contents.

In this session, the clients were asked to take a simple quiz about what they learned in the previous 7 session
as a review. The loan officers clarified question with regards to the concepts which were introduced in the
previous sessions. It also discusses savings in general and savings at PALFSI through the flexible savings
accounts to help clients better understand the benefits of savings.

Aspirations Training
Session 1: Overcoming Limiting Beliefs

Session goal: intended to teach clients that personal obstacles can be overcome through a positive mindset,
an optimistic outlook, and a willingness to try again. The goal is to boost each individual client's sense of
self and confidence in overcoming obstacles in life.

Participants were paired and were asked to stack up Styrofoam cups (In the form of a pyramid). This was
done 3 times per client. In the first and second try, the cups were scattered on the table, but on the 3rd try
each client were told that they can pre-arrange the cups in a way that will make it easier for them to stack
it later to improve their time.

The learning emphasized was `positive mindset and confidence can help overcome personal obstacles and
planning ahead would help them better overcome obstacles. It was emphasized that savings through the
PALFSI Flexible Capital Build Up is a way to prepare for emergencies and build up capital for investments.

Session 2: Dream Collage

Session goal: intended to help clients to focus on their long term goals and organize their thoughts about
how they can reach these goals.

Participants were asked to make a Dream Collage by cutting out pictures from newspapers or draw
representations of what they want to have or achieve in the future and paste it in an illustration board. They
were then asked to make a list of the dreams in the Dream List handout from the Dream Collage they made.
They also presented their Dream Collage to the group. At the end of the session the clients were told to
bring home their dream map and post it on their wall to remind them of what they should work towards.

The learning emphasized was to focus on their long term goals and organize their thoughts about how they
can reach these goals. It was also emphasized that achieving long term goals requires planning and financial
preparations and PALFSI's Flexible Savings Capital Build Up is a good place to save one's money.

Session 3: Dream Timeline and Financial Matrix

Session goal: intended to help clients organize their financial plans and structure their approaches towards
reaching their goals.



                                                      33
Based on their Dream list from the previous session, the clients were asked to create a Dream Goal by
selecting a business goal that they could achieve in 6 months to 1 year. They were then asked to articulate
this business goal by filling out clear goals. They have to make their goal measurable, assign dates on when
they want to start and achieve their goals, and visualize it.

They were also asked to fill in the Dream Map handout by sorting their dreams as to whether the dreams
are related to their business or family by writing the dreams above or below the ladder. It was also
emphasized that the PALFSI Flexible Savings Account can help clients work towards their financial goals
and meet the plans detailed in the Dream Map and Financial Matrix.

Session 4: Delaying Gratification "Marshmallow" Experiment

Session goal: intended to motivate clients to avoid immediate gratification that can be costly to long term
gratification and inspire clients to think longer into the future.

The clients were shown a video presentation, the "Marshmallow" experiment which was dubbed in Filipino.
In this session it was emphasized that delaying gratification in the short term will create opportunities in
the long term. Like forgoing with purchasing of a new TV set and investing the money instead in their
business will give them long term benefits or opportunities in the future. The movie was a tool to inspire
clients to think farther into the future. It was also a tool to bring across the idea that the values of patience,
self-discipline and focus will help them achieve their long term goals.

Session 5: Overcoming Limiting Beliefs II

Session goal: intended to teach clients that personal obstacles can be overcome through a positive mindset,
an optimistic outlook, and a willingness to try again.

This session is the same as Session 1 but instead of 10 cups they were asked to use 15 cups. It was
emphasized in this session that situations may change, oftentimes beyond their control, but they could
always adjust to the new situation by changing their negative attitudes to positive ones. By saving in the
PALFSI Flexible Savings Account they could also prepare for any unforeseen events in the future.

Session 6: Understanding Your "Why"

Session goal: encourage clients to think deeper about their future business goals and inspire a more future
oriented mindset.

The clients were asked to fill out the Understanding Your "Why" Handout by identifying one of their
business goals. They were then asked to pair with another group mate and discuss why the goal was
important to them. They were asked to visualize their dream. It was emphasized in this exercise that if they
want to pursue their goal they should be persistent in achieving it and that they should have a more future
oriented mindset.

Session 7: Review of Dream Timeline and Financial Matrix

Session goal: bring together the lessons learned from previous trainings and inspire the clients to move
forward with their dreams.




                                                       34
This is a review of Sessions 1, 3, and 6 with the objective to inspire the clients to move on with achieving
their dreams. Believing in oneself was also emphasized in this session. PALFSI Flexible Savings Account
was again mentioned as a way to help clients save money to help them in their future plans.

Session 8: Rich Mindset

Session goal: intended to finalize the inspiration training with a discussion of how to think positively and
powerfully about one's finances. The take away from this session is that positive thoughts lead to positive
results. Furthermore, if a poor man saves his money and plans for the future, he can turn into a rich man.

For this session, the loan officers discussed the statements in the Rich Mindset Handout while asking the
clients to give examples to the group when they acted with a rich mindset or a poor mindset. When they
give examples of when they acted with a poor mindset the loan officer they were asked how to change it
into a rich mindset. It was emphasized in this session how positive thinking can lead to positive results. In
addition, a poor man saving money can turn into a rich man. For the clients, saving in PALFSI Flexible
Savings Account is a part of the rich mindset.

                  Exhibit A1. The Aspirations Training Stressed Setting Big Goals




 You may feel that your dreams cost a lot. But you do not decrease your dream, instead you
 expand your income.



                                                     35
 Anecdote:

 Ask a fresh graduate what kind of home he wants: often the answers are: Big house, with
 garage, three bedrooms, big yard, with maybe a swimming pool. This person has no income,
 yet he dreams big!

 Ask a working person what kind of home he wants: often the answer will be, "ung simple
 lang po na kaya ng pag-ibig fund".

     1. A person without a dream does not have any barriers. His future is also uncertain
        because he has no direction.
     2. A person with a small dream will always only see barriers blocking his way into
        achieving his dreams.
     3. A person with a big dream will see his dream and not his barrier. Because the barrier
        is too small compared to his dream.

C. Time Preferences and Present Bias
We measure present bias using by asking individuals to make hypothetical choices between
different money amounts tomorrow versus in one month early in the survey, and in two months
versus three months later in the survey and seeing whether there are preference reversals (see
modules below)

Respondents are given 20 tokens each worth 20 pesos (400 pesos total) and asked to allocate tokens
to the two time periods. To incentivize respondents to allocate tokens honestly, they were told that
a randomly chosen respondent's allocation will be implemented after all the surveys have been
completed. The interest rate is held constant in both time periods (10 percent, 25 percent, 50
percent, 75 percent, 100 percent). For a given interest rate, we consider a choice present biased
when respondents allocated more to the nearer period when choosing between tomorrow and one
month versus tomorrow compared to when choosing two months from tomorrow versus three
months from tomorrow.
