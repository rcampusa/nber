        Investor Behavior in the October 1987 Stock Market Crash:

                             Survey Evidence




                                 ABSTRACT



    Questionnaires were sent out at the time of the October 19, 1987 stock

market crash to both individual and institutional investors inquiring about

their behavior during the crash. Nearly 1000 responses were received.

     The survey results show that: 1. no news story or rumor appearing on

the 19th or over the preceding weekend was responsible for investor

behavior, 2. investors' importance rating of news appearing over the

preceding week showed only a slight relation to decisions to buy or sell, 3.

there was a great deal of investor talk and anxiety around October 19, much

more than suggested by the volume of trade, 4. Many investors thought that

they could predict the market, 5. Both buyers and sellers generally thought

before the crash that the market was overvalued, 6. Most investors

interpreted the crash as due to the psychology of other investors, 7. Many

investors were influenced by technical analysis considerations, 8. Portfolio

insurance is only a small part of predetermined stop-loss behavior, and 9.

Some investors changed their investment strategy before the crash.

                   Investor Behavior in the October 1987

                    Stock Market Crash: Survey Evidence



     On Monday, October 19, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 508

points, a drop of 22.6% in one day. This crash was unprecedented in stock

market history. The next biggest one-day drop in the Dow Jones industrial

average, on Monday, October 28, 1929, was only 12.8%) The October 19, 1987

stock market crash was preceded by three drops in the Dow Jones Industrial

Average, on Wednesday October 14, Thursday October 15 and Friday October 16,

of 95, 58, and 108 points respectively.

     I have for some time been using questionnaire survey methods to learn

about investor behavior. As part of the Investor Behavior Project at Yale

University, John Pound and I have done several surveys of investors to learn

general patterns of behavior (Pound and Shiller [1986], Shiller and Pound

[1987]). I have undertaken pilot questionnaire surveys immediately after a

couple of major stock market drops (Shiller [1986]) to see what can be

learned about these drops. We have found that questionnaire surveys aimed at

collecting specific facts about individual behavior are useful research

methods. We learned among other things that well-posed open-ended questions

(where the respondents are asked to write their own reply) do help us to

learn things not obtainable from traditional questionnaires. The

questionnaire format seems often to provoke thoughtful responses, as the

frequent and sometimes extensive answers indicate.

     To try to understand what happened on October 19, 1987 and surrounding


     1The combined drop October 28 - 29 1929 was 23.1%.

                                      1
dates, I undertook four different mail questionnaire surveys: two small

pilot surveys (PILOT1 and PILOT2) both mailed out before 5:00 p. m. October

19, and then a major survey of individual investors (INDIV) (mostly sent out

by 5:OOp. m. October 21) and a major survey of institutional investors

(INSTI). All questionnaires were mailed before 5:00 p. m. October 23, 1987,

so that investors would receive them while their memories were fresh. In

total, there were 3250 questionnaires sent out and 991 completed

questionnaires received, for an overall response rate (adjusting for 227

addressee unknown or deceased returns) of 32.8%.

     In this paper, I report on general survey results, and then provide

interpretations and conjectures for what happened on October 19, 1987.2



                           I. Prior Pilot Surveys

     The structure of the questionnaires sent out in the week of October 19

was informed by the results of previous questionnaire surveys following

market drops. it is useful, then, to indicate briefly what was learned from

these.

1. September 11-12. 1986

     On September 11 and 12, 1986, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped

a total of 120.78 points, or 6.43%. The September 11 drop of 86.61 points in

the Dow was the steepest one-day drop in percentage terms since May 28,

1962. Desiring to see if anything could be learned about the events on those

days, I sent out immediately after the drop in the market a short pilot

questionnaire to 175 institutional investors and 125 individual investors



     2Barron's magazine also did a poll of investors in the closing days of
October, Palmer [1987]. Their poil did not include institutional investors.

                                      2
(the latter, from a list of those from a random sample of high-income

Americans, provided by Survey Sampling, Inc., who indicated in response to a

previous questionnaire that they held common stocks). The questionnaire

asked among other things:

     Can you remember any reason to buy or sell that you thought about
     on those days [September 11-12]? (Please try hard to remember.
     Don't give something you thought or talked about later).

Of those who responded (38% of those polled) there was a near-total absence

in the answers of any "story" about the market decline, that is, any

repeated reference to a concrete news break or rumor on those days, except

for the decline in the market itself. No more than three respondents seemed

to refer to any one other economic theory or fact on those days (see Shiller

[1986]).

2. January 23. 1987

     Between 1:30 and 3:00 p. m. January 23, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial

Average dropped 115 points and then rose 60 points. I wanted to see if

survey methods could shed light on what went on in that 1 1/2 hour period.

Thinking that stockbrokers may have a good feel for investor concerns, I

tried this time a pilot survey of 1000 stockbrokers selected at random from

throughout the United States. The idea this time was to tabulate 'key words'

that were used at various times of the day. I asked respondents to tabulate

"rumors, stories, theories, names, words, facts, or expressions, that people

used in conversations at various times of that day". The response rate for

the survey was only 8.2%, perhaps in part because the survey was difficult

or unappealing to respondents and because the survey was mailed out rather

late after the market drop, so that they could not remember. For what it is

worth, however, the only key words found in the 1:30-3:00 period were


                                      3
"program trading," "profit taking," "madness," and "buying panic" and the

only other repeated theme of conversations was estimates of how many years

ago this last happened.

     These pilot surveys suggested that there is no concrete story forbig

market drops. The answers to open-ended questions suggested people were

reacting to price changes themselves, so that the price drop fed on itself

in a vicious circle. I spent some time thinking and soliciting opinions how

to write a questionnaire that would provide information about the importance

and nature of this and related phenomena. Thus, I was prepared with a

different questionnaire formulation for the market drop surrounding October

19, 1987.

                 II. The Four Surveys of the October. 1987 Crash

The four surveys were:

     1. PILOT1: Pilot study regarding October 14-16. After the precipitous

downturn in the stock market October 14-16, a pilot questionnaire was sent

out, this time to the same 125 individual investors who were used in the

September 11-12 1986 pilot survey. These were mailed out early on the

morning of October 19, 1987. Of those sent out, 51 completed questionnaires

were received.

     2. PILOT2: Pilot study regarding October 19. After the 200 point drop

in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on the morning of October 19, 1987, it

was apparent that the pilot survey mailed out that morning had missed a much

bigger stock market drop, although the full magnitude of the October 19 drop

was still not known. It was a simple matter to repeat the mailing of that

morning, with the primary change that the questionnaire pertained to October

19 rather than October 14-16. These were mailed at about the time that the


                                        4
markets closed on October 19. There were 51 completed questionnaires.

     3. INDIV: Full study of individual investors. After the closing of the

market October 19, 1987, when the magnitude of the crash was known, it was

decided to go ahead with a major survey. The questionnaire was revised

taking account of the news of that day, and suggestions of several

colleagues. The questionnaire was mailed out to 2000 individuals on October

20-2. The list of names was from W. S. Ponton, and entitled "High-Grade

Multi-Investors" with a random selection from the entire United States.3

There were 605 completed responses.

     4. INSTI: Full study of institutional investors. A questionnaire nearly

the same as that of the October 19 survey of individuals was prepared and

mailed to 1000 investment managers sampled at random from the section

"Investment Managers, Alphabetical Index" from the Money Market Directory of

Pension Funds and their Investment Managers 1987. There were 284 completed

responses.

     The PILOT1 and PILOT2 sample is more likely than are the others to be

representative of all high-income persons who hold stocks, and since the


       This INDIV list is described in the Ponton Investor List Catalog Vol.
VIII by "names on three (3) or more lists - net worth of generally over
$250,000.00," (p. 4). Harvey A. Rabinowitz (president of W. S. Ponton)
explained to me that they maintain many mailing list of investors. The high-
grade multi investor list consists of people who are on three or more of
their lists that are suggestive of high-income, active investors. Most lists
described in their catalog are used. Sources of lists include "Clippings
from almost every daily, weekly and religious newspaper in the United
States, legal journals, business directories & magazines, public court house
records, replies to space ads in all types of business & investment
publications, investment seminar attendees, trade-offs with stock brokerage
firms & business/financial & investment publications, a few corporate
stockholder lists, purchase of lists from some investment firms that are no
longer in business, & many private & personal sources," (Investor List
Catalog, p. 23). However, Rabinowitz said there was no use made of some of
their more unusual lists (their lists of gamblers, cattle or new movie
investors). The average income of INDIV survey respondents was $136,700.

                                      5
surveys were sent out very early, the results rely on fresher memories.

However, the sample size is small. The INDIV sample should be representative

of active wealthy individual investors, and has the largest sample size. The

INSTI sample should be representative of officers of all ranks in investment

management groups, and is not aimed particularly at the managers of large

portfolios.



                                 III. Results

Breakdown into Buyers and Sellers

     Respondents for the INDIV and INSTI questionnaires were asked whether

they were net purchasers or sellers on various dates; see Table      Of
course, institutional investors trade much more frequently than do

individual investors. On October 19, the number of net buyers approximately

equalled the number of net sellers both for institutional and individual

investors. For the month before the crash, September 12 - October 12 -

institutional   investors who changed their holdings generally reported

decreasing their holdings, individual investors increasing their holdings.

Between October 19 and October 20 this was reversed, institutional investors

buying and individual investors selling. For other time periods, both

institutional investors and individual investors report moving the same way;

this can happen of course with numbers of buyers and sellers even though the

value of the amount bought by all buyers must equal the value of the amount



     40f PILOT respondents, 3.9% bought and 5.9% sold October 14-16, 9.O%%
bought and 5.9% sold on October 19. These percentages are slightly higher
than among the INDIV investors, though not statistically significantly
higher. The difference may be due to the wording of the question. Some of
the INDIV or INSTI respondents who both bought and sold in the interval may
put down "No Change" in the questionnaire, even though they traded.

                                       6
sold buy all sellers. The survey also missed certain categories of buyers or

sellers (e. g., foreign investors and New York Stock Exchange specialists).

     All results in the remaining tables are broken down between buyers and

sellers as described in this section.

No Clear-Cut Reaction to News

     In an effort to assess directly what it was that people were reacting

to, I included in this survey a list of news stories that were claimed in

the media as possible determinants of the stock market declines October 14-

19, 1987, and asked respondents to rate their importance. They were asked to

rate on a 1 to 7 scale (one completely unimportant, seven very important)

"how important each of the following news items was to you personally on

October 19, 1987. .   . Please tell how important y then felt these were,
and not how others thought about them." The question here departs from the

format in my earlier questionnaires, in that this time I suggested the news

stories, and used an open-ended question format only for the last category,

"other".

     The news items are shown in Table 2, question A; investors seem to

think that just about everything is at least somewhat relevant. There is a

broad similarity in results between individual (INDIV) and institutional

(INSTI) investors. The 200-point drop in the Dow on the morning of October

19 is the most important for both groups, and the price drops of the

preceding week are second or third for both. Treasury bond yields hitting

10.5% are second or third for both groups. For both groups Prechter's sell

signal is given lowest importance, the producer price index figures the

second lowest, and the U. S. attack on the Iranian oil station the third

lowest. The low importance given to the producer price index announcement


                                        7
confirms that there is some accuracy to the answers: the announcement was

not out of the ordinary at all and not substantive news; people knew that.

The low importance given to the attack on the Iranian oil station is

significant: it seems to be the best candidate for an important news event

that become public knowledge right on October 19 or over the weekend.5

       Not many in either group wrote in an answer under "other". When they

did, the items entered were highly varied. They rarely mentioned current

news stories. A 'too much indebtedness' theme seemed to be most common: they

referred to such things as the federal deficit, national debt, budget

deficit or taxes. Of the 90 individual investors who wrote in an answer,

33.3% mentioned such a theme, of the 55 institutional investors, 20.0%

mentioned this theme.

       The Barron's survey (Palmer [1987]) included a question that was

somewhat similar. Respondents were read a list of "things that have been

mentioned as possible causes of the recent fluctuations in the stock market

-
    particularly   the 508 point drop on October 19," and were asked to rate the

importance of each of them. One important distinction between their question

and mine is that they are asking for opinions held after the crash, and not

asking them to recall what they were reacting to then. Their question also

did not emphasize that what was wanted was a personal opinion, and not just

a distillation from the post-crash media accounts. According to their

survey, the most important items were the budget deficit and program

trading, and everyone getting nervous at the same time about the way the

economy is going, followed by the trade deficit and investor speculation,

and everyone getting nervous at the same time about the high stock market


       5The attack occurred at about 7:00 a. m. Eastern Daylight Time.

                                         8
and government economic policies. Their respondents did not think that banks

announcing an increase in interest rates was important at all, whereas in

the results I report in Table 2, this had moderate importance. Barron's also

found that the decline in the dollar and the recent merger and takeover

activities were unimportant.

     With the results reported here in Table 2, there was little difference

between buyers' and sellers' ratings of the news events, with minor

exceptions: sellers October 19 were somewhat more impressed than others with

Treasury Secretary Baker's statement that the dollar should slip further,

and slightly more impressed with the rise of the prime rate.

     That nothing stood out in the Table 2 results beyond the price delines

may be thought of as perhaps consistent with the general conclusion I was

inclined to from previous surveys: that investors may be reacting to price

movements themselves on days of big market drops, and not to any specific

news stories. However, some of the non-price news stories were rated as

almost as important as the news of the price drop itself. Moreover, one

question that I wrote with the expectation that it might confirm that people

reacted to price movements did not go as I expected. I asked "Suppose that

as of October 19, 1987 the same news had occurred except for the news of

price drops. Would your evaluation of the market or decisions to buy or sell

on October 19 have been substantially different?" Only 18.3% of the

individual investors and 34.0% of the institutional investors agreed with

this statement (Table 2, Question B.). Perhaps the question was too subtle,

and open to alternative interpretations.

     Other evidence also suggests that people were not reacting to concrete

news stories. In the PILOT2 survey, respondents were asked "Was any news


                                      9
story, that you read in the paper then, heard from an advisory service,

etc., or from anyone else, or any rumor on your mind over the weekend or on

that day as a reason to buy or sell that day? Of the 48 respondents who

answered, 9 or 19.7% said yes, the remainder no. These were then asked "If

yes, can you describe the story or rumor? (Be sure you're describing

something you heard on that day. Please try hard to put something down, but

don't put something done that really wasn't on your mind then.)" Only 3 put

down a genuine news story. Among the others one wrote "a friend who is a

securities analyst had informed me two weeks earlier he had pulled all of

his clients out of the market." Another wrote "News media stories about

'panic'/'free fall,' 1929 etc," another that "I discussed with my broker on

10/15 and decided to stay calm," another that "news commentators looked grim

-   like   trying hard not to panic people." In PILOT1, respondents were asked

the same question regarding the days October 14-16. Of these, 21.6% said

yes, but few of these entered any news story, and nothing consistent

emerged. Almost all of the responses reported not news stories but advice of

brokers and friends, or predictions others made about the future course of

the market.

Much Talk. Much Anxiety, little Action

      The survey revealed a remarkable amount of concern and involvement in

the stock market among individual and institutional investors, while very

few individual investors and only a moderate number of institutional

investors actually changed their holdings on October 19.

      Almost everyone (96.7%) in the random sample INDIV of individual

investors who responded said they had heard of the market crash on the day

of the crash. Of these, the average time when the investor became aware of


                                         10
"above average stock market drops" was 1:56 p. m. Eastern Daylight Time,

remarkably early for individuals in the nation as a whole when one considers

that this is only 10:56 a. in.    Pacific   Daylight Time. Only 18.4% of the

individual investors in INDIV did not hear of the drop until after 5:00 p.

in.   local   time (as would be the case if they learned of it on the evening

news). For institutional investors (INDIV) the average time when they became

aware was 10:32 a. m. Eastern Daylight Time. Roughly speaking, they were

almost all aware as the event unfolded.

       The average individual investor in INDIV reported talking to 7.4 other

people on the day of the crash, the average institutional investor 19.7

other people. The average individual investor (INDIV) checked the price of

stocks 3.2 times on that day. The average institutional investor (INSTI)

checked the price of stocks 35.0 times that day.6

       Many of these people were emotionally involved in the market. The

questionnaire asked about actual symptoms of anxiety experienced by

respondents (see Table 3, Question A): difficulty concentrating, sweaty

palms, tightness in chest, irritability, or rapid pulse. Fully 20.3% of the

individual investors in INDIV and 43.1% of the institutional investors

answered yes for the date Monday, October 19; substantial percentages

answered yes for adjacent days. It is remarkable that such a proportion of

the general population reported such specific symptoms of real anxiety at

one time.

       Moreover, 23.0% of the individual investors and 40.2% of the

institutional investors reported experiencing a contagion of fear from other



     6The figure is the number who provided an answer to the question; many
did not answer but wrote in the margin "very many times" or "continuously".

                                            11
investors. Among individual investors who sold on October 19, 53.9% reported

experiencing contagion of fear. Moreover, 35.0% of the individual investors

and 53.2% of the institutional investors report talking of events of 1929 on

the few days before October 19. The percents who spoke of 1929 were even

higher for those who sold on October 19. (See Table 3, Questions B and C.)

     Despite all this anxiety, most people did not change their holdings of

stocks. As we saw from Table 1, only 5.2% of the individual investors

surveyed reported actually being net buyers or sellers of either individual

corporate stocks, index futures or stock options on October 19. (A higher

proportion reported having changed their holdings between October 12 and 19)

There were almost four times as many who experienced the symptoms of

anxiety. With institutional investors, 31.1% changed their holdings on

October 19; slightly less than the percentage reporting experiencing

symptoms of anxiety. Thus, there was a lot of talk and anxiety, little

action.

Many Investors Thought They Knew What the Market Will Do

     I asked a question aimed at discovering whether investors thought on

October 19 that they knew when a rebound was to occur (Table 4, question A).

The point of this question was to learn the motivation of buyers that day.

Among individual investors fully 29.2% (or ten times the number of people

who actually bought that day) reported yes. Among institutional investors,

28.0% reported yes, well over the percent who bought that day.   Respondents

were then asked "If yes, what made you think you knew when a rebound would


        Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll Nov. 17-18, 1986 queried 271
adults who said they have an account with a stockbroker. Of these, 67% said
they traded financial securities three times a year or less, 16% four to ten
times a year, 10% more than ten times a year, and 7% were unsure. Wall
Street Journal, Nov. 5, 1987, p. 2.

                                     12
occur?" Many individual investors said "intuition" or "gut feeling" or just

"knew there would be a rebound." Often individual investors mentioned

theories of what the "big" investors were doing. There was often a

suggestion that the market tends to rebound when certain conditions were

met, but only infrequent references to technical analysis.

Institutional investors usually did not explain why they expected a rebound.

When they did, the answers were usually similar to those of individual

investors, simple intuitive statements: "gut feel," "historical evidence and

common sense," "market psychology."

    A common theme in answers to this question among institutional

investors was that the magnitude of the decline was prima facie evidence of

a rebound: "too far too fast for it not to rebound," "logic (wishful

thinking perhaps) that such a decline has never occurred without a

corresponding up reaction." Of the 73 institutional investors who explained

why they expected a rebound, 37.0% volunteered such an argument. The theme

was the magnitude of the decline, not the bargains that were created by the

decline. Among institutional investors who answered, only 13.7% cited the

low prices themselves as reason to expect a rebound. Individual investors

were less likely to mention either theme as reason to expect a rebound:

13.6% of the 154 individual investors who explained why they expected a

rebound volunteered that the magnitude of the drop itself was a reason to

expect a rebound, and 8.4% cited the low prices.

     Only one institutional respondent and only one individual respondent

mentioned portfolio insurance and only one institutional respondent

mentioned index arbitrage in answer to this question. The absence of mention

of these is surprising; one might expect such program trading to be part of


                                      13
a theory of rebounds since program trading was widely held to be the reason

for the stock market drops. A few institutional investors mentioned that the

stock market decline included many quality equities, allegedly a sign of a

rebound. A few institutional and individual investors mentioned a

psychological theory that the close of the market would exhaust the panic.

     The pilot questionnaire also had a related question. In answer to the

question "Did you at any point feel that prices had fallen too far, and that

bargains had been created?" Yes answers were given by 48% of the PILOT1

respondents and 74% of the PILOT2 respondents, the latter a far higher

percent than thought they had a pretty good idea when a rebound would occur

among INDIV investors. Perhaps the difference in answers has to do with the

absence of the words "pretty good idea" in the INDIV question. Moreover, a

"bargain" does not imply a "rebound," and as we shall see next, opinions of

over- or undervaluation does not seem to be the basis for most trade.

The average Investor Thought the Market was Overvalued Before the Crash.

     Fully 71.7% of the INDIV investors and 84.3% of the INSTI investors

reported that they thought around October 12, just before the crash that the

market was overpriced relative to fundamental value (Table 4, question B).

The question said "try hard to remember what you thought then" [October 12].

Of course it is quite possible that persons' reporting of their own past

thoughts was colored by the events that followed October 12.

     Consistent with their report that they thought the market was

overpriced, only 36.1% of the INDIV investors and 22.2% of the INSTI

investors described themselves as bullish and optimistic relative to other

investors on this date (Table 4, Question C.).

     Thus, few people in the INDIV and INSTI thought they were more


                                     14
optimistic about the stock market than average. It was as if people did not

realize how many others shared the view that the market was overpriced.

Apparently the view did not dissuade many people from buying stocks

nonetheless.

     What is particularly interesting about their answers is that those

people who reported net buying between September 12 and October 12 were just

as likely to think that the market was overpriced on October 12: 68.1% of

the individual investors in INDIV who were buying then and 93.1% of the

institutional investors in INSTI buying then. There are various reasons why

some investors might buy when they think the market is overpriced. For

example, many investors apparently think that they can time the market, and

buy while it is still going up. One institutional investor who had been

increasing holdings between September 12 and October 12 agreed that the

market had been overpriced but volunteered "Although we thought this to be

true, we followed the 'trend is your friend' philosophy." Another who had

not changed holdings over the interval wrote "not expecting such a dramatic

decline -   expecting   lower price to develop over the next 3-6 months." Some

follow a policy of reinvesting dividends. Others may follow the popular

"dollar-cost averaging" plan of buying equal amounts of money at regular

intervals, which is often described as a sober and responsible plan that

will cause the investor to acquire fewer shares when stocks are overpriced.

Weekend Effect

     Both the October 19, 1987 and October 28, 1929 crashes occurred on a

Monday after a preceding week of great market turmoil. It is plausible that

the magnitude of the drops had something to do with the fact that a weekend

gave people the time to reach decisions to act on Monday. We have seen above


                                         15
that actual symptoms of anxiety extended into the weekend for many

investors; in our samples of both individual and institutional investors the

number of people who reported such symptoms over the weekend was roughly

comparable to the number who sold on Monday. The percent showing anxiety

over the weekend was even higher for those who sold on October 19: 23.2% of

these individual investors and 30.6% of these institutional investors. And

the symptoms of anxiety reported are rather pronounced; there are likely to

have been many more people who thought quite seriously about the market

without such symptoms.

     In the PILOT2 questionnaire it was asked "Did you at any point over the

weekend or on October 19 feel that prices were likely to fall dramatically

soon?" Of those who answered, 39% said yes. Some of the respondents'

comments are suggestive of such a weekend effect. One respondent who

answered yes wrote: "Saturday was a day of soul searching to resist the

absolute fear that Monday could have dealt. Do we sell out Monday or ride it

out?" Of those who answered no, there was often as much anxiety over the

weekend; they merely had a difference of opinion as to the likely direction

of the market. One who answered no wrote "I thought the market would rebound

on Monday!"

Investors Thought Investor Psychology moved the Markets

     Investors were asked: "Can you remember any specific theory you had

about the causes for the price declines October 14-19, 1987?"

The most common theme overall in the theories written in response to this

question was the overpricing of the market before the crash. Among

individual investors, 33.9% of the 342 who wrote theories mentioned this

theme, among institutional investors, 32.6% of the 184 who wrote theories


                                     16
mentioned this theme. Another important theme was an institutional -   stop
loss theme (identified by key words institutional selling, program trading,

stop-loss, or computer trading): 22.8% individual, 33.1% institutional.8

Also present was an investor irrationality theme (that investors were crazy

or that the fall was due to investor panic or capricious change in opinion):

25.4% individual, 24.4% institutional.

     The next question on the questionnaire was: ttich of the following

better describes your theory about the declines: a theory about investor

psychology, [or] a theory about fundamentals such as profits or interest

rates?" Here, 67.5% (n = 530) of the INDIV sample of individual investors

and 64.0% (n   267) of the institutional investors said the theory was about

investor psychology. This is in contrast to results obtained earlier (Pound

and Shiller [1987]) with a random sample of institutional investors, where a

very similar question referred not to the stock market on a day of a crash

but to an individual stock the respondent held on a normal day. There, 79%

of the random sample of institutional investors said that the theory that

led them to hold the stock was a theory about fundamentals.

     Unfortunately, the interpretation of the question is somewhat

ambiguous, as respondents' written theories show. Many who said that the

market was very much overpriced before the crash, and needed to come more in

line with fundamentals, classified this as a theory about fundamentals. It


     8The Barron's survey asked individual investors who they thought
triggered the stock market crash, the results were institutional investors
56%, foreign investors 26%, and individual investors, 9%, Palmer [1987]. The
dominance of institutional investors in the answers here does not seem to
square with answers to open-ended questions I read, which often seemed to
refer to other individual investors. Perhaps individual investors will say
that institutional investors are extremely important when explicitly asked
about institutonal investors, but at other times imagine that others like
themselves are important.

                                     17
is hard to think, however, that someone who thought that the market crash

was due to bad news about the fundamental economic data would classify the

theory as one about investor psychology. The bias would seem to be against

investor psychology as an answer.

     That so many investors think that market psychology is the reason for

market movements is consistent with their holding stocks when they also

thought they were overpriced.

Technical Analysis Played a Role

     Investors were asked whether they were influenced by price dropping

through a 200-day moving average or other long-term trend line. This trend

line is an example of a technical indicator. About a third in both the

individual INDIV and institutional INSTI samples answered yes (Table 4,

question D).

     In the PILOT2 questionnaire, respondents were asked "Was any technical

factor on your mind in this connection on that day (channel, oscillator,

support level, etc)? Of the 47 who answered, 17.0% said yes.

     Since important news about fundamentals does not seem to appear on a

daily basis, any day-to-day formal analysis of price movements is likely to

focus on technical analysis, which uses price data as information. That is

probably why daily reports in places like the "Heard on the Street" column

of the Wall Street Journal report so many references to technical

indicators, and why we can be confident technical analysis plays a role

itself in market movements.

Portfolio Insurance is but the Tip of the Iceberg

     Only 5.5% of those institutional investors who answered the

questionnaire answered yes to the question "Do you follow an explicit


                                     18
portfolio insurance scheme?" A portfolio insurance scheme is a predetermined

rule that investors may use to limit losses. The rule specifies trade in

index futures that causes index futures contracts to be sold continually as

stock prices go down, thereby hedging the portfolio against further losses.

The rule follows a mathematical formula that has certain optimality

properties.

     Although the proportion who use explicit portfolio insurance is small,

the proportion of institutional and individual investors who have a policy

of limiting losses is around 10%, and among those who sold on October 19,

close to 40% individual, close to 20% institutional (see Table 5, question

A.). One can limit losses without an explicit portfolio insurance scheme by

adopting buy or sell points, i. e., deciding in advance when to sell on

either the cash or futures markets, by stop-loss orders or puts.

     One common misconception about portfolio insurance is that, since it

typically involves computers, it is importantly faster than other means of

limiting losses. However, people can respond quite fast themselves relative

to a day of market drops, without any computers (assuming that they can get

in touch with their brokers and have their orders executed). Moreover, we

have seen above that on October 19, they did indeed find out about record

market movements in time to be a factor in these movements.

     Studies of the September 11-12 1986 drop (SEC 1987) and of the January

23, 1987 drop (CFTC, 1987), as well as preliminary newspaper accounts (Cox,

1987) of a CFTC study of the October 19 drop, all conclude that portfolio

insurance was not big enough in impact to account for much of the drop on

those days. CFTC Commissioner Robert Davis was quoted as saying that "the

activity was not exceptional, and didn't have much impact on the overall


                                     19
stock market." (Cox, 1987).

     Since the behavior rule implicit in portfolio insurance is so well-

defined as to be executable by a computer, it is readily analyzable by

economists. We should avoid the temptation, however, to overemphasize the

importance of behaviors that we know well relative to behaviors that are not

precisely defined.

Changes in Investment Stratev

     If the stock market crash was due to investors reacting to price drops

themselves, then one might expect that they were more reactive at the time

of the crash than at other times. That would then explain why the crash was

so big on that day. I sought evidence whether this was so. I asked whether

they had adopted their policy of holding losses to a certain amount shortly

before the crash. Of those who had such a policy, 44.4% of the individual

investors and 28.0% of the institutional investors said yes (Table 5,

question B.) Those who said yes were asked when they adopted this policy:

some put down years, but 46.4% of these individual investors and 50% of the

institutional investors adopted the policy within a month of the crash.9

     Respondents were also asked whether they had abandoned a policy of

investing for the long term just before the crash: 13.2% of the individual

investors and 6.6% of the institutional investors said yes (Table 5,

Question C). Among those who sold October 19, the percentages were 38.5%

individual and 27.8% institutional. One institutional respondent who said

yes and who abandoned the policy on October 16 wrote "The 95 point drop is a

sure indicator of much higher risk on the downside. As things turned out, it



     9As a percent of total respondents, these are only 2.1% and 2.1%
respectively, not a large percent.

                                      20
was a precursor to the GREAT QUAKE on Monday." Another institutional

investor who claimed the policy was abandoned October 19 wrote "The market

was in a free fall and therefore unable to make proper investment

decisions."

     Respondents were also asked whether their response to the price

declines would have been less intense if the declines had occurred six

months ago (Table 5, Question D). I thought perhaps many would answer yes,

indicating a heightened responsiveness of investors to market prices now,

but most did not. Perhaps more would have answered yes if the question had

not specified the "same news about price declines" but instead "a 30-point

drop in the Dow." Perhaps the 508 point drop is so large that respondents

feel they would react intensely to it at any time.

                       5. Interpretation and Conjectures

     Something must have been different on October 19, 1987 that caused the

behavior of the market to be very different from other days. What

different on that day? To answer that question, one must look for something

that happened on exactly that day, not general considerations that

characterize many days. Thus, for example, it is not enough to say that

"portfolio insurance did it," since portfolio insurance has been around for

years.

     Sometimes big market movements are related to specific identifiable

news breaks. However, the survey did not turn up anything really important

to investors that became public on October 19 or over the weekend, other

than the price decline itself and the behavior of investors reacting to it

and previous declines. There is of course the possibility that a group of

investors -   missed or underweighted in the survey - was responsible for the


                                       21
stock market drop, and that these were responding to some important news

event that the broader group of investors surveyed did not appreciate. The

questionnaire was not directed to foreign investors, or to specialists, nor

did the survey weight results by size of investor.

       While no important news story appears to have broken right at the time

of the stock market drop, we can identify news stories that preceded the

drop by a number of days, and that were on investors' minds. Institutional

investors were most concerned about the recent rise in interest rates and

about Treasury Secretary James A. Baker's October 15 threat to push the

dollar lower in response to increases in German interest rates. Both

individual and institutional investors were confident that the market was

overpriced, worried about program trading, and were concerned about the

national debt and taxes. These concerns and worries certainly affected

individual behavior on October 19, but do not explain the events of that

day.

       In interpreting the lack of an identifiable proximate cause for the

drop, it should be borne in mind that there is a growing literature that

calls into question the "efficient markets" theory that all price movements

must be interpretable by information about economic fundamentals: (Shiller

 [1984], Campbell and Shiller [1987], DeBondt and Thaler [1985], Fama and

French [1986], Mankiw, Romer and Shapiro [1986], Poterba and Summers [19871,

West [1986], and others). Increasingly, there is statistical evidence that

suggests the stock market may have a life of its own to some extent,

unrelated to economic fundamentals)0



     10There are of course critics of this view as well. See for example
Terry Marsh and Robert Merton [1987].

                                        22
     Since no news story or any other recognizable event from outside the

market appears to be immediately responsible for the market crash, we will

thus turn to consideration of a theory of the crash as being determined

endogenously by investors: that the timing of the crash was related to some

internal dynamics of investor thinking, investor reaction to price and

investor reaction to each other. The survey results give us some information

about investors that help us to think about these investor dynamics.

     There were two channels by which price declines could feed back into

further price declines. First, a price-to-price channel: investors on

October 19 were reacting to price changes. Second, a social psychological

channel: investors were directly reacting to each other.11 From the

information collected on the frequency with which investors checked prices

and talked with each other on October 19, both feedback channels were

operating fast enough among the broad masses of investors to play an

important role in the hour-to-hour movements of the market: the

communications proceeded rapidly, and prices were checked with great

frequency. This was especially so among those investors who were net buyers

or sellers on October 19.

     The extent of communications as well as the amount of anxiety reported

suggests that this event was not unlike other alarming national events that

seize the public attention, and push aside much everyday activity for

attention to the event. As such, the significance of the event should not be

interpreted solely in terms of the quantitative measure of the amount of

wealth lost in the market drop. The changes in individual perceptions are


     11The fields of sociology and social psychology offer many insights
into the latter of these two channels; see for example Adler and Adler
[1984], Katona [1975], and McGuire [1969].

                                     23
more fundamental and are likely to be lasting, even if the decline in wealth

is reversed.

     Investors had expectations before the 1987 crash that something like a

1929 crash was a possibility, and comparisons with 1929 were an integral

part of the phenomenon. It would be wrong to think that the crash could be

understood without reference to the expectations engendered by this

historical comparison. In a sense many people were playing out an event

again that they knew well.

     Many investors thought that they could time the market. Technical

analysis played an important role in their predictions, and thus in the

decline in demand October 19. On the other hand, few investors,

institutional or individual, volunteered any references to technical

analysis in their answers to open-ended questions. They often wrote "gut

feeling" as their forecasting method, and often seemed to say that they were

guessing about the psychology of other investors. Investors appear to

believe they have some internal sense of magnitude or direction for the

market, and investors are highly divided on this sense of direction. Many

investors thought that the sheer magnitude of the price drops on October 14-

16 made it common sense that a rebound should come on Monday. At the same

time, many other investors thought that the tremendous drops that came on

those days raised issues that the market may be headed for a 1929-style

crash. Most of those who held to either belief did nothing about it. Of the

small number who did, the 'crash' theory holders happened to outnumber the

'rebound' theory holders.

     The actual decision to buy or sell on October 19 seems to be only

weakly related to interpretations of recent news events that investors rated


                                     24
as important: there was little difference between buyers and sellers on the

importance rating that was given to news events. Respondents apparently did

not have a clear theory how these past news events translated into

predictions of market price movements on October 19, yet very many

respondents still had predictions. It would thus be wrong to say, as many

have done, that the market drop on October 19, 1987 ought to be interpreted

as a statement of public opinion about some fundamental economic factor, e.

g., that there is lack of confidence in the White House or Congress. At

best, any such opinions probably played a role in the crash mainly as they

affected the vague intuitive assessments people under great stress made

about the tendency of prices to continue or reverse, or about how other

investors will react to the current situation.

A. Sources of Mailing Lists

PILOT1. PILOT2 (High Income Individuals, n = 125 each)

Survey Sampling, Inc., random sample of high-income investors in the
continental U. S. whose income predicted by a regression was $70,000 a year
or more. This is a list of high income individuals, not investors. In a
previous survey (Shiller and Pound, 1986) using this list we achieved (by
repeated followup mailings urging prompt response) a response rate of 59%.
Of those who responded, we asked "Have you, or someone in your household,
ever bought shares of common stock (not preferred stock) in a corporation?"
Of those who answered, 55% answered yes. The PILOT1 and PILOT2 lists were
drawn from those respondents who answered yes to this question.

INDIV (Individual Investors, n = 2000)

W. S. Ponton, (5149 Butler St., The Ponton Bldg., Pittsburgh PA. 15201)
"High-Grade Multi-Investors" with a random selection from the entire United
States. This list is described in the Ponton Investor List Catalog Vol. VIII
by "names on three (3) or more lists - net worth of generally over
$250,000.00," (p. 4). Harvey A. Rabinowitz (president of W. S. Ponton)
explained to me that they maintain many mailing list of investors. The high-
grade multi investor list consists of people who are on three or more of
their lists that are suggestive of high-income, active investors. Most lists
described in their catalog are used. Sources of lists include "Clippings
from almost every daily, weekly and religious newspaper in the United
States, legal journals, business directories & magazines, public court house
records, replies to space ads in all types of business & investment
publications, investment seminar attendees, trade-offs with stock brokerage
firms & business/financial & investment publications, a few corporate
stockholder lists, purchase of lists from some investment firms that are no
longer in business, & many private & personal sources," (Investor List
Catalog, p. 23). However, Rabinowitz said there was no use made of some of
their more unusual lists (their lists of gamblers, cattle or new movie
investors). Rabinowitz thought that the high grade multi-investor list
should resemble a random sample of all high -income active investors.

INSTI (Institutional Investors, n = 1000)

"Investment Managers, Alphabetical Index." from the Money Market Director of
Pension Funds and their Investment Managers 1987, T. H. Fitzgerald, Ed.,
Mcgraw Hill. Categories in list are "Investment Counsel Firms, U. S. Bank
and Trust Companies, U. S. Insurance Companies, and Independent Real Estate
Advisors." The names were selected randomly from this, without regard to
kind of firm or position within the firm.

B. Questionnaires

     The exact INDIV questionnaire follows, starting next page, with the

addition only of two or four numbers [in square brackets] after each

question: the numbers are the average answer for individual investors, the

number answering, the average answer for institutional investors, the number

answering. When only two numbers are shown, they refer to individual

investors.

     The INSTI questionnaire is virtually the same, with the following

difference:
