              How Close to an Auction is the Labor Market?
Employee Risk Aversion, Income Uncertainty, and Optimal Labor Contracts



                                ABSTRACT



    Section I of this paper develops a model of income insurance in the

labor market. The model differs from those of previous analyses in its

focus on quantitative implications regarding the degree to which wages

diverge from marginal value products, both in time—series and in cross—

section data. Sections II and III present empirical evidence consistent

with these implications. The main empirical finding is that of short—

term divergence, but long—term equality between wages and marginal value

products. The labor market appears to differ from an auction market only

in the short run, but this short—run divergence considerably reduces the

potential variability of employees' realized wealth.

I.     Ep1oyee Risk Aversion, Income Uncertainty, and Optical Labor Contracts


       Recent efforts to explain the exIstence of layoffs and the cyclical

stability of real wages have focused renewed interest on the voluntary

nature of involuntary uneployent and on the equilibrium characteristics
                                                                        1
of what appear to be non—siarket--clearng situations.                        One result of

these efforts has been the development of a class of models focusing on

employee aversion to earnings variance as the root cause of these phencena.

Analyses within this class typically assume that employees are averse to

variability in their consumption, that employee consumption is not

iadependent of realized employee income, and that emnloyees are less able
 than enloyers       to   diversify their sources of          inccme,       or that   emloyee3
 are   simply more    risk—averse than ermlcyers. The implIcation ofthese
 assumutions is that both parties can benefit fr                   arraiements vhich

 shift incone   variability           from cmployecs to rnpioycr, and th
 developed   is that these income—stabilizing arran;emer.ts entail                     the   use cf
                                                          2
 layoffs as a nes         of       adjuotin employment.

        According    to this argument, wages are allowed to dIverge from marginal

value    products in order to reduce earnings variance for employees. In periods

of high demand, fIrms pay employees less than the value of their marginal

product, while in periods of low demand, wages exceed marginal value products.

As a result, because wages do not equate employees' supply of labor with

 fis' demand for labor in states of low demand, supplementary adjustment

of employment by way of layoffs becomes necessary in such states.

        One partlculari', interesting Implication of most such analyses

 is the optimali:y of contracts whIch soeclfy state—invariant earnings
                               3
 for emPloyed workers.               At first glance this result is surprisIng, for
                                  2

 economists seldom find reason to argue that prices are better left

 unresponsive to states oE demand, even when there exist costs associated

 with price variability. On closer inspection, however, the result becomes

 transparent, for while introducing costs of wage variabilit. through

 employee risk aversion, these analyses introduce no counterbalancing

 costs of wage rigidity.

      A central assumotion in these analyses is the absence of any allocative

\function performed by wages once an initial sorting of workers across fir

 has taken place. Specifically, this absence results from the assumption

 that the costs of interfirm labor mobility are sufficiently high relative

 to the value of moving between firms that no such iriterfirm movement ever

 takes place. Clearly this assumption guarantees the optimality of state—

 invariant earnings for emloyed workers, for it eliminates any reason for

 wage variability after the initial sorting has taken place. By precluding

 any effect of -ealized wages on the realized Interfirm distribution of the

 labor force, that assumption precludes as well any. consideration of the

 influence of that effect on the optimal wage policy. PerformIng no cx post

 allocative function, wages are left free to be determined by other criteria
                            4
 such as earnings variance.

     While the absence of cx post interfirm labor mobility might be an

 acceptable assumption for analyzing the optimal degree of insurance against

 shifts in aggregate product demand when relative product demands are certain,

 relaxing this assumption is essential for any study of optimal income insur—

ance in the presence of relative demand uncertainty. Clearly, it Is necessary

also for any study of voluntary labor ncbility or of the effect of income

insurance on voluntary labor nobility.

     This section develops a model of the optimal income—insuring charac-

 teristics of labor contracts which extends previous analyses in   one funda—
                                     3

mental respect: the model considers relative changes in product demand among

firms   and relaxes the assumption that there is no wage—responsive interfirm

labor mobility after an initial sorting of workers across firms has taken

place. By allowing the ex post supply of labor realized by firms to depend

on the ex   post   wages offered by firms,    the   model developed in this paper

allows explicit consideration of the resource misallocation that is caused

by attempts to reduce the dispersion of employee earnings over states of

product demand. Consideration of this cost of wage rigidity leads to results

which differ from those of earlier analyses. In this model the exact wage

and employment policies offered by firms are determined by a tradeoff

between the value of variable wages and eoloyment in allowing efficient

resource allocation and the cost of variable wages and employment in

creatIng income uncertainty for employees. Variable wages become

necessary for optimal resource allocation, and because realized state—

contingent wages offered by firms may        once   again influence the ex post

interfirm distributIon of the labor force, ootimal wages may no longer

be determIned simply by employee aversion to earnings variance. This

extension is of more than theoretical interest, for it leads to explicit,

quantitative expressions for the optimal response of wages and employment

to variations in product demand that can be applied in scmeching more

than a loose, qualitative fashion and which can provide a basis for an

empirical test of the theory.

    The, following analysis focuses on a single contractIng period,

during which firms experience random shocks to the demands for their

products, and during which firms employ workers who dislike the prospect of
                       5
uncertaIn earnings.        It assumes that workers sort themselves among firms

at the start of the period on the basis of the labor cctracts, explicit

or implicit, which firms offer.          These contracts are assumed to specify wages
                                 4



and layoff probablities (arid imply quit probabilities) contingent on the

distribution of product demand among firms which is realIzed.

     During the first part of the contracting period, each firm receives

a certain price for its product and pays certain wages to its employees.

After a given interval, however, all firms experience shocks to the demands

for their products and may respond to this new situation with layoffs,

additional hires, or wage revisions, leading to some level of quits aong

their employees. For simplicIty the analysis focuses on a single firm,

assumed to be insignificant in the market, and abstracts from general equilibrium

considerations.

     The firm is assumed to maximize the value of profits expected over

all states of product deand by choosing the number of workers with

whom contracts are made at the start of the pericd arid by choosing values

for wages, layoffs, non—wage ayments to laid—off workers, and additional

hires corresponding to each possible state of product demand. The firm

is assumed to survive forever and to know the manner in which quits by

its employees and applications for employment from workers initially

at other firms respond to the wages which it offers in each state.

     Constraining the firm's efforts to maximize expected profit are the

profit—maximizing activIties of other firms and the efforts of workers to

maximize their utility. In order to attract workers at the star of the

period, the firm must offer an expected value of earnings which, adjusted

for income uncertainty, is at least as great as that available at other firms.

And in order to achieve the desired level of employment once the new distri-

bution of product demand is kno, the firm must offer a new level of

earnings which is consistent with the efforts of workers to arbitrage ralizd

differences among firms in wages net of mobility costs.

    It is assumed that after the new states of demand for firms'            products
become known, employees of the firm are given one drawing from the realized

                                                      If a firm is drawn which pays a
distribution of new wages paId elsewhere.
                                                                     firm
wage exceeding the value to the employee of remaining at the initial

by at least the cost of interfirm labor mobility, a quit occurs. If an

employee chooses not to quit and if he is laid off, he is assurned to be

given some severance payment by the firm naking the layoff and to accept
                                                                or to be unemployed for
the offer of the firm previously drawn but rejected,

 the remainder of the period if the firm drawn is not offering a wage
                                                           6

which       exceeds the    emaloyee'S value of leisure.

        More specifically, the firm's severance pay policy is assumed to

 guarantee a certain level of income for all employees laid off in a given

 state.       This   level may var'; with the state of demand for the firm's

                                              realized level of demand,the firm is

Expression (4) shows that the firm's maximization problem nvclves a

tradeoff between the effects      of   the firm's choIce variables •on the income

uncertainty associated with the firm's contact and the effects of those

variables on the expected net earnings of the firm arid its initIal emloyees

considered jointly, where the ecpeccation is taken over all possible future

relocations of the firm's initial work force. Roughly tated, the firm

can reduce income uncertainty for its employees by reducing the extent to

which wages reflect marginal value products. But it can do so only at

the cost of lower expected joint net earnings, because any gap between

rgInal value products and wages reduces the efficiency of volunca labor

mobility, and because layoffs or additional hires cannot eliminate this

inefficiency without creating greater costs of their own.              The implications
of    this tradeoff for the extent to which wages and en1oymenz respond to

changes in the dis:ribudon of product demand can be seen fran the first—

order conditions for the firm's maximization problem. The optimal neber

of contracts offered by the firm at the start of the period arid the fIrm's

optImal hiring, wage, severance pny,and layoff policies applying in any

where strict equalities hold for all non—zero values of the relevant variables.
       Condition (5) is equivalent to the restriction that the narginal expected

profit from additions to the firm's initial work force be zero. More interest-

 ingly, this condition requires that the expected (over all possible future

 relocations of the firm's initial work force) net risk—adjusted incone of

 the firm and its Initial employees taken jointly be equal to that expected at

 other    firms.   Applied more generally, condition (5) guarantees that the

 initial sorting of workers across fIrms will be optimal in the sense that no
initial reallocation could increase the expected net risk—adjusted product

of all firms taken together.14

       Given that     condition   (5) is satIsfied, condition (6)—(9) deter-mine         the
optimal   res:onse of income and erloyment to changes in the distribution of

product demand. Consider first condition (6). Condition (6) requires that

the   marginal value oroduct and marginal factor cost of additional hires in

state   s be equal if any hiring takes place in state s. Through this

condition, the availability of additional hires to the firm             influences the
optimal   characteristics of the firm's contract in r'o ways. First, the

elasticIty of the sucply curie of additional hires to the firm influences the

relation between the price of the firm's product and the margInal               value product
of    the firm's employees. Second, variability in the           OSit1Ofl   of that supply

curve   introduces an additional source of variation in the firm's demand for

the   services   of   its   initial work force.

        If the s.pply curve of additIonal hires to the firm were perfectly elastic

and stable, then regardless of the volatility of demand for             the   firm's   product,
there   could be no uncertainty about the marginal value product of the firm's

employees. Alternatively, even if the price of the firm's product were per-

fectly certain, there stIll could be uncertainty about the marginal value

product of employees If variability in the demand for other firms' products

caused variability in the supply price of additional hires to the firm. in

general, for any given variability in the price of the firm's product, the

corresponding variability in the marginal value product of the fIrm's employees

would be less, the more elastic the supply curve of addItional hires to                 the
firm    and the more the position of that         curve varied   to offset the effect of

changes    in product price.

        ConditIon (6) can be seen as a determInant of the state dIstributIon

        of the firm's demand for the services of its iniia1 work force. Given

        this distribution, conditions (7)—(9) determine the corresponding state
                                                                             15
        distribution of income arid employment for initial employees.             The exact

        mariner of this determination depends on the value taken by layoffs. Two

        cases   are   possible. For states of product demand in which layoffs are

        positive,conditions (6)—(9) jointly determine wages and employment. But

         for states of product demand in which layoffs are optimally zero, conditions

         (6) and (7) alone are determining.16

                In states of product demand for which layoffs are zero, condition (7)
                       17
         reduces to

          The first term in condition                 the net effect of a marginal increase

          in the state—s wage on the expected joint earnings of the fIrm and its

          inItial employees. This term represents the value of the margInal reduc-

          tion (increase) in resource misallocation brought about by Increasing the

          wage when it is belcw (above) that value whIch leads the firm's employees

           to allocate theraselves across alternative employments such that, net of

          mobility costs, earnings available elsewhere to the marginal employee equal

           the marginal value product of employees remaining at the firm.

                 Arty shortfall   of wages below marginal value products will cause some

          workers to quit even though the value of their marginal product exceeds the

           net earnings whIch they realize by quittIng. When such quits occur, the

           firm loses (PF'—w) while     the employee gains (v—L(v)—c)—(w—L(w)). Similarly,
           any surplus of wages over marginal value products will cause some workors not

           to quit even though the value of theIr marginal product falls short of the
                                    11

net earnings they could realize by quitting. .Then such quits fail to occur,

the firm loses (w—?F') while the employee gains (w—L(w))—(v—L(v)—c). In

either case, the difference——that par: of the loss to the firm for which there

is no corresponding emoloyee gain——is given by (PF'—L(w))—(v—L(v)—c)[. This

loss is solely due to the divergence of wages and marginal value products

resulting from efforts to stabilize etployee income.

     For the marginal employee ,v is equal to w+c, and so the marginal value

of this distortion is (PF'—w). Given a positive (negative) distortion between

marginal value products and wages, a marginal increase in the wage will dis-

courage some quits which would have resulted in a net loss (gain) to the

workers and the firm considered jointly. The contribution of this effect

to joint earnings in state s is (PF'—w)dN(v(s)), the first term in condition (10).
                                           dw (s)


     The second term in condition (10) is the (negative of the) effect of a

 marginal increase in state—s wages on the risk premium which the firm must

 pay to its employees. Given that employees are averse to variance Ln their

 earnings, this term will be positive for values of w greater than the mean

 of w, negative for values less than the mean, and zero otherwIse. Thus,

  an implication of condition (10) is that wages will be set at values which

  fall short of marginal value products in states of demand for which realized

  earnings exceed their mean level, and at values which exceed margInal value

  products in states of demand for which realized earnings fall short of their

  mean.

          In order to reduce income uncertainty for employees, the firm allows

  wages to diverge from marginal value products. But this procedure leads t

  a level of quits which is unprofitable for the firm and its employees taken

  jointly. This fact limits the extent to which the firm can optimally reduoc

  empicyce income uncertainty by reducing the extent to which wages reflect

                                                            r-
marginal value products. Optimal wages are too sticky to be fully efficient

in allocating labor, but too flexIble to eliminate income uncertainty for

employees.

     To illustrate, consider the firm's response to an increase in product

price. An increase in the price of the firm's product will cause the first

term in condition (10) to increase without alterIng the second term.        ConditIon

(10) indicates that the firm's optimal response will be to increase its

wage. When product demand increases, it becomes profitable for the firm to

raIse wages in order to discourage quits among its em3loyees. The resulting

increase in the firm's labor force allows the fIrm to take advantage of

the initial excess of marginal value product over wages paid. As wages

and employ-nent are increased, however, this excess is reduced, and in addition

the firm must Increase the risk—premium paid to its employees. The optimal

wage for state s is deteined by margInal equality of the net gains from

additions to the firm's labor force induced by hIgher wages wIth the incre-

mental effect of higher state—s wages on the risk   premium paid by the fir-n.
     For states   of demand in which layoffs are zero, condition (10) implies

a relation between wages and marginal value products of the basic form shown

below in Figure 1.

                                                                            —                  /

The exact form of this relation can be seen more clearly by re—expressing

condition (10) as



(II) u(s) =          P(s)F'(s)
               1+dL(w(s))/d1cN(s)
                 dw(s) / diogu(s)



It can be seen directly from condition (11)       that if   the marginal risk

premium associated with a wage increase, dL(w(s))/dw(s), increases in

absolute value as wages diverge from their mean value, or if the elasticity

of labor supoly to the firm, dlogN(s)/dlogw(s), diminishes as wages

diverge from their mean value, then wages will be less than         unit—elastic
                                                                    18
in    response to marginal value products, as drawn in Figure 1.         Intuitively,

if successive employment increases recuire increasing marginal wage increases,

or if the margInal risk premium imp1ed by a wage ncrase rises as wages

are further increased, then firms will increase employment (and, by ipl±ca—

tion, wages) less readily in response to product price increases as wages

diverge further from theIr mean value. Similarly, firms will reduce employ-

ment (and, by implication, wages) less readily in response to product

price reductions if, as wages fall further below their mean value, either

the marginal wage reduction required to induce a separation or the marginal

risk premium implied by a further wage reductIon increases.

       Similar reasoning suggests that firms with relatively inelastic

labor supply and relatively risk averse employees would have wage—response

schedules more closely approximating a horizontal line, while fIrms with

relatIvely    elastic labor supiy and relatively risk neutral employees

uculd   have wage—resDonse schedules more closely approXImating a 5' line
through. the origin in Figure 1. At       one extreme, with zero risk aversion,
the    fIrm's wage—response schedule would be given by the 450 lIne,       with
                                    14



wages unIt—elastic   in   relation to .argina1 value products. It is thIs

special case chat auction models of the labor market are led to. At the

other extreme, with either infinite risk aversion or :ero labor supply

elasticity, the firm's wage response furtccion would be given by a horizontal

line, with wages zero—elastic in relation to marginal value products and

states of demand. It is this specIal case that previous analyses of

income—insuring labor contracts have been led to by the assumption of

zero ex—posc labor mobility. It is an advantage of the present analysis

that it supplies a framework broad enough to incorporate both extreme cases——

pure auction and complete insurance——and yet specific enough to suggest the

foi of the relazin beteen wages and marginal value products ifl the

presence of income insurance.

     To investigate the role of layoffs and severance pay in the fi's

optimal contract, consider first the Implications of ccridition (8) for

the supplemental payments made by the.firm to employees laid off in State s.

Condition (8) requires that the firm guarantee all emoloyees laid off in

state s a level of income such that, at the margin, the benefits from such

payments in reducing income uncertainty equal the Implied loss in joint

net income resulting from the deterrant effect of severance pay on quits.

If quits were unaffected by severance pay, the firm would choose a level

of layoff benefits such that employees' expected income was unaffected by

the prospect of layoffs. That is, the firm would guarzntee all laid—off

employees a level of income equal to their ex ante mean level of income,

paying each employee the difference between the ex ante mean and that
                                                                   19
emplovee1s realized level of income at his next—best alternative.

    But to the extent that the
                                   prospect of severance pay discaurages cults,

the firm's optimal severance pay policy will fail to elImInate the inccme
                                      15


loss associated with layoff status. In states of low product denat-id,

some ep1oyees whose net earnings elsewhere exceed that a: their current

job will choose not to quit because the value to thern of renaming a:

the firrn, (l—,(s))w(s)+,(s)g(s), nay exceed the wage offered at their

next    best   alternative. As a consequence, the marginal effect of severance

pay on quits will lead to a net loss in expected joint incoe which must be

balanced against the marginal value of severance pay in reducing incone

uncertaInty. Higher values for g(s) reduce income uncertainty for employees,

but only at the cost of a lower mean level of income due to the negative

effect of severance pay on the efficiency of voluntary labor nobility.

        The preceding discussion of condition (8) nay seen reminIscent of the

dIscussion of cond:ion (10) and the fIrm's optimal wage policy, for the

same tradeoffs are involved in both conditions. In fact, conditions (7)

and (8) together imply that the opti1 value for the level of income that

the firm guarantees all employees laid off in state s ts     sImply   w(s), the
                                                                       20
level of income which it offers to those not laid off in state s.           This

characteristic of the optimal severance pay policy has important inpl1c—

 tions both for the firm's optimal layoff strategy and for the optimal

 response of wages to product price reductions. SettIng g(s) equal to w(s),

and noting that with g(s) equal to w(s), dN(s)/dJ(s) becomes zero,

 conditions (7) and (9) reduce to



 (12) 0>[P(s)F'(s)—w(s)]d(s) —       N(s)dL(w(s))
                             du(s)         du(s)

 whIch reveal some interestIng aspects of the optInal respcnse of wages and
                                                   16

layoffs       to variations in product demand in states of demand for which layoffs

are non—zero.

       Condition         (13) shows that the firm's          optimal layoff strategy is directly

determined only by efficiency cr1teria. Becase severance pay allows the firm

to compensate employees for the income loss associated with being laid off,

it    thereby allows the firm to choose its layoff strategy without being
directly      constrained by        ermloyees' aversion to        income uncertainty. When
the    firm   guarantees all emoloyees who do not quit in state s a certain

wage which is independent of layoff status, the direct relation between

layoffs and income uncertainty is broken. Also, quits are no longer affected

by the prospect of layoffs, since layoffs no longer affect raalized earnings.

As a result, the firm's layoff             strategy        involves only a comparison between

the marginal value product of employees at the firm and the expected net value

of what randomly          laid off employees could earn elsewhere. The              firm
                                                                                                  22
chooses   a level of layoffs in state sso as to equate these two values.

       By substituting condition (13) into conditIon (12) ,                    conditIon   (12)

can be expressed as



(14)
•
               0>[w(s)—w(s)]dN(s) —        N(s)dL(w(s))
                            dw(s)                  dw(s)



which, although identical in form to                    condition (10), is a   function only

of the wage paid by the firm              in    state s. There is     nothing in   condition (14)

to change when states of demand change. The imalication of this fact is

that once layoEfs bcccno positive, wages are made invariant to states of

product demand at a level given by



                                   u(s)

            It is interesting to note the decerm.inants of this minimu income

       which the firm guarantees to its ep1oyees. Condition (13) indicates

       that in response to a price decline, the firm will lay off enough workers

       to raise the margna1 value product of its employees to its es:imate of

       their net alternative earnIngs elsewhere. By construction, the firm has

       co knowledge of any particular employees' next—best alternative and so

       cannot be selective in whom it chooses to lay off.   The best the firm can

       do is to satisfy conditiori (13), realizing that some enployees not laid

       off will have net earnings elsewhere which exceed those of some laid—off

       employees.

            In contrast, when the firm reduces its wage, it causes only those

       workers who have the highest alternative net earnings to leave the firm.

       However, all emplcyees must suffer the wage reduction necessary to induce

       the marginal employees to leave the firm. Although adjustment of the

       firm's labor force by way of wage cuts may be more efficient in terms

       of the particular employees who are induced to leave the firm, it may

       be more costly in terms of the income varIability which it entails.

       In choosing the optimal level for the minimum income which it guarantees

       its employees, the firm balances at the margin these efficiency costs

       and in-come stability benefits to satisfy condition (14).

            Because the marginal risk premium imp1id by a vage—induced spara—

       tion increases as wages fall below their mean value, and because the

       relative allocative inefficiency implied by a layoff dinishes as wages

       are further reduced, layoffs may ultinately dominate wage reductions as

       a means of employment adjustment, even though wage reductions are Initially
                23
       preferred.    Further, because the relatIve allocatiye inefficleriay cf

       layoffs depends only on the wage paid by the firm, once layoffs become

       the preferred means of em1ovment reductIon, they will remaIn preferred

for all further employment reductions. This point is illustrated below

schedule for the firm's initial employees, derived directly from the ex         osc
alternative wage distribution in the firm's initial work force. This curve

would be the marginal factor cost schedule relevant to the fi: in the

absence of employee aversion to income uncertainty. The curve labeled Cw

is derived from the MFC   curve   by subtracting from it the monetary value of

the utility loss suffered by all the firm's enployees as a result of the

wage reduction implied by that point on the C curve. This curve can be

interpreted as the marginal factor cast schedule relevant to the fi            when

employees are averse to income uncertainty and when separncions are wage—

induced. The curve labeled MFC plots the expected net wage available else-

where to employees having alternative wages lower than that given by the

corresponding   point on the MFC   curve.    This curve generates the (horizontal)

marginal factor cost schedules that would be relevant to the firm's choice

of layoffs at dIfferent levels of wages.

     Starting from an initial equillbriun at point E , consider first 'a

                                                     1

adjustment cost that would be implied by a layoff at that wage, AB. Even

though all employees must suffer the wage reductIon to W , this reduction s

small enough to be preferred to layoffs, given that layoffs inply relatively

great allocative ineEficiency when wages are high.

    At lower values of product price, however, this need not be true.

Consider the firm's response to a price decline fron P to P . At point C

less than N, the reverse will be true. A.s the fir-n's wage falls toward the

minimum wage in the        market,   the difference between what the marginal voluntary

separation could receive elsewhere and what a randomly laid—off employee could

expect to receive elsewhere diminishes. As a result, because the marginal

allocatve inefficiency associated 'th            a   layoff depends positively on this

difference, these adjustment costs also decline as the wage falls.

     In Figure 2, at a product price of P , the fi's equilibriu response
                                         2
.s given by point E . The firm reduces its wage to w*, at which the
                       2
marginal adjustment cost implied by wage—induced separation comes to exceed

that marginal adjus:rent cost associated with a layoff at that           wage.   Given

w*, the marginal exected net alternative earnings of randomly laid—off

eplcyees is fixed      at the    value of w*, and so the fi lays off emloyees

to the point at which the marginal value product of employees remaining at

the fi is brouzht into ecualitv with that value. In Figure 2, the

optimal number of layoffs corresponding to product price P is given by
                                                                     2

      It is interesting to note that for sufficiently large reductions in

product price, the presence of income insurance nay actually increase the

employnent response to. product price reductions. Consider emloyent level

N .       At this level of employment, the fIrm's expectation of what an employee
 3
randoo'iy laid off at a wage of w cquld receive elsewhere is equal to what

the marginal net alternative at that level of employment would have been

in the absence of inccme insurance. For lower levels of employment, the

margInal      factor cost relevant     to   the fi n the presence of income
insurance, *,       exceeds th marginal factor cost that would apply in the

absence of income insurance. Thus, for product prices low enough to make

employment less than N optimal, emlo',ent in the presence of Income ns'rance

 will   be   less than   the level   that would have been optimal at the same price

 in the absence of Income insurance,
                                               Correspondingly;' marginal value products
 in the presence of inccme insurance
                                               can exceed marginal value products In the
absence      of income insurance for sufficIently low
                                                           product prices.
        Combining these results with those for states of damand in which layoffs
are   cro, the implications of conditions (6)—(9) for the
                                                                   optimal response
of   wages and employment to changes in prcduct price can be sumarized grahi—

cally as in Figure 3 below.

        Figure 3 plots values of wages, marginal value
                                                              products, quits, layoffs,
new hires, and emPloymant corresponding to
                                                     alternatIve possible ex—post values
of product price. The curves labeled "contract" refer to a firm which

supplies income insurance to its employees, while for a point of referonce,

the curves labeled "auction" refer to a firm           which supplies no income insurance
to its employee but which is assumed to have the same initial level of enployment.

        Panel (a) of Figure 3 shows thai, for states of demand in        which   layoffs
are zero, the presence of income insurance reduces the response of
                                                                   wages to
variations in product demand, but correspondingly increases the response of

marginal     value products to variations in product demand. Because income

insurance reduces wages in states of high demand and increases wages in
                                                                        states
of low demand, the responsiveness of quits to variations in product demand

is reduced, as shown in panel (b). To some extent, the firm can compensate

by increased additional hires in states of high demand and by reduced addi-

tional hires n states of low demand (panel (dJ). But so long as the

marginal supply price of        additional hIres    is an increasing functIon of   addI-
tional hires, the effect of income        insurance    cn voluntary separations 'iil

which implies the effect on       marginal value   products shown in panel (a).

       For states of demand in which layoffs are non—zero, panel (a) shows

that   income insurance leads to locally fixed levels of wages and marginal

value products. Panel            translates   this effect on wages into a locally

fixed level of voluntary separations, and panel (d) translates the effect
                                                                                           13
on .arginal value products into a locally fIxed level of additional hires.

The firm's marginal response to changes in product demnnd takes place solely

by way of layoffs in such states, as shown in           panel (c). Because layoffs
are    chosen so as to maintain the marginal value product of the firs

employees    at a fixed level exceeding the minimum        possible    level in the   absence
of income insurance (?anel [al), emp.loyenc in            th presence of income insurance

 II.    An Empirical Assessment of the Theory


        The preceding analysis argues that if income—insurIng labor contracts

 are present in the      labor market, then    wages should be less variable than

 marginal    value products and firms should rely on layoffs as a means of

 emploent        adjustr.ent in states of sufficiently low product demand. That
 this    argument is at least broadly consistent with empirical observation

 can    be sees from the data    presented below   in Table   1.


         Table   1 is based on annual values of residual income, production wor:er

 earnings,       value—added, and average monthly layoff rates for        U.S.   manufacturing

 industries,       .95 to 1976. The first      three   columns of Table 1   list values of
 real annual       residual income per production worker, real annual earnings of

 production      workers, and   real   value—added per production worker, all exarcssec

 relative to their te trends for the sample              period.   Column four lIsts similarly
                                                                                       26

        Definition of variables and source: see Appendix


       The data presented in Table 1 display two characteristics consistent

with the hypothesis that firms stabilize employee earnings. First, production

worker earnings arid     residual   income per production worker move together over

the cycle, but the variability of production worker earnings is substntia11y

less than the variability of residual income per production worker. The

mean annual absolute deviation from unity           for   the series underlyIng colun one

is .082, while the corresponding valuefor column two is only .014.                       Also,
the    mean absolute vcar—to—year change for the relative values underlying

column one Is .098, ccnparcd to .017 for column two,

     To put these nuiibers in conte:t, if f1rs' production fmcticnS
were Cobb—Dou1as and
                                   25


if firms offered no income insurance to their empLoyees, then the percentage
variability of annual   eaings and annual residual income per employee would

beequal, and equal also to the percentage variability or value—added per
employee. But if firms offered contracts that stabi1ied the annual income
of their employees, then the percentage variability      of   residual income per

.employee would exceed the percentage variability of value—added per      employee.27

For the data underlying Table 1 the standard deviations about trend for the

1ogarith of residual income per production worker, annual earnings of

production workers, and value—added per prcducton worker are .102, .013, and

 .024,   respectIvely. The fact that the percentage variability of residual

 income per production worker exceeds the percentage vnriab±lty of both value—

 added per production worker and production worker earnings suggests the

 presence of izcomo inurance. The non—zero variabIlity of annual earnings,

 however, suggests that this insurance is not complete.

         The second feature of Table 1 csistent with the presence of income

 insurance is the existence and signIficant (counter—) cyclical variability

 of layoffs. Although not evident from Table 1, layoffs coprise a signi-

 ficant fraction of total separations. The mean share of layoffs in total

 separations——the mean probability or layoff conditional on separation——is

 .402 for the sample period; ranging from a value of .196 in 1973 to a value

 of .634 in 1958. Corresponding values of the average monthly layoff race

 for those two years are .9 and 2.6, respectively.

         As Table 1 shows, perIods during which residual income per productIon

  wrker lIes belcw its trend    value   are characterized by small deviations of

  annual earnings below trend and high values of layoffs re1atve to trend.

  PerIods of relatively hIgh residual income on average display the reverse.

  The averce year of relatively lcw      resIdual   income (.907 of trend value)
                                      26


has production worker earnings equal to .984 of trend value and layoffs

equal to 1.199 of trend. In the average year of relatively high residual

income (1.065 of trend value), production worker earnings are 1.010 of

trend value, while layoffs are .855 of trend value.

       These   characteristics   appear to be   irtconsistent   with an auction model

of the labor market in which wages adjust to clear the market at all times.

The auction model could explain the relative cyclical stability of earnings

by appropriate choice of labor supply and demand elasticities and by appro-

prIate assumptions about the blat distribution of shocks to labor supply

and labor demand. ut such a model would leave unexplained fis' reliance

on layoffs in reducIng employment. The data in Table 1 indicate a signi—

ficant departure, at     least   in form, from an auction market, a departure which
                                                                            28
can be   rationalized   by an appeal to risk—shifting consIderations.

       But while the data in Table 1 may be qualitatively consistent with the

rIsk—shifting explanation of wage rigidity and layoffs, they may at the same

tIme   be quantitatively inconsistent with that explanatIon. Of particular
interest in Table 1 is the fact that the cyclical behavior of production

worker earnings differs only                    from the cyclical behavior of value—

added per production worker. If                 production functions were Cobb—Douglas,

 the relative variability of value—added per production worker would equal the

relative variability of production workers' marginal value product. Theref:re,

 on the assumption of Cobb—Douglas production functions, Table 1 could

 imply that wages do not differ much from marginal value products, and

 so cast   doubt   on explanatIons of layoffs that rel-y on such a differonce.

        More   generally, on   the assumption that firms' productIon Eunc:ipns are

 of the constant elasticity of substItutIon (C5) for, the interretaticn of

 the data in Table 1 would depend on the elasticity of substItution between

 productIon workers and other factars of productian. Fcr the CS productIon
                                        27



fuctiori, the     percentage variability of residual income per production worker

would   equal   the   percentage   variability of value—added per production worker
                                                                 29
if   fircis supplied no incocie insurance to choir enployees.         Thus, coluns one

and two of Table 1 would continue to suggest the presence of incone insurance.

flowever, internal consistency would require that the elasticity of substituticn

between production workers and other factors of production be less than unity.

For values of the elasticity of substitution less than one, the ralatve

variability of marginal value products would exceed the relative variability

of average value products, while for elasticIties of substItution greater

than one the reverse would be true?° Thus, Table 1 would          indIcate a
difference      in the cyclical behavior of wages and rginal value products

if the     elasticity of substitution were     less than one. It would indicate

lIttle or no difference otherwise. Depending on the value of the elasticity

of substitution, then, the data in colunn tree of Table 1 could either

suport or contradict the hypothesis that the data in coluns one, two,

and four reflect the presence of incce insurance.

        Many studies have estinated production functions for U.S. anufaceuring

industries using the CES fraraework. In general, studies using tine—series
                                                                        31
data    have found elasticities of substitution less than unity.             One night   be

 ternpted,   therefore, to conclude that the data in Table 1 support the          incone
 insurance      hypothesis in a consistent fashion. However, because previous

 estimates      have been based on the equality of wages and narginal value products,
 and   because wages may not equal ciarginal value products in the presence of

 incorne   insurance, it is not clear that previous estinates of the elasticity of
 substitution are valid in the presence of income insurance. Accordingly, it
 seens advisable not to rely on previously estimated elasticities of             ubs:I—

 Interpreting     the "contractingt' period as being of one year's length, this
 equazon would determine the relation between annual earnIngs and annual
marginal value products in the presence of income insurance. It is analogous
 to the equilibrium condition PF' in the absence of income insurance
 (equation [   reduces to this condition in the absence of aversIon to
               11]
 income uncertainty or in the presence off infinitely elastic labor supply) ,            and

 it can play tLe same role in estimation.
       By taking logarithms, equation (ll)can be re—expressed as

 for values of w(s) near the ex—ante mean of w. On the further assumptions
 that: (a) the supply of labor to the fIrm is of constant elasticity with
 respect to annual earnings at the firm; and (b) the marginal risk premium,
 dL(w(sfl/dw(g), is proportional to the logarithmic difference of w(s) from
 the   e:—ante mean lovel      of earnings (as might be the case If enDloyees are
 averro   to percentage uncertainty in their earnings) ,        equation   (16) can b&

 production   functions are CES, equation (17) would take the particularly sizple

 form of

 where F(s) denotes output in state $ and c denotes a constant.

      Interpreted in a time—series context, equation (18) suggests the following

 estImating equation;

where u is a regression disturbance term, and where y can be interpreted as              an
        t
elasticity    of annual earnings with respect to       annual marginal value products,
 holding    expected earnings constant. If      the   labor market operated as an
 auction, with   emlovees   always paid the value of their margInal           product,
 then estimates of equation (19)should result          In   estimated values of r
 near unity. In this case, equation (19)could be interpreted
                                                                         as just a

 that y equal unity.                   Alternatively, if firms offered contracts which stabilized

 employees' income in the manner assumed by equation (11), then estimates

 of y   should   be less than unity, with the difference from unity reflecting the

 degree to which employees' income is stabilized by firms.                               Thus,   at the price

 of some additional assumptions about the form of employees' aversion to income

 uncertainty arid about the labor supply curve facing the firm, CES production

 functions can be estimated ma manner that allows for the presence of income

 insurance. cre importantly for the purpose at hand, these assumptions allow

direct measurement of tho extent to which firms stabilize emloyee income.

     The estimates presented in Table 2 are based on th same data as underlie

Table 1——U.S. manufacturIng industries, 1954 to 1976. In place of the varIable

Ew(t),the regression reported in Table 2 includes a quadratic tthe trend. Given

that Ew(t) is intended to reflect conditions of labor supply, which may be

ecpected to change only gradually over time, the use of a time trend in place

of Ew(t) seems reasonable. A quadratic function was chosen to allow for the

changing industrial, demographic, and skill composition of the labor fcrceover

the sample period.

     The estimates in Table 2 were derived by an instrumental variables estimation

method in order t    allow   for pcssible endogeneity of the explanatory variables.

Auxiliary regressions were first performed for the 1ogarith of product price,

output, and output per production worker. Fitted values from these regressicns

were then used to estimate equation (20). In addition toa quadratic time trefld,

the auxiliarj regressions included, as explanatory variables the logarIthms

of the current and previous year's values of:      (a) net new orders for manu-

facturing establishments; and (b) an Index of helo—wanted newspaper adver-

tisements.   All nomInal values were deflated by the Consumer Pice Index

(all items). The maintained assumption, of course, is that these variable are

uncorrelated with the error term In
                                       equation (20), although correlated with
product price, output, and output per production worker. There is little
                                                                         çuestion
about the latter5but the asspcion of zero correlation with the error tarm

in equation (20) is subject to some doubt. However, given that short

cyclical deviations from trend are more lIkely to be demand—induced than

labor—supply_induced, it seems reasonable to assume that these variables

mainly reflect variation in product demand that iS

    The diagnostic statistics reported in Table 2 are self—explanatory and

require little orrtnent. The only questionable statistic is the Durbin—atson

statistic, which lies toward the upper tail of the inoonclusive region for a

test of positive autocorrelation in the residuals. Equation (20) was also

estimated by a Cochrane—Orcutt procedure to account for the possibility of

autocorrelatd errors, but the resulting estirnate of the auto—correlation

coefficient was only .l19, with a standard error of .211. Further, the

estiaces of all coefficients were virtually unchanged and the standard

errors were ncrcased only slightly when the presence of autbcorrelated

disturbances was allowed for.         If autocorrelation is present In true regression

disturbances, it is ncc significant enough to alter an'; conclusions based on

the estItes in Table 2. Therefore the following discussion will focus only

en the estirates shown     in   Table 2.

     Conditional on the naintained assunotions underlying equation (20),

the estimates in Table 2 offer support for the Incone insurance hypothesis.

Contrary to the predictions of an auction nodel of the labor narket, percentage

changes in product price do not translate into equal percentage changes in

annual earnings when annual narginal products are held constant. Indeed,

accordIng to the estjnatcs in Table 2, the elasticity of annual earnings with

respect to annual narginal value products is only .221. Thus, for the data

underlying Tables 1 and 2, annual earnings appear to be roughly only one—fifth

as responsive to annual tharginal value products as an auction rnodel of the
                                 36
labor narket wu1d suggest.

     This estiiated     relation between annual earnings and annual arEir.a1   value
products    can be used to neasure    the relative variability of employees' annual
rginal      value products over the sample period. The fitted values f:a equation U)

provide    yearly   crtIatcs    o log?F' + (l—i)lcgEw, where Ew is a quadratic functtn
                                              33
of    tine. Thus, if these fitted values are regressed on a quadratic function             of
time,       the residuals from that regression will measure the percentage de'rLatlon

of    argina1 value products from          (quadratic)   trend, multIplied by the factor .

If    these error teris are then divided by the estiiated '? arid exonentia:ed,

the    result   will be an estimated serIes for employees' marginal value products,

expressed relatIve to trend as in Table 1.

        Table 3 below lists these estinated rnarginal value product relatives

for production workers in U.S. manufacturing, 1954 to 1976. For purposes of

comparison, the corresponding relative values of annual earnings of production

workers are reprinted from            Table   1. Table 3 also lists the ratios of the

two    series'    yearly values, which can be interpreted as measuring the relative

difference between annual earnings and annual narginal value products over the
                    37
sample period.

     Taken together, Tables 1 and 3 offer consistent support for the

income insurance hypothesis. Annual earnings and annual narginal value
                                                                38
products are related in the nner suggested by Figure 3.              Also, the -

relation   between layoffs atd the excess of annual earnings over       annual
marginal value products is as shown in that figure. At this aggregate level,

the data are strongly consistenc with the hypothesis that firns reduce the
extent to which wages reflect marginal value products and, consequently, rely
on layoffs to induce separations in periods of low product denand.
     More detailed evidence related to this phenonenon is presented below
in Table 4. Table 4 presents estinates of equation (20) for eighteen two—
digit U.S. Manufacturing industries. The estimates again are based on annual
data for the period 1954 to 1976. In basic form, the method of estimation

used for Table 4 was the same as that   used   for Table 2. There are thrne diE—

ferecces, however. First, In addition to net new orders and an index of help

wanted newspaper advertisements, the regressions reported in Table 4 included

as first—stage instrumental variables the logarithms of value added and average

annual production worker earnings for all manufacturing industries other than

that for which estimates were being derived.     Second, many of the regressions
reported in Table 4 were estimated by a Cochrane—Grcutt procedure to allow for

autocorrelated disturbances. The decision to correct for first— or second—

order aut0000relation was based on an F—test with significance level of .05.

Third, in order to conserve degrees of freedom, the
                                                        equations underlying
Table 4 imposed the restriction of constant returns to scale, except where

earnings     with   respect   to rginal value products, 1,     lies   more than t-o

standard     errors below unity. For six of those fourteen,           the   estimated

value of y lies within two standard errors of zero. Th remaining eight

industries' estimates of '        are fairly uniformly distributed over the ur.i
interval.

       It   is interesting to note the diversity in the estImated degrees of Income

insurance present In the industries listed in Table 4.            In the absence of any

recognition of labor mobility, one would have to explain this diversity by an

apceal to inter—industry differences in risk aversion on the part of employees

or employers. .Then labor mobility is recognizd, however, these differences

can, at least potentially, be related to           observable variables.
       According     to equation (11),   the   response of wages to changes in marginal

value products will be smaller as the elasticity of labor. supply to the fi Is

smaller. In :h.       presence   of highly inelastic labor supply, the marginal benefit

from a wage reduction will be low, since the marginal labor supply response to

that wage reduction will be low. Therefore, the firm will be discouraged from

varying     wages in response to changes In product demand.

       A special case of this general principle occurs when there exIst

 fixed costs of interfirm labor mobility which are significant in relation to

 the potential benefits from such mobility. For reductions in product demand

sufficiently limited or temporary in nature that the present value of the

benefits from       labor   mobility remain less than the cost of Intorfirm mobility,

 the relevant elasticity of labor supply to the fi would be determined by

 the   distribution of employees' values of leisure. If          that discributian      were

very dense over some small range considerably below the firm's mean wage and
were of     small density in the region of the fIrm's rean        wage, then:       (a) the
                                           37



relevant, local elasticity of labor supply to the firm would be near zero;

and (b) the potential efficiency loss from laying off an employee would be

small, sInce the difference between employees' values of leisure would be small.

For temporary, limited reductions in product demand or extensive fixed costs

of interfi mobilit,, therefore, layoffs would dominate wage reductions as a

means of employment adjustment. It follows that, for any given distribution

deteining the siae and duration of              shocks   to product demand, the larger the
fixed cost of interfi labor
                                     nobility, the less likely would be a wage—

induced em?loyment response and the more likely would be a response by way
                                                                                        of
layoffs.      Also, given any dIstribution of mability costs among fis in an

industry, the larger the average cost of mobility, the smaller would 1e the

average    response of wages to changes in marginal value products.
       This   argument can be extended to the presence of firm—         or   indust,—
specific   human capital as well. Interpreting the mobility—induced depreciatIon
of   human capital as a fixed cost of labor mobility, the above
                                                                          reascning suggests
that   industries with a greater degree of specificity in the human capital of

their employees should have lower estimated values of y. Further, given
                                                                        any
positive      relation between   the specIfIc and general components of human capital,
this reasoning- suggests also that industries with hIgher average annual
earnIngs should have lower estimated values of y. 40
        Although the evidence is not conclusive, it is interestIng to           note that
the    estlmated values of y in Table 4 are
                                                   negatively related to the    mean annual
earnings      (over the sample   period)   of prcduction workers in those industries.

                                                                   average reni

     More directly, Lot the seven industries having estimated values of         -y



less than .15, the average real annual earnings of production workers is equal

to 6173, in comoarison with an average of 4191 for the three Industries

with estimated values of '        greater   than .83, and an average of 5457 for the

remaining   eIght intermediate industries. Thus, on the hypothesis that general

and specific human capital are positively related, the estimates in Table 4

suggest that the extent of income insurance Is greater in industries employing

more highly specific human capital.

     This suggestion is made even more strongly when inter—industry variation

in employees' education is accounted for. Holding average annual earnings

constant, an increase in the median level of education In an Indust can be

interpreted as reflecting an increase In the generally marketable component

of employees' human capital relative to the more specific, less easily
                       41
marketable comoncnt.        On this interpretation, therefore, Industries vith

higher median levels of education should have hIgher estImates of Y

average   earnings are held constant. Correspondingly, because inter—industry

variation in      nean     earnings nay reflect differerces in           either   the general or

specific component of enployees' hunan capital, and because controlling for

education   would nake inter—industry variation               in   rrean earnings nore reflective

of inter—industry differences in specifIc hunan capital, any negative relatIon

between mean earnings and es:iated values of y should be strengthened when

education is controlled for.

     As can be seen fron the regression results in Table 6 below, the

estImates in Table               are consistent also with this stronger set of hypotheses.

The estited coefficient on nedian education in the above regression is

positive and, although statistically significant only at a level of .10,

fairly large relative to the coefficient on nean earnings. Moreover, the

inclusion of nedian education considerably strengthens the es:ia:ed negative

relation between nean earnings and estinated values of y. By focusing oLly

on education and earnings, alnost forty percent of the inter—industry varia—

ton in estimated values of ' can be accounted for.

        Evidence of the relation between income insurance arid specific human

capital also can be seen in the relation between the estimated values of '

in    Table 4 and the median job tenure of male emoloyees in the corresponding

industries. On the assumption that inter—industry variation in median job

tenure reflects inter—industry differences in human capital specificity,

the previous discussion would suggest a negative relation between estimated

values of y and median job tenure. The estimates in Table       4 are   clearly
consistent with this hypothesis, as can be seen from the regression results

shown below in Table 7.     Over one—fourth of the inter—industry varIation in
estimated values of y can be explained by inter—Industry variation in median

job tenure.

       The estimated values of y in Table 4 reflect also on the relevance of

equation (11—8) in explaining inter—industry differences in layoff rates..

As discud i Section          1 the presence of income insurance implies the

use   of   layoffs as a means of reducing employment in perIods of
                                                                     sufficInly

low product dernand.    Further,   the greater the degree of incone insurance, the

higher would be the critical state of dear.d
                                                            below which layoffs becone Dositive.

Consequezitly, for any given interfjrn distribution of
                                                                     produc demand, industries
with higher average degrees of income insurance also would have higher
                                                                       average
layoff rates.

     With reference to Table 4, the irplication of these considerations is

that estimated values of y should be negatively related to average layoff
                                                                          rates,
ceceris paribus. Marginal evidence of this relation can be seen below in
Table 8. As the estlates below suggest, industries in whch.1ayoffs corprise

a larger share of total separations tend
                                                    to have higher degrees of income
insurance (lower estina:ed values of r).
                                                     Equivalent'y,    industries with high
degrees of incone insurance tend to rely more on layoffs to achieve a

given level of separations.

     Also, for a given average level of layoffs, industries wIth higher
average levels of se'aratjons tend to have hIgier estImated values of y.

In part, this may   reflect the   fact that industries with hIgher average levels

of voluntary separations are those with relatively low degrees of     specificity
in   employees' human cooltal. Eut it may also reflect the    fact that industries
with higher values of y.are more likely to respond to    reductions   in product

demand   by the use of wage reductions and so have higher average levels of
voluntary separations.
      The estimated values of y                   are entirely consistent
                                  presented in Table 4

with the income insurance hypothesis. In absolute value, they are as the
thoory predicts, and perhaps more importantly, they vary across industries in
a manner implied by the theory. Further, they appear to be related to inter—
industry differences in layoff rates as the theory suggests they should be.
In conjunctIon with Tables 1, 2, and 3, the evidence contained in Table 4
appears to warrant acceptance of the hypothesis that flrms stabilize the
income of theIr emoloyces in a manner sImIlar to that described by equation (ll)."

       The empirical analysis in this section suggests that firms supply
income insurance to their employees by reducing the extent to which
wages reflect marginal value products, and that firms consequently rely
on layoffs to reduce employment in states of sufficiently low product
demand. However, these results are based on a sequence of within—year
comparisons of earnings and marginal value products. The analysis In
 this section has not considered either the dynamic or longer—term
implications of the theory developed in Section I. The following section
considers these imolicatlons and Interprets the previous results within
the broader context vhich these implications provide.

III.   How Close to an Auction is the Labor Market?


       Perhaps the most striking empirical finding of the' previous sectcn

is the low estimated response of        earnings to   marginal   value products. This
low response     seems to indicate that the labor market differs considerably

from   an auction, at least on a year—to—year basis. Whether the labor market
differs    from an auction on any longer—term basis remains to be seen, however.

       In part, the low estimated values of I in Tables 2 and 4 can be actri-

buted to the inclusion of a tine trend in equation (20). With a time

trend included in the regression, the estImated value of I reflects the move—

ment of wages relative to trend that is induced by movements of marginal value

products relative to :rend. it does not reflect any longer tern relation

between wages and marginal value products that night be Impounded in the tine

trend.      Thus, the low estimated values for I in equation (20) arc not

tecessarily ir'consistent with a longer—tern, trend equality of wages and

marginal      value products.
       This    distinction between short—run and long—ran suggests that while

estimates of equation (20) may reflect the presence of income insurance,

they may not adequately describe the long—run characteristics of income

insurance. Equation (20) assumes that employees' wage expectations are

exogenous. However, with any sort of endogenous, lagged adjustment of wage

expectations, such an assumption requires estImates of that equation to be

interpreted only within an explicitly short—run context. Given enough             tIne
to adjust,     or   given   enough forewarning, the utility loss suffered by eplcyees

as a result of initially unexpected changes ifl         income iht be expected to
approach zero. Thic fact ugostc that the recoonsc of ves to chane
 in marginal value products might be distributed over tine, and that the

 long—run response nigh: differ substantially from the short—tern res?onse.

         Indeed, ecuatton (19) ossumos that the "long—run" elasticity of       ges
                                      44



with respect to (fully anticipated) changes in .arginal value products Is

unity. So long as expected wages change In proportion- to marginal value

products, wages also will    change   in proportion to nargirial value products.

Defining the long run as a period long enough for exoectatlons to                adjust    fully,

the estimated "short—run" values of y        in   Tables 2 and 4 are entirely consistent

with a long—run view of the labor narket          as   an auction.

       To elaborate with a specific exanple, assurne that eoloyees' wage

expectations evolve according to the adaptive schene



(21) Ew(t) = Aw(t—l) + (l—X)Ev(t—l)



In this case, by using equation (19) to express Ew(t—l) as a function

of   PF'(t—l) and w(t—l), and then substituting this expression into

equation (21) to express Ew(t) as a function of those sàe varIables,

equation (19) can be rewritten as



(22) log[w(t)J =    ylog[P(t)] +log[ F(t) J +           y(1—)(l—vJlogEF(t)]
                                           N(t)                 v

                   —y(l—X)log[P(t--l) ]—(l—X)logF(t—1) ]—y[l—] [1—.] (l—X)logfF(t—1)]
                                       C               N(t—l)        o

                   +(l—Xy)logfw(t—l)]+u


       It can be seen fron equation (22) that, so long as neither y nor A

is equal to unity, the effect on wages of a change in narginal.value products

will be distributed over ti'e.     For equation (22) , the short—te elasticity
of   wages with   respect to rginal value products is           equal    to y, whIle the
long—run elasticity (found by setting w = E; in equation [19]) S equal
to unity. ly in the case where y or A ecuals unity will shorz—run and
long—run elasticItIes coincide.
                                         45




       If the labor market operated as art       aucti.n   for all time intervals,

then   estimates of y from equaion (22) should be near unity, while estimated

coefficIents on lagged variables should be near zero. Alternatively, if

 the labor market operated as equation (20) implies, with no endogenity

of wage expectations, then estimated values of y from equation (22) should

be less than uqicy, while estirnated coeffients on lagged variables again

should be near zero. Finally, if employees' wage expectatiris were ertdcgencus,

so that employee aversion to initially unexpected income changes dinished

with the extent of forewarning, then estimates of y from equation (22) should

be less than unity, while estimated coefficients on lagged variables should

be non—zero and indicative of the time—distributed pattern of wage adjustment

in response to changes in marginal value products.

       Presented below in Table 9 are estimates from equation (22) based

on the same data as underlIe Tables 1, 2, and 3.

      I is interesting to note that, although there is no a priori justi—

 fication for equation (21)as a description of employee' expectations, the

estinated coefficients on current price, lagged price, and lagged wage in

equation (22) come very close to satisfying the restrictions
                                                               implied by
equations (19) arid (21).   According to equatIon (22), the sun of the

coefficIents on current price, lagged price, and lagged wage should be equal

to unity. The sun of the estlates of those coefficients from Table 9 is equal

to 1.0005. Hoc.'ever, the estimated coefficients on current and lagged output

per production worker are less consistent with the restrictions in1ied by

equation (22). According to that equation, the ratIo of the coefficients

on currant price and current output per production worker should equal the

ratio of the coefficients on lagged
                                      price and lagged output per production
worker. For the estimates in Table 9, the foer ratio is equal to .52, while

the latter ratio is equal to .197.    However, an increase n the estimated

coefficient on lagged price of less than threefourths of its standard error

would equate the two ratios. Thus, although the estimated coefficients in

Table 9 are not exactly consistent with the
                                              interpretation given them by
equation (22), they are close enough to suggest that equation (21) might provide

a reasonable apProximation to the evolution of employees' wage expectations
             147
over tine.

     This interpretation of the estimates in Table 9 is subject to two

questions. First, it is possible that the estimated coefficents on

lagged varIables simply reflect the effects of aucocorrelated disturbances.

Second, the general fo of equation (22) is consistent with interpretations

other than that suggested by equatIons (19) and (21)

     To address the fIrst question, r.ocice chat if the prover cpecficacion

of equatIon (10) were ivcn by
                                         47

                    0


     where: u(t) =      ou(-l)    +   v(t)


then, written in autoregressive form, equation (19) would become



 (21) logw(t) =    ylog[P(t)] + y1og         F(:) I   —
                                                          pylog(P(t—lfl

                           N(t—l)


which is identical in form to equation (22), but which iplias different

restrictions on the estimated coefficIents. In particular, If equacion(23)

is true, the product of the estimated ccefuicients on current price and

lagged wage should equal the negative.of the coefficient on lagged price, -
and the product of the coefficients on current
                                               output per production

worker and lagged wage should equal the negative of the coefficient on

lagged output per produduccion worker. Thus, the estimated co€fficients in
                                                                                             is
Table 9 can provIde a basis for distinguishing between equations (22) and (2).

      But on this subject, the evidence provided by Table 9 is mixed. In

 absolute value, the    product   of the coefficients on current price and lagged

wage exceed the coefficient cn lagged price by .171, a difference which is

 almost exactly consistent with equation (22).                  In contrast, the product O
 the coefficients on current output per prcducticn worker and lagged

wage differ from the coefficient on lagged output per production worker by

 only .041, a difference more consistent with equation (24) than with

 equation (22). Further, any use of the ectimates in Table 9 to dIs:ingush
                                      48



between equations (22) and (26) is hapered by the fact that the inplicacions

of the two equations are too similar for the data underlying Table 9 to allow

a test with rnuch power. However, a Durbin h—test for serial correlation

yields a value of .602, which is significant only at a level of .275. Thus,

although the estimates in Table 9 should be interpreted with cautIon, it

appears reasonable at this stage to interpret thei as iore than the result of

isspecificacion, and to interpret th•e as they stand.

     The second question rentioned above is less easily addressed. There

is rio guarantee that estiriated coeffIcients fron equation (22) do not sinoly

reflect costs of wage adjustnent that have nothing to do with eloyees'

aversion to income uncertainty. Thus, although the estir.ates frc equation (22)

(and equation [20, for that macter) are consistent with the inco insurance

hypothesis, they cannot be taken as conclusive proof that incoe insurarca
          50
exists.

     Nevertheless, regardless of the true underlying structure of wage

adjusenent and employees' wage ecpectat±ons, equation (22) an be justIfied

on the 'ore general grounds that it is caable of approxiating a wide

variety of distributed lag patterns for the effect     of changes in rginal
value   products on current and subsequent wages. Ex post, it can be justified

on the grounds that   It   fits the data as eli as do nodels which allow for

tore complicated lag structures. Thus, one need not accept the interpre-

tation of equation (22) iolied by equations (19) and (21) in order to

accept equation (22) as a reasonable basis for estizating the t1e—distrIbu:ed

response of wages Co changes in nargil vzlue products, and for testing

whether the long—run resoonse    of   wages to arginai value oroducts differs

fron the short—run rosDonse    in a   n3riner consistent with the incoc irsuronco

hypothesis.

      Therefore, consider the implications of the estinates in Table 9 for

 the time-distributed resoense of wages to changes in m:ginal value products.

The estimated coefficient of .402 on current product price indicates that,

holding the previous year's wage and marginal value product constant, a

ten percent increase in product price would lead to a four percent increase

in wages. In the following year, assuming that product price remained at

its current level and assuming for siz1jjy that marginal products

remained constant, wages would rise by an additional .171 percent (equal

to w(t+l) + w(t÷l) w(t) ).             the sane assumptions, wages would inarease
             3w(t)    P(c)
in the next period by a further .714 of .171 percent (equal to

w(t±2) [3w(t1)+w(t+l)..(t)])       ,   and so on. Ultimately, the complete
3w(t+l)  ?(t)   3w(t) ?(:)
long—run response of wages would be given by fw(t)±3w(t)         ]![l—w(t
                                                   P(t) P(t—1)
which for these data is ecual to 1.0015.      That is, the escated coefficients
from equation (22) imply that the long—run elasticity of wages with respect

to marginal value products Is unity, just as an auc:on model of the labor

market would predict. The short—run elasticity of .402 is sigrif.cant1y

lower, however, and is consistent with the income insurance hypothesis.2

     The question "How close to an auction is the labor market?", then,

is perhaps better posed as "How long does it take wages to respond to changes

in marginal value products as they would res?ond in an auction market?" The

estimated coefficients from equation (22) provide an answer to this question.

Listed below in Table 10 are various
                                         measures (implied by the estImates in

     As colunn one of Table 10 shows, alnost eighty—fIve percent of the

unit—elastic resonse of wages to changes In narginal value products is

achieved within five        years   of the initial shock. Alnost ninety percent is

achieved withIn six years. The nean lag for the effect of a change in nargicl

value products on wages is equal to 1.811 years, and, as colunn one clearly
                                  51

shows, the distributIon of lagged effects is heavily weighted toward short

lags. Thus, although the labor narkec appears not to operate as an auctIon

in a short—run sense, these data indicate that, at the nargin, it nay be

reasonably toodeled as an auction for tine Intervals on the       order   of five

years' length.

     But while the "narginal" deviation of wages fran narginal value products

dininishes fairly rapidly, the cunulative deviation renains. Thus, while a

pernanent ten percent increase in rnarginal value products would lead to an

8.8 percent increase in wages by the end of those six years (column one), the

cu.ulacive effect on wages over those six years would be only seventy percent

of the cunulative increase in narginal value products (colunn two). Dis-

counted at a rate of ten percent, the   present   value of the cunulated effect

on wages would be only sixty—seven percent of the cu.ulated increase in

rginal value oroducts (colunn four). Cunulating over a twenty year period,

the present value of the futue wage changes induced by a peanent, tiie—

zero Increas.e in narginal value products would be equal to ninety percent of

the auction result at a zero rate of interest (colunn two)    ,   and equal to only

eighty—two percent of the auction result at a ten percent rate of interest

(column four).

     As the estinates in--Table 10 show, the labor narkac returns fairly

rapIdly to the equality of wages and narginal value products. But the interin

period of inequality between wages and narginal value products reduces the

wealth effect corresponding to any given peranent change in narginal value

products by ten to twenty percent. Although the effects of incone Insurance

on enployee incone and the allocatIon of labor disappear in the long run, r"e

stabillzjr.g effect on eplovecs' realized wealth renains. In ans;;er to the
                                      52



question posed by this sectIon, the analysis indicates that the labor market

does operate as an auction, but with        an   adjustment Derlod of around six years.

This period of partial adjustcnz reduces the potential variability of

employees' realized wealth by approxirnately ten to twenty percent. In the

short—run, the   labor   market appears to differ from an auctIon market both in

terms of factor rewards and in terms of factor allocatIon. In the long—run,

it appears to differ only in terms     of   realized wealth.

Appendix. Sources and Definitions of Variables Used in the Enpirical Analysis

     Listed below by table are sources and definitions for the variables

referred to in the text.



Table 1, oae24

     Relative values for profit per production worker, annual earnings of

production workers, and value—added per production worker were constructed

by regressing the logarithn of the variable in question on a constant, tine,

and tine squared, averaging the deviations within the given periods, and then

exonentiating those averages. The relative values for layoff rates were

constructed by regressing the layoff rate on a constant, tIne, and tine scuared,

exoressing the actual values relative to fitted values, and then taking a

geoet:ic average of those relative values within the given periods.

     "Real" values were formed   by deflating nominal values by the Consuner
Price Index (all iters).

     Data   for production workers (as opposed to all employees) were chosen

to avoid possible biases due to cyclical changes in the composition of

manufacturing employment.

     Annual values of residual income (before taxes) were

taken from various issues of U.S. Federal Trade Comission, Quarterly

FinancIal Reort for nufacturin, inin2, and Trade CorDorations,

though these authors recognize chat state—invariant wages might not be
optimal where wages influence the ex post allocatIon of labor among firms,
their analyses do not relax the separation of cx post intcrfi   wage dif-
ferences and cx cost interfirm labor mobility, and do not explore ch
determination of optimi wages and layoffs in situations where completely
state invariant wages are not optimal. Some previous authors have allowed
for ex post interfirm labor mobility and ex cost wage variability (see, for
example, Grossman, and Akerlot and iyazaki), but as yet the optimal extent
of ex post vage variability has not been analyzed.

          5
              No credit can be claimed for the basic structure of the odel that
 is developed in this section. In major respects it is identical to that
 developed by Sally (1974) and Azariadis (1975). However, the extension of
 this model to allow for cx post interfirm labor nobility is original to
 this author. For a first analysis along these lines, see Brown (1976).
          6
       Although identical in productivity at their current employment, emloyees
 of the fi may differ in ptoductive characteris•tics of value elsewhere. Con-
 sequently, there may b a distribution of best alternative employments and
 alternative earnings among the firm's enloyees. If the firm's employees are
 assumed to be identical in all respects, this distribution should be inter—
 preted as a short run phenomenon due to limited information.
      The presence of severance pay in this model constitutes a second !mortant
 departure from the assumptions standard in previous analyses of income—insuring
 labor contracts. Non—wage pavrzents to laid—off workers are a widespread prac:ce,
 but their inclusion in the model does more than sim1y add realism to the ana..ysis.
 The existence of such state—contingent suc1enen:ary payments significantly
 alters the implications of the model with rosect to both the extent and mix of
 wage reductions and la'offs which the firm makes in states of slack product
 demand. It can be shown, in fact, that such pavmn:s are necessary if layoffs
 are to be an element of the oo:imal contract. Further, the model crovides a
 natural justification for such payments in theIr effect cm the cctimal derre-2
 of efficiency in oroductic: and resource allocation. The absence of such payen3
 in previous analyses is scmewhat puzzling, given that such aymcn:s nov cm—
 siderably reduce       the degree of   inccme uncertainty implied by any given degree
 of   employment umccr:ainv.
                                  57

       An alternative assumption would be that the firm pays all employees
laid off in a given state some fixed payment independent of the value of the
nextbest alternative which is realized. This alternative assummtion was re-
jected for two reasons. First, it would not allow the firm to stabilize emloyee
income as effectively as does the separation pay policy assumed in the text.
It therefore appears that this alternative policy would be dominated by a
policy of the sort assumed in the text, at least within the context of the assurao—
tioris underlying the present analysis. Second, given the limitations irapcsed by
the single—period framework of the model developed in the text, the separation
pay policy assumed does a better job of approximating the manner in which paments
made to laid off workers depend on those workers' realized alternatives (e.g.,
on how long workers remain unemployed before being reemployed).
          8
       For simplicity, the analysis assumes that a unique distribution of
 demand at other firms exists, and that the realized state of dend for the
 firm's product is simply a drawing from this distribution. This assumption
 makes the supply of labor to the firm   deterministic within each state of
 demand for the firm's product, and it insures that maximizing over all states
 of own product dem.and is the same as maximizing over all distributions of
 demand.
    Letting f(v) denote the probability density function for alternative
earnings within the fi's initial labor force, N(s) would be given by
A (s )   +c
  I f(v)dv, where A(s) = (l—.(s))w(s)--.A(s)g(s), where c denotes a
  0
fixed cost of interfirm mobility, and where ,(s), u(s), and g(s) are as
defined below.
          10
       Again letting f(v) denote the probability density function for
alternative earnings within the firm' initial labor force, w (s) would
be given by

                                       A(s)+c
               I   (v-c)f(v)dv           I f(v)dv, where A(s) is as defined above.

     11Given the utility function U(w), the level of utility corresponding
 to any given level of income can be approximated by
                                           2
 1.1(w) U(Ew) + U'(EwXw—Ew) +1U"(Ew)(w-Ew)
                              2

 Dividing by U'(Ew) yields
                                                                         2
 IJ(w)             [   U(Ew)    — Ew
                                       J   +   w   +   1 U"(Ew) (w-Ew)
 1J'(Ew)               U'(Ew)                          2 U'(Ew)
 Interpreting equation (2) as an expected—utility—constant constraint, it can
 be seen from this last expression that L(w(s) is equivalent to 1 ______
                                                                   2 U'(E')
       The expected value of this term can be interpreted as the risk premium
  which the firm must pay its employees in order to attract them at the
  start of the period, given the wage and employment schedule :hich it offers
  its employees. Employee aversion to income uncertainty implies that L(w)
  will increase as w diverges from its cx ante mean level. Thus, the firm's
  risk premiwa will increase as the uncertainty of the incce prospect
  which It offers its eamloyces increases.
                                             58
   12
        Defining f(v) and A(s) as above, w (s) is given by
                                                  q


         f   (v—c)f(v)dv   +   I    f(v)dv




        Again defIning f(v) and A(s) as above, L(s) is given by



        / L(v-c)f(v)dv             f f(v)dv


   14
      This implication follows from the fact that the expected marginal value
product of employees is diminishing in N, while expected costs of future relo-
cation are increasing in N. Because the expected net risk—adjusted joint income
of fIrms and employees is diminishing in N, equality at the margin will maximize
the expected value of current and future aggregate net risk—adjusted income.

   15
      More precisely, conditions (6)—(9) joIntly deteine state—s income and
employment for initial employees, but condition (6) does so only indirectly
through its effect on employees' marginal products. The
                                                         following analysis
abstracts from randomness in the supply curve of new hires and assumes that
the supoly curve of new hires is not infinitl'j elastic.

   16
      Condition (6) is, of course, only trivially operative for states of
demand In which additional hires are zero. In such states, if layoffs also
are zero, condition (7) alone determines the optimal wage and, imülicitly,
optimal employment. If layoffs are positIve, conditions (7)—(9) are determinin&.
   17
      Condition (10) is derived from condition (7) by setting ,(s)
                                                                   equal to
zero in condition (7) and by noting that A(s) is equal to w(s) when )(s) is
equal to zero.

   18
        These conditfons are not extreme. Tne elasticity of labor sup1v
  to the firm will diminish as the firm's wage diverges from its mean value
 if the density of the alternative wage distribution among the firm's employ—
 ees    Is greatest at
                     the mean wage and falls as the firm's wage approaches
 extreme values. The marginal risk premium, dL(w(s))/dw(s), i11 increase
 in absolute value as the firm's wage diverges from its mean ir employees
 are averse to income variability or uncertainty, since dL(w(s))/dw(s) is
 equal to —U"(Ew) (w(s)—Ew)
            U' (EwY
    19
         This result follows from the fact that, defIning L() as   above,
dL(g(s))/dg(g)    is equal to zero only if g(s) is equal to Ew.
                                     59
   20
        It is easily seen that conditions (7) arid (8) both reduce to condicon (10)
when g(s) is set equal to u(s).
       To understand this result, notice that the firm's payments to its eriloyees
are made responsive to product price only because of che effect of those payments
on the labor supply realized by the firm. Now, after all quits for the period
have occurred, and given the assumption embodied in the model that supplemental
payments made to laid off workers do not influence those workers' search behavior,
supplemental payments to laid off workers induce no labor SuPply response.
Consequently, there is no reason not to eliminate that income uncertainty uhicri
results from being laid off, given that state s has occurred arid given that the
employee has riot quit in state s..  The optimal poiicy therezore makes employees
indifferent to being laid off in any particular state.
       This result rests on the assumPtion that severance payments de to laid
 off workers do no: influence those workers' search behavior. In the absence of
 thi.s assumption, it would not generally be profitable for severance
                                                                      payments
 Co eliminate the income loss associated with layoff status.
    21
      Because this result rests on the ecuality of g(s) with u(s), it rests
also on the assumptions underlying that equality.
    22
      The optimal layoff policy in the presence of fully co.pensating
severance payments provides an interesting contrast to the optimal layoff
policies in models for which severance pay is riot an element of the labor
contract (see, for example, Sally (1976) and Azariadis (1975, 1976).
If severance pay is assumed not to exist, then the firm's layoff strategy
will be directly inf1unced by employees' aversion to inéome uncertainty.
In the absence of severance payments, the firm will hoard labor in periods
of slack product demand in order to mke work at the fi more attractive
to current and prospective employees. The firm's layoff strategy will
therefore be less efficient from the standpoint of production and resource
allocation, sacrificin; some productive efficiency Lu ordor to reduce
income undertainty for emoloyees. It uill not generally be profitable
for the firm to eliminate the risk of layoff, however, and so the fIrm
will have to pay some premium to its employees in the form of higher
mean earnings in order to compensate for whatever risk reains. This
premium would be reduced if the fIrm were to make severance paents
to its employees. It could be eliminated if those severance payments
were fully compensating, as assumed in the text.

      The relative allocatjve inefficiency implied by a layoff diminishes
as the firm's wage is reduced because the difference u—E(vlv<w} dimInishes
as thefirms wage is reduced.
    24
      In the absence of income insurance, the following equality would
hold in equilibrium

         _______   = P(s)F'(s)   =   u(s)
         dh(s)

Now, suppose that u(s) were reduced (e.g., in order to reduce the extent
of unexected wace incronscs in states of high demar.d) and c(s) ncroasod
so as to keep employment  constant. In this case the following would be
true
i(s)+h(s)d(h(s)) >
        ,, 1.-.
                     P(s)F'(s)   ,
                                            60


 and h(s) would be reduced to restore equilibrium. Alternatively, if w(s)
 were Increased (e.g. in order to reduce the extent of unexpected wage
 reduction in states of low demad) and h(s). reduced so as to keep employ—
 ment constant, the following inequality would result   -

 ii(s)+h(s)du(hCs))     <   P(s)F'(s)   ,
           dh(s)
 and h(s) would be increased to restore equilibrIum. In either case, it would
 not be optimal to fully offset the effect of a change In the wage paid to
 initial enployees. Only If i(s) were independent of h(s) would complete
 offsetting be optimal.

    25
       Panel (b) assumes a stable distribution of alternative wages among
 the firm's employees, while panel (d) assumes a stable supply curve of
 new hires to the fim.       -


    26
            A precise descrIption of the manner in which the numbers presented
  i   Table    1 were derived ca be found in the appendix.
      27
           For the Conb—Douglas production function, F(,N) —.
                                                           z KN,   annual
residual income per emnlcyee in the absence of income insurance would be
given by (l—e—)( )/N, and annual earnings per employee would be given by
PF( )/N. Taking the coefficient of variation as a neasure of percentage
variability, it can be seen from these expressions that in the absence of
income insurance, the percentage variability of annual earnings and annual
residual income per employee would be ecual, and equal also to the percen-
tage variability of value—added per employee. At the opposite extreme, if
firmscompletely stabilized the wage income of their employees, residual income
per employee would be given by (l—g)PF( )/N — , where    denotes the stabilized level
of wage paents per em1oyee. It is easily seen from this expression that
in the presence of such complete Income insurance, the percentage
variability of residual income per emloyee (again measured by the
coefficient of variation) would exceed the percentage variability of
value added per employee by a factor equal to one plus the ratio of
labor earnings to residual income.

 Using these expressions in the definition of profits yields

 Residual income in the absence of income insurance would be DrOortiOna1 to
 value added. Thus, residual income cer production worker would be proportical
 to value added per production worker in the absence of incomo insurance, and
 both would have the same percentage variability.

       This is not a general result, but it is true- for                              the data underlying

      Expression (17) is derived from (lô)bv substituting Rlcg[w(s)/Ew] in
place of dL(w(s))/dw(s), and c in place of dogN(s)/diogw(s). For an
example in which the assumption of dL(w(s))/dw(s) = Rlogf(s)/Ew] would be
approoriate, consider the logarithmic utility function U K1ogwj. Recall
that L(w(s)) is equal to —i U"(Ew)[w(s)—Ew}2. For the logarithmic utility
                                        2 U'(Ew)
function         this term would be equal to 1 fw(s)—Ew]2, and so dL(w(s))/dw(s)

log(F(t)/N(t)) =          constant +       alog[w(t)/P(t))             u
                                                                           t
This formulation follows from setting w =                     PF       and v=l in the expression
                                                                   N

       This limited degree of response applies to annual averages of hourly
and weekly earnings as well. Empirical evidence of this fact is available
from the author upon request.

    37
      The ratio of the relative values of annual earnings and annual marginal
value products will equal the ratio of their absolute values if annual earnings
and annual marginal value products follow the same trend. Equation (20) imolies
that they do follow the same trend.

    38
      This statement interprets the "contracting period" of Section I   -
to be of one year's length.

    39
      The estimated coefficients presented in Table 4 do not differ significantly
from those that allow for non—constant returns so scale in all industries. Also,
they do not differ significantly from estimates based on annual averages of
hourly or weekly earnings. The complete set of estimates from which those
presented in Table 4 are drawn is available from the author upon request.

      See Mincer for evidence that general and specific human capital are
positively related.

         See Parsons for a development of this argument.


       It is interesting to note that the estimated values of ' in Table
bear no systematic relation to the percentage of workers unionized in the
corresponding industries. In contrast, empirical work from Lewis to 4edoff
suggests a negative relation.


       These conclusions are not altered when different sets of estimated
 values of y are chosen. Alternative versions of Tables 5— corresponding
 to different sets of estinated values of y are available from the author
 upon requcst.


       For example, if the time—series behavior of marginal value products
 were given by

 PF'(t) = a      +a t-f-a   t2+u       ,   Eu       = 0
                01 2               t            t
 and if employees' wages in the presence of income insurance were given by
         =   a +a t+a
              01 2
 then estimates of equation (20) would indicate non—ecuality of wares and
 marginal value products even though longer—term, trend ecuality existed. I:
 iS worth repeating shic the following analysis interprets the "contracting'
 period as being of one year's length, and thus equates "wages" with annual
 earnings.

      No claim of origInality is made here. For a previous example of
 thisframework, see Cagan. This expectations model is assumed only for
the purpose of illustration. It will not generally be an unbiased
predictor of future wages. For a discussion of this point, see Muth.
