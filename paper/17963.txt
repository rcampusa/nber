                                              ABSTRACT

What are the gains from international trade? And how do immigrants influence this process? While
economists have considered these questions before, particularly in the context of aggregate trade flows,
there has been no work assessing the relation between immigration and international trade in varieties—that
is, the trade of particular goods from particular geographic areas. We consider the case of Canada,
document its impressive experience with import variety growth in the period from 1988 to 2007, and
relate this variety growth to the process of immigration. We find that import varieties grew 76%, that
this growth is associated with a welfare gain to Canadian consumers as large as 28%, and that enhanced
immigration flows may be responsible for 25% of this variety growth and its attendant welfare gains
for native-born Canadians.

1. Introduction

       One of the foundational issues in economics has revolved around the gains from


international trade. However, for all the clear-cut implications of the various leading models of


international trade, the empirical evidence has always been more ambiguous. In most instances,


the gains from trade are shockingly hard to identify and surprisingly small in magnitude. But in


recent years, the tide has turned as researchers have picked up this question again and sought to


apply new techniques drawn from applications of consumer demand and index number theory. In


particular, Broda and Weinstein (2006) have reawakened the profession’s interest in the role of


variety in enhancing consumer welfare, a theme which was successively piqued with papers by


the likes of Krugman (1979), Romer (1994), and Bils and Klenow (2001).


       Their paper may best be thought of as an ambitious and detailed exercise in bringing the


original work of Feenstra (1994) to the data. Building on Feenstra’s insight that trade data could

readily be used to trace the impact of new varieties on an exact price index of a single good,


Broda and Weinstein (2006) extend this work to demonstrate that with a few reasonable


simplifying assumptions, a similar methodology can be used to compute an aggregate price index


for imported goods. Their results were dramatic: the bias introduced by not considering new


import varieties in a standard import price index for the United States is on the order of 1.2% per




                                                                                                     2
year. Cumulatively, this implies an unmeasured welfare gain to US consumers from international


trade in the period from 1972 to 2001 representing 2.6% of GDP.


       In this paper, we are able to contribute to this literature on two fronts. First, we exploit


highly disaggregated Canadian trade data which is especially rich with respect to Canada’s trade


with the United States. Reflecting the unique relationship between the world’s largest bilateral


trading partners, Canadian agencies have consistently recorded import data not only on a very


wide range of commodities, but also at the level of US states. Thus, we are able to employ a new


working definition of variety which moves beyond the traditional taxonomy of a particular good


from a particular country by considering sub-national accounts. What is more, we are able to


document higher rates of import variety growth, and hence, larger welfare gains than would


potentially be the case by treating the United States as a single entity.


       Second, we also seek to identify the sources of import variety growth. Two likely

suspects present themselves in the form of economic growth and the reduction of trade costs. We


draw from a long literature relating immigration to the growth of international trade via the


reduction of trade costs. However, as a departure from this literature, we explicitly consider the


role of immigration in fostering the growth of import varieties, arguing that immigrants are in a


prime position to facilitate this process. Presumably, they possess superior knowledge of good




                                                                                                      3
varieties, market conditions, and regulatory environments in their home countries. Potentially,


they also face lower opportunity costs of engaging in import activity in the host country.


          In sum, our results are that Canadian import varieties grew 76% from 1988 to 2007, that


this growth is associated with a welfare gain as large as 28%, and that enhanced immigration


flows may be responsible for 25% of this variety growth and its attendant welfare gains. In what


follows, we first consider the data on variety growth in Section 2. Section 3 introduces the


paper’s empirical strategy. Section 4 lays outs our results with respect to the influence of import


variety growth on implicit prices and consumer welfare. In section 5, we consider potential


sources of this variety growth, namely immigration, while section 6 concludes.




2. Data: Documenting Variety Growth

          The most recent wave of globalization has deepened Canada’s already formidable

engagement in international markets due to the reduction of trade and nontrade barriers and freer


capital mobility. As a result, the share of imports in Canadian GDP has increased from 21.40%


in 1988 to 27.55% in 2007.1 However, in considering this rapid increase in import values, it is a


generally underappreciated fact that the rate of increase in import varieties has been even greater.

    Data are obtained from World Trade Analyser and CAMSIM unless otherwise stated.


                                                                                                      4
       We first need to clarify the definition of variety used in this paper. The ideal definition


for a variety would be a market-based firm/brand combination such as the Honda Civic or Ford


Focus. In several micro-level studies, researchers are able to use market-based survey data to


study the effects of variety on welfare or productivity, e.g., Blonigen and Soderbery (2010).


However, survey data is severely limited in terms of data coverage, usually comprising


observations on a single industry for a few years at best. For better or worse, survey data cannot


therefore be employed in macro-level studies which require data on a much broarer scope, i.e.,


the entirety of tradable sectors of the economy. Researchers typically employ trade data


organized along the lines of the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) or


Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) to carry out macro-level studies


and adopt the Armington definition that a variety is a country-good pair as in Feenstra and Kee


(2008). For example, beer produced in France and that produced in Britain are treated as two

varieties of the product “beer”.


       In this paper, we follow this precedent with one important exception. Canadian statistics


are unusually rich with respect to charting trade with the United States, given its overwhelming


role in the Canadian economy. In this one particular case, it therefore becomes possible to define




                                                                                                     5
a variety as a state-good pair.2 That is, we slightly abuse the standard definition of “variety” by


treating each state as an independent exporting area. Again, treating the United States in such a


manner is due to the dominant status of the United States in the Canadian import market. Though


the US share of Canadian imports dropped from 66.36% in 1988 to 54.18% in 2007, the United


States is still the overwhelmingly largest single source of imports to Canada. By way of


comparison, the second largest exporting countries to Canada were Japan in 1988 and China in


2007 with import shares of 7.06% and 8.82%, respectively.


           We can justify this choice of treating state-good pairs as a variety in the following ways.


First, if we were to treat the United States as a single country,3 it would significantly reduce the


count of import varieties and would be equivalent to throwing away good data. Second and more


importantly, it is very likely that large countries—such as the United States—do, in fact, produce


multiple varieties of single goods. Take the example of wine imports into Canada from the


2
    According to the data obtained from the World Trade Analyzer, we separate the United States into the following
54 exporting areas: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of
Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Other Unspecified,
Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, United States Virgin
Islands, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

    This is, in fact, an exercise which we have undertaken. To briefly summarize, the cumulative welfare gain in this
instance ranges from 5.2% to 50% for the most reasonable set of estimates, compared to our headline number of
28% using state-level data. However, we emphasize here an interesting ex-post observation on using state-level data,
namely it results in a set of estimates which is much more robust to the existence of outliers.


                                                                                                                        6
United States. The sources range from obvious areas of production along the West Coast such as


California, Oregon, and Washington but also include Massachusetts, Michigan, and New York.


Thus, treating large countries such as the United States as a single source of varieties likely


understates consumer welfare gains significantly. But the likelihood of inducing such downward


bias is reduced when we disaggregate the data to the provincial/state level. Indeed, the HS data


(i.e., exporting area/good–level data) would converge to the ideal market-based data (i.e.,


firm/brand–level data) if they could be further disaggregated to the city level. In sum, we argue


that treating individual states as separate exporting areas in Canadian imports is not only possible


but also desirable.4


           Based on our definition of varieties, Table 1 reports summary statistics on Canadian


import varieties between 1988 and 2007. In column (2), we document that the number of goods


under HS definitions increased from 12,072 in 1988 to 16,282 in 2007 or by roughly one-third

during these twenty years. At the same time, import varieties (exporting area-good pairs)


increased from 290,726 in 1988 to 512,697 in 2007 or by more than three-quarters. These




4
    As should be clear in our empirical strategy, disaggregation to the state level does not mechanically increase the
impact of variety on welfare even if it is argued that it increases the count of varieties. What is important here is that
the estimated elasticity of substitution across varieties is unbiased, regardless of whether or not varieties are defined
at the national or sub-national level.


                                                                                                                            7
findings clearly show that imported varieties have increased much faster than imported goods as


there are more countries competing in a typical goods market as suggested in column (3) and (4).


       Additionally, column (2) shows that the number of goods in 1988 that still survived in


2007 was 4,207 or only one-third of the total goods in 1988 (one-quarter of the total goods in


2007). That is, 7,865 goods from 1988 disappeared in the following twenty years whereas 12,075


new import goods entered the Canadian market by 2007. Similarly, column (5) shows that only


35% of the varieties in 1988 still survived in 2007 (=102,666/290,726) and that 70% of the


varieties in 2007 are from new import goods (=359,540/512,697). Furthermore, column (6)


shows that if measured in terms of shares of total imports, surviving import goods account for


only about 25% of imports with the remaining 75% being accounted for by the appearance of


new imports.


       In sum, Table 1 reveals that working behind the rapid growth in imports, the growth in

varieties has been even more dramatic. Furthermore, this growth has been accompanied by a


huge turnover in import goods as fully two-thirds of the import goods and varieties in 1988


disappeared while many more entered the Canadian market by 2007, not only making up for the


loss of disappeared imports but also contributing to the dramatic growth in imports. Finally, the


dramatic change in goods and varieties also suggests that studies which limit their attention to a




                                                                                                     8
relatively fixed basket of goods and varieties, e.g., the consumer price index, may be inherently


biased.


          Columns (3) and (4) in Table 1 also show that the rapid variety growth is due to the


increase in the number of areas exporting each good. To show this more clearly, Table 2 reports


the exporting areas’ ranking in both 1988 and 2007 with respect to the number of goods imported


into Canada. Table 2 shows unsurprisingly that the United States as a whole was the single


largest source of import varieties for Canada in both 1988 and 2007. Also somewhat


unsurprising is the fact that China vaulted in the rankings, jumping from fortieth in 1988 to first


in 2007, provided that the US states are treated as separate exporting areas. Similarly, Taiwan,


Mexico, and India register large improvements. Second, for all this improvement, fully 26 out of


the top 30 countries in 2007 also made the list in 1988. And without exception, all these 26


countries are highly developed and have had longstanding economic ties with Canada dating

from before World War II. The data in Table 2 are also consistent with three stylized factors


which are believed to be the main forces driving the rapid growth in import varieties: the striking


economic transformation of East Asia (e.g., China); the rapid fall in trade and nontrade barriers


in North America (e.g., Mexico and the United States); and enormous FDI inflows via vertical


and horizontal integration (e.g., Japan and the United States) and FDI outflows via outsourcing

(e.g., India).


                                                                                                      9
       Table 3 ranks the importance of countries according to their contribution to Canadian


import-variety growth. Perhaps not surprisingly, emerging markets contribute the most in this


respect: China in the first position is followed in order by Mexico and India. What is more,


greater East Asia is playing a clear role in this process as fully 7 of the top contributing 10


economies are from this region. Finally, it is also worth noting that although traditionally


important import-source areas did not contribute much in terms of import-variety growth, they


are nevertheless the most important exporting areas with respect to the growth of Canadian


import volumes. The rightmost column of Table 3 shows that with the exception of China, only


the usual suspects—places like Germany, Japan, and the United States—have contributed more


than 3% to Canadian import growth.




3. Modeling the Effects of Changes in Variety

       Feenstra (1994) derives an exact price index for a constant elasticity of substitution


(CES) aggregate good allowing for changes in both the variety and quality of existing goods.


This index can also be used in the case of several goods or industries as long as they are CES


aggregates. Broda and Weinstein (2006) extend Feenstra’s price index to the case of several CES


aggregates. As in Feenstra, they show that the bias imparted by ignoring new varieties depends

on their relative share of consumption in those goods, the goods’ weights in total consumption,


                                                                                                  10
and the elasticity of substitution between the varieties of these goods. The first two factors


measure the importance of the new varieties in the consumption bundle. The last factor shows


how much contribution a variety can make in improving welfare. When these elasticities are


high—i.e., the varieties of the same good are easily substituted for one another—new varieties


only make a small contribution to consumer welfare.


           We follow Broda and Weinstein (2006) very closely in the following for expositional


purposes—on this front, we make no claims to originality, but only summarize their work for the


reader’s reference. Suppose that the preferences of a representative agent can be denoted by a


two-tier utility function. Utility is defined over domestic goods ( D ) and heterogeneous goods

( M g ):

                                                        

where   1 and   1 are the elasticities of substitution between imported goods and between

domestic and imported goods, respectively. 5 Gt  1,..., N t  is the set of imported goods at time


t; and bgt  0 is a parameter representing the taste for good g which is allowed to vary over time.

            M g is a composite CES goods which is defined over the varieties of the goods “g”:




5
    Both elasticities are assumed to be greater than one to guarantee that utility is concave over goods.


                                                                                                            11

where  g denotes the elasticity of substitution among imported varieties of the good g;6 I g is the

                                                         

where gt                               and gt 1                                 ; pgv and xgv are the price and quantity

sold of variety v of good g, respectively.


             Equation (3) states that the exact price index in the presence of changes in variety is the


product of two terms: the “conventional” price index defined over a common set of varieties,

                                                                                     1/( g 1)
P M ( I g ) , and the effect of changes in variety, (gt / gt 1 )                               . This ratio of lambdas is actually


a measure of the change in variety weighted by the corresponding import revenue of each variety.


If in the restrictive case where the revenue of each variety is identical, the change in variety

corresponds to V1988 V2007 , the simple ratio of the number of varieties in 1988 and 2007. In other


words, the ratio of lambdas is the inverse of the weighted growth in varieties. The higher the




6
    Sigma is assumed to be greater than one to guarantee that composite goods is concave over varieties.


                                                                                                                                    12
expenditure share on new varieties—i.e., the lower is gt —the smaller is the lambda ratio and


thus the smaller the exact price index relative to the conventional price index. Therefore, an


increase in variety results in a decline in the modified exact price index relative to the


conventional price index. The magnitude of this decline depends on how important the new


varieties are to consumers—i.e., their consumption shares—and the similarity between new

varieties and old ones which is measured by the good-specific elasticity of substitution,  g . As

 g approaches infinity, varieties are perfect substitutes for each other. In which case, 1/( g  1)

                                            1/( g 1)
approaches zero, and the term (gt / gt 1 )            approaches one. On the contrary, when  g is

close to one, varieties are not close substitutes. In this case, 1/( g  1) is high, and the effect of


changes in variety becomes important as new varieties are very beneficial (while disappearing


varieties are very costly in welfare terms).


        Finally, the weighted variety measure is also robust to splitting varieties (for example,

from country-product pair to state-product pair). For example, assume wine is imported from two


US states with equal shares. Then the count of wine varieties will increase by one as one


country-level variety splits to two state-level varieties. However, the weighted variety measure


will remain unchanged since the weight of each new variety also splits in a half. Nevertheless,


this does not imply that more disaggregated varieties contain no additional information. Suppose

wine was initially imported from only one US state and two states later. If we were to measure


                                                                                                          13
varieties only at country level, we may erroneously deem it is a common variety that the U.S.


exports in both periods. However, we can capture the variety change if measuring varieties at


state level.

          Thus for I g  ,  g  G, and d gvt  d gvt 1 for v  I g the aggregate exact import price index

          As stated in Broda and Weinstein (2006), the aggregate import price index in (4) offers

three main improvements over prior work. First, it allows for changes in quality or taste. Second,


it allows for heterogeneous import goods with different elasticities of substitution and, thus,


eliminates the “symmetry bias” arising from the assumption of interchangeable goods. Third, it


remains unchanged even if there is creation or destruction of goods.


          The overall price index E for (1) is then given by

where the exponents are again the log-change ideal weights.




4. Results

        Following the empirical strategy detailed in Broda and Weinstein (2006), we proceed in


three steps in order to estimate the impact of import varieties on Canadian welfare during the


period from 1988 to 2007. In the first step, we estimate the elasticity of substitution among the

varieties,  g , for tens of thousands HS 10-digit goods. Next, we calculate the change in variety,

g , for each good g. After obtaining  g and the corresponding g , we can determine how much

the change in variety affects the exact price index for each good g. In the final step, we apply our


log ideal weights to the change in price due to change in variety for each good g and aggregate


them to estimate the total variety impact on the general price index of Canadian imports. Once

the aggregate impact is obtained, we can easily calculate the effect of variety on welfare based


on (7). Finally, we decompose the aggregate variety effect into individual country contributions.




                                                                                                      15
4a. Elasticities of Substitution


           To correctly estimate the elasticities of substitution, we need at least four varieties over at


least two years for each HS-10 good. However, the service industry, which corresponds to the


HS-2 categories 98 and 99,7 does not have sufficient observations in each of its HS-10 goods and,


thus, no sigmas can be estimated for this industry.8


           We estimate the sigmas for 16,097 HS-10 import goods. By comparison, Broda and


Weinstein (2006) are able to estimate 13,972 sigmas based on HTS-10 goods for the United


States between 1990 and 2001. Clearly, it is impractical to report these sigmas individually.


Instead, in Table 4 we report the average estimated sigma for fifteen HS-2 categories—again,


with the exception of the service industry, which is excluded.


           In column (3) of Table 4, we find that that the most important imports are in


“Machinery/Electrical” and “Transportation,” accounting for 30.17% and 22.93% of total

Canadian imports, respectively. Column (4) reports the number of HS-10 goods in each industry


for which we have estimated sigmas. As might be expected, the highest number of differentiated


goods comes from “Machinery/Electrical” and “Textiles,” representing 3,639 and 2,875


estimated sigmas respectively. Column (5) reports the median number of varieties per each HS-


7
    These numbers represent the first two digits of an HS code.
8
    The mean sigma of this industry, however, is approximated by the mean sigma for the “Miscellaneous imports”
category corresponding to HS 90-97 goods.


                                                                                                                  16
10 good. These range from 9.16 for “Animal & Animal Products” to 24.05 for “Miscellaneous”


while the overall mean for all imports is 15.80. In Broda and Weinstein (2006), the median


number of varieties per HS-10 goods across industries is 18.00. Provided that the mean and


median varieties per good in Broda and Weinstein (2006) are roughly the same, our Canadian


sample seems to mirror that of the United States. Of course, larger markets like the United States


should support more varieties per good than a country like Canada. On the other hand, we have


essentially bolstered the number of varieties per good in Canada by treating the US states as


separate exporting areas.


       As sigma is the elasticity of substitution between varieties, a lower value implies less


substitutability, and thus, less price-sensitive demand as suggested in (13). Furthermore, sigma


also enters the exact price index (11) in the exponential term. Thus, a smaller value for sigma


results in a larger effect for the change in variety on the exact price index. The weighted average

sigmas of HS-2 categories are reported in column (6). These weighted averages range from 1.64


for “Miscellaneous” to 4.19 for “Animal and Animal Products.”


       Almost instinctively, one would expect that the level of substitutability is high in


agricultural and mineral products, followed by light manufacturing goods, whereas it is usually


low in heavy manufacturing and electrical products. In other words, varieties are expected to be

more differentiated in the heavy manufacturing and electrical industry than those in the light


                                                                                                   17
manufacturing industry, mining, and agriculture. The average sigmas in column (6) are clearly


consistent with these priors. The highest mean sigmas are in agriculture (HS-2: 01-24), followed


by mining (HS-2:25-27), light manufacture (HS-2: 28-67), and finally the heavy manufacturing


and electrical industries (HS-2: 68-89). The “Miscellaneous” category has the lowest sigmas


overall, a perhaps unsurprising result as these imports are, by nature of the categorization, highly


differentiated.


           By way of comparison, Broda, Greenfield, and Weinstein (2006) estimate the sigmas for


the imports of 73 countries including the United States and Canada based on HS-6 goods for the


period from 1994 to 2003.9 Based on a similar estimation method, they report that the median


import elasticity of Canada is 5.0 while the simple average is about 10.0, somewhat larger than


our estimates. However, they also concede that the average Canadian sigma is not only much


higher than those of the United States at 4.20 but also higher than those which they estimate for

the entire world at 6.80. Taking their results at face value, one might conclude that Canadian


consumers value varieties much less than other consumers worldwide and particularly those in


the United States, which is paradoxical, given the strong evidence that Canadian consumers’


tastes are fairly close to those of the United States (Dinnie 2004). Another comparison is with

Kee, Nicita, and Olarreaga (2008). They employ HS-6 data for the period from 1988 to 2001, use


a rather different estimating strategy, and report that the simple average of Canadian import


elasticities is 5.75 while the weighted average is only 1.28. That is, our weighted average for


sigma falls between their weighted and simple average. Though in this context it is hard to argue


which estimation procedure is more precise, our estimates are at least in line with the work of


others.




4b. Variety Growth


          After obtaining the sigmas, the second step is to calculate the change in variety for each

good, g . In this case, the calculation of the lambdas requires the existence of common varieties


in both 1988 and 2007, i.e., t  , t=1988, 2007 . As seen in Table 1, the dramatic change in


goods and varieties means that we are in a position to calculate a much smaller number of

lambda ratios than sigmas. Similar to Broda and Weinstein (2006), we assume that whenever a

new variety is introduced within a HS-10 category with I g   (i.e., there exist no common


varieties), then the other HS-10 entries within the same HS-8 category share a common sigma. In


other words, the elasticity of a new variety is a weighted average of the elasticity of other goods


and varieties within the same HS-8 category. Similarly, if a new good is introduced within a HS-

8 category, then it shares a common elasticity with the other HS-8 goods in the same HS-6


                                                                                                       19
category. Likewise, the same rule applies to new goods introduced with HS-6 and HS-4


categories. However, we note that there are no common varieties in the service industry (HS-2


code: 98-99). In this case, we use the sigmas from “Miscellaneous” (HS-2 code: 90-97) for these


two categories.


       On this basis, Table 5 reports descriptive statistics for the 623 lambdas we are able to


calculate. This number of 623, of course, represents the number of import goods we eventually


use to calculate the exact price index. Of the 623 different HS level categories, 52 are aggregated


to the HS-2 level, 100 to the HS-4 level, 67 to the HS-6 level, and 56 to the HS-8 level; 348


lambdas remain at the HS-10 level. Although the difference between the number of sigmas and


lambdas we estimate is large, we emphasize that this study is still based on highly disaggregated


data as the weighted sigmas for the final 623 import goods we use are obtained from the 16,097


individual sigmas. By way of comparison, Broda and Weinstein (2006) generate 926 lambdas

from 12,347 sigmas for the period from 1990 to 2001. Their larger number of lambdas is


principally due to the shorter time span under consideration, and thus, the higher probability of


1990 goods surviving into 2001.


       Interestingly, the lambdas for the 348 HS-10 goods equal 1 in both 1988 and 2007. This


implies that most of the new varieties at the HS-10 level are created in new goods categories

rather than existing ones. This is consistent with a world in which firms distinguish their


                                                                                                    20
products from those of their competitors, and as such, monopolistic competition is the prevalent


market structure. Though all the 348 HS-10 goods exhibit no change in variety (i.e., the lambdas


equal one), they impart very little influence on the overall variety change for the exact price


index as their log-ideal weight is only 2.29%. It is the HS-2 level industries which carry the most


weight at 86.00%, and their average lambda ratio (λ07/ λ88) is 0.91, implying an increase in


variety of 10% (the inverse of the ratio). Similarly, an increase in variety is also documented for


the HS-6 level industries. The HS-4 and HS-8 level industries, however, actually report a


decrease in variety as their lambda ratios are above unity, but they account for less than 10% of


our observations. Thus, we can safely conclude that overall variety did indeed increase in Canada


from 1988 to 2007.


       In section 3, we noted that the ratio of lambdas is actually a measure of the change in


variety weighted by the corresponding import revenue of each variety. This ratio is equal to the

ratio of simple count number of varieties V1988 V2007 only if the revenue of each variety is


identical. From Table 1, we can determine that this ratio is only 0.57, a figure much lower than


even the smallest lambda ratio of 0.91 that we estimate for HS-2 industries. In other words, the


weighted growth in variety suggested by the simple count data is 75% (=1/0.57-1), a figure much


higher than our more carefully weighted growth in variety of 9.9% (=1/0.91-1). This discrepancy

is explained by the fact that import shares are very heterogeneous, with existing goods in


                                                                                                    21
particular having much higher market shares than new ones. This pattern is also seen in the data


for the United States reported in Broda and Weinstein (2006). There, the growth in variety from


1990 to 2001 suggested by count data is more than 117% while the growth in variety from 1990


to 2001 when weighting by import revenue is only 5%.




4c. Import Prices and Welfare


       The final step is to combine the estimates of import goods’ lambda ratios, their


corresponding weights, and elasticities of substitution, in order to calculate the effect of a good’s


change in variety on the exact price index of imports. According to (11), the aggregate effect of


changes in variety on the exact price index of imports can be derived from the multiplication of


the individual effects. However, as Broda and Weinstein (2006) and Broda, Greenfield, and


Weinstein (2006) argue, it is unlikely that the entirety of the estimated variety effects are

reasonable, seeing as how they are derived from tens of thousands individual estimates. The


concern is that a single outlier will severely bias the final result through multiplication. Therefore,


it is imperative that we exclude outliers before calculating the aggregate effect of changes in


variety on the exact price index. We are able to identify 3 clear outliers out of the 623 individual


effects: they are all below 0.80 or above 1.10 in value whereas fully 98% of the effects are

densely distributed in the range of (0.82, 1.07). The three affected HS industries are fruit wine


                                                                                                    22
(2204), film and sheet (3920), and sweet and chilled vegetables (070990). Not surprisingly, the


total import share of these 3 outliers is marginal at less than 1.44%.


       Excluding these outliers, the aggregate effect of changes in variety on the exact price


index of imports between 1988 and 2007 is about 0.35. That is, when adjusted for changes in


variety, the exact price index of imports fell 65% faster than the unadjusted price during the


period from 1988 to 2007. This represents very rapid annual declines of roughly 5%. Lacking


any benchmark for the case of Canada, we again have to compare our results with those reported


in Broda and Weinstein (2006) who find that the variety-induced decline in US import prices for


the period from 1972 to 2001 was 28% cumulatively, or about 1.2% annually. In the United


States, common goods across periods were much more prevalent: from 1972 to 1989, 73% of all


varieties survived; from 1990 to 2002, 67% survived. In contrast, this figure is a mere 25% for


Canada from 1988 to 2007. In other words, Canada experienced a much more dramatic change in

varieties than the United States, and consequently, a larger impact of changes in variety on the


Canadian import price index.


       The log ideal weight of imports in Canadian GDP,  M , for the period from 1988 to 2007

is 23.91%. Therefore, the effect of changes in import variety on the general exact price index,


 , is 0.78, or about 1.25% annually. By definition, the exact price index is derived as the


minimum cost of a unit of welfare. Therefore, if the general exact price index falls by x%, this is


                                                                                                   23
                                       x
equivalent to welfare increasing by        . Since the growth in import varieties results in the
                                      1 x

Canadian general exact price dropping by 22% (=1.00-0.78), we can conclude that the welfare


gain is about 28% (=0.22/0.78) from 1988 to 2007, or about 1.3% annually. Alternatively, one


can also interpret the gain via compensating variation: to restore the initial expenditure, a


representative consumer is willing to sacrifice x% of her real income should there be an x% drop


in the exact general price index. Thus, our results suggest that a representative Canadian


consumer would be willing to give up 22% of their real income from 1988 to 2007 in order to


gain access to new imported varieties.


        Of course, we need to emphasize that all of these results are based on a Dixit-Stiglitz


CES utility structure as in (1), (2), and (3), and this utility structure suffers from a few faults.


First, it assumes that the elasticities of substitution are time-invariant. Second, the functional


form requires that all marginal costs are fixed. Third, there is no interaction between domestic

goods/varieties and imported ones. As Arkolakis et al. (2008) argue, an increase in import


variety may come at the cost of a reduction in domestic variety. Delineating this interaction


remains an important task for future research. Instead, the results we offer here should be


regarded as an initial benchmark rather than the final word on the subject; we encourage others


to take up where we have left off.




                                                                                                       24
4d. Individual Countries’ Contribution to Canada’s Welfare Gain


        While Table 3 does detail individual exporting area’s contribution to the growth in


variety of Canadian imports, the ranking is based on pure count data. A more sensible measure in


light of the discussion above would be the growth in variety appropriately weighted by the


corresponding import revenue. Additionally, with data on hand on the elasticities of substitution


and ideal log weights, we can calculate an individual exporting area’s contribution to Canadian


welfare over this period.


        To begin, we note that the most accurate calculation of an exporting area’s contribution


should be derived from the comparison of the exact price changes, both including and excluding


the area of interest as an individual exporting area’s activity may affect the estimates of lambdas,


omegas, and sigmas. However, such an exercise is computationally cumbersome. Instead, we


assume that all estimates of omega and sigma remain the same and consider how much the

lambdas are affected when an individual exporting area’s change in variety is taken into account.


For example, suppose that an exporting area’s revenue from new varieties of a good g in 2007


accounts for x% of g’s total revenue and that the value of disappearing varieties of a good g in


1988 accounts for y%. Since the (inverse) weighted growth in variety from 1988 to 2007 is

expressed as g07 g88 , this particular exporting area’s change in variety will affect the aggregate


growth in variety by g07  (1  x%) g88  (1  y%) , ceteris paribus. That is, the exporting


                                                                                                         25
area’s contribution to the growth in variety is given by (1  x%) (1  y%) . Therefore, an


exporting area can contribute to the aggregate growth in variety via two channels: one way is to


contribute a higher new variety revenue share in 2007, i.e., a higher x; another way is to affect a


higher rate of survival of its 1988 varieties in 2007, i.e., a lower y.


        Table 6 ranks 30 countries and US states by their respective weighted variety growth and


contributions to Canadian welfare gain. Not surprisingly, China retains first place when we

consider revenue-weighted variety growth, i.e., the inverse of (1  x%) (1  y%) . Its weighted


variety growth from 1988 to 2007 is more than 84%. Other emerging markets, such as Thailand


(fourth), India (eighth), and Mexico (twelfth) also experienced rapid variety growth in the


Canadian import market. At the same time, historically prominent Canadian trading partners still


play an important role. France (sixth), Italy (seventh), and Germany (twentieth) all made the list


while fully 16 of the top 30 are US states.

        Such growth in variety is also of great benefit to Canadian consumers. For example, the


greater range of varieties imported from China alone in this period has improved Canadian


welfare by almost 16%. Cumulatively, other Asian countries contributed another 12% while


European countries contributed 10%. Considering US states in combination with one another, we


find that they contributed almost 34%, underlining the fact that the United States is still the most

important force in bolstering Canadian welfare via the growth in import varieties.


                                                                                                   26
        For those countries not listed in Table 6, only 42 make a positive contribution to


Canadian welfare. The remaining 234 countries have negative impacts on Canadian welfare via


the disappearance of varieties, although these effects are quite small in magnitude. Of the 234


countries in question, 199 have an absolute impact on welfare of less than 1%. This, of course,


implies that the gains in Canadian welfare via the growth in import variety are attributable to a


small fraction of countries with most countries barely maintaining their 1988 level of variety into


2007.


        Finally, it is worth noting that the ranking in Table 6 is also noticeable for its absences. In


particular, we have in mind other historically prominent Canadian trading partners such as Japan


and the United Kingdom, which do not make it into the top 30. We emphasize that the


contributions to welfare we have in mind are solely through the growth of variety. So, unlike


much of the earlier literature, this welfare gain does not spring from the import of capital or other

knowledge intensive goods, making the contribution of Japanese imports, for instance, seem less


important than they may really be. Additionally, many of Canada’s historically prominent


trading partners such as the United Kingdom were already exporting large numbers of varieties


in 1988, making the attainment of a high growth rate in variety difficult to sustain, especially in


the face of fierce competition from emerging markets.




                                                                                                      27
5. On the Sources of Variety Growth

         In explaining the dramatic growth in import variety into the United States, Broda and


Weinstein (2006) note that


         the most plausible explanations for this rise involve some story of the globalization


         process coupled with an assumption that goods are differentiated by country . . . For


         example, reductions of trade costs may have made it cheaper to source new varieties from


         different countries. Alternatively, the growth of economies like China, Korea, and India


         has meant that they now produce more varieties that the United States would like to


         import. (p. 553)


In what follows, we present some of the first empirical results relating variety growth to


economic growth and the reduction of trade costs. In particular, we draw from a long-standing


literature linking immigration with enhanced international trade flows via the reduction of trade

costs.


         Generally, this link is thought to arise from a few sources: immigrants may have a greater


preference for home-country products; immigrants may be in possession of better information


regarding arbitrage opportunities between the host and home countries, product differentiation,


the regulatory environment of their home countries, and/or the existence of immigrant-specific

preferences; or immigrants may be able to better negotiate ethnic networks with respect to issues


                                                                                                    28
of culture, trust, and, presumably, language. Gould (1994), in one of the first studies of this topic,


finds that immigration stocks in the United States via their effects on the transmission of local-


market conditions were systematically linked to not only higher levels of imports but also


significantly higher levels of exports at the bilateral level. The analysis was extended to highlight


the role of consumer manufactured goods in driving much of this result. Using highly detailed


state-level trade data, Dunlevy (2006) confirms this result but differentiates countries according


to their degrees of corruption and the prevalence of the United States’ two dominant languages,


that is, English and Spanish. In this case, the pro-trade effect of immigrants is markedly higher


for those coming from countries with higher levels of corruption and with official languages


other than English and Spanish. Likewise, Bandyopadhyay, Coughlin, and Wall (2008) exploit


the same state-level data to document the importance of ethnic networks in driving the link


between immigration and trade flows. Given the panel nature of their data, they are also able to

identify heterogenous effects across ethnicities, and thus, immigrant populations.


       In the Canadian context, Head and Ries (1998) were apparently the first to bring this


question north of the border. Here, they identify much stronger results for immigrants on


Canadian imports than exports, differential effects on Canadian trade according to immigrant


class with those immigrating under the entrepreneur class mustering a surprisingly weak

performance, and differential effects on Canadian trade according to region of origin with those


                                                                                                     29
immigrating from East Asia expanding trade more than immigrants from any other region.


Coming on the heels of this study and anticipating the broader move to considering sub-national


trade accounts, Wagner, Head, and Ries (2002) consider more exacting specifications of the


underlying gravity model, finding results which simultaneously support but temper those of


previous studies.


       At the same time, most of this literature has concerned itself with the effects of


immigration only on bilateral trade flows, whether this be at the national or sub-national level


(Hatzigeorgiou 2010). One notable and recent exception is the work of Peri and Requena (2010).


In this paper, they document the very pronounced rise in Spanish immigration over the period


from 1995 to 2008. What is more, they exploit highly detailed transaction-level trade data for


Spanish provinces and are able to decompose the effects of immigration on Spanish exports


along two margins. The extensive margin measures the increase in the number of exporting firms

while the intensive margin measures the increase in the volume of exports of existing firms.


They not only find a significant effect of immigration on Spanish exports but also are able to


attribute the bulk of export growth to the extensive margin.


       Here, we extend this literature by considering not the effects of immigration on the


volume of trade but rather the effects of immigration on the variety of imports. Our working

hypothesis is that immigration can positively contribute to variety growth. This relationship


                                                                                                   30
comes about via immigration’s reduction of trade costs in the form of the informational barriers


to trade. At the same time, we heed Broda and Weinstein’s suggestion that economic growth


may also be partially responsible for the growth in import varieties. Thus, our baseline regression


takes the following form,

(20) ln(V jt )   j  t   ln( IMM jt )   ln(YctY jt )   jt ,


where Vjt is the number of varieties from country j in time t, ϕj represents a set of exporting


country fixed effects, θt represents a set of time fixed effects, IMMjt is the stock of immigrants to


Canada from country j in time t, and Yct Yjt is the product of Canada’s and country j’s gross


domestic product in time t. The figures for gross domestic product were derived from the Penn


World Tables version 6.3 while immigrant stocks were derived from the Canadian Census of


Population for 1996, 2001, and 2006.10


           Table 7 reports the summary statistics for our three variables of interest while column (1)

of Table 8 gives the results from estimating equation (20). The point estimates are of the


expected sign, although that for joint outputs is insignificant at the 10% level. The point estimate


for immigrant stocks is, however, statistically significant with a 1% increase in immigrants


stocks being associated with a 0.42% increase in the number of varieties. The specification in


10
     Unfortunately, previous versions of the census, in particular those of 1991 and 1986, do not report immigrant
stocks in a sufficiently disaggregated manner to match the span of our dataset on import varieties from 1988 to
2007.


                                                                                                                     31
column (2) tries to account for any spurious correlation which may arise if the variables of


interest are trending in the same direction over time. Here, estimation takes place by means of


seemingly-unrelated-regression (SUR) where observations on import varieties, immigrant stocks,


and joint output in a given year are treated as a single equation. The coefficients on immigrant


stocks and joint output are restricted to be equal across equations. Although the coefficients


register as being somewhat smaller than before, they still suggest a powerful role for immigrants


on import variety with an estimated elasticity of 0.21.


       In combination, what these results suggest is that, on balance, a 1% increase in


immigration would lead to an increase in import varieties of about 0.30%. Table 1 above


documented the fact that the growth of Canadian import varieties ran at 3.03% per year from


1988 to 2007. At the same time, the stock of immigrants to Canada rose by 2.39% per year.


Pushing our results very hard, this would imply that immigrants to Canada are responsible for as

much as 24% (=2.39*.003/.0303) of the growth in Canadian import varieties in any given year.


These results are significant in a few respects. First, we earlier suggested that the aggregate


growth in import varieties over the period from 1988 to 2007 may have increased Canadian


welfare by as much as 28%. Taken at face value, our results would imply that the average


Canadian consumer was roughly 7% better off in 2007 than in 1988 simply due to the enhanced

varieties of import goods associated with immigration. Finally, these results are an important


                                                                                                   32
contribution to an emerging literature on the effects of immigration on host countries which


moves beyond standard considerations of competition (or complementarity) in local labor


markets. Thus, future debates on further immigration must consider the costs and benefits to host


countries not solely in terms of immigrations’ impact on wages and incomes but also in terms of


immigrations’ impact on consumer welfare via the type of variety effects documented here as


well as the effects of immigration on the prices of other traded and non-traded goods (cf. Cortes


2008; Lach 2007).




6. Conclusion

       In this paper, we have considered the issue of import variety growth, its implications for


the broader economy, and some of its potential sources. In the case of Canada, we document that


import varieties grew 76%, that this growth is associated with a welfare gain as large as 28%,

and that enhanced immigration flows may be responsible for 25% of this variety growth and its


attendant welfare gains.


       One of the keys to these results has been the use of highly disaggregated Canadian trade


data, especially with respect to the United States. Since Canadian agencies have consistently


recorded import data not only on a very wide range of commodities but also at the level of US

states, we have been able to employ a new working definition of variety which moves beyond


                                                                                                  33
the traditional taxonomy of a particular good from a particular country by considering sub-


national accounts. What is more, we are able to document higher rates of import variety growth,


and hence, larger welfare gains than would potentially be the case by treating the United States


as a single entity. We feel that this points one way in advancing the literature in defining


varieties more precisely and using data more consistently.


        At the same time, our results warrant a few caveats. First, there is a marked need for


considering more flexible utility structures than the Dixit-Stiglitz CES framework employed here.


In particular, a better handle on issues relating to time-variant elasticities of substitution are


needed. On a related note, greater consideration of the competition among varieties—both of


domestic and foreign origin—is warranted. The extent to which foreign varieties “crowd out”


existing or even potential domestic varieties could have a dramatic effect on any welfare


calculations. Finally, more work should be done in unlocking the “black box” surrounding

immigration and traded varieties and volumes. After nearly twenty years of research uncovering


the link between immigrant populations and international trade, very little is known about the


precise mechanisms driving the stimulative effects of immigration on the extensive and intensive


margins of international trade. These and the other issues raised by this paper obviously remain


for future work.

(*) HS-2 codes of 98 and 99 refer to the service industry, which accounts for 2.36% of Canadian
imports. However, no sigmas can be estimated for this industry due to insufficient observations
on its goods at the HS-10 level.
