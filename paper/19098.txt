In the past decade, foreign participation in local-currency bond markets in emerging countries has
increased dramatically. We revisit sovereign debt sustainability under the assumptions that
countries can borrow internationally using their own currencies and accumulate reserves. As
opposed to traditional sovereign-debt models, asset-valuation effects occasioned by currency
fluctuations act to absorb global shocks and smooth consumption. Countries do not accumulate
reserves to be depleted in “bad” times. Instead, issuing domestic debt while accumulating
reserves acts as a hedge against external shocks. A quantitative exercise of the Brazilian economy
suggests this strategy to be effective for smoothing consumption and reducing the occurrence of
default.

1 Introduction


       The past decade witnessed the impressive development of domestic government bond

markets in emerging market economies (EMEs). Market depth increased, maturities

lengthened, and the investor base broadened as a consequence of active foreign participation

in local currency bond markets. At the same time, EMEs accumulated international reserves.

However, since the interest earned from international reserves is much lower than that paid

on EMEs’ debts, this policy seems puzzling. What is the role of international reserves if these

countries have the option of inflating away domestic debt facing no significant external

liquidity risks? Why are these reserves not used to repay debt? Are international reserves

ultimately increasing or decreasing the sustainability of EMEs’ debts?

       This paper revisits the question of the optimal level of debt and foreign reserves under

novel assumptions that reflect the recent developments of capital flows to emerging markets.

In particular, increased foreign participation in local-currency bond markets implies that

emerging countries borrow internationally in domestic-currency-denominated bonds. This

makes them subject to new sets of constraints regarding repayment of their liabilities, and

exposes them to new incentives to actively accumulate international reserves.

       We modify a standard model of sovereign debt to quantitatively study how countries

should react to this new reality. We obtain that optimal reserve holdings turn out to be as

large as those observed in the data, and that default almost never occurs. This approach

differs from the traditional model, in that asset valuation effects contribute most significantly

to consumption smoothing. Our results suggest that joint issuance of domestic-denominated

debt and international reserves act as a powerful hedge against external shocks.

       These results are congruous with two trends that have characterized capital flows and

portfolio holdings of emerging countries over the past decade. The first is a strong increase in




                                                                                               1
foreign participation in local-currency bond markets in emerging economies. Using a newly

constructed dataset of the currency composition of sovereign and corporate external debt, Du

and Schreger (2015a, b) show that over the past decade, major emerging market sovereigns

that borrowed as much as 85% of their external debt in foreign currency now borrow more

than half in their own currencies (see also Burger et al. (2012)). Figure 1 displays the increase

in domestic-currency-denominated debt in a sample of emerging markets.

       The second trend is the accumulation of international reserves, depicted in Figure 2.

The average level of reserves in 2014 was more than 25% of GDP in emerging countries, and

only approximately 5% of GDP in high-income countries. As documented by the European

Central Bank (2006), the size and pace of accumulation of foreign reserves has been

unprecedented. Countries have accumulated reserves greater than their IMF quotas,

exhibiting ratios of reserves to imports above four months of coverage, reserves to short-term

external debt maturities above one year (Greenspan-Guidotti rule) and broad money. The

increase in reserve assets is not limited to China or the East Asian countries; its ubiquity




                                                                                                                                                   2
among developing countries has raised interesting questions in academic and policy circles

about the costs and benefits of reserve accumulation.

       The cost of holding reserves has been estimated at approximately 1% of GDP for all

developing countries (Rodrik, 2006). Against this cost, the commonly advanced explanation

is that reserves are accumulated as insurance against the risk of an external crisis, by

providing increased liquidity. However, borrowing constraints for emerging countries are

quite different from what they used to be. More than fifteen years ago, Eichengreen and

Hausmann (1999) advanced the original-sin hypothesis on the limits of emerging markets’

ability to borrow in their own currency. But the gradual redemption of these economies’ debt

sins over the past decade might naturally be expected to significantly affect incentives related

to debt default and repayment.

       In this paper, we study the joint determination of domestic-currency debt and foreign

reserve accumulation by constructing a dynamic equilibrium model of a small open economy

subject to international shocks. To smooth consumption, a benevolent government may issue


                                                                                                                                                  3
foreign debt in domestic and international currencies denominated in the price of non-

tradable and tradable goods, respectively. Domestic and international interest rates may

differ, and we explicitly model the risks associated with such differences. We calibrate our

model to Brazil, a typical example of an emerging country that accumulated international

reserves during debt redemption.

       The basic intuition for our model goes back at least to Bohn (1990), but its empirical

implementation has only recently begun to be studied (see Benetrix, Lane, and Shambaugh,

2015). Having positive net foreign currency positions (assets in foreign currency and debt in

domestic currency) is optimal when a country faces international shocks (such as the

endowment of tradable goods). This is because the asset valuation effects occasioned by

currency depreciation (or appreciation) act to absorb global shocks and smooth consumption.

       Debt and reserve accumulation also affect, and are affected by, a country’s incentives

to default. A large stock of domestically denominated debt could help counterbalance an

external shock but may not be sustainable. A country might not resist the temptation to

default on such a large debt, and could default through such methods as surprise inflation and

an outright restructuring of its services. Very large holdings of international reserves may

also not be optimal. International reserves that are unable to be pledged may not increase the

sustainability of debt. In fact, these reserves may reduce sustainability when debt is

denominated in foreign currency (Alfaro and Kanczuk, 2009). Additionally, because holdings

of international reserves shift consumption to later dates, they may be excessively costly.

       Our quantitative results suggest that the optimal level of international reserves is

fairly large, as the cost of holding these reserves is mitigated by valuation-smoothing gains.

Our model also matches some features of Brazil’s economic fluctuations, being consistent, in

particular, with the reduction in exchange rate volatility.




                                                                                              4
          In our analysis, issuing domestic debt while accumulating high levels of reserves acts

as a hedge against negative external shocks. That is, differently from previous work,

countries do not accumulate high levels of reserves to be depleted in “bad” times, as is

usually suggested in policy circles. This result relates to the vast literature on valuation

effects and optimal international portfolio diversification (Cole and Obstfeld (1991), Engel

and Matsumoto (2009), Alfaro and Kanczuk (2010), Healthcote and Perri (2013), and

Gourinchas and Rey (2014)). We contribute to this literature by explicitly considering a

sovereign’s incentive to default, thus incorporating sustainability of portfolio choices in our

analysis. In further contrast to previous literature, asset yields and exchange rates are

endogenously determined in the model, and are dependent on the government’s portfolio

choice.

          Our paper also relates to the growing literature that examines debt sustainability (see

Aguiar and Amador (2014) and Aguiar et al. (2016) for recent surveys of the literature),

particularly to analyses of the recently increasing role of local-currency debt in emerging

markets (Burger et al. (2012), Du and Schreger (2015 a, b), Hale et al. (2014), Ottonello and

Perez (2017)). Our paper adds to this literature by examining the determinants of reserve

accumulation in emerging markets. The rationale for reserve accumulation based on

interaction with local currency external debt (i.e., “redemption” of the “original sin”), which

was also put forth by Jeanne and Rancière (2011), complements explanations that emphasize

precautionary motives and roll-over risk (Alfaro and Kanczuk (2009), Durdu, Mendoza, and

Terrones (2009) and Bianchi et al. (2012)), financial stability (Obstfeld, Shambaugh, and

Taylor (2010)), externalities associated with the tradable sector or mercantilist view (Dooley,

Folkerts-Landau, and Garber (2003), and Benigno and Fornaro (2011)) and political economy

considerations (Aizenman and Marion (2003)).

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we derive intuition from a

two-period, stripped down version of the model. In Section 3, we present the infinite-period

general model. In Section 4, we calibrate the model to Brazil’s economy and discuss the

results of the quantitative simulation. In Section 5, we present further analyses of the main

results, discuss the robustness of the exercises. Section 6 concludes this study.


2 Two-Period Version of the Model


       We first develop a two-period, stripped-down version of the model to provide

intuition for the joint determination of international reserves and domestically-denominated

debt. Although the model cannot shed light on the sovereign’s “willingness to pay”

incentives, which hinge on the costs from defaulting, this simpler version underscores how

the combination of reserves and debt provides insurance against international shocks and

allows for intratemporal consumption smoothing.

       In this simple economy, the sovereign consumes only in the second period. In the first

period, she decides her holdings of debt and reserves for the second period, which are

denoted respectively by D and R. The sovereign’s preferences are given by:

                                u(cN, cT ) = E [log(cN) + log(cT) ],

where households’ second period consumption of non-tradable and tradable goods are

respectively denoted by cN and cT, and E represents expectation. In the first period,

households do not have any endowment, which implies that D = R (the first period exchange

rate was normalized to one). In the second period, households receive an endowment of a unit

of consumption of non-tradable good, yN =1, and their endowment of the tradable good

follows a stochastic process:

               yTG = (1 + σ), with probability equal to ½ (good state of nature), and

               yTB = (1 – σ), with probability equal to ½ (bad state of nature).


                                                                                            6
       Reserves correspond to riskless bonds that bear interest rates given by ρ. Debt can be

issued either in foreign currency or domestic currency. We assume the sovereign repays debt

in both the good and bad states of nature. In other words, default cannot be used to smooth

consumption.


2.1 Domestic Denominated Debt


       When debt is issued in domestic currency, households’ budget constraints can be

written as:

                    cGN              1             D(1 + r )
                c +
                 T
                 G      = (1 + σ ) + + R(1 + ρ ) −           in the good state of nature, and
                    eG              eG               eG

                      c BN             1              D(1 + r )
                  c +T
                     B     = (1 − σ ) + + R(1 + ρ ) −           in the bad state of nature,
                      eB               eB               eB

where r denotes the interest rate on domestically-denominated debt. International investors

are risk neutral, and must be indifferent between international assets and domestic bonds.

This implies:

                                                  (1 + r ) ⎡ 1 1 ⎤
                                     (1 + ρ ) =            ⎢ + ⎥.
                                                     2 ⎣ eG eB ⎦

       In each state of nature, households’ optimizations determine the real exchange rate

according to the relative marginal utility of tradable and non-tradable goods. Logarithmic

utilities imply the exchange rates are given by eG = 1/cTG and eB = 1/cTB. Market clearing

forces the consumption of non-tradables to equal the endowment of non-tradables. By

plugging the exchange rate into the budget constraints, the government problem can be

written as maximizing:

                                   u (cGT , cBN ) = log(cGT ) + log(cBT ) ,




                                                                                                7
subject to:

                                                    𝑅 = 𝐷,	  
                               𝑐&' = 1 + 𝜎 + 𝑅 1 + 𝜌 − 𝐷𝑐&' 1 + 𝑟 ,	  
                               𝑐.' = 1 − 𝜎 + 𝑅 1 + 𝜌 − 𝐷𝑐.' 1 + 𝑟 ,
                                        1 + 𝑟 𝑐&' + 𝑐.' = 2 1 + 𝜌 .	  

       Before considering that D = R, suppose that cTG + cTB equals approximately two, such

that the last constraint can be approximately written as r = ρ. In this case, it becomes

straightforward to plug the constraints into the maximization as follows:

                                      ⎛ 1 + σ + R(1 + ρ ) ⎞        ⎛ 1 − σ + R(1 + ρ ) ⎞
                              u = log⎜⎜                   ⎟⎟ + log⎜⎜                   ⎟⎟ .
                                      ⎝   1 + D (1 + ρ )   ⎠       ⎝   1 + D (1 + ρ )   ⎠

To make consumption the same in the good and bad states, the government could set either a

very high D or very high R, or both. Since D = R, the solution is to make them both very

high. (Note that, as a consequence, cTG + cTB equals two, and r = ρ).

       The result here is that domestic-denominated debt is a very effective insurance device.

Large holdings of domestic debt (in conjunction with large amounts of reserves) make

consumption approximately equal across different states of nature.

       To better grasp the mechanics of how this is accomplished, consider again the

household budget constraint after plugging in the market clearing condition for non-tradable

goods. They imply that the consumption of tradable goods are:

                                        D(1 + r )
        cGT = (1 + σ ) + R(1 + ρ ) −                  in the good state of nature, and
                                          eG

                                        D(1 + r )
        c BT = (1 − σ ) + R(1 + ρ ) −                 in the bad state of nature.
                                          eB

       There are two terms that make consumption different depending on the state of nature.

One term is the endowment shock, i.e., the sign of sigma. The other term is the domestic

denominated debt, which is valued by different exchange rates.



                                                                                              8
       If the exchange rate appreciates in good states of nature, then the second term offsets

the effect of the first term. It turns out that this is exactly the case. Market clearing conditions

imply that the exchange rate appreciates in a good state of nature and depreciates in a bad

state of nature, thus generating valuation effects over domestic-denominated debt. These

valuation effects work as an insurance device by paying out more in worse states of nature.


2.2 Foreign-Denominated Debt


       If debt is issued in foreign currency, the household’s budget constraint would be

written as:

                      cGN              1
              cGT +       = (1 + σ ) + + R(1 + ρ ) − D(1 + r ) in the good state of nature, and
                      eG              eG

                   cBN             1
               c +
                T
                B      = (1 + σ ) + + R(1 + ρ ) − D(1 + r ) in the bad state of nature, and
                   eB              eB

since there is no default, ρ = r.

        As before, to derive some intuition and before considering that D = R, we plug in the

exchange rates obtained by the market clearing condition to obtain the government problem

                         u = log(1 + σ + ( R − D)(1 + ρ )) + log(1 − σ + ( R − D)(1 + ρ ))

        To make consumption the same in both states, the government would have to make (R

– D) very large. Of course this is not possible, as D = R. This happens because the

government lacks an instrument to redistribute resources across states of nature, and can only

redistribute resources across different time periods.

       The conclusion of this section is that domestic-denominated debt provides the

government with a natural way of insuring against income shocks to the tradable good. Large

amounts of domestic debt (in conjunction with large holdings of international reserves) imply

that the valuation effects become very effective as a smoothing device. In other words, small



                                                                                                  9
endowment shocks are translated into large offsetting payoffs. In turn, this allows for

consumption smoothing across different states of nature.

       In contrast, the role of foreign-denominated debt is to transfer resources across time.

As such, it does not provide any intratemporal insurance. In this simple model, where

consumption happens in only one period, foreign-denominated debt plays no role in

consumption smoothing.

       Note that because this two-period model abstracts from default incentives, it cannot

shed light on the amount of debt and reserves a sovereign chooses to accumulate. Indeed, the

optimal solution in this simple case is for the government to hold infinite amounts of debt and

reserves. However, if we consider the possibility of default, there could be limits to the

amounts of debt the government would hold before resorting to default. In other words,

default considerations imply the need to analyze debt sustainability. And debt sustainability

considerations could, in turn, affect how much consumption smoothing could be provided by

the issuance of domestic debt. The next section tackles these issues.


3 General Model


       We model an economy populated by a continuum of private households, a benevolent

government, and a continuum of international, risk-neutral investors. Preferences are

concave, implying that households prefer a smooth consumption profile for both tradable and

non-tradable goods. To smooth consumption, a benevolent government may optimally issue

foreign debt in domestically-denominated currency and accumulate foreign reserves. The

benevolent government may further optimally choose to default on its international

commitments, in which case we assume it to be temporarily excluded from borrowing in




                                                                                            10
international markets. Default can be thought of as surprise inflation or as an outright

default.1

          We assume the households’ preferences to be given by:

                                                   ∞
                                         U = E ∑ β t u (ctT , ctN )                                    (1)
                                                  t =0


with:
                                                                             1−σ
                                                                         (       )
                                         [ω (cT ) −η + (1 − ω )(c N ) −η ]    −η
                                                                                     −1
                          u(cT , c N ) =                                                  ,            (2)
                                                         (1 − σ )

where E is the expectation operator, cTt and cNt denote, respectively, household consumption

of tradable and non-tradable goods, σ > 0 measures the curvature of the utility, η measures

the degree of substitution between tradable and non-tradable goods, ω indicates the relative

importance of these goods to household preferences, and β ∈ (0, 1) represents the discount

factor.

          If the government chooses to repay its debt, the country’s budget constraint is given

by:

                                ctN                  D            yN       D
                        ctT +       + qtR Rt +1 − qtD t +1 = ytT + t + Rt − t ,                        (3)
                                et                    et           et      et

where Rt denotes the foreign reserves level, Dt denotes the domestic denominated debt level,

and yTt and yNt are, the tradable and non-tradable goods endowments of output, respectively.

The debt and reserve price schedules, qR(st, Rt+1, Dt+1) and qD(st, Rt+1, Dt+1), and real exchange

rate function, e(st, Rt+1, Dt+1), are endogenously determined in the model, and are dependent

on the state of the economy, st, as well as on the government’s decisions. In the benchmark

1
  Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) document the main stylized facts regarding sovereign debt and default. As the
authors document, the cases of full outright default, as are those of outright repudiation of domestic debt, are
rare. Historical average haircut of outright default was around 30%. In other words, the assumption of full
default is a useful simplification both in the case of inflation and outright default.




                                                                                                             11
version of the model, the state of the economy is completely defined by the ordered set st =

(Rt , Dt, yTt, yNt).

         When the government defaults, the economy’s constraint is:

                                  ctN                ytN
                               c + + qt Rt +1 = yt +
                                T
                                t
                                       R          D
                                                         + Rt ,                          (4)
                                  et                 et

where yD = h(yT) corresponds to the endowments of tradable goods in default periods. After

defaulting, the sovereign is temporarily excluded from issuing debt. We assume θ to be the

probability that the sovereign regains full access to international credit markets.

         International investors are risk-neutral and have an opportunity cost of funds given by

ρ, which denotes the risk-free rate denominated in the price of tradable goods. Investors will

choose the debt and reserve prices, qD and qR, which depend on the perceived likelihood of

default and currency depreciation. For these investors to be indifferent between the riskless

asset and lending in a country’s non-tradable goods denomination, it must be the case that,

                                            1       ⎡              e ⎤
                                 qtD =           Et ⎢(1 − d t +1 ) t ⎥      ,
                                         (1 + ρ ) ⎣               et +1 ⎦

                        (5)

                                                   1
and                                        qR =        .                               (6)
                                                  1+ ρ

where dt+1 ϵ {0, 1}t is the occurrence (or not) of default, which is endogenously determined

and depends on the sovereign’s incentives to repay the debt. Note (5) is a version of the

uncovered interest parity condition that considers the possibility of default.

         Because the government chooses debt and reserve levels, the problem of the

households is intratemporal, and has the sole role of determining the real exchange rate.

Individual household maximization equates the relative marginal utility of tradables to non-

tradables to their relative prices,




                                                                                               12
                                                              1+η
                                              ω ⎛ ctN        ⎞
                                      et =           ⎜       ⎟⎟     .                       (7)
                                           (1 − ω ) ⎜⎝ ctT    ⎠

       The market-clearing condition for non-tradable goods is:

                                             ctN = yt .
                                                     N
                                                                                            (8)

       The timing of the decisions is as follows. In the beginning of each period, the

government starts with debt level Dt and reserve level Rt and receives endowments yTt and

yNt. It faces the reserve price schedule qR(st, Rt+1, Dt+1), bond price schedule qD(st, Rt+1, Dt+1),

and real exchange rate price schedule e(st, Rt+1, Dt+1). Taking these schedules as given, the

government simultaneously makes three decisions. It chooses (i) the next level of reserves,

Rt+1, (ii) whether to default on the debt, and (iii) if it decides not to default, the next level of

debt, Dt+1.

       The model described is a stochastic dynamic game. We focus exclusively on the

Markov perfect equilibria, whereby the government does not have commitment and players

act sequentially and rationally.

       Note that international investors and households are passive, and their actions can be

completely described by equations (5), (6), and (7). To write the government problem

recursively, let νG denote the value function if the sovereign decides to maintain a good credit

history this period (G stands for good credit history), and νB the value function if the

sovereign decides to default (B stands for bad credit history). The value of being in good

credit standing at the start of a period can then be defined as

                                       ν = Max{v G , v B } .                                (9)

       This indicates that the sovereign defaults if νG < νB. The value function νG can be

written as:

                           ν G ( st ) = Max{u (ctT , ctT ) + βEv ( st +1 )},               (10)




                                                                                                  13
subject to (3), and the value function νB as:

                  ν B ( st ) = Max{u (ctT , ctT ) + β [θEv G ( st +1 ) + (1 − θ ) Ev B ( st +1 )]},   (11)

subject to (4).

        The recursive equilibrium is defined by the set of policy functions for government

asset holdings and default choice and the price functions for domestic bonds, reserves, and

the real exchange rate such that, (i) taking the price functions as given, the government policy

functions satisfy the government optimization problem, and (ii) prices of domestic bonds,

reserves, and the exchange rate are consistent with the government’s decisions.

        This definition of equilibrium, identical to that of Arellano (2008) and Alfaro and

Kanczuk (2005, 2009), among many others, reflects a game played by a large agent (the

government) against many small agents (the continua of investors and households). It implies

that the government internalizes the effects of its actions over the prices. In our model, the

government internalizes the effect of its asset holdings over the real exchange rate.


4 Quantitative Analysis


        We solve the model numerically to evaluate its quantitative predictions in relation to

the accumulation of debt and reserves, the occurrence of default events and the business cycle

properties of the exchange rate.


4.1 Calibration


        One challenge in conducting quantitative analysis is that emerging countries only

began to issue relevant amounts of domestically-denominated bonds in the middle of the past

decade. The data time span of the current regime, especially concerning episodes of default,

is relatively small. In Brazil, for example, the last default episode was between 1983 and

1990 (Reinhart, 2010).


                                                                                                             14
        We address this problem by calibrating some of the parameters using a much longer

time horizon, during which international debt was denominated mainly in foreign currency.

In transforming our economy to consider the case in which bonds were denominated in

foreign currency, we assume the country budget constraint to be given by:

                            ctN                           ytN
                         c + + qt Rt +1 − qt Bt +1 = yt +
                           T
                           t
                                 R          B         T
                                                              + Rt − Bt ,                            (3’)
                            et                            et

rather than equation (3).

        This is effectively the case considered by Alfaro and Kanczuk (2009), in which B

denotes holdings of foreign bonds denominated in foreign currency. As above, in the case of

a debt default, reserves R continue to be held and can be used to smooth consumption. We

proceed with calibration by considering annual data since 1965.

        We set the international interest rate ρ = 0.04 and the inter-temporal substitution

parameter σ = 2, as is usual in real business cycle research in which each period corresponds

to one year (see Kanczuk, 2004). Due to considerable disagreement over the intratemporal

elasticity of substitution between tradable and non-tradable goods (Akinci, 2011), we make

the elasticity equal to one (the middle of the many possible estimations), and, for that, set η =

0. Our results are robust to many other parameter values. For the weight of tradables, we use

the share of output that corresponds to industry and agriculture, and set ω = 0.35, which is

also consistent with literature estimations.

        Because non-tradable consumption goods cannot be smoothed, we focus on the case

in which shocks are exclusively external, that is, on the tradable endowment.2 We thus make

yN = 1 for all periods. We then set yTt = exp (zTt), and assume that zTt can take a finite number


2
  Since the consumption of non-tradeable goods must be always equal to the non-tradeable endowment,
domestic shocks cannot be smoothed out (unless one considers additional policy tools such as fiscal policy, for
example). Different debt and reserve levels could still affect allocations due to the valuation effects, albeit
quantitatively small, that result from the exchange rate movements.




                                                                                                            15
of values and that it evolves over time according to a Markov transition matrix with elements

πT(zTi , zTj ); that is, the probability that zTt +1 = zTj, given that zTt = zTi, is given by the matrix π

element of row i and column j.

        We calibrate the technology state zT by considering the (logarithm) of GDP to follow

an AR(1) process; that is, zt+1 = α zt + ε t+1 where ε t ≈ N(0,σ ε ) . We obtain α = 0.85 and σ =
                            T        T                               2



0.12. The apparently high value of the standard deviation reflects the fact that the tradable

sector corresponds to roughly one-third of total output. To make the model consistent with

the data, the volatility of the tradable sector must thus be approximately three times that of

total output. As an indirect indication of consistency, we note that the volatility of the

industry and agriculture output is three times as high as the Brazilian GDP.

        We discretize this technology state into nine possible values, spaced such that the

extreme values are three standard deviations away from the mean. We also discretize the

space state of debt and reserves enough to avoid spurious results.

        Setting the probability of redemption at θ = 0.5 implies an average stay in autarky of

two years, in line with estimates by Gelos et al. (2011). Direct output costs are modeled from

default and assumed to be asymmetric. The endowments of tradable goods in default periods

are given by h(yT) = yDEF in case yT > yDEF, and h(yT) = yT in case yT ≤ yDEF. Setting yDEF =

0.85yT implies that tradable output costs of defaulting equal 15%, with the relatively large

number again reflecting the fact that the tradable sector corresponds to one-third of the

economy. The choice of output costs affects the probability of default. Thus, we calibrate

output costs in order to make the interest spread in the simulations equal to the average level

observed in the data, 6.8%.

        To obtain reasonable levels of debt in equilibrium, we set the intertemporal factor at

the relatively low value of β = 0.80, which is common practice in debt models (Alfaro and




                                                                                                       16
Kanczuk, 2009). This calibration of β also makes the average debt service – defined as

Bt − qtB Bt +1 – equal to its observed levels, which is 3.3% of GDP. (This happens because the

interest spread level was also matched).

4.2 Simulation results


       We first simulate our economy under the assumption that debt is denominated in

foreign currency. For the chosen parameters, the invariant distribution displays 48% of GDP

of debt and a 6.1% frequency of default (case (i) in Table 2). These numbers align closely

with the historical data for Brazil and other emerging countries presented in many other

papers. The equilibrium level of reserves is zero, a reincarnation of Alfaro and Kanczuk’s

(2009) result in a model with two sectors (but shocks in only one).

       As discussed extensively in that paper, there is a potential role in this setup for

reserves to smooth consumption when a country is excluded from international markets. But,

because reserve holdings reduce the sustainability of debt, quantitatively their optimal




                                                                                             17
holding is zero. The optimal government policy is to hold (foreign-denominated) debt and

default in extremely bad times.

        As an intermediate step, assuming the government cannot hold reserves (case (ii)), we

simulate the economy with locally-denominated bonds. We obtain, in this case, that the

government holds a fairly small amount of debt (9.8% of GDP) and virtually does not default.

Note that the volatility (standard deviation) of the exchange rate drops from 26.2% in the

case of foreign-denominated debt, and to 7.5% in the case of domestically-denominated debt

with no reserves. Thus, even without resorting to default, domestic denomination results in

more consumption smoothing.

        The level of domestic-denominated debt is small because consumption smoothing can

be attained even without default. Defaulting allows to smooth consumption but is costly: the


                                                                                                         18
exclusion of markets and output drop itself. Since the benefit of smoothing is not needed, the

sovereign opts to choose a level of debt in which she can resist defaulting.

       When we simulate the economy with locally-denominated bonds, but allow the

government to hold positive amounts of reserves (case (iii)), we obtain that, in the invariant

distribution, the economy displays 28.6% of GDP in (locally denominated) debt, with 24% of

GDP in reserves. As in case (ii), the government virtually does not resort to default as a

means to smooth consumption. Note, also, that the volatility of consumption drops even

more, with the standard deviation of the exchange rate falling to 4.2 percent.

       The intuition for holding both (domestically-denominated) debt and reserves,

developed in Section 2, is to allow for consumption smoothing across both states and time.

But the experiment with the full-fledged model yields novel results.

       In the two-period model, the optimal policy was to accumulate infinite amounts of

debt and reserves. In the general model, default incentives and the related issue of debt

sustainability reduce the amount of optimal debt and reserves. That they may, in fact, be

smaller than anticipated suggests that this scheme for smoothing consumption is fairly

powerful.

       A second insight is that the accumulation of reserves is not a problem in terms of

reducing the sustainability of debt when debt is in local currency. The experiment shows the

proposed scheme to be, in fact, sustainable in the sense that the government (almost) never

defaults.

       Put differently, in both the foreign-denominated and locally-denominated debt

experiments, international reserves play a role when a country is excluded from capital

markets. However, this role reduces the amount of debt that is sustainable, triggering

defaults, which are costly. When debt is foreign-denominated, Alfaro and Kanczuk (2009)

obtain that the optimal level of reserves is zero. This paper indicates that, when debt is



                                                                                           19
domestically-denominated, reserves are very useful, owing to their valuation effect, which

helps smooth consumption.

       Given that the interest earned from their reserves is much lower than that paid on their

debt, the reserve accumulation policy of emerging economies seems sub-optimal. For

example, Brazil’s total government debt (domestic and international) in 2011 was

approximately 60% of GDP and paid annual interest of about 12%. Its holdings of

international reserves, at 15% of GDP, earned interest of approximately 2% per year. Over

the last years, many pundits argue that international reserves are too costly, and that Brazil

should use them to reduce outstanding debt.

       According to our model, the logic of accumulating both reserves and domestically-

denominated debt is precisely that it is costly during good periods. When an international

shock is favorable, debt service is higher and consumption is reduced, when unfavorable,

debt service is reduced and consumption increases. When the whole invariant distribution of

shocks is taken into account, a country will enjoy a more stable level of consumption.

       Note that in the proposed construction, the level of reserves remains high during

unfavorable periods. The idea is not to buy consumption goods that deplete the stock of

reserves, but rather to maintain a constant reserve stock that serves as insurance by increasing

the stabilizing effect of domestic-denominated debt. Contrary to the usual argument in policy

circles, reserves are thus not insurance that can be “used” in bad times.

       In fact, the optimal policy function is to hold the amount of debt and reserves constant

in the relevant region, regardless of the period state. For this reason, we opted not to depict

the debt and reserve policy functions since they are just simple horizontal lines.

       To better grasp the mechanism of consumption smoothing without changing debt and

reserve holdings, we proceed as in the two-period model. Consider the household budget




                                                                                             20
constraint (3) after plugging in the non-tradable goods market clearing condition, and

assuming debt and reserves holdings are constant:

                                                                      D
                             ctT = y tT + (1 − qtR ) R − (1 − qtD )      .
                                                                      et

       In good states of nature, endowment yT is higher, which makes consumption also

higher. However, even if reserves and debt holdings (and interest rates) are constant, the

valuation effects of the exchange rate et can also affect consumption levels. If it is the case

the exchange rate appreciates in good periods (depreciates in bad periods), this valuation

effect tends to offset the endowment effect. Equation (7), which equates the relative marginal

utility of tradables to non-tradables to their relative prices, predicates exactly that. That is, in

good periods the exchange rate is smaller (more appreciated) and therefore consumption does

not increase as much.

       Notice that reserve holdings are kept constant, and that debt holdings are kept

constant in domestic units. However, debt holdings in foreign currency change affect the

consumption of tradable goods. In other words, it is the change in debt holdings in foreign

currency that offsets the endowment shock and makes consumption smoother.

       The finding that debt and reserve holdings do not vary with the state of nature is a

striking result. We investigated further the generality of this result by considering alternative

parameterizations and allowing for finer grid around the optimal values. We found that this

invariance result is very robust and, in this sense, seems more qualitative than quantitative.

The essential intuition for the result is that the stabilization effect of issuing local-currency

debt provides sufficient consumption smoothing so that there is no need to change the levels

of debt and reserves.

       Early literature on sovereign debt has proposed two alternative devices to smooth

consumption. One is contingent debt, which is to vary debt holdings depending on the state



                                                                                                 21
(e.g., Eaton and Gersovitz (1981)). The other is contingent service, where debt holdings are

kept constant, but debt services vary with the state of nature (e.g. Grossman and Van Huyck

(1988)).3 Adding to that literature, Grossman and Han (1999) show that contingent service

models allow for more consumption smoothing than contingent debt models.

         More recent literature (e.g. Arellano (2008)) considered models in which contingent

debt and contingent services were simultaneously possible. An interesting result of this

literature is that, in equilibrium, only contingent services are used to smooth consumption. In

contrast, debt tends to be used primarily to front load consumption. A common result in this

literature is that debt holdings are lower in bad times (see Kanczuk and Alfaro (2009)). That

is, changes in the debt level make consumption less smooth.

         As in recent literature, the model in this paper assumes both contingent debt and

contingent services are possible. A novelty is that there are two instruments to perform

contingent service. One is the traditional option to default; the other is valuation effects via

exchange rate changes.

         The finding that debt and reserve holdings do not vary with the state of nature is

striking at first sight. But it can be seen as a reincarnation of the result that only contingent

service is used for consumption smoothing. The stabilization effect of issuing local-currency

debt provides sufficient consumption smoothing.

  That is, consumption smoothing is achieved by making service contingent on the realization of income: the
sovereign services its debt in full only when it realizes high income and faults either partially or fully when it
realizes low income.

denominated debt. These assets (or liabilities) could potentially be held against both the

Brazilian private sector and the rest of the world.

       In our model, only the government is assumed to be able to hold international assets.

However, the position of the full country (government and private sector) against the rest of

the world is, in fact, the closest concept to be contrasted with the model. The challenge in

doing so is the absence of comprehensive data about the denomination of private sector

holdings.

       Although some information about private sector debt holdings is available, it is

common practice for firms to change the denomination of debt using market derivatives. It is

similarly common for foreigners to use derivatives to gain exposure to the Brazilian currency

and invest in carry trade strategies. Because these derivatives to swap currencies are often

Shambaugh (2015)).4 Given the lack of comprehensive data, we assume international

reserves and foreign-denominated government debt to roughly correspond to the country’s

position in relation to the rest of the world.

        The case of domestic-denominated bonds is more complicated. We know that before

2003, foreign exposure to Brazilian currency debt was quite small.5 Post-2002, because the

increase in debt was concomitant with the accumulation of reserves, as depicted in Figure 3,

it is natural to assume foreigners to be responsible for a large fraction of it.

        Table 3 summarizes the data. Rather than guessing the holdings of assets and

liabilities, we indicate the net position in each denomination. Before 2006, there was virtually

  Anecdotal information indicates that even large firms that issue bonds denominated in dollars hedged most of
their currency exposure after the substantial depreciation in 1999 (Central Bank of Brazil (2015)).
5
  In 2002, the Brazilian five-year CDS, which measures the risk of dollar denominated debt, was as high as
4,000 basis points. In periods with such risk of default, it is highly unlikely that foreigners would hold local
currency.



                                                                                                             24
no local-denominated external debt. After 2006, holdings of reserves were higher than

holdings of foreign-denominated debt. Thus, the net position of foreign-denominated

securities switched from debt (liabilities) to assets (reserves).

        The comparison between Table 2 and Table 3 requires some discussion. As there was

no available data on the consumption of tradables and non-tradables, we chose the exchange

rate as the primary variable to contrast with the model. Due to a small sample, a single crisis

could imply differing output volatilities. We therefore calculated the ratio between the

exchange rate standard deviation and output deviation to make the comparison of the model

and data more robust.

        Our argument is that with debt redemption, the Brazilian economy should move from

case (i) in Table 2 (foreign-denominated debt) to case (iii) in the same table (domestically-

denominated debt and international reserves). The country seems to be in the process of

changing from one steady state to the other, whereas Table 2 shows the economy to already

be in the steady state invariant distribution.

        We propose considering the 2006-2014 time-horizon of Table 3 data as an

intermediate step in the transition from case (i) to case (iii) in Table 2. Interpreted this way,

the model accounts for the exchange rate’s cyclical behavior reasonably well. The ratio of

volatility of the real exchange rate to that of output dropped by half, from 11.8 to 5.6 (Table

3). According to our model, this ratio should drop from 9.4 to 1.5 if the country moves from

one steady state to the other (Table 2). Brazil, however, is still far from converging on the

steady state. During the 2006-2014 period, Brazil’s holdings of international reserves were

13.4% of GDP. In the proposed steady state, these holdings would reach 24% of GDP.

        Table 3 additionally depicts the correlation of the exchange rate and output. For the

two periods considered, the correlation was -0.90 and -0.87. In our model, there being shocks

only to tradable goods, this correlation is equal to -0.99 in case (i). A simple way to reduce



                                                                                              25
this correlation would be to add (uncorrelated) shocks to the non-tradable sector. We

nevertheless adopt this comparison to support our hypothesis that non-tradable sector shocks

are not a quantitatively important factor in our analysis. Consumption smoothing by itself

makes this correlation very low, once domestic debt is considered.

         For completeness, Table 3 also reports consumption standard deviations, as a

secondary indication of the volatility reduction, and the correlation between net exports (trade

balance) with output. We observe that the volatility of consumption also drops in Brazil, both

in absolute value and as a fraction of GDP volatility.6 However, the mere fact that the

volatility of consumption is a lot higher than GDP volatility raises questions of the use of

consumption in the place of exchange rates.7

         The moments related to net exports suffer from a related problem. As there are no

investments in our endowment economy, the correlation of net exports with output is

intimately related to the volatility of consumption. Thus, in the model, consumption

smoothing implies that net exports are very procyclical. In contrast, as Table 3 shows, the

trade balance is countercyclical in the data.8


6
  Measurement problems with Brazilian data render consumption volatility a particularly noisy information. In
Brazil, as in other emerging countries, there is no direct measure of inventories. Total GDP is then calculated
from the supply side. In order to make GDP from the demand side equal to the supply side calculation,
inventory changes (and any other mismeasurements) are implicitly added to the consumption component. In
other words, consumption is obtained by the residual. As a consequence, the reported consumption component
becomes less reliable and more volatile than expected. In the US national accounts statistics, in contrast,
inventory changes are measured and reported. Consumption is more informative and is less volatile than GDP,
as usual theory suggests. To illustrate the problem, we can make the US data comparable with Brazil, by adding
the change in inventories and measurement residual to the original U.S. consumption series. The resulting
consumption series becomes more volatile than GDP, as in Brazil. According to this perspective, consumption
volatility in the Brazilian data is not a reliable indicator. As a consequence, the consumption volatility generated
by the model, which is smaller than GDP volatility, should not be considered a limitation of the model.
7
  Alternatively, García-Cicco, Pancrazi and Uribe (2010) modify the basic real business cycle model in order to
match Mexican and Argentinean data moments. One of their findings is that preference shocks are responsible
for most of the excess volatility of consumption over output in these countries. Applying the same logic to the
model here, one could add preference shocks in order to increase consumption volatility. However, this, not
being the focus of the paper, would not add to our understanding of the mechanisms proposed, but would add
computational complexity.
8
  This is a direct consequence of having an endowment economy. There is a long literature (e.g. Backus, Kehoe
and Kydland (1992)) showing how the steep reaction of investments to positive shocks can make net exports
countercyclical in simple models. In other words, there is a standard way to match this feature of the data.
However, for computational simplicity, this paper is abstracting from this issue.



                                                                                                                 26
       Finally, Table 3 reports the correlation between the spread and output. In the first

period the correlation is negative, as expected. In the second period it becomes positive but is

very small. This happens because, with the recent reduction of risk, spreads converge to fairly

small values and become largely irrelevant for the understanding of other variables.


4.4 Evidence from other Emerging Countries


       We now look at empirical evidence for other emerging countries. As we mentioned in

the introduction, the accumulation of domestic-denominated debt in conjunction with

reserves is becoming a ubiquitous phenomenon. This generates several questions. Are the

countries that accumulate more debt the ones that are more susceptible to international

shocks? Has the volatility of the exchange rate dropped more in countries that accumulated

more debt?

       Although a formal analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, in Table 4 we report

selective statistics for countries depicted in Figures 1 and 2, for which Moody’s study offers

complete data. As a word of caution, since the time span covered is very short, it becomes

statistically difficult to capture changes. We opted to define two periods – the first containing

the years from 2000 to 2004, the second defined by the period 2010 to 2014 – to calculate the

averages of the variables. We then obtain the change in the stock of debt, the stock of

reserves and the standard deviation of the exchange rate between these two periods.

       Even though the data sample is very small, this exercise reveals results that are

consistent with our hypothesis. In particular, the correlation between (domestically

denominated) debt accumulation and exchange rate volatility reduction is positive and equal

to 0.3. It is also the case that the correlation of debt accumulation and reserve accumulation is

positive (equal to 0.4). On the other hand, we note that for many countries there was an

increase in exchange rate volatility, in spite of debt and reserves accumulation. We also note



                                                                                              27
that the correlation between reserve accumulation and volatility reduction is slightly negative

(equal to -0.1).

             We believe the best way to look at table 4 is to divide the countries into those for

which the exchange rate was very volatile (Brazil, South Africa and Turkey), and those for

which the exchange rate was already fairly stable in the first period considered (Philippines,

Thailand, Peru, China). In the countries for which the exchange rate was very volatile, the

accumulation of (domestically denominated) debt and reserves had an important effect and

caused a reduction in volatility. In countries in which the exchange rate was already stable,

accumulation did not make a significant difference.

Notes: y and e denote, respectively, output and exchange rate.


             A similar point can be made about the choice of exchange rate regime. Since most of

the real exchange rate volatility comes from the nominal exchange rate, fixed exchange rate

regimes result in very low (real) exchange rate volatilities. One thus expects that, in these

regimes, the correlation between debt (or reserve) accumulation and the exchange rate


                                                                                                                      28
volatility is not informative. In the sample considered, even though all countries have de jure

flexible regimes, some have what de facto resembles a fixed regime (Levy-Yeyati and

Sturzenegger (2003)). This is a reason to focus on the countries with higher volatility. In

those countries, the accumulation of debt (and reserves) had an important effect in reducing

exchange rate volatility.


5 Robustness and Discussion

5.1 Volatility of Exchange Rate


       In our model, as in other standard exchange rate models, the volatility of the exchange

rate is directly linked to the volatility of the ratio of the consumption of tradable and non-

tradable goods. If the volatility of consumption is much higher than that observed in the data,

our model generates only reasonable levels of exchange-rate volatility. Adding to this puzzle,

Engel (1999) shows movements in the U.S. exchange rate to be driven almost exclusively by

changes in prices of tradable goods, which are usually assumed to be equal across countries.

       Burstein, Neves, and Rebelo (2003), addressing these issues in the context of

exchange-rate stabilization, introduce in an otherwise standard model a distribution sector

that can dramatically improve the model’s performance. Rather than adding a new sector to

our model, we invoke their claim that modifying preferences in a standard model can mimic

the introduction of distribution costs.

       We modify, in particular, the utility function, making the share of tradable goods ω =

0.10. As above, we find the optimal policy to be the accumulation of reserves in conjunction

with locally denominated debt, and this strategy to be effective at smoothing consumption

across both different states of nature and time. The only difference between the results of this

experiment and the one in Section 4 is quantitative. In this alternative economy, the levels of




                                                                                             29
local-currency debt and reserves as a percentage of GDP are, respectively, 10.4% and 3.2%.

Thus, the decrease in the importance of the tradable sector implies, as expected, a reduction

in debt and reserve accumulation.


5.2 Shocks to Non-Tradeable Endowment


           As discussed in the calibration of the model, we opted to focus on the case in which

shocks are exclusively external (tradable). Domestic (or non-tradable) shocks are not

essential to the analysis, as they cannot be smoothed out (consumption of non-tradable goods

must be always equal to the non-tradable endowment). However, one can investigate if by

adding shocks to the non-tradable endowment there is substantial improvement of the model

fitness.

           Table 5 reports the results of such experiments. Its first two lines show the exchange

rate and output moments for the Brazilian data in the two periods considered. The next four

rows show the moments from model simulations. The third line corresponds to case (i) of

section 4.2, in which there is only foreign denominated debt and there are only shocks to

tradeable endowment. The fifth line corresponds to case (iii) of section 4.2, in which there are

locally-denominated debts and reserves, but again only tradable shocks. Lines third and sixth

are extensions of the third and fifth lines (respectively), when there are shocks both to

tradables and to non-tradable endowment.

           Note that the correlation between exchange rate and output was -0.90 and -0.87 in the

two periods considered. In contrast, in our model, there being shocks only to tradable-goods,

this correlation is equal to -0.99 when there is only foreign-denominated debt (third line of

Table 5).

           In order to reduce this correlation, we then add (uncorrelated) shocks to the non-

tradable sector. We find that by having the volatility of non-tradable shocks equal to one third



                                                                                              30
of the volatility of the tradable shocks, we can exactly match this dimension of the data. This

is reported in the fourth line of Table 5. Notice that there is no substantial change in the

volatility of the exchange rate.

Brazil 2006-2014                                                 5.6               -0.87
Only Tradables shocks, Foreign Denominated Debt                  9.4               -0.99
Non-Tradables shocks, Foreign Denominated Debt                   9.6               -0.87
Only Tradables shocks, Locally Denominated Debt                  1.5               -0.17
Non-Tradables shocks, Locally Denominated Debt                   1.4                0.25



        We then consider the case with locally-denominated debt. When there are only shocks

to tradable endowment, the correlation between exchange rate and output is much smaller,

although still negative, as in the data. However, when shocks in non-tradable goods are

added, this correlation becomes positive.

        The conclusion of this experiment is that although the inclusion of non-tradable

shocks can improve one dimension of the model, it worsens the other dimension considered

in this section.


5.3 Reserve Accumulation and Exchange Rate Management


        A branch of the literature argues that reserve accumulation is a means of keeping the

exchange rate depreciated, thereby helping to protect a country’s industry and stimulate

exports (Dooley et al., 2003). In this paper we do not consider mercantile considerations for

reservation accumulation. For example, as the commodity boom ended and growth slowed,




                                                                                               31
some countries have used their international reserves to maintain their exchange-rate peg.

However, this has clearly not been the main driver for all countries. Brazil, for example,

maintained roughly the same reserve management policy independent of commodity prices.

       Notice that while in the present paper, reserves are used to smooth the volatility of the

exchange rate, in the literature on reserves and export-led growth, reserves are used to

influence the average value of the exchange rate. That is, in our model, the rationale for

reserve accumulation is to smooth consumption of tradable goods. But as a direct

consequence, the exchange rate is also smoothed. In particular, the exchange rate does not

need to appreciate as much in good times due to the valuation effects associated with the

accumulation of reserves.


5.4 Rationale for Debt Redemption


       In our model, debt redemption, or the possibility of a country issuing external debt

denominated in local currency, implies fewer occurrences of default. A related issue

considers why emerging countries were unable to issue domestically-denominated external

debt previously, such as during the 1980s and into the 1990s. Although a complete

investigation is beyond the scope of this paper, we conjecture that there were two reasons for

recent debt redemption.

       One possibility is that investors could not identify the type of government issuing the

bonds. As Alfaro and Kanczuk (2005) argue, sovereign-default episodes (delays,

rescheduling, etc.) seem consistent with reputation building. This, in turn, is consistent with

the existence of different types of governments, including those that would default

independent of the state of nature (“inexcusable defaults”, in the language of Grossman and

Van Huyck (1988)). Lenders, when extracting information from the default in order to set

the next period’s interest rate, most likely will consider the possibility that in this period the



                                                                                               32
sovereign was of the “bad” type, and charge higher interest rates. It is possible that risk

increased sufficiently to shut down the market. As the type of government in control became

clearer and the risk was reduced, international investors became more disposed to buy debt

issued in local markets.

       A second, related issue is inflation. Inflation and inflation volatility were extremely

high in Latin America during the 1980s, making returns on domestic-denominated bonds

very risky for international investors, possibly so high that investor appetite for this type of

asset was insufficient for the existence of the market.


5.5 Private-Sector Debt


       In our model, debt is issued exclusively by the benevolent government; households

(i.e., the private sector) cannot issue debt and choose their intertemporal consumption. This

assumption raises two issues. First, the analysis would be unchanged were private sector debt

to be included, assuming no distortions or other imperfections (taxes, externalities, time

inconsistency issues) that could drive a wedge between the objectives of the benevolent

government and those of the households. Second, in the event that the objectives of the

government and the households do conflict, the government could attempt to offset, perhaps

even prohibit, household debt and reserve accumulation by creating rules and changing the

law. Thus, unless political economy issues are considered, the assumption that households

cannot issue debt is not crucial to the analysis.

       As mentioned before, since firms often use over-the-counter derivatives to change

their debt denomination, data on private debt is unreliable for assessing net positions. These

considerations notwithstanding, due to the recent Real depreciation, and the consequent

balance sheets risk, the Central Bank of Brazil conducted an inquiry on corporate businesses

to have a sense of the dimension of potential currency risks. As Table 6 indicates, dollar-



                                                                                             33
denominated corporate risk debt seemed fairly small. In particular, the unhedged debt of

firms that have no foreign counterpart amounted to only 3.3% of GDP. This suggests that our

assumption that only the government holds international debt is adequate from a purely

quantitative viewpoint as well.

6 Conclusion


        The past decade was characterized by two new trends in international capital flows to

emerging markets: (1) carry trade activity and associated foreign participation in local-

currency bond markets, and (2) large accumulations of international reserves. We believe that

both can be rationalized as an optimal debt management strategy. Borrowing in domestic

currency can insure emerging countries against international shocks because the valuation

effect that results from currency appreciation negatively correlates with the shock, an

intuition that dates to Bohn (1990).

        We revisit sovereign debt sustainability under the assumptions that countries can

accumulate reserves and borrow internationally using their own currency. Countries do not

accumulate reserves to be depleted in “bad” times. Instead, issuing domestic debt while

accumulating reserves acts as a hedge against external shocks. Asset-valuation effects due to

currency fluctuations act to absorb global shocks and smooth consumption. Our quantitative

study of how reserve accumulation affects governments’ decisions to default finds that


                                                                                          34
optimal holdings turn out to be as large as those presently observed. Our results match

several characteristics of the Brazilian business cycle, suggesting this strategy to be effective

for smoothing consumption and reducing the occurrence of default.
