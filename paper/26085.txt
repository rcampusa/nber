                                          ABSTRACT

In this paper I analyze the process leading to the abandonment of the gold standard in the U.S.
in1933, and the devaluation of the dollar in 1934. I argue that most changes of monetary regime
have an impact on contracts. In this specific case, contracts that were written in terms of gold, or
"gold equivalent," were rewritten in paper dollars. Congress did this on June 5 1933, when it
abrogated the "gold clause" retroactively. The Supreme Court validated the move in February
1935. The result was a very large transfer of wealth from creditors to debtors. I use daily data on
commodity prices to investigate the extent to which these policies contributed to ending deflation.
I find that commodity prices reacted strongly to the announcement of policy changes, and to legal
procedures involving contracts. These results are consistent with the "change in regime"
hypothesis of Sargent.

    1. Introduction

What are the effects of a "change of regime" on key macroeconomic variables, such as prices,
interest rates, and economic activity? By "change of regime" I mean a major alteration in
monetary policy arrangements. For instance, adopting a currency board, dollarizing, joining a
monetary union, abandoning the gold standard, leaving a currency union, and so on. This
question ­ which was tackled by Sargent (1982) in his famous "The end of four big inflations"
paper ­ has become particularly relevant during the last few years, when a number of countries
that don't have a currency of their own have considered reintroducing a domestic money.
Discussions along these lines have taken place, from time to time, in countries such as Ecuador,
Greece and Italy. (Ecuador uses the U.S. dollar as legal tender, while Greece and Italy are
members of the Euro Zone). According to Sargent, if the announcement of the change of regime
is credible, macroeconomic variables will react quickly, even before the new regime is
implemented.

One of the consequence of changes of monetary regime is that they affect contracts. Consider the
case of a country (say, Ecuador) that doesn't have a national currency, but decides to reintroduce
one, the new Sucre. At the time of the reform every contract is denominated in dollars. Assume,
further, that a few days after the introduction of the new Sucre, there is a large devaluation.
Debtors would want to discharge their debts in depreciated national currency (the new paper
Sucres). Creditors, on the other hand, will insist on being paid in USDs, or dollar-equivalent, at
the new exchange rate; after all, payment in USD is what the original contrast established. In
spite of the importance of this issue, very few studies (if any) have addressed it. 1

In this paper, I analyze the most important "change of regime" in the United States' monetary
history: the abandonment of the gold standard in April 1933 and the official devaluation of the
dollar on January 31, 1934. Both of these events took place during president Franklin D.
Roosevelt's first administration. 2 More specifically, I investigate how this major alteration of the
rules of the game, aimed at "ending a big deflation," affected commodity prices. In order to do
this, I use a new high frequency (daily) data set for 1932 through 1935, for the prices of corn,
cotton, rye, and wheat.




1
  To be sure, there have been some studies on the consequences of the Euro, dollarization, and the adoption of a
currency board. On the adoption of a common currency see, for example, Aizenman (2018). On currency boards
and Argentina, Edwards (2010).
2
  In the United States, the gold standard was abandoned in stages. Although gold holding by the private sector and
gold shipments were prohibited in April 1933, the official price of gold was maintained at the historical $20.67 an
ounce for almost nine months. The USD was officially devalued with respect to gold in late January 1934. (See
Section 2 for details).
                                                 2


What makes this change of regime particularly interesting is that in 1933 almost every debt
contract in the United States was written in terms of gold. That is, contracts had a clause ­ the
so-called "gold clause" ­ stating that the debtor had to pay his debt in gold equivalent. This
clause was introduced in contracts during the Civil War, when two currencies ­ one backed by
gold and one not backed by specie (the "greenbacks") ­ circulated side by side. However, since
the official price of gold had been $20.67 since 1834, the gold clause had not been an issue until
1933.

The four specific questions I address in this paper are the following: First, did the announcement
of the abandonment of the gold standard affect commodity prices, even before the USD was
officially devalued? Second, how fast did the legal alteration in contracts affect prices of
commodities. Third, what was the impact of the actual official devaluation of the dollar, on
January 31, 1934, on prices? And finally, how did the legal proceedings related to the abrogation
of the gold clause, including the hearings at the Supreme Court, impacted prices during the early
months of 1935. The emphasis on commodity prices stems from the fact that these policies were
ostensibly undertaken as a way of ending deflation and raising agricultural prices. (Roosevelt,
1938).

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 I provide some background
information on the process that led to the abandonment of the gold standard (April 1933) and the
official devaluation of the dollar (January 1934). This analysis will help put the empirical
investigation in Sections 3 in the proper historical perspective. In Section 3 I analyze the effects
of the different policy announcements and policy measures on commodity prices. Finally, in
Section 4 I offer some concluding remarks.

   2. Change of monetary regime in 1933-35: Historical Background

Before proceeding with the empirical analysis, in this Section I provide some historical
background. In Table 1 I present a detailed timeline with the most important economic events
from 1933 through 1935.

       2.1 From the gold embargo to the gold buying program

On March 6 1933, when he was barely one day in office, President Roosevelt declared a national
banking holiday, and implemented a gold embargo. On March 9 Congress passed the Emergency
Banking Act, which gave authority to the government to liquidate insolvent banks and to provide
                                                            3


support to those that were viable in the long run. On March 13, banks began to reopen their
doors, and the public started to re-deposit cash and gold. 3 The gold embargo remained in place.

On April 5, President Roosevelt issued an Executive Order requiring people and businesses to
sell, within three weeks, all their gold holdings to the Federal Reserve at the official price of
$20.67 per ounce. 4 On April 19, during a press conference, FDR announced that the nation was
off the gold standard, and that gold exports were prohibited. He stated that the goal was to help
the agricultural sector. He said: 5

                  "The whole problem before us is to raise commodity prices. For the last year, the
                  dollar has been shooting up [this was a reference to the depreciating pound
                  sterling] and we decided to quit competition. The general effect probably will be
                  an increase in commodity prices. It might well be called the next step in the
                  general program."

In spite of announcing that the country was "off gold," no decision was made with respect to the
exchange rate. The official price of gold continued to be $20.67 an ounce, a price that had
prevailed since 1834. Since France was on the gold standard, the official USD-Franc exchange
rate continued to be fixed; the dollar-pound sterling rate had been fluctuating since September
1931, when the United Kingdom abandoned gold.

On May 12th, Congress passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA). This legislation
authorized the President to increase the official price of gold to up to $41.34 an ounce. 6 The
objective was to generate "controlled inflation," and to help farmers by raising commodity prices
and by lightening their debts in real terms. The view espoused by supporters of devaluation ­
including economists Irving Fisher and George F. Warren ­ was that a higher price of gold
would rapidly be translated into higher commodity prices. In spite of the AAA, the official price
of the dollar remained at its historical level.

Devaluing the dollar officially, was not straightforward. As noted, most debt contracts ­ both
private and public ­ included a "gold clause," stating that the debtor committed himself to paying
back in "gold coin." A dollar devaluation meant that the value of debts subject to the gold
clauses would automatically increase, generating generalized bankruptcies and a massive

  The Thomas Amendment gave the President three options to help increase commodity prices: devaluing the
dollar, remonetizing silver at a ratio of 16 to 1 relative to gold, or to issue up top three billion dollars of non-backed
currency or greenbacks.
                                                           4


increase in the public debt. On June 5, Congress passed Joint Resolution No. 10, annulling all
gold clauses from future and past contracts. The official exchange rate with respect to gold,
continued to be $20.67 per ounce.

One week after debt contracts were changed by Congress, an important international conference
was inaugurated in London. The London Conference was supposed to deal with protectionism
(tariffs), credit policies, employment, commodity prices, and the possible return of all nations to
an "international standard." On July 3, President Roosevelt sent a cable to the delegates stating
that he was unhappy with the direction the discussions had taken. There was too much emphasis
on short run exchange rates stabilization and not enough on commodity prices and recovery. He
reiterated that the goal of economic policy around the world should be to generate "controlled
inflation." 7

On Sunday October 22, during his Fourth Fireside Chat the president reiterated that the
fundamental goal of the government was to "restore commodity price levels." 8 He said that in
order to accomplish this goal he was putting in place a "gold buying program." 9 The RFC
(Reconstruction Finance Corporation) would buy newly minted gold, and, occasionally, gold in
the international markets, at arbitrary prices that exceeded the ongoing price in the global
marketplace. 10 Although the program was limited in scope, it was expected that by offering
higher prices for gold, agricultural prices would increase rapidly. The brain behind this gold
buying program was Cornell professor George F. Warren. On October 25, the first day of the
program, the RFC paid $31.36 per ounce of gold, 27 cents above the world price. 11 Throughout
the gold buying program the official exchange rate remained at $20.67 per ounce of gold.

On January 31, John Maynard Keynes published an open letter to President Roosevelt in the
New York Times. In it he strongly criticized the US exchange rate policy, including the gold
buying program supported by Professor Warren. Keynes wrote: "The recent gyrations of the
dollar have looked to me more like a gold standard on the booze than the ideal managed currency
of my dreams." 12 In early January 1934, almost coincidentally with the publication of Keynes
open letter, the gold buying program was effectively ended. 13 On January 31, 1934, one day

  In rigor he was expanding greatly a very small gold buying program that had been implemented in late August.

   In order to get around the fact that the official price of gold was still $20.67 an ounce, the RFC paid with its own
discounted debentures, which were immediately bought by the Treasury at par. See Acheson (1965).

13
   Formally, the program continued through January 1934, but there was only one price change, on January 16
from $34.06 to $34.45 per ounce. As I point out below, if I extend the period considered under the program, the
results are virtually identical.
                                                            5


after the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 was signed into law, the President set the new official price
of gold at $35 an ounce. The Treasury would buy and sell internationally any amount of metal at
that price, in order to settle trade payments. Americans, however, were still forbidden from
holding gold. This official price for gold was in place until mid-1971.

           2.2 The Supreme Court gold cases

As soon as the dollar was officially devalued, there were legal challenges to the new Gold Act
and the Joint Resolution. Creditors asked the courts to require debtors to pay in "gold
equivalent," at the new exchange rate of $35 an ounce of gold. As a number of cases made their
way through the courts system, an increasing sense of uncertainty percolated into the markets.
On November 15, 1934, the administration announced that it was asking the Supreme Court to
consolidate a number of cases related to the abrogation of the gold clause and to hear them
together. According to the administration, this was the only way to reduce uncertainty. The Court
announced that it was hearing these cases on January 8, 1935.

Between January 8 and January 10, 1935, lawyers for claimants and for the government argued
in front of the Justices. According to the press, the administration lawyers, including the
Attorney General, did poorly. Many thought that the abrogation would be declared
unconstitutional. This unleashed what the New York Times called a "speculation fever for gold."
(See Edwards, 2018, for details).

The Supreme Court rulings came on February 18. The Justices confirmed, by a 5-4 vote, the
constitutionality of the Joint Resolution that annulled the gold clause in private debt contracts.
According to the Court, Congress had the power to alter private contracts retroactively, if that
was required to run monetary policy. The decision regarding public debt was more controversial
and complex. The Court ruled, also by a 5-4 vote, that although the abrogation was
unconstitutional for public debt contracts, there were no damages, and thus the government did
not have to compensate holders of public debt. The Court argument was based on the idea that
because of deflation, the same amount of paper dollars that were used to buy the original Liberty
Bonds would buy an even greater amount of goods in 1934. That meant, the majority of the
Court argued, that investors had not been negatively affected by the abrogation of the gold clause
and subsequent devaluation of the dollar. These rulings put an end to the controversies related to
the 1933­1935 change of monetary regime in the United States. 14

Most scholars who have studied the Great Depression ­ including Friedman and Schwartz,
Meltzer, Bernanke, Eichengreen, and Romer ­ agree that this change in monetary policy played a
fundamental role in the U.S. recovery. Starting in February 1934, and largely as a consequence


14
     For details of the legal proceedings and the Court rulings, see Edwards (2018).
                                                       6


of the devaluation of the dollar, the U.S. experienced large inflows of gold. These were
monetized by the Federal Reserve, with the concomitant increase in the monetary stock.
According to Romer (1992, p.781, emphasis added): 15

         "Monetary developments were a crucial source of the recovery of the U.S. economy from
         the Great Depression... The money supply grew rapidly in the mid- and late 1930s
         because of a huge unsterilized gold inflow to the United States... [T]he largest inflow
         occurred immediately following the revaluation of gold mandated by the Roosevelt
         administration in 1934."

         2.3 Key dates

As the discussion presented above indicates, there were a number of key dates around the
"change of regime" that took place in the United States in 1933­1935. In the empirical analysis
in this paper I have focused on six specific and important dates (See the timeline in Table 1 for a
more detailed and granular display of important dates):

     ·   April 19, 1933. This is when President Roosevelt announced, during a press conference,
         that the US was getting off the gold standard.
     ·   June 5, 1933. On this date Congress passed the Joint Resolution that abrogated the gold
         clauses in private and public debt. The abrogation was retroactive.
     ·   October 23, 1933. This is when President Roosevelt announced that his administration
         was implementing a "gold buying" program, an initiative that was based on the ideas of
         Cornell professor George F. Warren.
     ·   January 31, 1934. This is when the dollar was officially devalued with respect to gold.
         The price went from $20.67 to $35 per ounce.
     ·   January 8-10, 1935: During these days the Supreme Court heard the "gold cases." As
         discussed above, the administration lawyers did poorly, and many observers believed that
         the Court would rule against the government.
     ·   February 18, 1935: The Supreme Court ruled that the abrogation of the gold clause for
         private contracts was constitutional. It also ruled that holders of Liberty Bonds (public
         debt with the gold clause) were not harmed by the Joint Resolution and that, thus, they
         did not have to be compensated for losses.


15
   Other scholars who have emphasized the role of the devaluation include Eichengreen and Sachs (1986),
Eichengreen (1992), Bernanke (2000), Bernanke and James (1991), Temin (1991), Mundell (2000), and Irwin (2012).
It is not possible to do justice to the copious literature on the Great Depression; see, however, Bordo, Choudhri
and Scwhartz (2002), Bordo and Kydland (1995), Meltzer (2003), De Long (1990), Wigmore (1987), and Calomiris
and Wheelock (1998). Friedman and Schwartz (1963) continues to be the basic study on monetary policy during
this period. Edwards (2017a) discusses the economic thinking on exchange rates at the time of these policies.

       3. Change of monetary regime, contracts, and commodity prices

In this Section I use daily data from January 2, 1932, through December 31, 1935 to analyze the
effect of the change in monetary regime on commodity prices. The empirical strategy is as
follows: I estimate a number of error correction models for the log differences of prices, where I
include six dummy variables for the dates presented above. As noted, the question is to what
extent prices of corn, cotton, rye, and wheat reacted to the most important announcements and
actual policy implementation. The basic results are subject to a battery of robustness tests, related
to specification, covariates included, and time period considered in the estimation.

       3.1 Data and preliminary analysis

In Figure 1 I present daily prices for corn, cotton, rye, and wheat for January 2, 1932, through
December 31, 1935. 16 The successive vertical lines capture the key dates defined above:
04/19/1933; 06/05/1933; 10/23/1933; 01/31/1934; 01/8-10/1935; and 02/18/1935. As may be
seen, throughout this period these four commodities experienced important price increases.
Cotton, for example, the commodity FDR was most concerned about, doubled in price between
early 1932 and December 1935, from about 6 cents a pound to 12 cents a pound. Price
movements, however, were not smooth; day to day changes were quite volatile. There were
periods of clear upswings, and periods of price declines.

President Roosevelt, of course, was up to date on the evolution of these (and other) commodity
prices. Henry Morgenthau Jr., who at the time was the Governor of the Federal Farm Board, and
who would become Secretary of the Treasury, showed the President weekly charts with
agricultural prices, exchange rates, financial variables, and the stocks of monetary gold from
around the world. In early April FDR had concluded that a "managed currency," a system
advocated by economists such as Irving Fisher and George F. Warren, was necessary to generate
a permanent increase in commodity prices. The first step in a "managed currency" regime was an
official devaluation of the dollar. 17

       3.2 Regression results

In this Section I present the results from a series of "event study" regressions for four commodity
prices. As noted, my interest is to investigate four related issues: (a) Did policies announcements
affect prices, even before the actual devaluation of the dollar was implemented? (b) Did the
abrogation of the gold clause have an impact on prices? (c) Did the official devaluation affect

     Fisher (1913, 1920), Warren and Pearson (1930, 1931). See also Tavlas (1997) and Edwards (2017c).
                                                      8


prices? And, (d) did the legal proceedings in front of the Supreme Court regarding the sanctity of
contracts have an effect on prices? These questions are related to Sargent's (1982) "change in
regime," analysis of inflation. 18 In Sargent's model, economic agents respond to changes in
expectations, and alter their habits and decisions in anticipation to what they believe will happen.

        3.2.1   The empirical model

In order to investigate the short term dynamics of prices during 1932-1935, I estimated number
of error correction models of the following form:



(1)       log  = 0 + 1 log -1 + 2  log -1 +    +    +  .



In each regression,  is the variable of interest: the price of corn, cotton, rye and wheat. The
variables DUMMY are "event" dummies that take the value of one if during that day (or during
the event window) a policy related to the change of regime was either announced or put in place.
In the base regressions, dummies for the 6 events listed above were included. The  are other
covariates, including changes in bilateral exchange rates, changes in interest rates, and changes
in government bonds' prices. See the discussion below for a robustness analysis.

        3.2.2   Results

The base results are presented in Tables 2 through 5. Four specifications are provided for each
commodity; White heteroscedasticity-consistent t-statistics are reported for each equation. 19 In
the first equation in each Table, only the six events dummies are included as regressors (in
addition to the lagged dependent variables). In equation (2), log changes in the bilateral exchange
rates of the dollar with respect to the pound and the French franc are added. This specification
allows us to understand whether the change of regime announcements and policies worked their
way into prices through channels other than exchange rates. Equation (3) also includes the
change in the Federal Reserve Banks' discount rate. Finally, in the last specification (4), the log
differential of the price of Liberty Bonds is also included.

Overall, the results are very good and informative. This is particularly the case, considering that
these are daily data in log differences. Of course, the results are different for the different
commodities; some are affected more than others by specific events and/or covariates. However,

18
   Temin and Wigmore (1990) proposed the "change of regime" hypothesis for explaining the recovery from the
Great Depression.
19
   Breusch-Pagan tests indicate that the null of no heteroscedasticity is rejected at conventional levels.
                                                9


there is a common thread throughout the regressions reported in the Tables 2-5. In general, the
results suggest that announcements of change of monetary regime mattered, and impacted
commodity prices significantly. Also, the change in the nature of contracts was extremely
important. In particular, the legal proceedings surrounding the abrogation of the gold clause in
debt contracts had significant effects on commodity prices. At a more specific level, the
following insights emerge from Tables 2 through 5:

   ·   The (mere) announcement, on April 19, that the U.S. was abandoning the gold standard,
       had a positive and significant impact on the price of corn and cotton. The order of
       magnitude of the effect was large, between 3% and 4% in one day. There is no evidence
       that the April 19 announcement affected the price of rye or wheat.

   ·   The Joint Resolution passed by Congress on June 5, 1933, retroactively annulling the
       gold clause from debt contracts, does not appear to have affected commodity prices in a
       significant way. The coefficients for the dummy are not significant (or only at the 10%
       level). In some ways, this is surprising, since the abrogation of the gold clause was a
       fundamental step in the process towards eventually devaluing the dollar and trying to
       bring deflation to an end. There are a number of possible reasons for this result, which I
       address in greater detail below.

   ·   The announcement that a "gold buying" program was being launched, on October 24,
       1933, had a significant and positive impact on the prices of the four commodities
       considered in this paper. The point estimates of the corresponding event dummy are
       between 0.9% for cotton and 5.7% for wheat, and are all significant at conventional
       levels. The implementation of this program ­ which, as noted, was the brainchild of
       economist George F. Warren ­, signaled to the public that new measures related to the
       exchange rate were about to be implemented. As pointed out above, this program was
       based on the notion that if the price of gold went up, commodity prices would follow
       swiftly.

   ·   The official devaluation of the dollar on January 31, 1934, appears to have impacted only
       one commodity price: cotton. The event dummy is insignificant in the regressions for the
       other 3 commodities. A logical interpretation for this result is that this was not an
       unexpected event; in fact, it was fully anticipated by the public. After January 15, when
       the Gold Act, was passed by Congress, there was certainty that the dollar would be
       officially devalued in the next few days. The only question was by how much the official
       price of gold was going to be raised.

       ·   The results in Tables 2 through 5 categorically indicate that the legal status of contracts
           was extremely important during this period. Changes (or the perception of changes) in
           contracts had a significant impact on the prices of the four commodities studied in this
           paper. As may be seen, the event dummy for the hearings in front of the Supreme Court
           are always negative and significant. This is a reflection of how poorly the government
           lawyers did during the hearings. Indeed, on January 10, 1935, a reporter for the Chicago
           Daily Tribune affirmed that "at least four of the Justices... indicated impatience with the
           New Deal theory that Congress... can wipe out the gold clause in $100 billion of
           contracts." (For details, see Edwards, 2018). A number of observers had pointed out after
           the hearings that if the Court rejected the Roosevelt administration arguments, there
           would be a need to roll the devaluation back, and reinstate the old price of gold, of $20.67
           per ounce. This would have a highly negative effect on prices. The regression estimates
           in Tables 2 through 5, also show that the actual rulings by the Supreme Court on
           February 18, 1935, resulted in a positive change in the four commodity prices. By
           supporting the government policy and the Joint Resolution, the Supreme Court,
           confirmed that the devaluation of the dollar implemented in January 1934, would stand.

       ·   Finally, the results indicate that the other covariates affected commodity prices in
           different ways. In particular, there is evidence that changes in the bilateral exchange rates
           affected the prices of cotton and wheat. At the same time, there is no evidence that either
           the alteration of the Discount Rate by the Federal Reserve, or government debt prices
           impacted on commodity prices in a significant fashion. As may be seen, the coefficients
           for the event dummies are not altered significantly. This indicates that the "change of
           regime" effect operated in addition to any influence it could have had on market
           exchange rates or on interest rates.



As reported in Figure 1, during 1933, commodity prices peaked on July 17. Their retreat after
that date has been interpreted as evidence that the increase from March through mid-July was
solely the result of significant speculative forces. Often the words "speculators" and
"speculation" have a negative connotation. In this case, however, they should be interpreted as a
situation where economic agents who believed that a "change in regime" was about to take place,
tried to take advantage of that fact. 20

       3.2.3 The Joint Resolution of June 5, 1933

One of the most interesting results presented above refers to the coefficient for the June 5 Joint
Resolution that abrogated the gold clause. As noted, in the sixteen regressions reported, these
coefficients were not significant, and in a number of cases had a negative sign. The most
plausible explanation is that Resolution was fully expected, and that it was already internalized
by the time the resolution was signed into law. The Democratic Party had an overwhelming
majority in both chambers, and the parliamentary debate indicated, without any doubts, that the
Resolution would be passed.

In this section I investigate whether the announcement that Congress would consider the
abrogation of a key clause contracts impacted on commodity prices. This happened on May 26,
when the Secretary of the Treasury indicated that the White House would ask Congress to alter
the nature of debt contracts in the United States. The House passed the Resolution on May 29,
and the Senate on June 3. It became effective on June 5. In Figure 2 I present changes in the four
commodity prices between May 1 and June 10 1933. The vertical lines are drawn on May 27,
one day after the announcement that Congress would address the gold clauses, and on June 5, the
day the abrogation became official.

In order to address this issue formally I added an event dummy for May 27 to the error correction
regressions. The results obtained, when the basic specification was used, are presented in Table
6. (The results for other specifications are very similar, and are available on request). As may be
seen, the event dummies for May 27 are always significant and positive, indicating that the
announcement that the nature of contracts would be changed as a further step towards
devaluation, resulted in price increases. The point estimates of the May 27 dummy range from
0.4% to 1.2%.

These results, then, indicate that, as expected, the changing nature of contracts did impact
commodity prices in an important way. This is reflected by the fact that the three event dummies
that are related to the gold clause ­ the announcement of its abrogation, the hearings in front of
the Supreme Court, and the Courts rulings ­ are significant, have the expected signs, and have
rather high point estimates.

       3.2.4   Robustness and extensions

The results presented in Tables 2-6 were subject to a number of robustness tests. Some of the
most important ones include: (a) The estimation period was reduced, to start in June 1932, just
before the Democratic party convention, and to end on June 30, 1935. (b) Two and three days
"event windows" were introduced. (c) I defined a merged "event" variable for all announcements
related to the change in regime. And (d) I used a dummy variable for the months when the FED
                                                          12


undertook open market operations, instead of the change in the Fed's Discount Rate variable. 21
In each of these cases the main conclusions reported above were maintained; results available on
request.

I also estimated a number of alternative specifications. Among other things, I introduced
additional covariates, as a way of making sure that the results reported above are not due to some
omitted variables. In particular, the following covariates were added: (a) A dummy variable that
takes the value of one when key New Deal legislation was passed by Congress (e.g. AAA, NRA,
Glass-Steagall); and (b) a dummy variable that takes into account key political events, such as
the presidential election, the February 15 assassination attempt on FDR, the Inauguration of the
new administration, and the London Monetary and Economic Conference of June-July 1933. The
results obtained when these additional covariates were included (available on request) confirmed
the results reported above. Moreover, there is no evidence that, once controlling for other factors
(including gold-related policies) either political or New Deal events affected commodity prices.
In only one of the regressions is the coefficient for the political events marginally significant.

       4. Concluding remarks

The abandonment of the gold standard in 1933, and the official devaluation of the dollar in
January 1934, are considered by most historians as defining moments in U.S. economic history.
These two policies generated massive capital inflows that were not sterilized by the Federal
Reserve. The concomitant increase in the monetary base and overall money supply helped the
country recover from the Great Depression. What is less known about this episode is that in
order to implement the devaluation it was first necessary to annul the gold clause in debt
contracts. This was done by Congress on June 5, 1933 through a Joint Resolution. This measure
was seen by many as an outright violation of property rights. To the surprise of many, the Joint
Resolution was supported by the Supreme Court through three rulings on February 18, 1935. The
rulings were supported by 5-4 votes, with the swing vote being provided by the Chief Justice
Charles Evans Hughes.

In this paper I presented a detailed an analysis of the process leading to the new monetary
regime, officially inaugurated on January 31, 1934, with the final passage of the Gold Act and
the devaluation of the dollar. The results from the estimation of a number of error correction
regressions using daily data for commodity prices show that FDR's announcements were
credible, and elicited price jumps even before the actual price of gold was increased officially. At
the same time the results show that the public was deeply concerned about the legal aspects
surrounding the change of regime. More specifically, the results reported here show that the

announcement, on May 26,1933, that the gold clause would be annulled resulted in a significant
positive jumped in prices. Similarly, the perception that the government lawyers had done poorly
in front of the Supreme Court generated a large and significant decline in commodity prices
during the second week of January. This was a response to the belief that if the Supreme Court
ruled against the government, the devaluation of the dollar would have to be rolled back.

In their seminal book on the monetary history of the United States, Milton Friedman and Anna
Schwartz argue that abandoning the gold standard and devaluing the dollar had an important
positive effect for the US economy. According to them, these policies "stimulated capital flow to
the United States." They then add that "the rapid monetary expansion owed nothing to monetary
actions other than the rise in the price of gold." Friedman and Schwartz 1963, p. 699).

 However, Friedman and Schwartz argued that abandoning of the gold standard also had a
negative side; more specifically, the abrogation of the gold clause was "discourage[ed] business
investment." 22 Analyzing in detail whether that was the case is beyond the scope of this paper. It
is an important topic for future research. What the research reported in this paper has done is
confirm the notion advanced by Sergeant (1882), in the sense that a credible announcement of a
change of regime has an immediate impact on important macroeconomic variables, even before
the actual structural reforms that institute the new regime are put in place. The key word in the
previous statement is, of course, "credible." As the history of a number of emerging markets,
many of them in Latin America, has shown time and again, non-credible announcements tend to
have a negative effect, by triggering capital outflows and/or speculation.

                                             A.- 1933

March 4              Franklin D. Roosevelt is inaugurated as President.

March 6:             Bank Holiday and gold embargo are declared through Presidential Proclamation
                     No. 2039.

March 13:            Most banks reopen; gold embargo is maintained.

April 5:             Executive Order No. 6102: All gold holdings have to be sold to Federal Reserve.

April 17:            Thomas Amendment is introduced to Senate. Gives the President authority to
                     undertake three specific policies to end deflation: reduce the gold content of the
                     dollar by up to 50%; issue up to $3 billion in greenbacks; remonetize silver at a
                     ratio of 16 to 1 with respect to gold.

April 19:            President Roosevelt gives 13th press conference of his Administration. Towards
                     the end he announces that the U.S. if definitely off gold. Metal exports are
                     forbidden.

April 20:            Executive Order No. 6111: All exports of gold are suspended indefinitely. The
                     U.S. is effectively off the gold standard.

April 24:            Secretary Woodin announced that half a billion notes in 2.875% Treasury notes
                     would be issued, with the gold clause. This suggests to many that the gold
                     embargo will be lifted soon.

April 29:            Thomas Amendment passed by Senate 55-35. Several democrats, including
                     Senator Glass vote against it.

May 12:              Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) is signed into law. It includes the Thomas
                     Amendment. Newspapers refer to it as "Relief-Inflation legislation." Federal
                     Farm Emergency Relief Act is passed.

May 16:              President Roosevelt sends message to international governments stating that the
                     goal of the London Conference ought to be to stabilize exchange rates.

May 23:              New York State Supreme Court Justice Phoenix Ingraham rules that payments on
                     gold clause debts may be made (and received) in paper dollars.

May 26:              The Government announced that there is a need to have a uniform legal standing
                     with respect to the gold clause. The Administration asks Congress to officially
                     void, through a Joint Resolution, the gold clause both for past and future
                     contracts.
                                                    19


May 29:                  The House approves Resolution abrogating gold clauses.

June 5:                  Joint Resolution of Congress abrogating gold clauses is passed is signed into law.

July 21:                 The House of Commons approved overwhelmingly (131 to 22) a provision that
                         cancelled payment in gold on the World War I debts. This suggests that the dollar
                         will strengthen relative to sterling.

July 27:                 The London World Economic Conference comes to an official end without
                         achieving any of the objectives discussed by world leaders during their early
                         discussions.

August 29:               Executive Order No. 6261 authorizes the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to
                         buy newly minted gold at "the best price obtainable in the free market of the
                         world." This is Phase One of the `gold buying" program.

October 24:              Second phase of gold buying program begins. Prices set by the Secretary of the
                         Treasury and the President, and may deviate from world prices. In addition to
                         buying newly minted gold in the U.S. the RFC will buy and sell gold in the world
                         markets, if needed.

                                                 B.- 1934

January 30               The Gold Act of 1934 is signed into law.

January 31               A new official price of gold of $35 an ounce is established.

July 3                   A District Court in New York rules that the abrogation is constitutional. The
                         lawyer for the plaintiff declared that he will appeal to the Supreme Court.

November 18              The solicitor General asks the Supreme Court to hear for gold cases on January 8,
                         1935.

                                                 C.- 1935

January 8 ­ 10           For gold cases are argued in front of the Supreme Court. According to the press
                         the government legal team did poorly.

January 14-February 17           Markets are nervous, as it becomes clear that the Supreme Court may
                         rule against the government.

February 18              The Supreme Court finally delivers its rulings. All of them support the
                         government by a vote of 5 to 4.
