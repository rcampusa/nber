         Exchange Rate Determination with Systematic
           and Unsystematic Policy Regime Changes:
              Evidence From the Yen/Dollar Rate

                             ABSTRACT

    This paper presents results of estimating an exchange rate equation

in light of theoretical considerations regarding changes in sterilization

and intervention policy and tax policy which imply that the coefficients in

the equation will not behave as fixed parameters in a given sample period,

as standard econometric practice assumes. We compare the results of

ordinary least squares and a random coefficients model of the Japanese

Yen—U.S. dollar exchange rate during the floating period of July 1973

through June 1982.

     When systematic end of year policy changes affecting Japanese reserves

are explicitly modeled, both OLS and the random coefficients model show

increased explanatory power. The random coefficients model appears to be

superior to OLS however; by allowing the coefficients to vary over time as

required by the economic theory discussed above, estimates of the mean

response coefficients for the floating period all have the hypothesized

sign, and explanatory power is sharply increased.

1.   Introduction


     This paper reports significantly improved results from estimation

during the 'floating' [July 1973 through June 1982] period of a monetary

equilibrium rational expectations (MERE) expression for the yen/dollar

exchange rate. There are two sources of the improvement over results

reported elsewhere in Makin (1981, 1982) and over results with exchange

rate equations in general which1 as Meese and Rogoff (1983) have

demonstrated, have been somewhat disheartening.

     The first and most important source of improvement arises from

allowance for intervention policy and tax policy regime changes. More

recently, Branson (1983) has paid attention to the former while Makin

(1984) addresses the latter. A rational expression for the exchange rate

which incorporates intervention and sterilization together with after—tax

uncovered interest parity, conditions the impact upon the exchange rate of

actual and expected changes in explanatory variables upon the degree of

intervention and sterilization and on relevant effective marginal tax

rates, each of which may vary considerably over time. Obviously this

violates the assumption that an exchange rate equation with fixed

coefficients can be estimated over a sample period during which there have

been changes in the degree of intervention and sterilization, in effective

marginal tax rates or both. One way to deal with the complex nonlinear

response of coefficients to continuous and often simultaneous changes over

time in intervention/sterilization policy and effective marginal tax rates

is to hypothesize that coefficients so impacted behave as random variables

with a stable mean and finite variance. Such an approach is employed in

this paper.




                                      1
    The random coefficients assumption will of course be violated if, in

addition to a random pattern, there exists some systematic pattern to the

policy regime and its impact on coefficients. It is necessary to control

for any systematic element of policy regime behavior. In the case of Japan

there emerges a large and systematic 'end of year' pattern whereby reserves

are allowed to increase sharply in December and to fall by a nearly equal

amount in January——almost as if Japan moves onto a quasi—fixed exchange

rate regime during these months. Employing dummy variables to control for

this systematic part of Japanese intervention policy not only improves the

fit of our exchange rate equation but, by eliminating significant
'outliers' which violate the random coefficients model assumptions yields

results that are fully consistent with the MERE model. In short, the

second source of our improved results, controlling for systematic Japanese

intervention behavior at year end, is sufficient to preclude rejection of

the hypothesis that nonsystematic intervention/sterilization and tax policy

regime changes in both the United States and Japan require that a random

coefficients model be employed to test hypotheses embedded in rational

models of exchange rate determination.

     Before proceeding to specifics, it is worthwhile to place this

investigation within the context of two non—contradictory but different

approaches to improving the fit of exchange rate equations that have

emerged over the past decade from extensive and often innovative empirical

investigations of exchange rate behavior.1 One approach, whereby assets

denominated in different currencies are viewed as imperfect substitutes,

points to inclusion in exchange rate equations of 'left out variables'

needed to account for a systematic difference between the forward rate and

 the expected spot rate. The imperfect substitutes hypothesis suggests



                                         2
significant deviations from uncovered interest parity which are consistent

with either foreign exchange market inefficiency (generally rejected as a

prior hypothesis) or time varying risk premiums. In turn, since the

existence of time varying risk premiums is consistent with imperfect

substitutability between assets denominated in different currencies, it

thereby——given risk aversion——implies a significant effect of sterilized

intervention on exchange rates.2

    The second approach, followed here, attributes less significance to

deviations from uncovered interest parity as a source of poor exchange rate

equation fits and attributes more significance to policy regime changes.

The operational result of the second approach is to try and improve the fit

of exchange rate equations by allowing for both systematic and random

effects of policy regime changes. It is worth noting that empirical tests

under both approaches may be biased by failing to specify uncovered

interest parity in after—tax terms.3 We avoid such bias by employing an

after—tax expression for uncovered interest parity. Once estimated, our

random coefficients model which includes as explanatory variables only

measures of relative excess money supplies in Japan and the United States

performs quite well and displays no gross symptoms of left out variables.

    The remainder of the paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 briefly

lays out an intervention/sterilization and tax policy regime augmented

version of the MERE model, first developed for a simple floating regime by

Bilson (1979) and later extended, first to an intervention/sterilization

regime model by Makin (1981) and then extended to include tax regimes by

Makin (1984).   Section 3 describes briefly the random coefficients

procedure employed to estimate the model. Section 4 presents results of

estimating the model for the yen—dollar exchange rate with monthly data




                                      3
running from July, 1983 through June, 1982.          Some concluding comments are

presented in Section 5.


2.     Exchange Rate lodel


       Here a rational expression for the equilibrium exchange rate is

derived from a simple structure including money demand equations in two

countries, purchasing power parity (which can be expanded to allow for

'real' exchange rate changes) and an after—tax covered interest parity

equation. We also allow for official exchange market intervention and

the presence or absence of sterilization of effects of intervention on the

monetary base.

       The solution to the two country model after some algebra and

iterative substitution is a parametized expression for the exchange rate in

terms of:    relative (exogenous portions of) money supplies, relative real

output, and 'real' exchange rate changes. Parameters which determine the

exchange rate in terms of current actual and expected future values of

these variables include the income and interest elasticities of money

demand in each country, tax rates on interest income, and foreign exchange

gains and losses in each country and——of particular significance for the

investigation proposed here——the degree of sterilization and intervention

in each country.

       A basic solution employing the procedure just outlined, following

Makin (1981, 1983) is obtained as follows. Based on log linear money

demand equations in countries '1' and '2,' purchasing power parity and

deviations therefrom ('real' exchange rate changes) an expression for the

log of the spot exchange rate may be written as


                    =        — aZt + dat +

                       =   log    of exogenous (not tied to sterilization) portion of
                            of monetary base in country 1 less log of exogenous
                            portion of monetary base in country 2.

                       =   log    of real income in country 1 less log of real income

        An expression for the difference between nominal interest rates can be

derived from after tax covered interest parity:4

                ii


where

        ln(1+i)        i for small i

            =   log   of the forward rate at time t.

            =   log   of the spot rate at time t.

                                                    5
and

        =   marginal   tax rate on interest income in country 1.

        = marginal tax rate on exchange gains in country 1.


Equation (2) says simply that if the tax on exchange gains r is less than

the tax on interest income then the interest differential between countries

1 and 2 will exceed the exchange gain or loss. Obviously j = c, the

considerations wash out and before and after—tax covered interest parity

conditions are identical.

      In most cases, the tax on exchange gains is below the income tax rate.

See Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co. (1979) for a full discussion. For U.S.

corporations k = 0.30 for positions held more than 12 months while =
0.48 so that = 1.35.        In practice actual marginal income tax rates for

corporations as well as households may be lower and may vary considerably

over time. (See Tanzi (1982) and Estrella and Fubrer (1983)).

      Traditionally, deviations from covered interest parity expressed by

equation (2) have been attributed to political risk and/or portfolio

balance considerations.5 Some current studies such as Ito (1983) have

found results for Japan—U.S. which are generally consistent with = 1.0

during the 1975—80 period and consistent with         < 1.0 thereafter. 3 < 1.0

 is consistent with       > r, contrary to expectations based on the U.S. tax

 code. In contrast, Katz (1983) reports results for the United States and

 seven industrial countries which suggest        > 1.0 over the short run which

 is another odd result, since usually short run exchange gains are taxed at

 the same rate as interest income. Katz's results may be due partly to

 measurement error since he in effect uses expected inflation differentials

 to measure expected depreciation——thereby hypothesizing satisfaction of
 purchasing power parity——and then estimates what amounts to an uncovered


                                           6
interest parity equation. In sum, while empirical evidence on              is

inconclusive at this stage, some allowance for possible changes over time

is prudent.

        If assets denominated in currencies 1 and 2 are perfect substitutes,

no risk premium separates the log of the forward rate,         from the log of

the expected spot rate——at time t for time t+1, se+1. Therefore:


               —   0
               — t5 t÷i•


Substituting from (3) into (2) gives:


(4)         i1 —   1 = t°t+i —
      Substituting                              —
                       from (4) into (1) for        i2   and rearranging terms

gives:


               =                  +
                           se+1

Substituting   iteratively to solve for t0t+i equation (5) becomes:


(6)




where




        Equation (6) describes the spot exchange rate as being determined——in

a manner set by money demand parameters1 sterilization and intervention



                                         7
policy and tax rates——by current actual and expected future values of the

set of exogenous variables, de, , and z defined above.

     A primary conclusion from the discussion of exchange rate
determination summarized in equation (6) is the implied effect on the

exchange rate of current and prospective policies regarding intervention,

sterilization and tax rates applied to interest earnings and to foreign

exchange gains and losses. Announcement of expected future changes in such

policies will change the current equilibrium spot rate in the forward—

looking foreign exchange market even if current and prospective values of

exogenous variables remain unchanged.

     Since 0 takes on a larger negative value as intervention is stepped up

to smooth exchange rates, the result of more aggressive intervention is to

reduce exchange rate changes in response to given changes in actual or

expected values of relative excess money supplies or other disturbances.

Considerable variation over a given sample period in the degree of exchange

market intervention will result in a poor fit of a fixed—coefficient

equation over that sample period. The same will hold true for changes in

effective marginal tax rates over a sample period. A possible remedy is to

control for any systematic changes in intervention policy or tax rates and

to attempt to capture unsystematic changes with a random coefficients

model.


3.   Methodology


     Given that our focus is on incorporating the effects of systematic and

unsystematic policy changes on the coefficients in an exchange rate

equation, we adopt a simple version of (6), abstracting from variations in

a risk premium, specification of disturbances causing systematic deviations

from purchasing power parity, and representations of expected future

                                        8
exogenous variables. With these qualifications, we proceed to examine the

following equation (all variables in log first differences):


                                        +              +

      Equation (7) implies a number of maintained hypotheses, including:

(a) stable money demand functions; (b)                after—tax covered interest parity

with stable effective marginal tax rates; (c) stable intervention and

sterilization policies in both countries; (d) current growth rates of

explanatory variables as proxies for both current and expected future

growth rates; and (e)          the 'real' yen/dollar rate follows a random walk.

Violations of (a), (b) [stable effective marginal tax rates] and (c) can be

entertained under the random coefficients approach employed below to

estimate (7). Simple extrapolitive models (AR—i, with seasonal terms for

Japanese reserves) adequately model growth rates for explanatory variables,

so current growth rates capture both current actual and expected future

growth rates. Examination of the real yen/dollar rate behavior during the

July, 1973 — June, 1982 sample period reveals that residuals from its log



                                                  9
first differences are 'white noise' Q(24) = 23.4 which is consistent with

(0).

       Remaining questions regarding maintained hypotheses center on the

assumption of perfect substitutability between yen and dollar assets

(satisfaction of covered after tax interest parity.) Evidence on perfect

substitutability is mixed with Henderson et al. (1984) reporting that

perfect substitutability between yen and dollar assets cannot be rejected

under rational expectations while Hansen and flodrick (1983) are unable to

reject the hypothesis of a time—varying risk premium for the yen—dollar

rate.

        In effect, our estimates of exchange rate equations reported below

allow for time—varying parameters while imposing after—tax covered interest

parity and employing only the simplest measures of explanatory variables.6

        Inmost econometric applications, the coefficients are estimated as

constants throughout the time period being analyzed. This approach is

likely to be inappropriate when applied to an equation such as (7), where

the coefficients are subject to the several sources of variation just

discussed. Hildreth and Houck (1968) have outlined a procedure whereby

consistent estimators can be obtained for a model which allows the

coefficients to vary over time. The estimated coefficients are interpreted

as the 'mean response' coefficients. The statistical model is summarized

by:

                                      t=s
thus



(9)         E(at1) =   a1.

       Consistent estimators for a1 can be obtained with a generalized least

squares procedure using an estimated covariance matrix for e:


(10)        0 = (M'MY1 M'u


where M is a matrix containing the squared elements of (I—X(X'XY1X') and U

contains   the squared residuals from an ordinary least squares regression on

(7). The GLS vector containing the estimated mean response coefficients is

obtained from7


(11)        a =   (X'01XY1X'01Y.

4.     Estiaation Results


       The OLS and random coefficients results from regressions on equation

(7) appear in Table 1.             The OLS equation yields virtually no explanatory

power as R2 = .01.       Applying the random coefficients procedure outlined

above provides no dramatic improvement——indeed the signs of the U.S.

variables are the reverse of those implied by theory.

       However, a close look at the data reveals that (7) is not an entirely

correct specification of the exchange rate equation. Japanese reserves

systematically rise sharply in December, and fall by roughly the same

magnitude the following January. The magnitude of these end of year

reserve changes averages roughly five times that of the monthly changes

throughout the remainder of the year.

       Systematic policy changes of this nature can be handled using OLS and

dummy variables for the months in which this occurs. We thus redefine (7)

as


                 =        +           + a2JPt + a3USRt + U4USPt + a5JRDt + a63RJt
(12)                 a0       aiJRt

                                                  12
where JRD takes the value of JRt if the month is December and is zero

otherwise. JRJ is similarly defined.

    Failure to account for this policy shift is likely to bias the

estimate of a1 downward in a regression on (7), as the dramatic increase

(decrease) in Japanese reserves in December (January) is likely to be

heavily discounted in foreign exchange markets. We thus expect to see an

increase in the estimated coefficient for a1, and hypothesize that the

signs of a5 and a6 are negative in (12).

    The econometric results from estimation of (12) are presented in Table

2. The OLS equation shows some improvement over its counterpart, although

again, only the estimated coefficient on Japanese reserves changes exceeds

its standard error. In addition, the signs of the estimated coefficients

for Japanese Production and U.S. Reserves are the opposite of what the

theory predicts.

     However, as hypothesized, incorporating systematic policy changes

through the inclusion of the December and January Reserve dwmnies results

in an increase in the estimated coefficient for Japanese Reserves, with

negative coefficients estimated for the dummy variables.

     The application of the random coefficients model yields improvement in

each and every statistical category. All estimated coefficients are of the

hypothesized sign, and the standard error of each coefficient is reduced

relative to its counterpart in Table 1. (The standard error of the mean

response coefficient for Japanese Reserve changes is reduced relative to

the estimated coefficient by a factor of four). R—squared rises to .4039

and the Durbin—Watson statistic also improves to 1.8606.

    In both versions, the effect of the dummies is to reduce sharply the

impact of Japanese Reserve Changes in December and January. The degree to

which such reserve changes are reduced in the random coefficients version

is roughly the same in both months, leaving a small, positive effect of

Japanese Reserve Changes on the exchange rate during these months.




                                           14
        Overall, our results are consistent 'with the hypothesis that regime

changes and/or instability of money demand equations account for a

significant portion of the poor fit of yen/dollar equations during the

'floating' period.8


5.      Svary

        This   paper presents results of estimating an exchange rate equation in

light of theoretical considerations regarding changes in sterilization and

intervention policy and tax policy which imply that the coefficients in the

equation will not behave as fixed parameters in a given sample period, as

standard econometric practice assumes. We compare the results of ordinary

least squares and a random coefficients model of the Japanese yen—U.S.

dollar exchange rate during the 'floating' period of July 1973 through June

1982.

        When systematic end of year policy changes affecting Japanese reserves

are explicitly modeled, both OLS and the random coefficients model show

increased explanatory power. The random coefficients model appears to be

superior to OLS however, by allowing the coefficients to vary over time as

required by the economic theory discussed above, estimates of the mean

response coefficients for the floating period all have the hypothesized

sign, and explanatory power is sharply increased. These improved results

strongly suggest that a random coefficients model is a useful technique for

modeling exchange rate determination during quasi floating regimes where

responses of exchange rates to changes in relative excess money supplies

are likely to vary over time.

4. If country 2 has an asymmetric tax treatment of exchange gains and

     interest income then equation (1) may hold without satisfying covered

     interest parity for country 2. This case is examined for Canada and

     the United States by Levi (1977).        Such asymmetry raises the

     possibility of simultaneous two way capital flows and also raises an

     interesting question of how long run equilibrium is achieved. For now

     we assume that countries 1 and 2 have symmetric tax systems so that

     equation (1) describes covered interest parity for both or, alterna-

     tively that country 1 is so large relative to country 2 that it

     dominates markets sufficiently to preclude significant deviations from

     equation (1).

7.   Equation (11) bypasses the question of the estimated variances of the

     random coefficients. This is necessary due to the inclusion of dummy

     variables in the model, which causes the matrix required for

     estimation of the variance of the coefficients to be singular. This

     precludes the possibility of providing estimates of the     and hence

     a time path of the random coefficients.

                   11014K! SUPPLY: STRRTLT7ATION AND INTVENTI0N




        Money supply is represented by a log linear money 'production
function' which determines money supply in terms of domestic and foreign

assets of the central bank. For country 1, let:


(A.i)               M1s =      i   1       2



where:             = money supply.

                       domestic assets of central bank in country '1.'
            D1

            X1 = foreign           exchange reserves of central bank in country '1.'

                   =   elasticity      of money supply with respect to D1.

                   =   elasticity      of money supply with respect to X1.


In logs (A.1) becomes:


                       m1 = j1d1       +
(A.2)                                      j2x1.

        Sterilization links d negatively to reserves


(A.3)                  d1       de1 — (i—st1)      x
where:                  log of autonomous portion of domestic assets of central
             de1
                            bank in country 1.

             st1 =      sterilization          coefficient in country 1 1st1 0 implies
                            full sterilization; st1 = 1.0 implies
                            zero sterilization and d1 = de 1


        Intervention links reserves to the exchange rate where:



                                                    18
(A.4)          x = —ys.

   measures the elasticity of official reserves with respect to the

exchange rate, s. The faster currency 1 depreciates (a rise in s) the

faster country 1 reserves are lost (and the faster 'foreign' reserves

rise). If analogous expressions apply for country 2, then      the relative

money supply term for countries 1 and 2, can be written as:


(A.5)          t =       +


where:
                              —    *
                    = j1dej       i1 de2

               O(O)     [—y1(j2—j1(1—st1)) —    T(ii(1St))]
If intervention dominates sterilization so that currency depreciation

lowers x and raises x2 then 0 is unambiguously negative. If sterilization

eradicates intervention's affect on the monetary base 0 = 0.   In this case

   =     and there is no need to take account of either intervention or

sterilization in modeling the money supply. The important thing about

(A5) from the standpoint of estimation is the fact that it links to '0',

the value of all reduced—forms describing the impact upon the exchange rate

of exogenous variables. And '0' in turn depends upon intervention and

sterilization policy parameters y and st (i1,2) which are likely to

change over time.
