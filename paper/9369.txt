Debt Relief: What Do the Markets Think?
Serkan Arslanalp and Peter Blair Henry
NBER Working Paper No. 9369
December 2002


                                            ABSTRACT

       The stock market appreciates by an average of 60 percent in real dollar terms when countries

announce debt relief agreements under the Brady Plan. In contrast, there is no significant increase

in market value for a control group of countries that do not sign agreements. The results persist after

controlling for IMF agreements, trade liberalizations, capital account liberalizations, and

privatization programs. The stock market revaluations forecast higher future net resource transfers

and GDP growth. While markets respond favorably to debt relief in the Brady countries, there is no

evidence to suggest that current debt relief efforts for the Highly-Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs)

will achieve similar results.

I. Introduction

          Bono and Jesse Helms want debt relief for highly indebted poor countries

(HIPCs). The Pope and 17 million people are behind them. On June 17, 1999, the lead

singer of U2 presented 17 million signatures in support of the Jubilee 2000 Debt Relief

Initiative to Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder at a meeting of G8 leaders in Cologne,

Germany. In a Papal Bull on November 29, 1998, Pope John Paul II called on wealthy

nations to relieve the debts of developing nations in order to “remove the shadow of

death.”

          Opponents of debt relief occupy less hallowed ground but are no less zealous

about their cause, citing at least three reasons why the debt relief campaign is misguided.

First, debt relief alone cannot solve the problem of third world debt. Even if all debt

were forgiven, it will accumulate again if income does not grow faster than expenditure

(O’Neill, 2002). Second, debt relief can create perverse incentives for debtor countries—

by relaxing budget constraints, debt relief may induce governments into prolonging bad

economic policies (Easterly, 2001a). Third, rewriting debt contracts may hurt a debtor’s

reputation and hinder its ability to obtain future loans (Easterly, 2001b).

          Moral proponents of debt relief can point to three counterarguments in their

defense. First, some debts are illegitimate. There is a precedent for canceling debt that is

odious— incurred without the consent of the people and not for their benefit— and

Kremer and Jayachandran (2002) present a feasible way of doing so. Second, debt relief

can benefit both creditors and debtors (Krugman, 1988; Sachs, 1989). Third, and related

to the second point, it is good accounting practice to write off debts that cannot be




                                                                                          1
collected. That way, future loans can be given on a sounder economic basis (Sachs and

Huizinga, 1987; Summers, 2000).

       Does debt relief help or hurt the recipient? This paper takes a new approach. We

ask the stock market to opine. In March of 1989 the United States government formally

approved an initiative by Treasury Secretary Nicolas Brady calling for debt relief for

third world countries. Between 1989 and 1995, sixteen developing countries reached

debt relief agreements under the Brady plan. This paper examines the response of each

debtor country’s stock market to the news of its own Brady agreement. Figure 1 conveys

the central fact. The stock market appreciates by an average of 60 percent in real dollar

terms when countries announce the signing of a Brady debt relief agreement.

       The stock market is forward looking. It asks what discount rates and cash flows

lie ahead. The effect of debt relief on discount rates and cash flows follows from the

collective action problem that it is designed to solve. If each creditor would agree to

forgive some of its claims, then the debtor country would be better able to service the

debt owed to each creditor. Consequently, the expected value of all creditors’ claims

would rise. Forgiveness will not happen without coordination, however, because any

individual creditor would prefer to free ride, maintaining the full value of its claims while

others write off some debt (Krugman, 1988; Sachs, 1989). By forcing all creditors to

take a haircut, debt relief solves the collective action problem and paves the way for

profitable new lending (Cline, 1995). The new capital inflow reduces discount rates in

the debtor country by relaxing the intertemporal budget constraint (Obstfeld and Rogoff,

1996). Also, to the extent that a country suffers from debt overhang, debt relief increases




                                                                                           2
the incentive to invest and may raise expected future growth rates and cash flows

(Krugman, 1989; Sachs, 1989).

       The stock market removes the temporal dimension of the analysis by collapsing

the entire expected future stream of debtor-country discount rates and cash flows into a

single summary statistic: the change in the value of the stock market. However, it is

important not to look at debtor-country stock market responses in isolation. Suppose that

the Brady Plan coincides with a global shock unrelated to debt relief that reduces

discount rates and increases cash flows. Debtor-country stock markets will rise, but so

too will stock markets in countries that do not sign debt relief agreements.

       In order to assess whether the Brady country stock market boom was due to the

announcement of debt relief agreements or a common shock, we compare the stock

market response of the Brady countries with the market response of a similar group of

countries that did not sign Brady deals. Figure 1 shows that the control group does not

experience a significant increase in stock prices; the market response in debtor countries

cannot be explained by an unobservable common shock.

       Reporting the results in real dollar terms also requires caution. In countries with

high inflation, the rate of depreciation of the official nominal exchange rate may not keep

pace with inflation. Under such a scenario, the real dollar value of the stock market may

become artificially inflated. To account for this possibility, Section II analyzes the stock

market using real local-currency stock returns. The conclusions are unaltered. The stock

market responds in a positive and statistically significant manner to debt relief

agreements, but there is no significant market response for the control group.




                                                                                          3
        Many countries enter into IMF programs immediately following the

announcement of their Brady Plan. Therefore, it is possible that debt relief agreements

drive up stock prices because they signal future IMF programs. We investigate this

possibility by examining whether stock markets respond positively to IMF agreements

that are not accompanied by debt relief. Section IV demonstrates that this is not the case.

        Similarly, countries receive Brady deals in return for committing to economic

reforms that are designed to increase openness and raise productivity. So, it is possible

that stock prices go up because debt relief signals future reforms. Again, this is not the

case.   The market response to debt relief remains significant when controlling for

concurrent reforms: trade liberalization, privatization, and capital account liberalization.

        After grappling with concerns about robustness in Section IV, Section V turns to

issues of interpretation. Why do stock prices rise? Is this a spurious result? Or, does the

stock market rationally forecast future changes in future fundamentals? Again, theory

points to the net resource transfer (NRT) and future growth. If market values rise

because debt relief paves the way for profitable new lending, then the stock market

responses should have some predictive power for future changes in the NRT. Similarly,

if debt relief improves future growth prospects, then the stock market responses should

have some predictive power for future changes in output. While this approach does not

provide definitive evidence, the stock market responses do help predict the change in the

NRT and GDP growth for up to five years following the agreements.

        Would debt relief for the HIPCs produce the salutary effects achieved by the

Brady Plan? We do not think so. The Brady Plan worked because debt relief was the

appropriate policy response for a group of countries where the collective action problem




                                                                                               4
genuinely stood in the way of profitable new lending.          In a companion paper, we

demonstrate that the collective action problem is not the primary obstacle to growth in the

HIPCs (Arslanalp and Henry 2002). Rather, the principal obstacles are a lack of basic

institutions and social infrastructure, problems that debt relief is unlikely to solve

(Easterly 2001b)

       Debt relief has become synonymous with the HIPCs, but a number of middle-

income developing countries are also substantially indebted (Easterly 2001b; Birdsall and

Williamson 2002). Furthermore, Section VI of this paper shows that these middle-

income countries bear far greater resemblance to the Brady countries than do the highly

indebted poor countries. And yet the middle-income debtors are not part of the debt

relief conversation. In other words, our results point to a cruel irony. The debt relief

debate focuses myopically on the HIPCs, whose problems debt relief cannot solve, while

countries that would actually benefit from debt relief receive precious little consideration.



II. Data and Descriptive Findings

       Table I provides a complete list of the countries in the treatment and control

groups. The treatment group consists of all countries that received a Brady Plan. There

are 16 such countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, the Dominican

Republic, Ecuador, Jordan, Mexico, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Poland,

Uruguay, and Venezuela. The table also gives the announcement date of each country’s

Brady Plan. The principal source of dates is Table 5.3 on page 234 of International Debt

Reexamined (Cline, 1995). However, the book does not provide announcement dates for




                                                                                           5
Bolivia, Nigeria, Panama, Peru and the Philippines1.                   For these five countries we

retrieved     announcement         dates     using     the    Lexis-Nexis        Academic        Universe

(http://web.lexis-nexis.com/universe).2           We verified the accuracy of the search by

matching the dates obtained from Lexis-Nexis with those in the Quarterly Economic

Reports of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).


IIA. Selection of the Control group

        The control group consists of all developing countries that: (1) Did not receive a

Brady plan; and (2) Have stock market data in the International Finance Corporation

(IFC) Emerging Market Data Base going back to at least 1994. There are 16 such

countries: Chile, China, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, India,

Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Turkey, and

Zimbabwe.

        Since the treatment group consists of countries whose stock markets respond to

external shocks, it is crucial that the control group contains countries whose stock

markets will also respond to such shocks. If the control group consists of countries in

such an abject state of development that their economies lack basic institutions, then their

stock markets may not respond positively no matter how favorable the external shocks.

In other words, it is important to ask whether the selection of the control group introduces

statistical bias into our findings.             We address this concern by examining the

characteristics of the two groups in some detail.

  Cline (1995) provides only the year of the announcement for the Philippines and only the implementation
date for Nigeria and Bolivia. It does not provide any dates for Panama and Peru because these countries
were still negotiating their debt relief agreements at the time of the publication.

                                                                                                          6
       The treatment group and the control group display similar geographical

dispersion. Both groups contain countries from Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Eastern

Europe. One significant difference is that Latin American countries comprise the largest

fraction of countries in the treatment group. The control group, however, consists mostly

of Asian counties.     History suggests that the relatively heavier weighting of Asian

countries in the control group will make that group the stronger economic performer. We

confirm this suspicion by comparing the treatment group and the control group using two

standard measures of economic performance, growth and inflation.

       The control group outperforms the treatment group on both measures. Table I

shows that between 1980 and 1999 the median growth rate of per capita GDP for the

control group was 3 percent. The treatment group grew by only 1 percent per year during

the same time period. GDP growth was also less volatile in the control group. The

standard error of GDP growth for the control group was 1 percent, as compared to 2

percent for the treatment group. Finally, the control group has a lower and less volatile

rate of inflation: a median of 11 percent and a standard deviation of 3 percent. The

corresponding numbers for the treatment group are 27 and 18.

       To summarize, the median country in the control group has faster and less volatile

growth together with lower and less volatile inflation than its treatment group

counterpart. To the extent that superior long-run economic performance is positively

correlated with better-managed economies, we would expect stock markets in the median

control-group country to be more responsive to any auspicious common shock. If there is

any selection bias, it works against finding a significantly large revaluation in the Brady

countries. In other words, the bias, if any, strengthens our results.

IIB. Stock Market Data

           The principal source of stock market data is the IFC’s Emerging Markets Data

Base (EMDB)3. Stock price indices for individual countries are the dividend-inclusive,

U.S. dollar-denominated and local currency-denominated IFC Global Indices. For most

countries, EMDB’s coverage begins in December 1975, but for others coverage only

begins in December 1984. Each country’s U.S. dollar-denominated stock price index is

deflated by the U.S. consumer price index (CPI), which comes from the IMF’s

International Financial Statistics (IFS). The local currency-denominated index is deflated

by the local consumer price index for each country, which is also obtained from the IFS.

Returns and inflation are calculated as the first difference of the natural logarithm of the

real stock price and CPI, respectively. All of the data are monthly.

           Reliable stock market data exist for only 10 of the Brady countries: Argentina,

Brazil, Ecuador, Jordan, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, and Venezuela.

We bring back Bolivia, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Panama, and

Uruguay into the picture in Section V where we move the focus of analysis from

financial to real data.



IIC. Descriptive Findings: Stock Market Responses to Debt Relief Announcements

           This subsection presents evidence on how the stock market responds to news of a

future debt relief agreement. For each country in the treatment group we calculate the

average monthly stock return over the entire sample. The average monthly return is a

proxy for the expected monthly return. Subtracting a country’s expected return from its

actual return gives the abnormal return. Now let month [0] be the month in which a

                                                                                          8
Brady debt relief announcement takes place, for a given country. Similarly, let [-12]

denote the 12th month before the debt relief announcement, so that [-12, 0] denotes the

one-year window preceding the announcement. The cumulative abnormal return for a

country is defined as the sum of its abnormal returns from month –12 to month 0.

       Figure 1 plots the average cumulative abnormal return across all ten Brady

countries in event time. The average Brady country stock market experiences cumulative

abnormal returns of 60 percent in real dollar terms. In other words, the real dollar value

of the stock market increases by 60 percent more than it does in a typical year. Now look

at the graph for the control group. If a common shock caused the run-up in equity prices

in the Brady countries, then we should see a run-up in the stock prices of the control

group as well. This is not the case. The average cumulative abnormal return for the

control group is close to 0. The preliminary conclusion is that the stock price increase in

the debtor countries is not due exclusively to a common shock that has favorable effects

on all emerging stock markets.

       One concern is that the results may be sensitive to whether real returns are

measured in dollars or local currency units. To address this concern, Figure 2 replicates

the graph using real local currency returns instead of real dollar returns. Figure 2 is

virtually identical to Figure 1. Since the choice of currency makes little difference, the

formal empirical analysis in Section III focuses on the dollar-denominated returns.

       Outliers are another source of potential concern.        Since there are only ten

countries in the Brady stock market group, one country may dominate the results. To

explore this possibility we conduct median tests in the following way. For each of the ten

countries we compute the median annual stock return. The stock return in the 12-month




                                                                                         9
period preceding the Brady announcement exceeds the median, annual return for every

country except Peru. We also conducted median tests in local currency and the results

were the same.     Peru is the only country whose stock return during the 12-month

announcement window was less than its median 12-month return.



III. Methodology and Formal Empirical Results

       We evaluate the statistical significance of the relationships apparent in Figure 1

by estimating the following regression:

Rit = α i + γ 1BRADYit + γ 2CONTROLit + ε it .                                        (1)

Where Rit is the real return in dollars on country i ’s stock market index in month t,

BRADYit is a dummy variable that is equal to one in [-12, 0]. CONTROL is a dummy

variable that is equal to one in all of the control countries in Brady-Announcement

months [-12, 0]. We also estimate BRADY and CONTROL using nine-month [-9, 0],

six-month [-6, 0], and three-month [-3, 0] windows. The country-specific intercepts

allow for the possibility that average expected returns may differ across countries due to

imperfect capital market integration.

       Equation (1) constrains the coefficients on BRADY to be the same across all

months, which means that the parameter γ 1 measures the average monthly stock market

response to all Brady Plan Announcements. Since the dummy variable for the event

window is twelve months long, the total stock market response to debt relief for the

Brady countries is given by twelve times the parameter estimate.

       A different estimation technique would be to use a seemingly unrelated regression

(SUR). This approach would have the advantage of providing a unique coefficient


                                                                                       10
estimate for each country for each event. However, there are also disadvantages to this

approach. The low power of hypothesis tests in unconstrained systems severely weakens

the ability of the event study methodology to detect the impact of the event. Second,

SUR requires a balanced panel. Due to the limited time series availability of stock

market data, creating a balanced panel would result in discarding some of the 10 debt

relief events. Given data limitations, the pooled cross-section time series framework

seems appropriate.

           With an unbalanced panel, it is not possible to relax the assumption of no

contemporaneous correlation of the error term across countries. Therefore, we will take

indirect precautions. Specifically, three of the alternative regression specifications to

equation (1) will estimate abnormal returns relative to the World stock market index, US

stock market index, and finally IFC’s emerging stock market index. Since all of the

sample countries are emerging markets, the inclusion of a composite emerging market

index as a right-hand-side variable will partially control for contemporaneously

correlated disturbance terms. Including the emerging market index does not change the

results.



IIIA. Basic Results

           The first row of Table II (Panel A)— labeled ‘Country-Specific Mean’— gives

the results from the baseline specification in equation (1). White standard errors are

reported in parentheses. Column (1a) shows that the coefficient on BRADY for the

twelve-month window [-12, 0] is 0.05 and is statistically significant at the 1 percent level.

Multiplying the coefficient by 12 gives the total effect, a 60-percent increase in the real




                                                                                          11
dollar value of the stock market. Column (1b) gives the coefficient estimate for the

CONTROL dummy.           In contrast to the estimate for the BRADY countries, the

revaluation effect associated with the control group is economically weak, 0.005, and

statistically insignificant. Column (1c) provides the p-value from a two-sided F-test of

the hypothesis that the coefficient estimate on BRADY is equal to the coefficient

estimate on CONTROL. The p-value for this test is 0.001. The difference between the

BRADY estimate and the CONTROL estimate is statistically significant. In other words,

the stock market in BRADY countries rises by roughly 60 percentage points more than it

does in the CONTROL group.

       The results using nine-month, six-month, and three-month windows are all

consistent with the 12-month estimates. The coefficient estimate of BRADY ranges from

0.048 to 0.052 and is statistically significant in every specification. Furthermore, the

BRADY estimate is always significantly larger than the estimate of CONTROL. Row 2

of Table II (Panel A)— labeled, ‘Constant Mean’— presents estimates of equation (1)

using a constant intercept term, α , instead of country-specific intercept terms. The

results are almost identical to those in Row 1.



IIIB. Controlling For World Stock Markets

       Equation (1) provides a parsimonious baseline specification of abnormal returns,

but it does not allow for the influence of world stock markets on local returns. In order to

do so, we follow Kho, Lee and Stulz (2000) and use the international capital asset pricing

model (ICAPM) to measure the expected return on each country’s stock market index.

Specifically, we now estimate:




                                                                                         12
Rit = α i + β RtW + γ 1BRADYit + γ 2CONTROL + ε it ,                                                (2)

Where RtW is the real return in dollars on the Morgan Stanley Capital Market Index

(MSCI) in month t. While barriers to the international movement of capital may raise

questions about the economic assumption of an ICAPM, as a purely statistical matter,

returns on world stock market indices do have some predictive power for stock returns in

the countries under consideration (Henry 2000a).4

        Row 3 of Table II (Panel A) presents estimates of BRADY and CONTROL using

equation (2). Row 4 presents estimates that use real U.S. stock returns, RtUS , in place of

RtW . Row 5 presents estimates that use the real dollar return on the IFC Emerging

Market index, RtLDC , in place of RtW . Row 6 presents estimates that use all three sets of

world stock returns simultaneously. The results in Rows 3 through 6 perfectly mirror

those under the benchmark specification in Rows 1 and 2. The coefficient on BRADY is

statistically significant under all four ICAPM specifications. The point estimate ranges

from 4.9 to 3.9 percent per month, and the estimate of BRADY is significantly larger

than the estimate of CONTROL in all but the three-month window estimates.



IIIC. Other Robustness Checks

        The estimates in Panel A of Table II adjust for cross-country heteroscedasticity

and cross-country correlation, but they do not account for potential serial correlation in

the error terms.      Hence, White standard errors may not be sufficient to ensure the

(FGLS). FGLS allows for the possibility of serial correlation, in addition to correcting

for cross-country heteroscedasticity.

        The estimations using FGLS yield the same conclusions as the OLS estimates in

Panel A. Every FGLS point estimate of BRADY in Panel B of Table II is statistically

significant.   The FGLS monthly point estimates of BRADY are smaller than those

obtained using OLS, but they are still large. The smallest point estimate for the twelve-

month window is 0.034— a total revaluation of greater than 40 percent. Furthermore, the

coefficient on BRADY remains significantly larger than the coefficient on CONTROL in

all of the specifications except for some of those that use 3-month windows.



IV. Do IMF Programs and Economic Reforms Drive the Results?

        Three central facts emerge from Sections II and III: (1) Stock markets in debtor

countries experience a positive and statistically significant revaluation in response to

news of debt relief; (2) the effect is large and it is not an artifact of the currency in which

the revaluation is measured; and (3) the response is uniformly positive across debtor

countries.

        The control group also experiences a mild revaluation, but the 50-percentage-

point difference between the estimates of BRADY and CONTROL is statistically

significant and cannot be explained by a common shock. Having ruled out common

shocks as an explanation, the following subsection of the paper examines whether the




                                                                                            14
Brady countries’ stock market revaluations are driven by the prospect of debt relief or the

expectation of future IMF programs and economic reforms.



IVA. IMF Programs

        Countries receive debt relief in return for agreeing to commit to economic reforms

that are designed to increase openness and raise productivity (Cline, 1995). In other

words, Brady agreements may also constitute implicit news about the entire future

schedule of economic reforms.       Official country agreements with the International

Monetary Fund illustrate the point.     Column 3 of Table III shows that an official

agreement with the IMF immediately precedes, or follows on the heels of, every Brady

deal.

        Since IMF programs followed all of the Brady agreements, Brady agreements

may drive up stock prices because they signal future IMF agreements. Because every

debt relief agreement closely coincides with an IMF agreement, we cannot disentangle

the debt relief effect by inserting into equation (3) a dummy variable for IMF programs

that coincide with debt relief announcements. An IMF dummy constructed in that way

would be collinear with the BRADY dummy and present the attendant econometric

problems.

        Therefore, we adopt a different tack. We examine whether the stock market

responds to IMF agreements that are not accompanied by debt relief. We do this by

constructing for each country a list of all IMF programs that did not occur within a year

(before or after) of the announcement of its Brady debt relief agreement. We then create




                                                                                        15
a dummy variable, IMFPROGRAM, which takes on the value one for all such programs,

and estimate the following regression:

         Rit = α + β RtW + γ 1IMFPROGRAM it + ε it                                                    (4)

Following the earlier specifications, we estimate twelve-month, nine-month, six-month,

and three-month windows. If the stock market responds positively to IMF agreements

that are not accompanied by debt relief, then the estimate of γ 1 should be positive and

significant.

        There is no evidence that the stock market responds positively to IMF agreements

that are not associated with a Brady Debt Relief Agreement. The coefficient estimate of

IMFPROGRAM is negative and statistically insignificant in every specification. The

estimate for the twelve-month window is –0.016; the estimate for the nine-month window

is -0.011; the estimate for the six-month window is -0.004; the estimate for the three-

month window is -0.027.5



IVB. Economic Reforms

        Just as debt relief agreements may signal future IMF agreements, IMF agreements

may in turn signal countries’ commitment to future economic reforms (Williamson, 1994;

Collins, 1990; Bruno and Easterly, 1996). By transitivity, debt relief may signal future

economic reforms. If debt relief agreements are a signal of future productivity-enhancing

reforms, then the results in Table II may erroneously attribute the stock market

revaluation to debt relief instead of the future reforms.



5
 The insignificance of the IMFPROGRAM variable is consistent with evidence that the market responds
positively to IMF agreements, only when they are announced in the midst of high inflation (Henry, 2002).


                                                                                                      16
       Columns 2 through 4 of Table III present a list of critical economic reform dates

in each country.     Broadly speaking, economic reforms fall into one of four areas:

stabilization, privatization, trade liberalization, and capital account liberalization. The

previous subsection on IMF programs addresses stabilization issues. This subsection

focuses on the latter three reforms.

       We use the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Quarterly Economic Reports to identify

the date of trade liberalization. We check the EIU dates against the trade liberalization

dates in the World Bank Publication, Trends in Developing Economies (1994) and the

dates in Sachs and Warner (1995). We identify privatization dates with the World Bank

Privatization Transaction Database, which contains the names and dollar amounts of all

privatizations occurring between 1988 and 1999. We use the database to identify the first

year in which there were recorded sales of stated owned enterprises. Once we know the

year of the first sale, we search the EIU’s quarterly economic reports for the month in

which the start of the privatization program was announced. We also check the EIU to

make sure that there were no privatizations preceding the starting date of the database.

Finally, the capital account liberalization dates come from Henry (2000).

       A close examination of Table III illustrates the point of the exercise. All of the

treatment countries began implementing major economic reforms before, during and after

the Brady period. There is sufficient heterogeneity (staggering) in the timing of the

economic reforms to allow us to control directly for their effect on stock prices. To do

so, we construct a series of reform dummies for each country: TRADE; PRIVATIZE;

LIBERALIZE.        These variables take on the value 1 during the month a reform is




                                                                                        17
announced and in each of the preceding 11 months. We then estimate the following

regression:

 Rit = α i + β RtW + γ 1BRADYit + γ 2CONTROLit + γ 3TRADEit + γ 4 PRIVATEit + γ 5CAPITALit + ε it
(5)

       Table IV presents the results. Panel A gives the White-corrected OLS estimates.

Panel B gives the FGLS estimates. The coefficient on BRADY is significant at the 1

percent or 5 percent level for every window. The point estimate of 0.05 suggests an

average revaluation of 5 percent per month during the debt relief announcement window.

The third row of the table shows that the coefficient on BRADY is significantly different

from the coefficient on CONTROL for all of the specifications. Consistent with a

number of previous papers, the capital account liberalization dummy is significant for the

[-6, 0] and [-3, -1] windows. There is little evidence that the other reforms do much to

stock prices during the sample period. Table IV suggests that the Brady Plan is an

important source of market revaluation, even after controlling for the effect of

contemporaneous economic reforms.



IVC. Is it a Halo Effect?

       Since we find no significant effect of real economic reforms, it is important to ask

whether the documented rise in stock prices associated with the Brady Deal is spurious.

In other words, is there a temporary halo effect associated with Brady countries, a kind of

irrational exuberance about the efficacy of debt relief that is not justified by subsequent

changes in the fundamentals? Two pieces of evidence suggest that this is not the case.

       First, although the point estimates of the market responses to reforms are not

significant, it does not follow that economic reforms are unimportant. On the contrary,


                                                                                          18
economic reforms are an essential complement, which help ensure the viability of debt

relief agreements. Figure 3 illustrates the point. In the three countries in which reforms

stalled temporarily— Jordan, Nigeria, and the Philippines— the initial rise in valuations

is completely wiped out.              In other words, debt relief does little good unless it is

accompanied by real changes that alter a country’s underlying economic fundamentals.

         Second, ex-post evidence suggests that the stock market revaluations are not

simply a halo effect. Specifically, the next section of the paper demonstrates that the

stock market accurately forecasts changes in real fundamental variables such as GDP

growth and the Net Resource Transfers (NRT). In particular, high GDP growth, and

positive NRTs follow after all stock market revaluations.



V. Exploring the Fundamentals: Why Do Market Values Rise?

         If the stock market increases are not spurious, they should reflect a fall in future

discount rates and or a rise in cash flows.                   Accordingly, this section of the paper

examines the extent to which the ex-ante changes in market valuation rationally forecast

ex-post changes in discount rates and cash flows.

         The effect of debt relief on discount rates follows from the collective action

problem that debt relief is designed to address. To understand the collective action

problem it is useful to introduce the idea of the net resource transfer (NRT). The NRT is

the net flow of real resources into a country, and therefore has direct implications for

discount rates.6


6
  Discount rates in developing countries are notoriously hard to measure. Financial repression and other
market distortions, which characterized these countries prior to the Brady Plan, make it difficult to assess
the true change in the risk-free rate from official interest rates. Instead of looking at official interest rate
measures, which may not reflect the true scarcity of capital, we use the change in the NRT as a proxy.


                                                                                                               19
       As rich countries with high capital to labor ratios will export capital to poor

countries where the rate of return is higher, poor countries typically experience positive

NRTs. However, the NRT may suddenly turn negative when collective action problems

arise— adverse shocks or poor economic management may drive risk averse creditors to

call in existing loans and make potential new creditors unwilling to lend. Since lending

would be profitable if not all creditors tried to get their money at once, the negative NRT

outcome is inefficient. By forcing all creditors to take a haircut, debt relief solves the

collective action problem and paves the way for profitable new lending (Cline, 1995).

The new capital inflow reduces discount rates in the debtor country by relaxing the

intertemporal budget constraint (Obstfeld and Rogoff, 1996).

       The effect of debt relief on cash flows also follows from the theory. If a country

suffers from a debt overhang, then debt relief may increase the incentive to invest and

raise expected future growth rates (Krugman, 1989; Sachs, 1989). To the extent that

corporate cash flows are positively correlated with GDP, a higher GDP growth rate

implies a faster growth trend for cash flows.



VA. Is There a Change in Net Resource Transfers?

       Since debt relief may reduce discount rates by restoring positive net resource

transfers to countries where it hat turned negative, the large positive ex-ante changes in

market valuation should be associated with positive changes in the NRT. Panel A of

Table V presents data on the Net Resource Transfer in event time. The table shows a

clear pattern. The sign of the NRT changes twice for the Brady countries. In every one

of the years from [-18, -9] the median net resource transfer is positive for the Brady




                                                                                        20
countries. In year –8, roughly the time of the debt crisis, the NRT turns negative and

remains so until after the Brady Plan. After the Brady Plan, net resource flows become

positive for the rest of the sample.

           Again, it is important to ask whether the reversal in the sign of the NRT in the

Brady countries can be explained by a common shock. The evidence from the control

group in Panel B of Table V suggests that this is not the case. The median level of NRT

to the countries in the control group was positive for all but two years from 1970 to 2000.

           Panel B of Table V shows that the reversal in the direction of the net resource

transfer is particularly striking for some individual Brady countries.       In Brazil, for

instance, after 10 consecutive years of negative resource transfers, the NRT turns positive

in the year of the announcement of the Brady plan and remains positive for the rest of the

sample. In 5 of 10 Brady countries with stock market data --Brazil, Jordan, Mexico,

Philippines, and Venezuela –the NRT becomes positive within the first year of the Brady

plan7. In Argentina and Ecuador, the NRT turned positive in the year preceding the plan.

In Poland, the NRT turned positive in 1991, admittedly long before its debt relief plan

was unveiled. However, following Poland’s plan, there was a three-fold increase in the

level of NRT. In fact, Peru is the only country from this group, which did not experience

a change in NRT concomitant with its Brady plan. Peru is also the only country in the

group, which did not experience a positive and significant stock market revaluation in

anticipation of the plan.

           The numbers in Panel B also demonstrate that debt relief without economic

reform has only ephemeral success in restoring positive NRTs. After initially turning

positive, the NRT becomes negative in 3 out of the 10 Brady countries with stock
7
    In Nigeria, the NRT turned positive two years after the Brady plan.


                                                                                        21
markets: Nigeria, Philippines, and Venezuela.        The last paragraph of Section IVB

identifies Nigeria and the Philippines as non-reformers at the time of their Brady Plan.

And Venezuela, according to Sachs and Warner (1995) significantly reversed its reforms

after two years of successful implementation.

       On the other hand, economic reform without debt relief is not sufficient to restore

positive NRTs. We checked to see whether the NRT to Brady countries became positive

following the economic reform dates in Table III. None of these reforms by themselves

are successful in reversing the sign of the NRT. Only after the implementation of debt

relief does the NRT turn positive. Again, this fact should not be interpreted to mean that

economic reforms are unimportant. Indeed, the NRT remains positive only as long as

countries sustain their economic reforms. Here is the point: While economic reforms are

important for raising the productivity of capital, reforms by themselves may not be

sufficient to overcome collective action problems.

       Turning to Panel B, we see that Brady countries without stock markets do not

systematically experience the reversal in the NRT that we see in the Brady stock market

countries. The median NRT for the non-stock market Brady countries turned negative

only once between [-18, 0]. Although Panama and Uruguay have certainly experienced

changes in the NRT following their Brady Plans, it is harder to make that assessment for

the other countries. The net resource transfers to Bolivia, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, and the

Dominican Republic have almost always been positive, even during the debt crisis years.

       This pattern may suggest that debt relief for these poorer countries was not as

effective as it was for the other countries for which dependable stock markets data were




                                                                                       22
available. Section VI explores why this may be the case, but before doing so we now

examine whether debt relief is associated with changes in growth.



VB. Is There a Change in Growth?

       Since debt relief may increase expected future growth rates, positive ex-ante

changes in market valuation should be associated with higher than normal future GDP

growth. Figure 4 shows that countries grow faster following the Brady Plan. The graph

plots the average deviation of the growth rate of per capita GDP from its country-specific

mean in event time for all 16 Brady countries versus that of the control group. The

message is clear. The Brady countries experience abnormally high growth rates in each

of the five years following the Brady plan. There is no significant change in the growth

rates of the control group.



VC. Does the Stock Market Rationally Forecast the Changes?

       Table VI shows that the stock market revaluations appear to rationally forecast

higher future NRTs. There is a strong correlation between the sign of the cumulative

abnormal return on the stock market and the change in the sign of the NRT. In 9 of 10

countries, stock markets correctly predict the change in the sign of the NRT within the

two years following the Brady Plan.

       Next, Table VI shows that the stock market revaluations, which occur in

anticipation of the Brady Plan, also appear to forecast higher future GDP growth

outcomes. There is a strong correlation between the sign of the cumulative abnormal

return on the stock market and the sign of the deviations of output growth from its long-




                                                                                       23
run mean. In 9 of 10 countries, markets predicted the abnormal GDP growth in the year

following the Brady Plan. In 9 of 10 countries, the markets predicted the positive

cumulative abnormal GDP growth for the next two years, and similarly in 8 of the 10

countries for the next five years after the Brady Plan.



VI. Do the Results Suggest that the HIPC Initiative Will Work?

       Easterly (2001b) argues that debt relief is unlikely to promote investment, reform

or growth in the HIPCs. We think that he is right. Yes, markets rise in anticipation of the

Brady Plan.     And ex-post data on net resource transfers and growth confirm the

rationality of the markets’ forecast. But there are vast differences between the Brady

countries and the HIPCs.

       Theory suggests that in order for a country to be a legitimate candidate for debt

relief, it must satisfy two necessary (but not sufficient) conditions. First, the collective

action problem must stand in the way of net capital inflows to that country. Second, the

country must have a social infrastructure that is sufficiently well developed to ensure that

net capital inflows will be channeled into growth-generating investment.

       The data in Sections I through V suggest that the Brady countries meet both

necessary conditions. In contrast, this section argues that the HIPC countries do not

satisfy either. Specifically we demonstrate that: (1) Capital flows to the HIPC countries

are not deterred by the collective action problem; (2) There has never been significant

scope for profitable lending to the HIPC countries; and (3) The absence of profitable

investment opportunities stems from a lack of social infrastructure.




                                                                                         24
VIA. The Collective Action Problem Does Not Deter Capital Flows to the HIPCs

           The Brady Plan worked because it alleviated the collective action problem,

clearing the way for renewed and profitable lending to the Brady countries. In contrast,

HIPC countries have never suffered from a negative NRT. Panel A of Table V (column

5) shows that the NRT to the HIPC countries has always been positive. If the goal of

debt relief is to restore positive NRTs, then it is not clear how this policy will help a set

of countries that have experienced an uninterrupted stream of positive net resource flows

since 1971.



VIB. There is Little Scope for Profitable Lending to the HIPC Countries

           Although things went sour in 1982, international lenders had expected to make

money by lending to the Brady countries. Presumably, this is why they did so in the first

place. In contrast, there has never been any such expectation for the HIPCs. Table VII

throws the contrast into relief. As early as 1974, loans to the private sector (private debt

+ foreign direct investment + portfolio equity) comprised almost half of the total net

resource flow to the Brady stock market countries. On the other hand, international

lending to the private sector has never been a significant fraction of the total net resource

flows into HIPC countries. As a fraction of total inflows, loans to the private sector in

the HIPC countries have never exceeded 10 percent and have been as low as 4 percent8.

           Furthermore, there has also been a shift in the composition of international

lending to the Brady countries, away from the public sector and toward the private sector.

Table VII shows that at the peak of the debt crisis (1985-89) grants plus public and

publicly guaranteed debt accounted for 73 percent of the net resource transfer to the
8
    Table VIII provides a complete list of all the HIPC countries.


                                                                                          25
Brady countries. By 1994, lending to the private sector— foreign direct investment

(FDI), portfolio equity, and private debt— constituted the chief source of net resource

flows. No such shift has taken place in the HIPC countries. In fact, the opposite has

occurred—official flows and flows to the public sector have become more, not less,

important. The role of grants has increased to the point where they now constitute the

majority of the net resource flows to the HIPC countries.



VIC. Poor Social Infrastructure Explains the Absence of Profitable Investment

       Recent advances in law and finance help explain the virtual absence of private

capital flows to the HIPCs. The degree to which a country’s law protects the legal rights

of minority shareholders exerts a significant influence on that country’s access to external

finance, (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny (LLSV) 1997, 1998, 2002;

Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). If investors get poor protection they will stay away. Outside

finance will dry up, and fewer resources will be available for growth (Dornbusch, 2000).

This insight is germane to the present discussion. The median Brady country ranks lower

than the median G7 country on every component of the LLSV index of investor

protection: shareholder rights, creditor rights, efficiency of judicial system, rule of law,

and rating of the accounting system.

       Shleifer and Wolfenzon (2002) show that weaker investor protection lowers the

marginal product of capital and can eliminate the incentive for capital to flow from rich

to poor countries. According to their argument, the capital, which does flow to the Brady

countries, pales in comparison to what we would see in a world where minority




                                                                                         26
shareholders in the Brady countries enjoyed the same legal protection as their U.S.

counterparts.

        While the Brady countries rank low on the LLSV index, the HIPC countries do

not even make the list. If private capital trickles to Brady countries because they fare

poorly on the LLSV index, then woe to the HIPCs whose capital markets and investor

protection laws are not sufficiently developed to even merit a ranking.

        Having capital markets that are not sufficiently developed to make the LLSV

ranking is probably correlated with having weak social institutions in general. In turn,

social infrastructure can be a crucial factor in determining the level of human capital

accumulation and the marginal product of capital (Kremer 1993). In other words, the rate

of return to private lending in HIPC countries is low because they lack the institutional

development that is necessary to create an environment where: (1) entrepreneurs can earn

an economically fair rate of return on capital; and (2) lenders have an incentive to extend

capital to the private sector.

        We investigate this claim by using the Hall and Jones (1999) measure of social

infrastructure to compare the HIPC and Brady countries. Hall and Jones construct their

measure for 130 countries. The median G7 country ranks 14th; the median Brady country

ranks 63rd; the median HIPC country ranks 102nd. Moreover, all of the G7 countries are

in the highest 20th percentile; all of the Brady countries, except for Nigeria and

Dominican Republic, are in the highest 70th percentile; 27 of the 38 HIPC countries with

available data are in the lowest 30th percentile.

        We also compared HIPC and Brady countries using the average value of their

score on the Heritage House Index of Economic Freedom from 1995 to 2002. The results




                                                                                        27
are similar. Out of 161 countries, the median G7 country ranks 14th; the median Brady

country ranks 59th; the median HIPC country ranks 110th. Moreover, all of the G7

countries are in the highest 20th percentile; all the Brady countries, except for Bulgaria,

are in the highest 60th percentile; 24 of 39 HIPC countries with available data are in the

lowest 40th percentile over the same period.

       It is interesting to note that a number of highly or moderately indebted countries

closely resemble the Brady countries, but have received no consideration for debt relief.

For example, consider Indonesia, Pakistan, Colombia, Jamaica, Malaysia, and Turkey.

The median LLSV score for this group of six countries is 4.6 out of 10. The median

LLSV score for the Brady countries is 4.9. Similarly, the median country in the group of

6 ranks 61st on the Hall and Jones (1999) measure of social infrastructure; the median

Brady country ranks 63rd. Finally, the median country in the group of six ranks 58th on

the Heritage House Index of Economic Freedom; the Median Brady country ranks 59th.

While we do not suggest that countries should receive debt relief based solely on their

resemblance to Brady countries, the analysis suggests that debt relief for the group of six

would constitute a much more efficient use of resources than debt relief for the HIPCs.


VII. Conclusion

       Largely because of the HIPC Initiative, debt relief has become synonymous with

the poorest of poor countries. Developing countries that are equally indebted but have

higher incomes do not receive any consideration for debt relief. For example, Easterly

(2001b) shows that Latin American and Caribbean countries are on average more

indebted than HIPC countries. Birdsall and Williamson (2002) call for extending the

debt relief initiative to include a number of more developed emerging economies. Our



                                                                                          28
results support their call and point to a cruel irony. Relatively developed but highly

indebted emerging economies may be the most promising candidates for debt relief, but

current efforts focus exclusively on HIPC countries where debt relief is least likely to

achieve any efficiency gains.

The first column lists all the countries in the Treatment group, i.e., the countries that signed Brady deals. The next column
identifies the countries for which stock market data are available from the IFC Emerging Market Data Base or the Global
Financial Data Base. In contrast, the last two columns list all the countries in the Control group, i.e. the countries that did not
sign Brady deals and have had stock market data available as of 1994 from the IFC Emerging Market Data Base. The last two
rows compare the Treatment and Control groups in terms of their historical GDP per capita growth and inflation rates from
1980 to 1999. The standard deviation of each rate is given in parenthesis.

The estimation procedure used is Ordinary Least Squares. The stock market data are monthly from December 1979 to July 1999 for all the countries in the Treatment and
Control groups. Stock market data are unavailable before December 1984 for Nigeria, Philippines, Venezuela, Columbia, Malaysia, Pakistan; before December 1986 for
Turkey; before December 1989 for Indonesia; before December 1992 for Peru, Poland, China, Hungary, South Africa, Sri Lanka; before September 1993 for Ecuador; and
before December 1993 for the Czech Republic. The left-hand-side variable is real, dollar-denominated stock returns. Brady is a dummy variable that takes on the value one for
each month during a particular event window preceding a Brady plan. Control is a dummy variable that takes on the value one for each country in the control group during the
months preceding Brady Plans. The column labeled ‘Twelve-month Window’ presents estimates of Brady and Control using an event window that begins twelve months prior
to the announcement of the Brady Plan and ends with the announcement month. The analogous definition applies to the columns labeled ‘Nine-month Window,’ ‘Six-Month
Window’ and ‘Three-Month Window.’ For each event window, six regression specifications are estimated. The first row presents estimates of Brady and Control using the
benchmark specification that allows for country-specific intercept terms. Row 2 presents estimates using an alternative specification that allows for only a single intercept
term. Row 3 presents estimates using the ICAPM specification that introduces the World stock return index as an additional explanatory variable. Row 4 presents estimates
using the US stock return index instead of the World stock index. Row 5 presents estimates using the LDC stock return index instead. Finally, row 6 presents estimates that
use all three sets of indices simultaneously. The column labeled Brady>Control shows the p-value for a test that the coefficient on Brady is statistically larger than the
coefficient on Control. White-corrected standard errors are given in parenthesis. The symbols ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10
percent levels, respectively.

The estimation procedure is Feasible Generalized Least Squares. The stock market data are monthly from December 1979 to July 1999 for all the countries in the Treatment and

before December 1989 for Indonesia; before December 1992 for Peru, Poland, China, Hungary, South Africa, Sri Lanka; before September 1993 for Ecuador; and before
December 1993 for the Czech Republic. The left-hand-side variable is real, dollar-denominated stock returns. Brady is a dummy variable that takes on the value one for each

return index instead of the World stock index. Row 5 presents estimates using the LDC stock return index instead. Finally, row 6 presents estimates that use all three sets of
indices simultaneously. The column labeled Brady>Control shows the p-value for a test that the coefficient on Brady is statistically larger than the coefficient on Control.

This table lists the announcement dates of major economic events for the countries in the Treatment group. The first column identifies these countries. The second
column lists the month and year of each country’s Brady Plan. These dates are obtained from Cline (1995), Lexis/Nexis, and various issues of the Economist Intelligence
Unit. The third column lists IMF plans that are announced shortly preceding or following Brady Plans. These dates are obtained from Henry (2002) and various issues of
the IMF Annual Reports. A Standby agreement with the IMF is noted as SB and an Extended Fund Facility agreement is noted as EFF. The next three columns list the
dates of the beginnings of major economic reforms. The trade liberalization dates are obtained from Sachs and Werner (1995). The privatization dates are obtained from
the Privatization Data Base maintained by the World Bank. The capital account liberalization dates are obtained from Henry (2000). *Poland switched to a market
economy in 1990, simultaneously setting up a stock market and opening up to foreign investment. **Venezuela reversed its trade liberalization reforms in 1993.

The estimation procedure is Ordinary Least Squares; White-corrected standard errors are given in parenthesis. The stock market data are monthly from December 1979 to
July 1999 for all the countries in the Treatment and Control groups. Stock market data are unavailable before December 1984 for Nigeria, Philippines, Venezuela, Columbia,
Malaysia, Pakistan; before December 1986 for Turkey; before December 1989 for Indonesia; before December 1992 for Peru, Poland, China, Hungary, South Africa, Sri
Lanka; before September 1993 for Ecuador; and before December 1993 for the Czech Republic. The left-hand-side variable is real, dollar-denominated stock returns. Brady
is a dummy variable that takes on the value one for each month during a particular event window preceding a Brady plan. Four different event windows are utilized. The
column labeled ‘Twelve-month Window’ presents estimates of Brady and Control using an event window that begins twelve months prior to the announcement of the Brady
Plan and ends with the announcement month. The analogous definition applies to the columns labeled ‘Nine-month Window,’ ‘Six-Month Window’ and ‘Three-Month
Window.’ Control is a dummy variable that takes on the value one for each country in the control group during the months preceding Brady Plans. Privatize, Trade, and
Liberalize are dummy variables that take on the value one during the event window preceding a privatization, trade liberalization and stock market liberalization respectively.
For each event window, two regression specifications are estimated. The World column presents estimates of Brady, Control, Privatize, Trade, and Liberalize using the
ICAPM specification that introduces the World stock return index as an additional explanatory variable. The Constant Mean column presents estimates using the
specification that allows for only a single intercept term. The column labeled Brady>Control shows the p-value for a test that the coefficient on Brady is statistically larger
than the coefficient on Control. . The symbols ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent levels, respectively.

Net resource transfers are equal to net resource flows minus interest payments on long-term loans and foreign direct investment profits. The first column
lists the years in event time. The number ‘0’ represents the year in which its Brady Plan was announced. For Control group countries and Highly-Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC), 0 represents 1989. The next four columns show the progression of net resource transfers in event time to the following groups of
countries: the Control group, the Brady Stock market group, the Brady Non-Stock market group, and the HIPC countries. The Control group countries are
displayed in Table I. The Brady Stock market countries are the countries in the Treatment group with available stock market data as displayed in Table I.
The Brady Non-Stock market countries are the remaining countries of the Treatment group. The HIPC countries are displayed in Table VIII. The data on
NRT are obtained from World Bank’s Global Development Finance Data Base.

    This table presents the correlation between increases in market valuation before Brady Plan announcements and changes in net resource transfers and
    GDP growth afterwards. The first column lists the Brady Stock market countries. The Brady Stock market countries are the countries in the Treatment
    group with available stock market data as displayed in Table I. The second column identifies the countries that experienced abnormal stock market
    returns over the 12 months preceding their Brady Plan announcements. The third column identifies the countries that experienced changes from
    negative NRT to positive NRT in the year preceding or during the two years following the announcement. The fourth column identifies the countries
    that experienced abnormal GDP growth in the year of the announcement. The fifth and sixth columns identify those that experienced abnormal
    growth in the first and second year after the announcement. Finally, the seventh and eight columns identify the countries that experienced abnormal
    cumulative GDP growth during the two and five years following the announcement of the Brady Plan. The + sign denotes positive identification of a
    country. * Following the Brady Plan in Poland there is no change in the sign of NRT, but the level of NRT almost triples.
