                                            ABSTRACT



       This paper analyzes the role that health status plays in household portfolio decisions using
data from the Health and Retirement Study. The results indicate that health is a significant predictor
of both the probability of owning different types of financial assets and the share of financial wealth

held in each asset category. Households in poor health are less likely to hold risky financial assets,
other things (including the level of total wealth) being the same. Poor health is associated with a

smaller share of financial wealth held in risky assets and a larger share in safe assets. We find no
evidence that the relationship between health status and portfolio allocation is driven by "third
variables" that simultaneously affect health and financial decisions. Further, the relationship between
health status and portfolio choice does not appear to operate through the effect of poor health on

individuals' attitudes toward risk, their planning horizons, or their health insurance status.

1. Introduction

       Economists have long realized the importance of understanding individual

portfolio choice. Recent empirical work on individual portfolio choice has focused on a

number of important questions, including the impacts of bequest motives (Hurd [2002]),

undiversifiable human capital risk (Heaton and Lucas [2000]), and the differential tax

treatment of income generated by various assets (Poterba [2001]).

       The role of health status has received little attention. While several studies have

documented that health affects total wealth accumulation (Smith [1999], Venti and Wise

[2000], Wu [2003]), there is much less research on how health influences the allocation

of that wealth to various assets. Edwards [2002] develops a theoretical model in which

health risk determines portfolio shares through its effect on risk aversion. One can

imagine other channels through which health could affect portfolio composition. Poor

health may influence an individual’s marginal utility of consumption, her degree of risk

aversion, rate of time preference, and the variability of her labor income, all of which

could affect portfolio composition. Because health tends to deteriorate with age and

older people control a disproportionate amount of total wealth, it seems particularly

pressing to understand how poor health affects portfolio allocation decisions.

       The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether differences in health status

help explain differences in individual portfolio composition, ceteris paribus. We

examine how health status is related to both the probability that a household holds a

particular type of asset in its portfolio, and the share of financial wealth held in each asset

category. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews

previous empirical work on household portfolio choice. Section 3 discusses the empirical
strategy and describes the data. In Sections 4 and 5 we examine the impact of health

status on the choice of assets and on the proportion of financial wealth held in the various

assets, respectively. We find that health effects are present in both sets of decisions. In

particular, households in poor health are less likely to hold all classes of financial assets,

other things (including the level of total wealth) being the same. Further, poor health is

associated with a larger share of financial wealth held in safe assets and a smaller share in

other classes of assets. Section 6 concludes with a summary and suggestions for future

research.



2. Previous Literature

       A rich theoretical literature demonstrates how portfolio decisions depend on

factors such as risk aversion and investment opportunities.1 Early contributions analyzed

static models in which an investor selects the portfolio that maximizes expected utility

given total wealth and the risk-return pattern of available assets (Tobin [1958] and

Mossin [1969]). More recent research has moved to a dynamic framework in which

one’s portfolio is selected to maximize expected lifetime utility. Important issues include

the role of incomplete portfolios (King and Leape [1998]), human capital uncertainty

(Heaton and Lucas [1997]), the ability to substitute labor income for asset income (Bodie,

Merton and Samuelson [1992]), and uncertain time horizons (Foldes [2000]).

       The empirical literature on portfolio choice has sought to find observable

variables that explain cross sectional variation in portfolio behavior. Typically, the

covariates used include resources available to the household (total wealth and income) as

well as demographic characteristics (age, race, gender, marital status). Such variables are




                                             -2-
generally statistically significant and quantitatively important in regressions explaining

portfolio behavior, both in U.S. and European data. (See, for example, Bertaut and Starr-

McCluer [2002], Carroll [2001] and Guiso et al. [2002]).

           Most empirical work in this area addresses two distinct but related questions

regarding portfolio choice. First, does the individual or household hold a positive amount

of a given asset at all? Second, what proportion of the total portfolio is held in each

asset? This approach of estimating reduced-form models for ownership probabilities and

for portfolio shares has served as a fruitful starting point for analyzing a number of issues

relating to portfolio allocation. Examples include Poterba and Samwick [1999], who

include marginal tax rates to study the impact of the federal income tax; Heaton and

Lucas [2000], who use a measure of the variability of labor income to investigate whether

the riskiness of human capital affects the demand for financial assets; and Edwards

[2002], who includes an attitudinal variable--the individual’s subjective probability that

health will limit her work activity over the next decade--to examine whether health risk

affects portfolio choice. We adopt the same basic approach to analyze the effect of health

status on portfolio composition.



3. Data and Empirical Strategy

3.1 Description

We use data from four waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS is a

nationally representative panel that follows across time approximately 7,000 households

with a primary respondent between the ages of 51 and 61 during the first year of the

survey. The first wave of the study was conducted in 1992, so the primary respondents

1
    See Gollier [2002] for an excellent survey.

                                                  -3-
represent cohorts born between 1931-1941. The next three waves of the survey were

collected in 1994, 1996, and 1998. While this sample is clearly not representative of the

entire age distribution of households, Poterba [1994, p. 2] and others have shown that net

worth is highly concentrated among older households. Further, tabulations from the 1998

Survey of Consumer Finances indicate that households headed by individuals between

the ages of 51 and 67 own about 44 percent of the equity in the economy. Hence, as

suggested above, this is an important group to study in the context of portfolio

composition issues.

        The survey includes detailed information on health and cognitive status, and a

variety of economic and demographic variables. Of particular interest for our analysis is

that the HRS provides information on each household’s holdings of a quite

comprehensive set of financial assets: checking, savings and money market accounts,

CDs, bonds and bond funds, government savings bonds and T-bills, stocks, mutual funds

and IRA and Keogh accounts.

        Conducting an analysis of portfolio decisions requires that one specify the set of

assets from which the investor chooses. In practice, some arbitrariness is involved in

aggregating financial assets into relatively homogeneous groups that are suitable for

statistical analysis. A typical strategy is to collapse financial assets into three classes,

“safe,” “medium risky,” and “risky” (Hurd [2002]), although some studies construct as

many as eight to ten categories (Poterba and Samwick [1999]). We use a four-way

classification scheme consisting of safe assets (checking and savings accounts, money

market funds, CDs, government savings bonds and T-bills), bonds (corporate, municipal

and foreign bonds and bond funds), risky assets (stocks and mutual funds), and retirement




                                              -4-
accounts (IRAs and Keoghs). This is quite similar to Hurd’s [2002] approach, except that

he combines retirement accounts and bonds into one category. However, given the

special tax treatment of IRA and Keogh accounts, and the fact that they may be relatively

illiquid for some households, it seems sensible to segregate them (as do Poterba and

Samwick [1999] and King and Leape [1998]). Unfortunately, the HRS does not indicate

what kinds of assets are in the retirement accounts. The Survey of Consumer Finances

(SCF) does provide some information. On the basis of SCF tabulations, we allocated

each household’s retirement accounts to stocks and bonds. Doing so did not change the

substantive results of our analysis of portfolio shares. 2

           Table 1 presents summary statistics of the key variables, including demographic

characteristics and financial wealth holdings. The average age (over the four-year panel)

of husbands is roughly 60 years and the average age of wives is 56, while singles are 59

years of age on average. 58 percent of single people are female and 18 percent are black.

For married couples3, approximately 6 percent of husbands and wives are black. Single

people have slightly over $38,000 in financial assets on average; the figure for couples is

about $95,000.

           Approximately 67 percent of singles and 80 percent of married couples have a

positive amount of safe asset holdings. It is not quite clear how to interpret this figure,

particularly because virtually everyone in this sample presumably has Social Security

wealth, which is generally perceived to be a “safe” asset. Hence, we do not include safe

assets in our discussion of ownership probabilities in Section 4. The percentages for the

other categories are much lower – only 20 percent of singles own any risky assets, while

                                                   -5-
33 percent of married couples have a positive amount of these assets. The analogous

numbers for bonds are only 4 percent and 7 percent. The figures in this table are

consistent with previous findings that many households have incomplete portfolios in the

sense that they do not own positive amounts of every type of asset. Conditional on

having financial wealth, the great majority of it is held in safe assets – an average of 64

percent for singles and 54 percent for couples.4

        One important issue in studying portfolio shares is how broadly the measure of

wealth in the denominator should be defined. Different pictures can emerge if one uses

financial assets, all physical assets (including homes and automobiles), or physical assets

plus human capital as the relevant measure of wealth (Heaton and Lucas [2000]). We

follow most previous investigators in looking at shares of financial assets. We compute

portfolio shares for all individuals who report positive financial assets.5

        Our health status variable is based on the answer to the following question:

“Would you say your health in general is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?” The

HRS codes the answers to this question on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 representing excellent

health and 5 representing poor health. We create a dichotomous variable Sick, which

takes a value of one if the individual rates his or her health as “fair” or “poor” and zero

otherwise.6 A large literature documents the validity of self-reported health measures.

Poor self-reported health is strongly correlated with mortality even after controlling for

3
  There are a few non-married cohabiters whom we include in this category. Excluding these households
has no effect on our results.
4
  The finding that a substantial number of U.S. households have no safe assets--or no financial assets
whatsoever--has been documented in a number of data sets. See, for example, Bertaut and Starr-McCluer’s
[2002, p. 190] tabulations from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). When a household reports not
having even a checking account, the SCF asks why. Typically, such households reply that the fees are too
high, they do not write enough checks to make it worthwhile, and so on.
5
  Some researchers exclude households whose financial net worth does not exceed some threshold (Heaton
and Lucas [2000]).



                                                  -6-
indices of functional capacity, the presence of specific medical conditions and physician

health assessments (Idler and Benyamini [1997]).7 Additional evidence along these lines

is provided by Hurd and McGarry [1995], who find correlations in the AHEAD data

between self-reported health status and both mortality and the onset of several serious

health conditions, after controlling for various socio-demographic conditions.8 That said,

in the psychology literature some have argued that an individual’s subjective health

evaluations may be distorted by his or her mood (Schmidt et al. [1996]). We therefore

also estimated our model using several alternative measures of health status, including

specific medical conditions and an index of the individual’s ability to conduct activities

of daily living. The results were qualitatively similar to those using self-reported health

status.

3.2 Some Cross Tabulations

          We begin our exploration of the relationship between health and portfolio

decisions by showing how the proportion of households owning various assets and their

respective portfolio shares vary with health status (Table 2). Results are shown

separately for single and married people. For both individuals and couples, being healthy

increases the probability of owning each one of the financial assets. For example, 25.1

percent of healthy single people own some risky assets; for sick single people the

analogous number is only 8.2 percent. Similarly, 38.5 percent of couples in which both


6
  Analysis using all five indicator variables does not change our substantive results.
7
  An alternative approach suggested by Edwards [2002] is to focus on the individual's expectation that, over
a period of time such as a decade, her health will interfere with her ability to work. However, this limits
the sample since the variable is defined only for individuals who are in the labor force at the time the
question is asked.
8
  As an alternative way to investigate this issue, we included an indicator for the individual’s mental health
status as a covariate in our basic model. If mental health is driving both self-reported health status and
financial decisions, then inclusion of mental health should reduce the impact of self-reported health status.
However, such does not appear to be the case in our data.


                                                    -7-
spouses are healthy own some risky assets; the figure is only 12.2 percent for couples in

which both spouses are sick. The right hand side of Table 2 indicates that health status is

also correlated with the proportion of financial wealth held in each asset category.

Married couples with two healthy spouses hold an average of 49.5 percent of their

financial wealth in safe assets and 18.9 percent in risky assets, while couples with both

spouses who are sick hold 74.7 percent in safe assets and only 6.6 percent in risky assets.

A similar relationship between health status and portfolio shares holds for singles.

         Although Table 2 indicates that differences in health status are associated with

differences in ownership probabilities and portfolio shares, a number of variables are

known to be correlated with health status and some of these could also be correlated with

portfolio decisions. Hence, while these results are suggestive, we now turn to a

multivariate approach. We discuss ownership probabilities and portfolio shares in

Sections 4 and 5, respectively.



4. Ownership Probabilities

4.1 Estimation Issues

         Our goal is to determine whether variations in health status exert an independent

effect on the probability that a household owns each of the four types of assets. We

follow the general strategy employed in previous papers and estimate a probit model for

the probability of owning each asset, including on the right hand side our

dichotomous variable for poor health and controls for total wealth,9 income and other

demographic characteristics. We pool together the data from the four waves of the HRS


9
 Total wealth includes the value of all net housing equity, all vehicles, net business equity, financial assets,
and other assets including real estate. It does not include pension or social security wealth. However,


                                                     -8-
and use a random effects estimator of the parameters.10 We also include a year effect for

each wave.

        Two major issues must be addressed in estimating these models. The first is how

to treat married couples versus singles. The typical practice of simply including an

indicator variable for marital status (for example, Bertaut and Starr-McCluer [2002]) is

really not suitable in our context. There are potentially interesting questions about

decision making within households that are best explored if separate equations are

estimated for single and married individuals.11 This decision is reinforced by Barber and

Odean’s [2001] finding that married and single people follow different stock trading

strategies; their other portfolio decisions might differ as well.

        The second issue relates to the treatment of health status for married couples.

Because of different life expectancies, husbands and wives may have different time

horizons. Further, there is some evidence that men and women differ with respect to risk

aversion (Barber and Odean [2001] and Lott and Kenny [1999]). These considerations

suggest that men and women may favor different portfolio strategies, and that the impact

on the family’s portfolio when one or the other is ill may differ. Hence, there is no

reason to expect health effects for the two spouses to be symmetric, so an average or

combined measure is inappropriate. Instead, we enter one indicator variable for the

husband’s health status, and another for the wife’s.12



when the wealth variable is augmented with an imputation for pension wealth, none of the substantive
results changes.
10
   With a random effects estimator, identification of the health status coefficients comes in part from
changes in health status within households over time.
11
   Browning [2000] and Mazzocco [2002] provide discussions of savings behavior in households with more
than one decision maker.
12
   As noted below, we also allowed for the possibility of an interaction between the spouses’ health
outcomes and found that, in general, it had no impact on the substantive results.


                                                 -9-
         With respect to other covariates, our choices are quite conventional. We include

age because risk aversion and the time horizon vary with it (Bertaut and Starr-McCluer

[2002, p. 199]). 13 Previous studies have indicated that education exerts an important

influence on portfolio choice; in general, households with more education are more likely

to hold diversified portfolios, perhaps because they have better information about various

investment opportunities (King and Leape [1998, p. 190]). We include a set of

dichotomous variables for educational attainment. We also include indicator variables

for sex (in the equation for singles) and race, and the presence of any children, all of

which could affect risk aversion, the decision-making time horizon and bequest motives.

Theory suggests that the level of total wealth is an important determinant of portfolio

allocation both because it can influence risk aversion and because there may be fixed

costs to owning certain assets (Hurd [2002, p. 467]). To allow for nonlinearities in the

impact of wealth, we enter it as a quadratic. Our wealth variable includes financial

wealth in addition to physical capital such as net equity in housing and businesses.

Following the tack suggested by some earlier studies, we experimented with a wealth

variable that also included an estimate of individuals’ human capital.14 This modification

of the wealth variable had no impact on the estimates of health effects that are reported

below. Finally, previous research has also shown that income is a significant determinant




13
   There is a well-documented negative correlation between health status and age. This raises the
possibility that the failure to include health status in analyses of portfolio choice may bias estimates of age
effects. However, when we estimated our models without health, the coefficients on the age variables
generally did not change substantially.
14
   We follow Heaton and Lucas’s [2000] algorithm for estimating human capital: Assume that for
individuals under the age of 65, real labor income remains constant at its current level until age 65 and then
ceases. For individuals over 65 who report labor income, assume that this income remains constant until
age 70 and then ceases. Streams of labor income are discounted back to the respondent’s current age at a
real interest rate of 5 percent.


                                                    - 10 -
of portfolio composition even conditional on wealth (King and Leape [1998]), and we

also enter it as a quadratic.15



4.2 Basic Results

         The probit estimates for single individuals and couples are reported in Tables 3a

and 3b, respectively. The first column for each asset category gives the results for the

basic specification. The second column for each category adds controls for parents'

education and industry and occupation.16

         Consider first the health effects for the single individuals in Table 3a. The results

are quite striking. Being in poor health exerts a negative and statistically significant

effect on the probability of owning each financial asset.17 Further, calculating the

marginal effects from the probit coefficients listed in the table18, we find that the effects

are quantitatively important. Specifically, the figures in the first columns under each of

the assets imply that being in ill health reduces the probabilities of owning retirement

accounts, bonds, and risky assets by 2.1, 0.2, and 1.7 percentage points, respectively. In

short, the basic message from the cross tabulations in Table 2 continues to hold when we

include other covariates: health affects asset choice.

         An important question is whether the observed relationship between health and

portfolio choice is somehow spurious. One way this might occur is if there is reverse

causality – portfolio composition affects health rather than vice versa. We find this

scenario implausible. Although the notion that there are dual pathways relating health

15
   The results are essentially unchanged when we use step functions for wealth and household income.
16
   There are 12 industry categories and 17 occupations, based on standard census classifications.
17
   This is similar to Edwards’ [2002] result that poor health reduces the likelihood of stock ownership.
Edwards estimates his model treating the HRS waves as a series of independent cross sections.



                                                   - 11 -
status and wealth is taken seriously in the literature (Smith [1999]), we can think of no

compelling reason to believe that the allocation of that wealth to various assets would

influence health status after controlling for the level of total wealth.

           Another possibility is that some third variable drives both health status and

portfolio choice. This seems a more substantial issue. Suppose, for example, that people

with privileged family backgrounds learn more as children about the financial world and

also acquire good health habits. In this case, the strength of the relationship between

poor health and portfolio choice would be overestimated. Or perhaps certain jobs have

more volatile income streams than others and at the same time involve more stress and

worse working conditions than other jobs. Again, our estimated relationship between

health status and portfolio choice would be biased. The HRS data provide us with some

information that can be used to explore these possibilities. Although there is not

extensive information on family background, we do know the parents’ education.

Further, household members’ occupation and industry are reported. The second columns

for each asset category in Tables 3a and 3b show the results when the basic equations are

augmented with parents’ education and a set of industry and occupation dichotomous

variables. Although there are some systematic relationships among occupation, industry

and portfolio decisions (results not shown here), the magnitude and the significance of

the health effects do not change substantially. Thus, to the extent that our data allow us

to explore the possible influence of third variables, we find that they do not undermine

our basic finding that health status affects asset choice.

           Consider next the married couples in Table 3b. There are two health coefficients

for each family, one each for the husband and the wife. As in Table 3a, the first column

18
     See Maddala [1983, p. 23].

                                              - 12 -
for each asset does not include controls for family background and occupational history,

while the second column for each asset does. For virtually every asset type, the

coefficient on poor health (of either spouse) is negative. The coefficients in the first

columns of Table 3b imply that poor health of a husband reduces the likelihood of

owning retirement accounts and risky assets by 8.9 and 3.0 percentage points,

respectively, and has essentially no effect on the probability of owning bonds. For wives,

poor health decreases the likelihood of owning retirement accounts, bonds and risky

assets by 6.5, 0.2, and 4.0 percentage points. Thus, just as for singles, poor health

reduces the probability of owning each financial asset, ceteris paribus. Once again,

including additional controls for parents’ education, industry and occupation does not

alter substantially the magnitude or significance of the health effects.

       Computations based on the coefficients in Table 3b suggest that a couple in which

both spouses are in poor health is 7 percentage points less likely to hold risky assets than

a couple in which both spouses are in good health, other things being the same. A natural

question in this context is whether the cumulative impact when both spouses are ill is

different from the sum of the individual effects. To investigate this issue, we augment

each equation with an interaction between the husband’s and wife’s health variables. It

turns out that these interactions are not significant for any of the assets (results not shown

here), so that the joint effect when both spouses are in poor health is approximately equal

to the sum of the individual spouses’ effects.

       We now discuss very briefly the coefficients on the other variables in Tables 3a

and 3b. The findings are broadly consistent with those from previous studies. For

example, the probability of owning each asset tends to increase with wealth and income;




                                            - 13 -
the probability of owning each asset increases with age; the probability of owning risky

assets increases substantially with education; and blacks are much less likely to own

risky assets than non-blacks. Single females are less likely to hold risky assets and

retirement funds than single males, though there are no significant gender differences for

the other assets. In results not reported here, we allow the health effects of singles to

vary by gender by including an interaction between sex and health status. However, this

interaction term is not significant for any of the assets.

4.3 Mechanisms for Health Effects

        Taken together, Tables 3a and 3b indicate that health status exerts important

effects on portfolio choice. For both single and married households, poor health is

associated with a lower probability of owning each financial asset. As noted in the

introduction, there are various mechanisms through which health might affect portfolio

choice. In this section we examine several of these mechanisms.

4.3.1 Risk aversion

        As already noted, theory suggests that an investor’s risk aversion is an important

determinant of portfolio allocation. Respondents who become sick may become less (or

possibly more) risk averse than previously. The HRS asks respondents a question that is

designed to provide information about their attitudes toward risk--whether they would

take a job that would double their income with a 50 percent chance and cut it in half with

a 50 percent chance. To investigate whether health effects might operate through impacts

on risk aversion, we define the dichotomous variable risk taker, which takes the value of

one if the individual answers affirmatively to the question, and zero otherwise. The

results when we augment our basic model with this variable are in the first panels of




                                             - 14 -
Tables 4a and 4b. (This question is asked only in the first wave of the survey, so only

data from that year are used to estimate this variant of the model. The same applies to the

questions relating to planning horizon and bequest motives discussed below.) The

results indicate that more risk loving individuals are more likely to have risky assets

(although not all the point estimates are statistically significant). While this finding is

perfectly intuitive, including this self-reported risk aversion measure does not affect the

estimated health coefficients substantially, for either singles or married couples.19 Hence,

health does not appear to affect portfolio choices by affecting attitudes toward risk.

4.3.2 Planning horizon

         The HRS asks, “In deciding how much of their (family) income to spend or save,

people are likely to think about different financial planning periods. In planning your

(family’s) saving and spending, which of the time periods listed ...is most important to

you [and your (husband/wife...)]?” The possible responses are: “next few months,”

“next year,” “next few years,” “next 5-10 years,” and “more than 10 years.” We create

the dichotomous variable plan1 which takes a value of one if the first response was given

and zero otherwise, plan2 if the second response was given, and so on. If poor health

affects portfolio choices by changing people’s time horizons, then when we include these

dichotomous variables, the health coefficient should become less important. The second

panels of Tables 4a and 4b show the results when we augment the original specifications

with the plan variables. The results indicate that households with longer time horizons

are more likely to have some of each type of asset, although the relationship is not


19
  Because these models are estimated using only the first year of the panel, the results are not directly
comparable to those in Table 3a. Our assessment that the health coefficients do not change much is based
on a comparison to the canonical model estimated using only the first wave, which is not reported here to
conserve space.


                                                  - 15 -
monotonic. However, including these variables in the model does not materially affect

the health coefficients.       Thus, there is little evidence that the results are driven by the

fact that some households are more forward-looking than others.

         The notion that planning horizons might be related to health raises the issue of

life expectancy. The portfolios of unhealthy and healthy people may differ because

unhealthy people do not expect to live as long. The HRS asks respondents to rate their

chances of living to the age of 85 on a scale of one to ten. In results not reported here, we

included this variable in our basic models, and found that one’s perceived chance of

living to 85 is not strongly related to asset allocation. Further, the health effects are about

the same as in the basic model.20

4.3.3 Bequest Motives

         In the same spirit, if an individual has a bequest motive, this may, in effect,

extend his time horizon. The HRS asks individuals whether they intend to leave a sizable

bequest to their heirs. The five possible answers to this question are “definitely”,

“probably”, “possibly”, “probably not” and “definitely not”. We create a set of

dichotomous variables on the basis of the responses and include it in the model.                     As

indicated in the fourth panels of Tables 4a and 4b, the strength of the bequest motive is

significantly related to the probability of ownership of financial assets, but it has no

substantive impact on the coefficients on the health variables.




20
  A person’s subjective probability of living a long time may depend on how optimistic he or she is. This
raises another possibility--our results are driven by the fact that optimistic people buy risky assets and say
they feel healthy. The HRS does ask respondents some questions that indirectly relate to their degree of
optimism. In particular, the individuals were asked to rate the likelihood that the following would occur
during the remainder of their lifetimes: double-digit inflation, major depression, Social Security becoming
less generous, and housing prices rising faster than inflation.. These variables had no impact on portfolio



                                                    - 16 -
4.3.4 Health Insurance

         Another possibility is that bad health leads to large medical expenses, which

induce changes in the portfolio. If this were the case, we would expect the impact of

health to depend on health insurance status. To investigate this possibility, we created a

dichotomous variable taking a value of one if the household is insured and zero

otherwise, and included it in the basic models. The results, reported in the fourth panels

of Tables 4a and 4b, provide little evidence that the relationship between health and

portfolio choice depends on the availability of health insurance. In the same spirit, we

augmented the basic models with out-of-pocket medical expenditures (including

prescription drug payments). In results not reported here, again we find no effect on the

portfolio.

4.3.5 Discussion

We have examined a number of possible channels through which health might affect

portfolio decisions. None of them does a very good job at explaining the strong

relationship between health and the probability of owning particular classes of assets.

One possibility is that the various attitudinal measures are not good proxies for

individuals’ true underlying risk preferences, planning horizons, or bequest motives.

Alternatively, some entirely different mechanisms might be at work. For example, health

status may affect expectations of future income and hence permanent income, which in

turn influences investment decisions. This observation is potentially troubling because to

the extent wealth is measured with error, health might simply be a proxy for unobserved

wealth. While our data do not allow us to investigate this possibility directly, when we


composition or the coefficient on health. To the extent that these expectational variables proxy for
optimism, this suggests that optimism is not driving our results.


                                                   - 17 -
estimated our basic models leaving out wealth altogether, we found that the health effects

were similar both in magnitude and statistical significance. This implies that our

estimated health effect is not merely an artifact of the correlation between health and

wealth. We believe that this observation, together with the results in Table 4 and our

discussion of “third variables” in Table 3, goes a long way in establishing that there is a

robust relationship between health status and portfolio choice, though the channels

through which it operates are not entirely clear.



5 Portfolio Shares

5.1 Estimation Issues

        Our next step is to estimate how the shares of the four asset categories that

comprise financial wealth depend on health status. The main statistical issue arises from

the fact that portfolio shares are bounded by zero and one. Investigators have used a

variety of econometric approaches. Heaton and Lucas [2000] discard from their sample

individuals whose stock holdings fall below a certain floor and use ordinary least squares

estimation. Bertaut and Starr-McCluer [2002] utilize Heckman’s [1979] selectivity bias

correction to account for the fact that many of the portfolio shares are zeroes. Poterba

and Samwick [1999] and Edwards [2002] use a tobit estimator. While each approach has

its advantages and disadvantages, we choose the tobit model with truncation at zero.21 As

before, we pool data from the four waves and estimate the model using random effects,

including a year effect for each wave.



21
  Poterba and Samwick [1999] and Edwards [2002] employ a two-limit tobit estimator, with truncation at
zero and one. However, in our data, none of the assets has a substantial concentration of the portfolio
shares at unity, so we use the simpler one-limit version.


                                                 - 18 -
         It is difficult to find a compelling reason to use a set of covariates different from

that in the ownership equations so, following the usual practice, we use the same

variables as in Table 3. A technical point arises in this context. When a set of share

equations with the same right hand variables is estimated by ordinary least squares, the

predicted shares are constrained to add to one, implying that the predicted marginal

effects for any given covariate are constrained to sum to zero. The tobit estimator does

not automatically impose this constraint. While it is possible to constrain the coefficients

in this way, the process is cumbersome.22 It turns out that, as a practical matter, in our

data the implied marginal effects come close to summing to zero, so we simply present

unconstrained estimates.23

5.2 Basic Results

         Following the tack we took with the ownership probabilities, we estimate the

share equations separately for singles and married couples. The tobit results are

presented in Tables 5a and 5b, respectively. Once again, the first column for each asset is

the canonical specification and the second column includes controls for occupational

history and parents’ education. Consider first the health effects for the single individuals.

The results indicate that poor health increases the proportion of financial wealth held in

safe assets and decreases the proportion held in the other three asset categories. Using

the coefficients in the tables, we can compute the marginal effects of poor health on

portfolio shares. The specifications in the first columns imply that poor health is

associated with an increase of 0.042 in the proportion held in safe assets, a decrease of


22
   See Poterba and Samwick [1999] for details. Note that Heckman’s two-step procedure does not
constrain the predicted shares to equal one.
23
   Specifically, the sum of the marginal health effects comes out to -0.034 for singles, -0.005 for married
men and –0.013 for married women.


                                                    - 19 -
0.045 held in retirement accounts, a decrease of 0.011 held in bonds, and a decrease of

0.022 held in risky assets.24 The addition of more control variables in the second

columns does not alter these results.

         The health effects for married couples are shown in Table 5b. Once again, poor

health for both husbands and wives leads to a higher concentration of safe assets and a

lower concentration of virtually all of the other asset categories (the coefficient on

husbands’ poor health in the equation for bonds is positive but insignificant).

Calculations of the marginal effects for the basic specifications indicate that poor health

of a husband is associated with an increase of 0.032 in the proportion held in safe assets,

a decrease of 0.030 held in retirement accounts, an increase of 0.003 held in bonds and a

decrease of 0.01 held in risky assets. The analogous numbers associated with a wife

being in poor health are 0.029, -0.014, -0.007, and -0.021. In the second set of columns

where we include controls for parents’ education, industry and occupation, the results are

similar. The basic conclusion is that health is a strong predictor of how a household

allocates its financial wealth to different types of assets. Specifically, poor health is

associated with less risky portfolios.

5.3 Mechanisms for Health Effects

         As in the case of ownership probabilities, we next explore possible channels

through which health might affect portfolio shares. Following the tack in Tables 4a and

4b, we incorporate risk preferences, planning horizon, bequest motives, and health

insurance into the basic model. The results are presented in Tables 6a and 6b for singles

and couples, respectively. Table 6a shows that, in some cases, the additional variables


24
  As discussed earlier, the tobit estimator does not constrain the shares to sum to one, which explains the
fact that the marginal effects do not sum to zero.


                                                   - 20 -
are systematically related to the allocation of financial wealth. For example, from the

first panel, individuals who say that they would be willing to take a job with riskier

wages hold larger shares of their portfolios in risky assets and smaller shares in safe

assets. Likewise, those with longer planning horizons tend to devote a smaller share of

their portfolios to safe assets and a larger share in all other types of assets. Importantly,

however, the inclusion of none of these variables significantly alters the coefficients on

the health status variable.25 The results for married couples in Table 6b are similar.

Hence, as is the case for ownership probabilities, none of these variables sheds much

light on the channels through which health affects portfolio shares. However, an

intriguing hypothesis is suggested by the theoretical model of Bodie, Merton and

Samuelson (BMS) [1992], which posits that individuals vary their labor supply to

compensate for the variability in investment returns. BMS view this as an explanation

for the fact that older people tend to hold safer portfolios--the ability to compensate ex

post for low returns decreases with age. But when an individual is sick, his or her ability

to adjust labor supply is similarly diminished; the BMS logic suggests that this, too,

should induce a movement toward safer assets, just as our empirical findings suggest.



6. Summary and Conclusions

         This paper has documented the existence of a strong relationship between health

status and portfolio decisions. Even after controlling for the level of total net worth,

household income, and a variety of socio-demographic characteristics, poor health

decreases the probabilities of owning retirement accounts, bonds, and risky assets.


25
   Recall that the models with risk preferences, planning horizons and bequests are estimated only for the
first wave, so that the health coefficients are not directly comparable to those in Tables 5a and 5b.


                                                   - 21 -
Further, those in poor health tend to have relatively safe portfolios -- compared to

households that are in good health, the proportion of wealth held in safe assets is higher,

while the proportion held in all other asset categories is lower. We find no evidence that

the health effects are driven by some third variable that simultaneously influences both

health status and financial decision-making.

       Although the results suggest that health is an important determinant of portfolio

allocation, it is not clear through what channels the effect operates. We explored several

possibilities, including risk preferences, bequest motives, planning horizons, and health

insurance. However, the inclusion of such variables has very little impact on the

magnitude of the health effect. Perhaps the survey responses do not adequately represent

individuals’ underlying attitudes, or there are other reasons why health affects household

portfolio decisions. Exploring alternative mechanisms through which health might affect

portfolio choice is an important avenue for future research. We view the notion that poor

health reduces the household’s ability to increase labor supply to compensate for bad

portfolio performance as particularly promising in this context. In any case, the results in

this paper suggest that there are potentially important linkages between the health care

sector and financial markets. One can imagine, for example, that improvements in

medical technology that improve health status will induce changes in portfolio holdings.

This observation could be particularly relevant in assessing the financial consequences of

the aging of the baby boomers.

Notes: All regressions include controls for age, education, race, sex, household income, total net worth, the
presence of children and a constant term as in Table 3a. The models that include health insurance information
are random-effects probits using 4 waves of data and including time effects, while all other models are cross-
section regressions using wave 1 data (since these questions are not asked in other waves). Omitted category
for planning horizon is "a few months". Omitted category for bequest motive is "definitely not". Standard errors
are in parentheses.

Notes: All regressions include controls for age, education, race, sex, household income, total net worth
and the presence of children as in Table 5a. The models that include health insurance information are
random-effects tobits using 4 waves of data and including year effects, while all other models are cross-
section regressions using wave 1 data (since these questions are not asked in other waves). Tobit
regressions are left-censored at zero. Omitted category for planning horizon is "next few months".
Omitted category for bequest motive is "definitely not". Standard errors are in parentheses.

Notes: All regressions include controls for age, education, race, sex, household income, total net worth and
the presence of children as in Table 4b. The models that include health insurance information are random-
effects tobits using 4 waves of data, while all other models are cross-section regressions using wave 1 data
(since these questions are not asked in other waves). Tobit regressions are left-censored at zero. Omitted
category for planning horizon is "a few months". Omitted category for bequest motive is "definitely not".
Standard errors are in parentheses.
