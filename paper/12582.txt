A nationally representative sample of respondents estimated their fatality risks from four types of natural
disasters, and indicated whether they favored governmental disaster relief. For all hazards, including
auto accident risks, most respondents assessed their risks as being below average, with one-third assessing
them as average. Individuals from high-risk states, or with experience with disasters, estimate risks
higher, though by less than reasonable calculations require. Four-fifths of our respondents favor government
relief for disaster victims, but only one-third do for victims in high-risk areas. Individuals who perceive
themselves at higher risk are more supportive of government assistance.

The United States has experienced its greatest natural and man-made disasters in recent

years. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina led to the largest level of insured losses to property in

the history of the United States. The 9/11/2001 attack on the World Trade Center, the

Pentagon, and four airliners was by far the most devastating terrorism attack ever on the

nation. Each event seared the nation’s psyche.

        How people perceive and respond to these disasters is of fundamental interest. To

the extent that losses can be reduced through self-protection or self-insurance, people’s

risk beliefs will affect the extent to which they will undertake measures to reduce their

losses. Natural disasters and other “acts of God” are not totally unanticipated and

unpreventable. Those who build a beachfront home in a hurricane zone are exposed to

much greater risk of hurricane damage than those who live inland. 1 Protection against

terrorism risks is less subject to individual control, though maintaining an adequate life

insurance policy can reduce the economic deprivation to one’s survivors. Following the

9/11 terrorism attack and recent natural disasters, the government made tremendous

efforts to aid and rebuild. Public perceptions of the desirability of such assistance will

govern the degree of public support for post-disaster aid.

        This paper reports on evidence from an original national survey that focused on

the public’s perception of natural disaster and terrorism risks and the degree of support

for different policy interventions. How do people perceive the risks of disasters? Do




1
 In a recent statement, ten climate experts who disagree about global warming observed that “‘the main
hurricane problem facing the United States’…is an ongoing ‘lemming-like march to the sea’ in the form of
unabated coastal development in vulnerable places, and in the lack of changes in government policies and
corporate and individual behavior that are driving the trend” (Revkin 2006).




                                                                                                       3
these perceptions vary in a plausible manner with actual risk levels based on information

gleaned from their geographic location and personal experience?

       What types of government relief policies do people favor, and in what

circumstances? What is the source of such preferences? Are they governed by self-

interest with a concern for precedent, implying that people at higher risk would be more

generous? Or does compassion play the predominant role? We use the term compassion,

rather than altruism, when individuals are willing to assist others who have suffered

significant losses, because the preference is more circumscribed than merely helping

those who are worse off, perhaps because of weak job skills. And where people are

compassionate, is there a concern for moral hazard, implying that their willingness to

help would be tempered by an efficiency consideration, namely not to provide an

incentive to locate in high-risk areas? Differences in the extent to which the public

supports relief efforts of different kinds in New Orleans have led to months in which such

efforts ground to a halt due to a lack of policy clarity on which areas of the city should be

rebuilt and which should not. Rebuilding the high-risk areas is inefficient because it

generates the prospect of either excess expenditures on assets that need protection, or

substantial future expected losses accompanied by inevitable pressures for continued

bailouts at the public’s expense. Failure to rebuild these areas is a politically charged

issue primarily because the poor, black segments of the New Orleans populations are

concentrated in areas at greater risk, which produces lower real estate values and more

affordable living.

       To explore the public’s views on such risks and different relief policies, we

designed and administered a major national survey. Section 1 briefly summarizes the




                                                                                            4
nationally representative sample used for our survey and describes the survey instrument.

Our results provide a unique, detailed perspective on disaster risks. We compare natural

disasters with both automobile accident risks and terrorism risks to put our results on

natural disasters in perspective. Section 2 examines respondents’ beliefs about different

risks and the determinants of these risk beliefs. We find that most people rate themselves

as being of average or below-average risk irrespective of the risk considered. There are,

however, important differences in risk beliefs across respondents and types of risk.

Section 3 analyzes respondents’ beliefs about how government should respond to these

hazards. As one might expect, we find evidence of considerable self-interest, with people

living in high natural disaster risk or terrorism risk areas being more supportive of aid for

the hazards to which they are exposed. However, there is also evidence of tremendous

compassion, though where relevant restrained by moral hazard concerns.



1. Background Information on the Survey

       We designed and commissioned a survey consisting of a series of questions

regarding respondents’ risk beliefs and their attitudes toward various policy responses to

disasters. Detailed personal characteristic and background questions were also included,

to serve as covariates in our empirical analysis. The text of many of these survey

questions is reported below in conjunction with the pertinent empirical results.

       Our data were secured using a Web-based survey administered to a sample from

the Knowledge Networks (KN) panel. We pre-tested the survey in March 2006,

administering it to over 100 subjects. This pre-test employed identical questions to those

analyzed in this paper. This enables an important contrast, since in early April 2006,




                                                                                             5
shortly after the pre-test was completed and before our main test, major tornadoes hit the

Southeast, particularly the Tennessee area.2 The final survey was administered April 11

to April 25, 2006 following these tornadoes.

        Both the pretest and the final survey were administered by KN to a nationally

representative sample of respondents age 18 and older. Respondents took the survey on

their computer or Web TV. The survey takes about 20 minutes. The completion rate for

the survey was 79 percent. While 1,135 surveys were at least partially completed, we

focus on the 1,077 observations for which we have complete data on all variables of

interest. Appendix Tables A.1 and A.2 summarize the sample characteristics and

variable means and standard deviations.

        The sample for the final survey mirrored the national adult population. For

concreteness, we sometimes compare the weighted completed interviews and the Current

Population Survey benchmarks for February 2006. 3 Our sample divides evenly between

men and women, a negligible 0.1 percent difference from the national average. Some of

the age categories equal the national fractions; the largest difference is 0.2 percent for

those age 18-29 and those 30-44. The racial breakdowns for blacks, whites, and

Hispanics differ by no more than 0.1 percent from the national statistics. Each of the

education categories likewise has a discrepancy of at most 0.1 percent from the national

figures. The regional breakdowns are often identical to the national average, with the

largest difference being that the sample has 0.2 percent fewer respondents from the

Tornadoes, Tennessee is Struck by More.” New York Times, 9 April, Final Edition.

  The sample is weighted to account for some minor deviations from an equal probability design. For
example, the panel never includes more than one adult per household and includes only half of the potential
panel participants contacted who had telephone numbers but for which KN could not find an address. The
weighted completed interviews are very similar to the unweighted numbers—47.4 percent males
unweighted and 48.1 percent males weighted.


                                                                                                         6
Midwest. In short, the sample tracks the national population breakdowns remarkably

well. It is not a convenience sample but a true, nationally representative sample that

meets the highest standards of representativeness.



2. Risk Beliefs for Natural Disasters and Other Risks

         We start by exploring how people assess their risks from natural disasters. In

doing so, we address comparable risk belief questions for auto accident risks and

terrorism risks. These comparisons help put the natural disaster risks in perspective.

Auto accident risks are precisely estimated, well-known hazards that have been the

subject of numerous previous analyses. Indeed, auto accident risks often are the anchor

given to respondents in risk belief surveys so that they can think sensibly about other

risks in the survey. 4 Terrorism risks provide a different basis of comparison with natural

disasters because, like natural disasters, they too tend to be dramatic, low-probability

events that are highly publicized. 5 Unlike auto accident risks, they are poorly

understood, causal mechanisms for them are widely debated, and risk assessments for

them are highly diffuse. Moreover, whereas auto accident risk levels are influenced

considerably by personal safety-related behavior, such as driving speed and drunk

driving, terrorism risks tend to be beyond individual control. Natural disaster risks

involve both some exogenous nature-related risk components as well as aspects of

personal choice, such as picking an at-risk location.

         Given our focus on three classes of risks of quite disparate magnitude and

precision, the challenge in designing the survey was to develop risk belief questions that

 There is a considerable literature on perception and responses to low probability events. For a review see
Camerer and Kunreuther (1989) and Kunreuther and Pauly (2004).


                                                                                                          7
could be compared across these different hazards. While quantitative risk questions seem

ideal, respondents often have difficulty in assessing probabilities as small as the risks of

being killed by terrorists. For example, even if the terrorism attacks of 2001 were to be

repeated annually, the fatality risk would be under 1/100,000 per year for a random

citizen. The annual fatality risks from natural disasters are much lower.



         2.1 Risk benchmarks, averages and medians, personal experience

         Even order of magnitude changes in current risk levels would be hard for most

respondents to assess, i.e., to say whether their personal risk was one in ten thousand, or

one in one million, or one in ten million or one hundred million. Accordingly, we asked

respondents to compare their risk level from a danger to the average risk level of others. 6

         More specifically, the risk belief questions for auto accident risks, natural disaster

risks, and terrorism risks took a common form. The question first provided information

that would enable respondents to assess the average risk across the population. The

question then asked respondents whether they considered their own risk to be above

average, average, or below average. The specific text of these questions was as follows:

         Many of the following questions will ask you to compare programs that reduce
         auto accident risks and other types of hazards. Each year just under 40,000 people
         in vehicles die in traffic accidents in the United States. On the average day about
         100 people die due to traffic accidents. These risks are isolated deaths. Even for
         major accidents the number of people killed in a particular accident is not great.
         How would you rate your risk compared to the average driver?

                                                   I have an average fatality risk….................... 1
                                                   I have an above-average fatality risk............. 2

6
  One approach to eliciting terrorism risk assessments that was used in Viscusi and Zeckhauser (2003) was
to ask the total number of people who would be killed in the U.S. next year in terrorism attacks. But such
questions would be influenced by anchoring effects in the current survey, which gives respondents
information on the average number of deaths from each cause. Moreover, the risks vary by region, and the
regional variation is of substantial interest and will not be reflected in the national estimates of fatalities.


                                                                                                               8
                                           I have a below-average fatality risk............... 3


       In contrast, natural disasters kill large numbers of people at the same time and are
       major national catastrophes. Hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and earthquakes are
       major types of disasters. Hurricane Katrina killed over 1,000 people, and every
       year natural disasters kill over 100 people on average. How would you rate your
       risk of being killed by a natural disaster?

                                           I have an average fatality risk……................ 1
                                           I have an above-average fatality risk............. 2
                                           I have a below-average fatality risk............... 3

       Natural disasters aren’t the only risks that kill many people at the same time.
       Attacks by international terrorists also can cause a catastrophic number of deaths.
       The 9/11 terrorist attack killed 2,976 people. How would your risk from terrorists
       compare to the average American’s?

                                           I have an average fatality risk.......................... 1
                                           I have an above-average fatality risk............... 2
                                           I have a below-average fatality risk……......... 3



       One danger arising from asking for comparisons with “average Americans” is that

mathematically oriented respondents might recognize that risk levels are in fact highly

skewed, with a small percent of the population at substantially elevated risk. Thus, 98%

of the population may indeed be at below-average risk of a fatality from our four types of

natural disasters, which tend to strike specific geographic areas. The real contrast one

might have wished was with the American at median risk. But we recognized that asking

that question would have confused most of our respondents. Moreover, the median risk

value for the risks in this survey is zero or quite close to it, so that the median American

reference point would not have been informative. Some respondents may have used at

least some element of “median reasoning” when responding to our average question. We

follow in a long tradition in asking about risk levels relative to the average.




                                                                                                     9
        Our principal purpose in using our risk questions is to establish a comparative risk

rating across different types of risk, thus putting the natural disaster risk beliefs into a

more general risk perception context.

        Auto accident risk questions asked in relative terms have become a staple in the

optimism bias literature. Rethans (1979) first showed that the overwhelming majority of

drivers considered themselves to face average or below-average risk. Some might

interpret this result as implying that people are overoptimistic and underestimate the risk.

However, it may be that due to the skewed nature of the risk distribution across the

population, most people correctly conclude that they are below average in risk. Our

questions, which provide people with numbers of deaths in the total population, may spur

them to think in terms of means rather than medians. If this is true for automobiles, it is

likely true for the other risks included in the survey.

        For a variety of reasons, most respondents will view themselves as facing average

or below-average risks. Few people may be willing to find fault with themselves and rate

themselves as bad drivers. Some respondents also select “average” as their response to

all such comparative questions posed in a complicated survey to move quickly to

complete the survey. 7 To the extent that respondents adopt “average” as their time-

minimizing response to taking our survey, that strategy should affect all risk belief

questions equivalently. Some analysts have also hypothesized that the below-average

fatality risk responses to auto accident risk questions may reflect the degree to which

people believe, perhaps incorrectly, that they can exercise control over the risk. It should

also be noted that even when people rate themselves as being of below-average risk or

7
  Viscusi (2002) presents survey evidence indicating that some respondents consistently rate themselves as
being average on many disparate dimensions—stress level, income, degree of worry, and a variety of health
risks.


                                                                                                       10
average risk, survey evidence on consumer behavior indicates that people’s actual cost-

risk tradeoff decisions do not reflect underestimation of the risk (Viscusi and Magat,

1987).

           The reference points indicating fatality experience for each of the questions were

chosen to be informative, but the contents are not exactly parallel because of the unique

nature of the 9/11 attack. The survey apprises respondents of the number of motor-

vehicle deaths per year and per day, the number of people killed by Hurricane Katrina

and the average number killed annually by natural disasters, and the total number of

deaths from the 9/11 terrorist attack.

           Table 1 reports the distribution of responses for each of these risks. Consistent

with the literature, averaging across the three risk categories, the great majority of

respondents—92.4 percent—believe that they face average or below-average fatality

risks. 8 These percentages vary only a modest amount across the risk categories—from

91.5 percent for automobile hazards to 93.5 percent for natural disasters, with terrorism

risks in between at 92 percent. Just over half of all respondents believe that they face

below-average risks, and 41.3 percent believe they face average risks. Natural disaster

risks and terrorism risks involve little personal control but nevertheless have a higher

percentage of respondents rating themselves as being of below-average risk. These

patterns are inconsistent with the common explanation that risk belief patterns such as

those exhibited in the auto accident context are due to overestimation of the degree of

personal control and the accompanying unwillingness to find fault with one’s own

driving skills.



8
    See Weinstein and Klein (1996) for similar “optimistic” results.


                                                                                               11
            It is quite reasonable that the majority of respondents believe they face below-

average fatality risks from natural disasters and terrorism attacks. If they recognize that

risk levels are skewed, with a few people at substantially elevated risk. Most people do

not live in earthquake zones, exposed beachfront areas in the Southeast, or tornado

corridors. Their risks will be much lower than the quite substantial risks faced by the

small fraction of people living in such high-risk locales. Similarly, risks from terrorist

attacks are presumably quite low for most of the United States, notwithstanding the

Department of Homeland Security’s ill-considered ranking that identifies more terrorism

targets in Indiana than in New York. 9



            2.2 Personal experience and risk beliefs

            Personal experience with a natural disaster may affect individual risk beliefs.

From the standpoint of rational Bayesian learning, one would expect assessed risks to rise

after experiencing a natural disaster. The Availability Heuristic may also be at work,

although the influences of rational and irrational influences are difficult to disentangle.10

The survey consequently included questions to ascertain whether the respondent had

experienced a hurricane, flood, earthquake or tornado. Assuming they had not moved a

substantial distance, personal experience should greatly increase people’s current risk

estimates, as we show below.

            Table 2 presents the cross tabulation of these disaster experiences with the

corresponding risk beliefs. Notably, for these different categories of disasters from 282

to 321 people in the sample, or just under one-third, had experienced each of these risks.

     See Tversky and Kahneman (1974) for discussion of the Availability Heuristic.


                                                                                                         12
Table 2 organizes the data with information on those who did not experience the disaster

in the first two columns and information on those who experienced the disaster in the

final two columns. The distribution of the influence of these events differs somewhat by

the particular disaster. Experiencing a hurricane or a tornado decreases the percentage

who rate their risks below average by about 10 percent, but has a minimal effect on flood

and earthquake perceptions. For each risk, having experience with it shifts perceived risk

upwards.

         We conducted Wilcoxen rank sum tests using the logical ordering below-average,

then average, and then above-average. These tests yield z-statistics of 3.473 for having

experienced a hurricane and 2.964 for having experienced a tornado. The comparable

differences for having experienced a flood (z = 0.869) or an earthquake (z = 0.708) are

not statistically significant. Somewhat strikingly, even after experiencing any of these

disasters the percentage who rate their risks as being above average ranges from only 7.8

percent to 10.6 percent.

         Personal information is probably a more telling indicator of risk than state of

residence, since there is so much interstate variability in risk level. Nevertheless,

identifying the high-risk states proves very telling. We identify the four high hurricane

risk states: Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, 11 which between them hold over

13 percent of respondents in our sample. The risk belief summary in Table 3 indicates

that living in a hurricane state substantially alters risk beliefs. Based on the Wilcoxen

rank sum test, these differences are highly significant (z = 5.977). The percentage of

people who view the fatality risk as being below-average is 24 percent lower, where this

                                                                                                            13
difference is distributed fairly evenly between the two remaining categories. The fact

that not everybody in these states perceives an elevated risk is also not surprising because

inland areas in, for example, Dallas, Texas are at much lower risk than the Texas average.



       2.3 The distribution of risk across states, Lorenz curves, and rational updates

       Our results show that individuals in higher risk states are more likely to place

themselves in a higher risk category. But what would rational calculation show? To

investigate this question, we looked at fatalities from each of our four categories of

natural disasters over the past 50 years. We then computed fatalities per capita for each

state, and produced what in effect is a Lorenz Curve for each type of disaster, and for

automobile fatalities. The data for earthquakes and tornadoes is from 1950-1994, for

autos from 1994-2004, and for floods from 1995-2004. That is, for each source of

fatalities, we computed what percent of the population is required to produce what

percent of the fatalities. Our per capita calculations used the 2000 census, which is

obviously a gross simplification, since the national population has grown substantially.

Counterbalancing this, fatalities per capita have mostly decreased over this period. The

Lorenz curves for these five types of disasters are shown in Figure 1. Note that the

curves for the natural disasters are highly bowed, implying that a small fraction of the

population accounts for a large percentage of the fatalities, though some are much more

bowed than others. Indeed, to account for half of the fatalities, you need the following

1%, (4) tornadoes, 9%, and (5) auto accidents, 35%.

Given such skewed risk levels for natural disaster fatalities across states, we would

expect individuals to update probabilities significantly, and raise their posterior risk

assessments, if they had personal experience with a disaster. (The updating would be

more intense if we computed results over smaller geographic areas.)

       In short, although people with experiences with natural disasters update their risk

levels, it is likely that they do not do so sufficiently, as seen in Table 2. Tversky and

Kahneman (1974) refer to the tendency to update insufficiently as anchoring. Zeckhauser

(1996, p. 115), specifically addressing catastrophes, notes that: “Neither humans nor

society deal effectively with information, particularly probabilistic information.”



       2.4 Statistical results on risk beliefs




                                                                                            15
       To explore the determinants of beliefs about natural disaster fatality risks, we

explore ordered probit results for the above-average, average, and below-average risk

categories. We report regressions based on the Knowledge Networks sampling weights,

but the results are almost identical to the unweighted results because the sample closely

mirrors the U.S. population. The ordered probit coefficients have been transformed to

reflect the marginal influence of each variable.

       Table 4 reports five sets of regression estimates; the differences arise because

different sets of region variables and disaster experience variables are included. The

continuous variables included in all equations are Age (in years) and Years of education.

The remaining variables in one or more equations are all 0-1 dummy variables for

Female; Black, non-Hispanic; Other/multiple race, non-Hispanic; Hispanic, all races;

Mid-Atlantic region, East-North-Central region, West-North Central region, South

Atlantic region, East-South Central region, West-South Central region, Mountain region,

Pacific region, Metropolitan residence, Household income (in tens of thousands of

dollars); Household income, top category; Republican, Current smoker, Experienced

natural disaster, Experienced hurricane, Experienced flood, Experienced earthquake,

Experienced tornado, Hurricane state, and Hurricane state interacted with Experienced

hurricane. The excluded categories in the regressions are male, white/non-Hispanic, and

New England.

       The equations we examined appear in their respective columns. Equation 1

includes the full set of demographic variables and whether the respondent has

experienced a natural disaster. Quite reasonably, people in the high-tornado-risk states in

the West-North Central region, the high-hurricane-risk states of the South Atlantic, East-




                                                                                          16
South Central, and West-South Central regions, and the high-earthquake-risk states of the

Pacific region perceive themselves as being at greater risk of suffering from these

particular disasters. 12 Better-educated people rate their risks as being lower, which may

reflect their understanding that risk is skewed, but this is a matter worthy of further study.

Republicans also assess risks as being lower. The lower risk beliefs held by well-

educated and Republican respondents suggests that they may have less of a personal

stake in disaster relief efforts. There is suggestive evidence about this below. As

expected, having experienced a natural disaster has a powerful positive effect on risk

beliefs.

           Equation 2 distinguishes the effect of natural disaster experiences by the

particular type of disaster. The combined disaster experience variable in equation 1 had a

significant positive effect on risk beliefs for natural disasters in general. Looking at the

risks individually, experiencing a tornado or a hurricane boosts risk beliefs, but

experiencing a flood or an earthquake is not influential. 13 These multivariate results

consequently mirror the mean patterns in Table 2.

           Equations 3-5 include variables indicating whether the respondent lives in a

hurricane state, and an interaction of hurricane state residence with hurricane experience.

They omit the regional variables that may substantially capture the influence of the

hurricane state variable. The results are quite consistent across these three specifications.

One effect is consistently strong and significant, namely the interactive influence of

hurricane state and having experienced a hurricane. Due to the strong interrelationship of
12
   The listing of the states corresponding to these categories appears in the Appendix. New England is the
excluded regional category.
13
   Looking at Figure 1, the flood result is not too surprising, since it is the least skewed of the four natural
disasters. Earthquakes are the most skewed of our risks. However, a recent experience has two
counterbalancing effects. It updates and raises the long-term risk level. But it lowers the immediate risk,
since pressure has been released in the fault.


                                                                                                              17
these variables, it may be that they are influential individually, but the most powerful

effect is accounted for by the interaction, perhaps because one’s own experience is

reinforced by learning of experiences with other hurricanes striking nearby.

         The final survey results that form the basis of the estimates reported thus far were

estimated using a sample from mid-April 2006. However, we have an additional sample

of 115 pre-test respondents, queried just before a series of fatal tornadoes hit the

Southeast in early April 2006. Given the power of the Availability Heuristic and

Bayesian learning, one would expect that the effect of the variable for having experienced

a tornado would be greater for the sample polled after the tornadoes than before. In

ordered probit regressions, not reported, we included an interaction between the tornado

experience variable and whether the sample was polled after the tornado. There was a

marked upward shift in the tornado experience coefficient in the post-tornadoes sample. 14

         People will likely do a worse job estimating their risks from terrorism than from

natural disasters. People in different regions presumably are also less able to distinguish

differences in risk, because of the dearth and imprecision of knowledge about the

distribution of terrorism risk. To be sure, major cities appear to be prominent terrorism

targets, which may sufficiently skew risks so that everyone else is at below–average risk.

But are residents of Colorado at greater or lower risk of a terrorism attack than residents

of Georgia?

         The ordered probit estimates reported in Table 5 show that respondents’ risk

beliefs are diffuse for terrorism risks. Few of the demographic variables are statistically

significant, though older respondents view themselves as at lower risk, and non-Hispanic


14
  More specifically, the interaction variable had a coefficient of 0.468 with a standard error of 0.234, while
the experienced tornado variable remained statistically insignificant.


                                                                                                           18
blacks view themselves as at higher risk. Residence in a metropolitan area has a

powerful positive influence, consistent with the past pattern of terrorism attacks in the

United States and abroad. This result is also reminiscent of the finding by Fischhoff et al.

(2003) that proximity to the World Trade Center increases terrorism risk beliefs since

terror risk judgments often involve people imagining a repetition of the 9/11 experience.

The effect of living in a metropolitan area is equivalent in magnitude to the effect of

being a frequent flyer, namely taking more than 6 plane trips per year. 15

         The risk belief results for both natural hazards and terrorism risks in most respects

are quite sensible in direction, but insufficient in magnitude. People who live in highly

vulnerable areas should assess greater risks, and they do. People who have experienced

natural disasters should assess greater risks, as they do with hurricanes and tornadoes,

though not floods. Nevertheless, the level at which they assess this risk is well below

what our Bayesian calculations indicate is reasonable. 16 And the much more frequent

and geographically concentrated natural hazards should exhibit more interpersonal

differences than terrorism risks, which are not even well understood by government

officials charged with the task of preventing terrorism attacks. And that is what we find.



3. Attitudes Toward Government Disaster Relief

         After major disasters strike, there is invariably a major infusion of both private

and government relief assistance. Some of this assistance is funded in advance through



15
   This variable is significant at the 10% level, two-sided, or 5% level one-sided test level. On a theoretical
basis one would hypothesize that more plane trips should boost the risk, making a one-sided test
appropriate.
16
   Even if everyone understood risk skewness, and was focusing on average as opposed to median, virtually
all of those without personal experience should rate themselves below average.


                                                                                                            19
contributions to subsidized flood insurance. There is also considerable post-disaster aid

for which there are no charges paid either ex ante or ex post.

       We distinguish three different possible motivations for governmental relief

efforts. First, public support for aid may be governed by individual self-interest. To the

extent that people believe that they too will be at elevated risk for catastrophic losses,

they will support disaster aid to establish a precedent. Second, people may be motivated

by pure compassion. Irrespective of why people have suffered the damages from

disasters, they may support assistance that will help restore the victims’ welfare to or

toward their pre-disaster levels. Third, support for relief efforts may stem from what we

term “efficient compassion.” Efficient compassion supports relief efforts but is less

willing to provide aid if the damage arose because of problems of moral hazard or a

failure by disaster victims to take advantage of the protections already offered by the

market. For example, people who knowingly choose to live in identified high-risk areas,

and insurance companies that fail to take avail themselves of appropriate reinsurance

opportunities, will be deemed less deserving of assistance.

       To explore these different sources of support for government relief policies, we

examined several natural disaster and terrorism contexts. The three natural disaster aid

scenarios involved recovery efforts generally, assistance to those who live in high-risk

areas, and assistance to people who return to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and

rebuild in high-risk areas. The survey text for these three questions was as follows:

       The U.S. government subsidizes insurance programs to cover property losses
       from natural disasters, and the U.S. government often provides money to help in
       the recovery efforts. Do you believe the U.S. government should provide
       subsidized insurance and compensation to victims of natural disasters such as
       hurricanes, floods, tornados, and earthquakes?




                                                                                             20
                                           Yes................................................................... 1
                                           No ................................................................... 2


       In some cases people who are victims of natural disasters have purposely chosen
       to live in a risky area. Often, these are attractive and expensive locations, such as
       along a beach or next to a river. Do you believe that the U.S. government should
       provide subsidized insurance and compensation to victims of natural disasters
       who chose to live in high-risk areas?

                                           Yes................................................................... 1
                                           No.................................................................... 2


       After disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, people rebuild houses that have been
       destroyed. In some cases these houses are rebuilt in high-risk areas, such as the
       low lying areas of New Orleans that will be vulnerable to future flooding. If
       people do rebuild in areas the U.S. government indicates are high-risk, do you
       believe the U.S. government should provide compensation if a major hurricane
       strikes New Orleans again?

                                           Yes................................................................... 1
                                           No.................................................................... 2

       The first disaster relief question pertains to general support for disaster insurance

and compensation after the major types of natural disasters. This question raised no

explicit concerns regarding moral hazard or inefficient self-insurance or self-protective

behavior. For the entire sample, 82.2 percent supported such assistance.

       The second disaster relief question raises the issue of people choosing to live in a

risky area that exposed them to a greater level of risk. Given the voluntary nature of such

risk taking, those exhibiting efficient compassion should be less willing to provide relief

in this situation. That prediction is borne out, as only 37.0 percent favor relief in this

situation, as compared to 82.2 percent in the initial case.

       The third question addresses a specific type of moral hazard situation that pertains

specifically to the rebuilding efforts in New Orleans. Unlike the previous question,




                                                                                                                21
which highlighted the possibility of providing aid to perhaps less sympathetic owners of

expensive beachfront homes, this question pertains to homeowners attempting to rebuild

their homes in the high-risk areas of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, who are for

the most part poor and have lost a lot. Compassion would suggest that aid is merited, but

such a decision would bear a strong component of inefficiency. Only a minority of

respondents—36.1 percent—were willing to support assistance to people suffering losses

in high-risk New Orleans areas following the rebuilding efforts.

       To explore how personal self-interest influences these different levels of support,

the three panels in Table 6 summarize the support for each policy by those at the three

different levels of personally assessed risk of death from natural disasters. The degree of

support rises as one moves across the columns from the below-average risk group to the

average risk group and then to the above-average risk group, showing that self-interest

does play a role. The differences across the different risk perception categories are

statistically significant in all three instances, with Wilcoxen rank sum test values of z =

2.082 for victims in general, 4.490 for victims exposed to high voluntary risks, and 2.205

for victims of the next New Orleans hurricane. While the expected pattern is borne out,

the extent of the increased support for relief from moving from the below-average risk

group to the above-average risk group is only 5.3 percent for aid to New Orleans and 6.9

percent for relief when there is no explicit moral hazard issue. The moral hazard question

exhibits the greatest influence of personal risk levels; there is a 19.7 percent upswing in

the level of support across risk levels. Apparently moral hazard is not as much of a

concern if individuals have a strong self-interest in maintaining relief efforts that will be

of benefit to them.




                                                                                            22
       To explore what personal characteristics determine the levels of support for relief

efforts, Table 7 reports a series of probit regressions on the probability of support, where

the coefficients have been transformed to reflect marginal probabilities. The first two

regression columns are for the first two relief questions and the third column is for aid to

New Orleans after the next hurricane.

       Many of the significant effects show a consistent pattern across all three relief

questions. Older respondents are less willing to support relief efforts for victims living in

high-risk areas or in New Orleans after the next hurricane, even after controlling for

household income and other background characteristics. However, age imposes no such

reluctance for the initial disaster risk question. It is only when people are knowingly

behaving in an inefficient manner that older respondents decrease their levels of support

in equations 2 and 3.

       Groups that are generally more liberal politically, namely female and non-

Hispanic black respondents, are more supportive of assistance. Women have a greater

likelihood of being willing to support government relief efforts generally, but not when

there is inefficient behavior in equations 2 and 3. Black respondents have a greater

willingness to support general relief than does the omitted category of white respondents.

Interestingly, non-Hispanic black respondents are much more likely to support relief in

all cases, even when people live in high-risk areas, as in equations 2 and 3 of Table 7. As

the New Orleans experience indicates, the residents of many of these high-risk areas tend

to be poor and, in the case of New Orleans, predominantly black. The greater

affordability of homes in areas where land values are low because of the greater risk

tends to produce racial differences. Black non-Hispanic survey respondents—




                                                                                           23
presumably sensitive to such causality and the horrific New Orleans experience—are

much more willing to support government relief efforts to continue support even though

the victim has chosen to live in a risky locale.

        The regional characteristic variables are not as influential in the aid equations as

in the earlier risk belief equations. Perhaps the impetus for relief does not vary greatly

across the United States. However, people who live in high-risk areas seem to have

greater tolerance for moral hazard in equation 2, as exemplified by the positive effects of

residing in the Pacific and West-South Central regions.

        No such regional variations are observed for equation 3 representing aid to New

Orleans. None of the broad regional groups is statistically significant at the usual levels.

In probit regressions not reported, we omit these broad regional categories and explore

whether living in a hurricane state or being a resident of Louisiana or Mississippi boosted

the levels of support for aid to New Orleans after the next hurricane. Neither of these

variables is statistically significant.

        Political orientation is a main driver of the support for relief, not just for the

efficient compassion questions, but for all the relief options. In every instance,

Republicans have a consistently lower probability of supporting the relief policies than do

Democrats and independents. After controlling for political affiliation, blacks have

higher probabilities for support; females also have higher probabilities, though not where

moral hazard is a prime factor. Presumably, these groups are more liberal than their mere

political affiliation indicates.

        The equations also included a measure of individual risk-taking behavior—the

general health risk exposure of the respondent as reflected in whether they currently




                                                                                             24
smoke cigarettes. Smokers face a considerable smoking-related mortality risk; their

probability of premature death due to smoking is 1/6 to 1/3. The smoker variable

consequently captures willingness to expose oneself to extremely large health risks.

Beyond this, the smoker variable may also reflect a tolerance for others who take risks

and are guilty of moral hazard, since smokers are frequent targets of criticism for their

own risk-taking behavior. For the two relief questions involving individual choices to

engage in risky behavior, smokers are more forgiving of decisions involving moral

hazard and are more willing to support relief. Both effects are significant at the 10

percent level. However, for Equation (1) in which moral hazard plays a minor role, there

is no significant smoker effect.

       Respondents who believe that they face a below-average disaster fatality risk.

This group is significantly less supportive of relief efforts except in Equation (1), which

pertains to the situation of efficient compassion. The moral hazard scenarios generate the

greatest negative differential support for relief among those who perceive their own

natural disaster risk to be below average.

       The terrorism component of the survey included similar questions regarding

government relief. The survey included the possibility of relief aid to victims of

terrorism. It also inquired about relief for insurance companies, which one would expect

to be much less sympathetic recipients of assistance, hence to get lower levels of support.

The specific questions were as follows:

       After the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center the U.S. government
       provided compensation to the families of the terrorism victims to make up for the
       income losses their families experienced. Do you believe that in the future the
       government should provide such compensation to U.S. victims of international
       terrorists?




                                                                                            25
                                                Yes................................................................... 1
                                                No.................................................................... 2


        Insurance companies also suffer losses after major terrorism attacks such as 9/11.
        Should the U.S. government provide insurance coverage to insurance companies
        to reduce the financial risks companies might face from major terrorist attacks?

                                                Yes................................................................... 1
                                                No.................................................................... 2

        A substantial majority, 77.1 percent of respondents, favor aid to terrorism victims.

A surprisingly high 52.1 percent favor aid to insurance companies, presumably indicating

some comprehension of market function, for example, that such relief would

predominantly flow through to insureds. 17

        Table 8 distinguishes the level of support for these two types of government

assistance as a function of the individual’s perceived personal risk of death from

terrorism. Based on the Wilcoxen rank sum tests, the willingness to support terrorism

victims (z = 3.649) or insurance companies (z = 2.590) differs significantly across the

different risk belief categories, though without consistent patterns of influence. The first

set of results for aiding victims displays no consistent pattern, whereas one would have

expected the levels of support to rise as subjective risk rises. The support for aid to

insurance companies is more responsive to individual risk beliefs, increasing from 48.6

percent for the below-average risk category to 62.8 percent for the above-average risk

category.

        As with the regression results for terrorism risk beliefs, the probit regressions for

the two terrorism-aid questions reported in Table 9 show far fewer significant effects than

the natural hazard regressions. This difference arises in part because unlike natural

17
 To determine how much of aid to insurance companies would translate to lower rates, or the ability to
make payouts given a catastrophic incident, would be a difficult calculation even for economists.


                                                                                                                     26
hazards, which are geographically concentrated in well-known areas, terrorism risks are

poorly understood. Indeed, none of the regional dummy variables is statistically

significant. Perhaps more importantly, people may feel that whereas people can choose

to live in areas not threatened by natural disasters, terrorism risks are beyond their

control, and are at least partly the responsibility of a government that failed to protect

them.

        Several of the personal characteristic variables display patterns that mirror the

natural hazard results. Older respondents are less willing to support either type of post-

terrorism relief. Non-Hispanic blacks and woman are more supportive of aiding

terrorism victims after an attack, but only women would aid insurance companies.

Better-educated respondents are less supportive of post-terrorist attack aid.

        The negative effect of the Republican variable parallels the natural disaster

results. Republicans are less supportive of aid to terrorism victims, with a coefficient that

is large absolutely, and both negative and significant. They are relatively less stingy with

insurance companies: their insurance company coefficient, though also negative, is only

one-third the value of that for victims, and statistically insignificant. Given traditional

understandings about political attitudes, and beliefs or skepticism about trickle down

processes, it is not surprising that blacks are much less likely to help insurance

companies, whereas Republicans are less likely to help victims directly.

        Of the various personal risk variables, the Current smoker variable is of greatest

interest. Smoking is by far the riskiest personal consumption activity that people engage

in on a large scale. This variable consequently provides an excellent measure of overall

attitudes toward risk-taking behavior. The Current smoker variable has an effect that




                                                                                              27
accords with prior findings about risk takers. Smokers are more supportive of aiding

victims of terrorism, just as they were often more supportive of aiding natural disaster

victims. Frequent flyers who take more than 6 plane trips per year are not more

supportive of relief, and the personal fatality risk assessments display the same

inconsistent pattern as the cross tabulations in Table 8.



4. Conclusion

This paper explored two broad questions: 1. What factors drive individuals’ beliefs about

their risks from various disasters, and how accurate are those beliefs? 2. What policies

do individuals favor for disaster relief, and how do those policies relate to their assessed

risks?

         The answer to the first question is that risk beliefs have many rational

components, but fall short of what one would expect with fully rational Bayesian

assessments of risk. Personal experience and location-related risk influence risk

assessments in the right direction, but insufficiently. These factors should have a very

powerful influence, as our Lorenz Curve for fatality risks by state shows that natural

disaster risks are highly concentrated, unlike auto fatality risks.

         For each of our four natural disasters, more than half of our respondents thought

that their fatality risk from natural disasters was below average, and another roughly

thirty-five percent thought their risk was average. Even people who had experienced

disasters did not differ markedly from those who had not.

         A common explanation for apparent underestimation of risks, such as those from

auto accidents, is that individuals suffer from an illusion of control. That explanation




                                                                                           28
does not apply to natural disasters. A plausible hypothesis, worthy of further study, is

that individuals actually understand the skewness in the distribution of risk. Though only

half of the population can be below median risk, the vast majority are below average in

risk. That is surely true for auto accidents as well, the favorite domain for “control”

hypotheses.

        More than four-fifths of our respondents favored government assistance for

victims of natural disasters, but this fraction fell to only one-third when the natural

disasters happened to people living in high-risk areas. This decline suggests that

respondents intuitively understand the concept of moral hazard. We label this

phenomenon “efficient compassion.” That is, there is a strong element of compassion in

their responses, but it is tempered when disaster victims have knowingly exposed

themselves to high risk. Individuals who perceive themselves to be at greater personal

risk are more supportive of government assistance, as are groups that tend to be liberal

politically. Black respondents, who may have been particularly struck by the

governmental failure to rescue the black population of New Orleans from Hurricane

Katrina, are much more supportive of continued aid to that city. In short, policy

preferences for disaster relief reflect both compassion for the unfortunate, and a dollop of

self-interest.
