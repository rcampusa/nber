                EXCHANGE-RATE MANAGEMENT VIEWED AS TAX POLICIES


                                       ABSTRACT


       The paper develops an   analytical framework which   demonstrates that

the various forms of exchange-rate management are equivalent to

corresponding tax   policies.    To   highlight the salient issues,   we

consider   two specific categories of     exchange—rate policies. The      first
is a   dual exchange-rate regime, which separates exchange rates for

commercial and for financial transactions, and the second is a unified

exchange—rate system in which the country unilaterally pegs its exchange

rate at the same rate for all transactions.

       We show that the dual exchange rate policies can be usefully cast

as distortionary taxes on international borrowing, and a unified pegged

exchange-rate policies can be usefully cast as lump-sum tax cum subsidy

policies. The equivalence between the various characteristics of

exchange-rate management   and   tax           suggests that exchange—rate
                                       management

analysis could    be usefully incorporated into the broader framework of

the analysis of   fiscal policies.      A two-country model of the world

economy is used to demonstrate the international transmission mechanism

of   these policies.

      This   paper analyzes the problem of exchange-rate management from
the perspective of tax policy.     In general, monetary and fiscal policies
are intimately related to each other through the budget constraint of
the government. This interdependence implies that changes in the money
supply   arising from exchange—rate management necessitate corresponding

compensating changes in monetary or tax policies designed to ensure

public—sector solvency.    In a frictionless undistorted model of the

world economy, the specific combination of these monetary and tax poli—

des   is immaterial.   In such a framework, the time distribution of lump—

sum taxes and of monetary changes does not alter the real equilibrium.

Such a model is characterized by Ricardian neutrality and the real

equilibrium is neutral with respect to the nominal exchange—rate

regime. 1/

      In this paper, we modify the frictionless model by introducing key>

features that break the strong neutrality results. We consider a frame-

work within which exchange—rate management exerts significant effects on

the economic system.    This framework is then used to demonstrate the

equivalence of various policies of exchange—rate management and corres-

ponding tax policies.    It is for this reason that we view exchange—rate

management as part of the broader issue of fiscal management.

      To highlight the salient issues we consider two specific categories

of exchange-rate policies.    The first is a dual exchange regime, which

separates exchange rates for commercial and for financial transactions.


  1/ For an analysis of such a model see Helpman and Razin (1979)
Helpman (1981) and Lucas (1982).

The second is a unified exchange—rate system in which a country unilat-

erally pegs its exchange rate at the same rate for all transactions.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.       In Section II,

we present the analytical framework.    Section III analyzes the dual

exchange rate regime from the perspective of distortionary taxes, while

Section IV discusses the impact of the dual exchange rates on the world

rate of interest.    The analysis in the next two sections is concerned

with the connection between the fixed (but unified) exchange rate system

and lump sum taxes (Section V), and the effect of this regime on world

interest rates (Section VI).    Concluding remarks   are     presented in Sec-

tion VII.




                       II.   The Analytical Framework

       In this section, we consider a minimal framework which nonetheless

captures the main features necessary for the incorporation of monetary

considerations. We assume a model in which domestic and foreign goods

are Internationally tradable and are perfect substitutes in consumption.

For convenience we adopt the cash—in-advance formulation. 1/          Accord—

ingly, purchases of goods require cash payments which are assumed to be

carried out in terms of the seller's currency.       Thus,    goods produced

abroad are purchased with foreign currency, and domestically produced

goods are purchased with domestic currency.




  1/    For examples of such a formulation, see Lucas (1980), Stockman
(l80),    Helpinan (1981), Greenwood (1983), and Persson (l981).
                                         —3—



     At   the beginning of each period individuals transact in the finan-

cial markets and obtain their desired portfolio composition.         The

desired holdings of domestic and foreign currencies reflect the pattern

of planned purchases of domestic and foreign goods that take place

during the period.        The counterpart of these purchases are the sales of

goods by firms.     Accordingly, during each period domestic firms accumu-

late domestic currency and foreign firms accumulate foreign currency.

At the end of each period (which coincides with the beginning of the

subsequent period) domestic firms redistribute the proceeds of their

sales to domestic individuals in the form of wages and dividends.

Analogously, at the end of each period foreign firms also redistribute

their proceeds to foreign individuals in the form of wages and divi-

dends.

     It is convenient to start with a specification of the policy

actions undertaken in managing the dual (two-tier) exchange-rate
regime. 1/ In this context government transactions can be separated
into two accounts: a domestic-currency account and a foreign-currency
account.    We   assume   that   the government sets the paths of the two

of the working of dual exchange-rate regimes view such regimes as
instruments of balance of payments policies. For a recent analysis, see
Dornbusch (1986).

flows, quantitative controls, and dual exchange rates are provided in

(198'4), and Stockman and Hernandes (1985).   For an analysis of dual
exchange  rates or capital controls in the  context of public finance and
distortionary taxes, see Aizenman (1986) and Persson and Svensson (1985)

exchange rates (the commercial and the financial rates) and allows free

mobility of capital.

          In period t the monetary expansion induced by government foreign

exchange intervention in pegging the financial exchange rate is

     denotes the world (fixed) nominal rate of interest on foreign—

currency denominated bonds, and Bdenotes private-sector debt expressed

in units of foreign exchange. The monetary expansion in period t asso-

ciated with pegging the commercial exchange rate at the level

     is                    where             is the (per-capita aggregate) real
          tP(Y-Ct),                (Y—C)
trade balance——the excess of production (which is assumed to be fixed)

over spending. Thus, the monetary injections associated with foreign

exchange interventions are:


          (1)                           +



It is noteworthy that in this formulation we have assumed for conven-
ience that the exchange rate applicable to debt service is the financial

exchange rate.           The key results of the paper do not depend on this

assumption.

      An alternative specification generating a dual exchange—rate regime

assumes         that the government   imposes a binding quota on the volume of
private—sector net international borrowing and pegs the commercial
exchange        rate. In this formulation the financial       exchange   rate, a, is
determined in        the free market.       We denote the quota by
                                                                     .    Accordingly,

equation (1) becomes:
                                                                —5—

                                                                              RFBt1).

     The two alternative formulations of the monetary consequences of

exchange-rate interventions reflect themselves in the money supply.                                        The

money supply process is formulated as


                              =            +
     (3)
                    M             Mt_i          X      Tt


where Mt denotes period t domestic money supply and Tt denotes taxes.

     Money—market equilibrium in the domestic economy implies that


     (14)                         =
                                      Mt

where Pt and                  denote the domestic—currency price of the good and the

level of domestic output, respectively.

     The left—hand side of equation                                (14)   represents the (reduced-form)

world demand for domestic currency. It represents the sum of the domes-

tic demand, MHt, and the foreign demand, MHt.                                     In view of the cash-in-

advance constraints the sum of these demands can be written as

        +                    where              denotes         the foreign purchase of the domes-
            C*t),
tically produced good.                         The requirement that the world demand for the

domestic     good equals               the level of domestic output implies that
       *

 xt
    + C
        xt    =     Ix   .    Hence,            tx
                                               P Y    is the world demand for the domestic

currency.      Equivalently, the interpretation of                                the left-hand side of
equation     (14)    could also be given by noting that money is used only for

transactions involving the purchase of domestic output;                                    hence, if all

output is purchased, the world demand for domestic money equals the

value of domestic output.                            In equilibrium, this quantity equals the
                                               —6—


existing supply of money.            In this context, we note in passing that in

the simple formulation of equation (a),               since      money serves only as a

medium of exchange, the incane velocity of circulation is unitary.

     The private sector is assumed to Consist of overlapping generations

as in Blanchard (1985) and Frenkel and Razin (l986a. 1986b).                     This

assumption introduces into the model a finite expected horizon in which

the probability of survival of each individual from each period to the

next is denoted by 1.        Accordingly, the budget constraint of an indi-

vidual of age a at time t is:


     (5)
               —*                —     *
                                               +             -
                                                                 -
                             =
                                 e1F1Y              5tba,t       Tt      Stba_i, t_i


where b is the debt of the individual expressed in units of foreign

currency.    Accordingly,         represents the sales by domestic firms
                                           x
during period t—l, whose proceeds are distributed to individuals at the

beginning of period t. The last term on the right—hand side of equa-
tion (5) represents the debt commitments. As is evident, the relevant

effective   rate of interest is (RF/Y) - 1,              reflecting the risk     associated

with mortality.       The unique feature of the dual exchange-rate regime is

reflected by the two exchange rates appearing in equation (5).                     The

domestic    price   level,       =
                                     Y' is         governed by the commercial exchange

rate through the purchasing-power-parity relation.                     On the other hand,

debt commitments are settled using the financial exchange rate,

which the financial exchange rate, 5t is determined in the free market.

     Equation (5) is the budget constraint applicable to period t.                          It

is shown in the Appendix that consolidating the periodic budget con-

straints into a single lifetime constraint and making use of the

requirement that in the limit as time approaches infinity the present

value of debt commitment (computed using the effective rate of interest)

is zero yields:


             —    *                         —        *                -

expressed in units of first—period foreign currency.                      The economic

interpretation of the various terms follows.                    Consider, for example, the

coefficients of c           and   c        on the left-hand side of equation (6).

These coefficients are                     and                                            The

domestic relative price of consumption in period one in terms of con-

sumption in period zero is                                                         This

relative price is the product of two terms:                    the real effective world

discount factor (shown by the second bracketed term) and the differen-

tial rates of depreciation of the commercial and the financial exchange

rates (shown by    the first      bracketed term).         This     latter   component, which
represents the contribution of exchange-rate management to the overall
real rate of return on investment in financial assets, translates the
world real effective discount factor into the corresponding domestic

discount factor.      That is, the capital gain on an investment in assets
                                    —8—

denominated in foreign currency is (s1/s0), and its product with

          translates the return into units of foreign-currency-denominated

goods.    A similar interpretation applies to the coefficients multiplying

the rates of consumption in other periods.    As isevident, divergencies

between the domestic and the foreign real rates of interest stem from

the terms involving exchange—rate changes in the dual exchange-rate

regime.     It is important to note that these divergencies arise only from

differences in the percentage rates of depreciations of the commercial

and financial exchange rates.     In the absence of such differences, the

domestic and foreign real rates of interest are equalized.

        The present-value factors multiplying the levels of output on the

right-hand side of equation (6) differ from those used to evaluate the

consumption sequence.     The difference arises from   the   underlying cash—

in—advance formulation, according to which nominal proceeds from sales

of output are distributed with a one period lag.       The next term on the

right—hand side of equation (6) represents the discounted sum of nominal

taxes.     The final term is the individual's debt commitment

                      To express these quantities in units of period-zero
(RF   —l"a—l      l

consumption, we need to multiply the various coefficients by s0/e0P0.

As a result for any given initial foreign price, the real value of

wealth also depends on the ratio of the two exchange rates In period

zero,
         s0/e0.
        To evaluate the real effects of exchange—rate management, we need

to determine the equilibrium value of wealth.     The foregoing discussion

dealt with the factors governing the pricing of consumption in various

periods, under the conditions of a dual exchange—rate regime.         To
                                              —9—


complete the analysis of the determinants of consumption, we need to

determine the dependence of the equilibrium level of wealth on the

exchange-rate regime.            Accordingly, we substitute the equilibrium

conditions into the individual equation (6) which is then aggregated

over individuals. As shown in the Appendix, this procedure yields:

        The pertinent characteristics of equation (7) are discussed in the

subsequent sections.         Prior to this discussion, it is relevant to remark

that the pricing coefficients of output,                                   are the same as
                                                             (eP/s)d,
the pricing coefficients of consumption shown in equation (6).                       In

equilibrium, the lagged payments reflecting the cash-in—advance conven-

given in equation (7), it is useful to consider a benchmark case in

which the authorities do not intervene at all in the foreign exchange

market and allow for free international mobility of capital.                       The

analysis of this special case highlights the basic mechanisms through

which exchange-rate management influences the economic system.                       Accord-

Hence, equation (7) becomes:


       (8)                =

In this benchmark case, therefore, the equilibrium value of wealth is

the discounted sum             of   GDP net of initial external debt commitment.               This

expression reveals that the consumption—opportunity set is the same as
the one obtained in the undistorted barter economy. This illustrates
the point that the finiteness of the horizon, in and of itself, does not
introduce     a distortion into the economic system.


                    II.       Dual Exchange Rates as Distortionary Taxes

       In order to focus on the unique mechanism associated with the dual

exchange—rate policies, consider the infinite-horizon case in which

I =   1.     To facilitate the exposition, we suppose that the foreign price

is fixed and normalized to unity; that is, we let Pt =                         1.   In that

case              R, and since I =         1,       we replace the present-value factor


dt by at
         =        Rt.         Further, we express equation (7) in units of first—

period consumption——by multiplying each term by (s01e0)—-and note that

the real value of wealth spans the consumption—opportunity set.                            Accord-

ingly,


                                     =                     +          -             -

       We define the dual exchange-rate premium by the percentage discre-

pancy between s and e; that is, the premium is (s/i)
                                                     -                          1.   Accordingly,
      reflects    the evolution of        the dual exchange-rate premium over time.

A   rise    in the premium is associated with a decline in                           The dis-

counted sum of consumption shown in equation (9) differs from the one

obtained in the undistorted Ricardian model by one important property:

it    is    influenced by the time path of the dual exchange—rate premium.

Indeed, if      the premium        is constant for all time, then the consumption—

possibility set characterized by equation (9)                       coincides    with the one

obtained in the undistorted barter economy.

           In general, the evolution (rather than the level) of the dual

exchange—rate premium influences the consumption—possibility set by

distorting the prices governing the intertemporal allocation of consump-

tion (and of output if investment is allowed for) and by influencing

wealth.       The distortionary effect on the Intertemporal prices arises

from the wedge that the dual exchange-rate system introduces between the

effective domestic and world rates                  of interest.      An   additional channel
through which      the dual exchange—rate premium influences wealth operates

through the interaction between the evolutions of the premium and of the

external debt, as reflected by the term

                        mt,(lrt—   11÷)   Bt.

       To illustrate this mechanism, consider, for example, the coeffi-

cient of

       this coefficient represents the "subsidy rate" induced by the evolu-
B0,
tion of the premium, and B0 is the "subsidy base."                         The subsidy rate
                                        —   12 —




represents       the percentage rate of reduction in the value of the debt

measured in terms of domestic goods.          Accordingly, if   l   exceeds

       then the foreign—currency value of the debt incurred in period zero

depreciates.       Adjusting this depreciation for the rise in domestic

prices (indicated by e1/e0) yields the subsidy in real terms.            Accord-

ingly, the expression in equation (10) can be viewed as the discounted

sum of the products of the periodic subsidy rates and the periodic

subsidy bases.

       The two effects of the dual exchange—rate system (the intertem—

poral—price effect and the wealth effect) are equivalent to those aris-

ing from the imposition of distortionary taxes on international borrow-

ing.    Since in our formulation the exchange rate applicable to debt

service is the financial rate, this dual exchange—rate system is

lent to a system of taxes on international borrowing in which debt

service Is not exempt from the tax.          Alternatively, a dual exchange—rate

system, in which the exchange rate applicable to the debt service is the

commercial rate, is equivalent to the system of taxes on international

borrowing in which debt service is exempt from the tax.

       We    conclude this section by   characterizing the effects of dual

exchange-rate policy, cast as a distortionary tax on international
borrowing, on the real equilibrium of a small open economy. Assuming a

Equation    (11) states that the economy's external debt is the difference

between the sum of the present values of past (and present) consumption

and outputs adjusted for the initial debt commitment (in present value

as of period t).

        Using the economy-wide solvency requirement that in the limit (as

time goes to infinity) the present value of external debt (evaluated by

using the world real rate of interest) equals zero, equation (11) can be

written as:

            tV.        Effects     of Dual Exchange—Rate Policies on the
                                    World Rate of Interest

     We develop now a simple diagrammatic exposition that is useful for

the analysis of the International effects of a dual exchange in a two—

country model of the world economy.                  The diagrammatic aparatus is

developed in detail in Frenkel and Razin (1987, 1988).                      The key channel

through which the effects of the dual exchange-rate policies are trans-

mitted internationally is via changes in the world rate of interest.                              To

facilitate the exposition, we divide the horizon into two periods:                              the


present, which is denoted by t=O, and the future (t=1,2, ...), and use

the aggregation        procedure    outlined       in Frenkel   and Razin   (1986b).       To

apply this procedure of aggregating quantities pertaining to all future

periods into a composite single quantity we need to compute the present

values of various flows.             Assuming that output and the dual exchange—

rate premium do not vary across future periods (t=l,2,...), we define a

constancy equivalent (average) interest rate r and the corresponding

market discount factor R =            l+r.     For ease of exposition, we also

abstract from mortality risk and assume that I =                   1.

     Under these assumptions,             the private—sector budget constraint
(equation (9)) can be modified to yield:

                                                                                      -

B1,
world capital market implies that the market discount factor, R, is

common to both countries.

       The analysis is conducted with the aid of Figure 1, in which the

downward sloping schedules plot the desired ratio of current to future

consumption as a decreasing function of the average rate of interest.

The assumption that the utility functions are homothetic enables us to

express the various demand schedules in terms of desired consumption

ratios.        The domestic and the foreign private—sector relative demands
                                   *
are denoted        by D and 0          ,       and their       values      at the point    in which

subjective rates of time preference                                  and     .   The elasticities           of   the

relative       demand schedules                 are the corresponding             intertemporal         elastici-

      The initial equilibrium, in which both countries adapt the flexible

exchange rate system, is described by point A.

       The introduction of a dual exchange—rate system by the domestic

government changes              the positions of the                 domestic relative demand curve

D.    The    direction of the change depends                         on the implied path of             the real
             rate premium                  =                             If             > 1, then the policy

raises the effective price of future consumption and induces a substitu-

tion toward current consumption.                             Thus,   for each and every value of the

world rate of interest, the domestic relative demand schedule shifts to

the right from D to D'.                    The vertical displacement of the schedule is

proportional to the change in the path of the dual-exchange rate premium

ir.   Associated       with the new domestic relative demand, the new world

relative demand (the weighted average of domestic and foreign relative
                                        w     w'
demands) also shifts to the right from D to D     and its proportional              ,




rightward      shift    is equal               to    the domestic-country weight i                  times   the

percentage rightward displacement of the D schedule.                                          The new equi-

librium obtains at point B, at which the world rate                                        of'   interest rises.

       A similar analysis could show that if                            it   < 1,        then the policy lowers

interest falls.


              V.    Exchange Rate Management as Lump-Sum Taxes

     In this section we depart from        the    bench—mark case of equation (8)

and examine the pure wealth effects of exchange—rate management.                        There-

by we determine the circumstances under which exchange—rate policies can

be shown to be equivalent to lump—sum tax policies.                  In order to focus

on the pure wealth effect associated with exchange—rate management, we

introduce again the finite horizon by assuming that the value of I is

less than unity, and we assume that the authorities peg the exchange

rate without separating between the commercial and the financial rates.

In such a unified exchange rate regime, the management of the rate is

nondistortionary, and its impact on the real economic system operates

only through the pure wealth effect (see Helpman and Razln (1987) for a

similar framework).

     Using the assumptions that the exchange—rate regime is unified

(i.e., et =        and that the fixed foreign price         P       is norialized to

unity, we express the consumption—opportunity set of equation (7) as:


    (16)
              Jo   dtCt   Jo   dtYx
                                      + (1 —   '   Jo dtB
                                                                —


where we have used the definitions of              = B -   B and     dt
                                                                          =   (I/R)t.
     The only element that distinguishes between the consumption—oppor—

tunity set shown in equation (16) and the set obtained in the barter

economy (embodied in the expression for wealth in equation (8)) is the

second term on the right—hand side of equation (16).                 It follows that in
                                     —   18 —



contrast   with the consequences of dual exchange rates, the unified rate

results in undistorted intertemporal prices.      For example, as shown on

the left-hand side of equation (16), the relative price of consumption

in period 1 in terms of consumption in period 0 is the world real dis-

count factor,   hR.
       In our pure monetary model without government spending, the term

(1 —                  is governed by the movement of international reserves
       Y)Eto dtB
induced by the pegging of the exchange rate.      Accordingly, unless the

government designs its tax and monetary policy so as to always meet (at

the given peg) changes in the demand for money, the pegging operations

are reflected in the evolution of government debt.

       As is evident, changes in the stock of government debt influence

the real equilibrium by altering the value of wealth.      The extent to

which government debt influences private—sector wealth depends on the

difference between private and social rates of discount. This differ-

ence reflects the finiteness of the individual's expected horizon and it

is the same mechanism responsible for the real effects of lump—sum taxes

analyzed in Frenkel and Razin (l986a). Thus, the effects of unified

exchange—rate management are equivalent to those exerted by lump—sum tax

cum    transfer policies.

                VI.    Effects of a Unified Pegged Exchange Rate
                           on the World Rate of Interest

       World equilibrium requires that in each period the given supply of

world output equals the demand.       To facilitate the exposition, we again

divide the horizon into two periods:       the present, which is denoted by

t=0 and the future which consolidates all periods from      tl     forward.

     The exposition          in          this    section              is based        on the assumption that   the


utility function is logarithmic.                                  Under this assumption, the marginal

propensity to save is 16 (where I denotes the survival probability

and 6 denotes the subjective discount factor).                                           Accordingly, as shown in

Frenkel and Razin (1986b), the per—capita aggregate consumption function



                        =            —

income,    computed by using                    the effective rates of interest.                     It is
assumed    that the foreign and                       domestic consumption                 functions have a
similar form.
     The equilibrium conditions include the specification of the initial

values of domestic and foreign wealth as well as the                                          requirement that
present and    future goods—markets clear.                                    These conditions are given in

equation (18) through (21).

        Equations (18) and (19) specify the initial equilibrium values of

domestic and foreign wealth owned by the existing population.                                    In this

specification, private wealth is expressed as the sum of the present

values of current and future disposable incomes plus the net asset

positions.      In these equations, the term I/(R — 1) denotes the present

value of an annuity (commencing at period t=l) evaluated by using the

effective constancy—equivalent interest rate.                              A unique feature of

equation (18) is the inclusion in it of the term Bg.                                    This term, which

equals the amount of short-term government debt (reserve losses) associ-

ated with the exchange—rate management, reflects the capital gains (due

to overvalued currency) captured by the currently alive domestic private

sector (see Helpman and Raziri (1986)). These equations also embody the

requirement that the home country's initial external indebtedness,

       equals the foreign country's initial net creditor position.

       Equation (20) is the requirement that world demand for goods in

period t = 0 equal world supply.                    The left—hand side of this equation

shows the sum of domestic and foreign per—capita private sector's con-

sumption (as implied by equation (17) and its foreign counterpart), and

the right—hand side is the sum of per—capita domestic and foreign out-

puts          and           net of government spending.                        The equality between

I and I* ensures that the sizes of the population of the two countries
are equal to each other.    As a result, aggregate world demand and supply

can be expressed in terms of an equality between the unweighted sum of

the individual country per—capita demand and the unweighted sum of the

corresponding per—capita supply.
                                                                 sum of
     Equation (21) specifies the requirement that the discounted

per-capita domestic and foreign private demand for future goods equal

the discounted sum of per—capita future world outputs net of government

spending.   These discounted sums are cnputed as of period t=0 with the

                                                               The interpre-
aid of the constancy equivalent (average) interest rate.

represents the per-capita wealth of those who will be
                                                   on future goods.          To
periods from t=l onward; this wealth will be spent

the time of birth, and since by our normalization the size of each

cohort at birth is one individual, this term also represents the

cohort's wealth at birth.    Since in each period in the future there is a

new cohort whose wealth at birth is computed similarly, the discounted

sum of all future cohorts' wealth (as of period      tl)   is obtained by

present    value of an annuity (commencing at t=l) evaluated by using the

risk free interest rate.                      The resulting expression is then discounted to

the present (period t=0) through a division by R.                                          This yields

[R/(R_l)(R—1)](Y--T). Multiplying this term by (1—1) converts this

aggregate wealth into the corresponding per—capita wealth.                                         A similar

interpretation applies to the second bracketed term on the left—hand

side of equation (20).                Finally, the right—hand side of equation (20) is

the discounted sum of all future domestic and foreign outputs net of

governments' spending.                As a manifestation of Wairas' law, the system

(18) through (20)            is linearly dependent.

     In addition to equations (17) through (20), the equilibrium condi-

tions also include the requirements that both governments be solvent.

Expressed in terms of the average interest rate, and assuming domestic

government solvency, the domestic government constraint is:


                        =   —                 T

tions can be reduced to two basic market-clearing equilibrium condi-

       Equation (22) is the reduced—form market—clearing condition for

present goods with the left-hand side showing the sum of domestic and

foreign private sectors' demands and the right—hand side showing the

world supply of outputs net of government spending.                                               Equation (23) is

the reduced—form market-clearing condition for future goods with

analogous interpretations applied to the terms on its left and right-

hand sides.     These market-clearing conditions are used later in the

diagrammatic exposition of the world equilibrium.

       Throughout we assume that the foreign government follows a

balanced—budget policy and that initially the domestic budget is

balanced. This ensures that changes in world rates of interest that

result from domestic policies do not impact on the solvency of the

foreign government and therefore do not necessitate secondary changes in

fiscal policies.

       Figure 2 (based on Frenkel and Razin (l986a)) shows the equilibrium

of the system.        In panel I the PP schedule describes combinations of R

and        that maintain equilibrium in the market for present goods.                                              It is
      C0
positively sloped since, as seen from equation (22), a fall in the rate

of interest raises foreign wealth and induces a rise in foreign spending

on present goods; therefore, domestic consumption must fall in order to

induce an offsetting reduction in demand.                                      The FF schedule describes

tion (22).         These tax changes do not impact on the PP schedule, but                  as

seen from equation (23) they induce a fall in demand for future goods.

To restore equilibrum at the given rate of interest,                          must rise so   as

to raise         demand for future goods.             Associated with such a rise in wealth

is a rise in current consumption. Thus, the FF schedule shifts to the

right.      As a result, the new equilibrium is reached at points

management of the exchange rate results in an undervaluation

          This    paper demonstrated the equivalence between exchange—rate
management and tax policies. For this purpose,
                                               we used                        the minimal

monetary framework and have not attempted to provide   a complete analysis

of the broader issues associated with monetary and exchange-rate poli-

cies in the world economy.    To establish the key propositions, we modi-

fied the benchmark model characterized by perfect capital markets,

flexible market—clearing prices, no distortions, and no difference

between the time horizons of the private and the public sector.    We

showed that dual exchange—rate policies can be usefully viewed as dis—

tortionary taxes on international borrowing, and unified pegged

exchange—rate policies can be usefully viewed as lump—sum tax cum

subsidy   policies.   The equivalence between the various characteristics

of exchange—rate management and tax management justifies the inclusion

of exchange-rate analysis into the broader framework of the analysis of

fiscal policies.
