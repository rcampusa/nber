                 THE EFFECT OF ILLICIT DRUG USE
                  ON THE WAGES OF YOUNG ADULTS

                            ABSTRACT



    This paper examines the effects of cocaine and marijuana use
on the wages of a sample of young adults drawn from the NLS Youth
Cohort. The endogeneity of drug use in a wage equation is
considered and a 2SLS procedure is implemented. The rather
surprising results suggest that for this sample, increased use of

marijuana or cocaine is associated with higher wages. The
positive relationship between drug use and the wage does not
diminish with age, but remains substantially positive. We also
investigate whether systematic differences in the return to
measures of human capital investments can explain the observed

positive relationship between drug use and wages. The results
from this analysis do not support such a hypothesis.

INTRODUCTION

    The use of illicit drugs has become one of this country's most pressing

public health concerns, with the issue occupying a prominent place in the

political debate at all levels of government. An important feature of this

debate relates to the consequences of drug use in the workplace, with

particular attention being drawn to declining productivity, product quality

and public safety. Economists have developed several theoretical models

that explain the types of behavior often observed among drug users

(e.g. addiction) but little empirical work has been done to quantify the

individual differences resulting from drug use (Becker and Murphy 1988,

Iannaccone 1984, Mullahy 1985, Stigier and Becker 1977, Pollack 1970). This

paper is an attempt to identify one such difference, namely the effect of

illicit drug use on wages.

    In particular, we analyze whether the frequency of use of cocaine or

marijuana affect the wage rates of a sample of young adults drawn from the

National Longitudinal Survey of the Work Experience of Youth (Center for

Human Resources 1987)1. The adverse impact of illicit drug (i.e. cocaine

or marijuana) use on the physical and psychological veil being of

individuals has been extensively documented2. The health effects of

illicit drug use are both acute (iediate or short term) and chronic (long

term) in nature. With respect to cocaine, the acute effects include raised

blood pressure, hyperactivity, seizures and heart failure, and the chronic

effects include anxiety, irritability and paranoia (Stone—Fromme and Xagen

1984, Long 1986, Kozel and Adams 1985). In the case of marijuana, the acute

symptoms include paranoia, memory loss and lack of coordination with some

chronic effects being decreased motivation and irritability (Jones and

Lovin.ger 1985, Mann 1985). Given this medical background and the assumption




1103e                               —1—
that employees receive the value of their marginal product as pay, we would

expect to find that Illicit drug use would be associated with lower levels

of productivity and thus lower wages (Berger and Leigh 1988). In fact

however, the results of this analysis do not appear to support such a

conclusion. Among the current sample of young, working adults, illicit drug

use is not associated with lover wages.

      The balance of the paper will be divided into the following parts. In

the next section the empirical model used in the analysis will be

described. This section will be followed by a description and examination

of the current data set. The results of estimating the models will follow

the data section, and the paper will close with a summary of results and

suggestions for future research.




EMPIRICAL SPECIFICATION

      The detrimental physical and psychological effects of drug use suggest

that wages should be a negative function of illicit drug use. Following

closely to Becker and Murphy (1988), wages are a function of the stock of an

addictive good's (drug) consumption capital and the stock of human capital;

           (1) W =   f(S,   H),

where W is the wage (in period t      — subscripts   omitted), S is the stock of

drug consumption   capital, and   H is the stock of human capital. The wage is

expected to be negatively related to the stock of drug consumption capital

and positively related to the stock of human capital. Estimation of a

simple human capital wage function, augmented by the addition of a measure

of drug use however, is not appropriate for several reasons, which upon

examination suggest    estimating a simultaneous model of wages and     drug   use
(i.   e. drug consumption capital).




llO3e                                    —2—
   The fact that drugs are a consumption good makes the level of such use

dependent on income. Since wages constitute a large portion of income, an

increase in the wage will lead to an increase in the consumption of drugs,

assuming drugs are a normal good. Thus, individuals with higher wages will

be expected to have higher levels of drug use. For example, the popularity

of cocaine use among the college educated, who would also be expected to

have a high relative wage (i.e. income), might be partly due to an income

effect associated with the consumption of drugs3. The popular media is

also full of references to the use of drugs, especially cocaine, by highly

paid athletes, entertainers and business people. There is a perception,

grounded in economic theory, that higher wages leads to increased drug use.

Thus, when examining the relationship between drug use and wages, it is

necessary to develop a model in which the causality runs in both directions.

   A second reason for expecting the causality between drug use and wages

to be interdependent, also relies on the nature of drug use as a consumption

good. The motivation here comes from the Michael and Becker (1973), or

Stigler and Becker (1977), treatment of drugs and wages as inputs used in

household production. Depending upon the relationship between drugs and

time in household production, there can be a positive or negative dependence

of drug use on the wage4. The wage Is assumed to be equal to the value of

time in home production.

   A final reason why a single equation model is inappropriate, is due to

the fact that unobserved attributes that affect wages could also influence

drug use. In particular, Becker and Murphy (1988) demonstrate that

individuals with a high rate of time preference are much more likely to use

drugs. This is due to the fact, that drug use involves a tradeoff between

current and future utility.5 It is also the case, however, that




1103e                                —3—
individuals with higher rates of time preference will select themselves into

jobs that have flatter age (experience) earnings profiles (Mincer 1974).

Thus we would expect drug use to be correlated with the error of a wage

equation. Those with high, but unobserved, rates of time preference will

have high drug use levels and          high   wage levels. This could be true for

other unobserved attributes, such as anti—social attitudes, which could lead

to similar biases but in the opposite direction as that suggested for the

rate of time preference. The problem is one of unobserved heterogeneity

which    is   common to many   cross   sectional analyses. Some authors have

corrected for this problem by using some type of instrumental variable. In
this paper we utilize a two equation model, and Two Stage Least Squares
(2SLS) estimation method that can         be interpreted as an instrumental variable
procedure6.
    The three problems outlined above, prevent           simple OLS wage regressions

from    yielding unbiased estimates. One solution to         this   problem is to
estimate a simultaneous system of equations with wages and drug use being

jointly determined. The models that will be estimated in this paper are:



    2)W          a0 +aX+aD+E
                     1   2  w
    3)D = bo+blZ+b2W+Ed


where W is the natural log of the wage, D is drug use, X and Z are vectors

of independent variables, the aj and b1 are parameters and Ed are

error terms. The wage equation includes a measure of ability (armed forces

qualifications test), experience, experience squared, education, education

squared, an interaction between ability and education, an interaction

between experience and education, demographic variables (e.g. age, race) and




llO3e                                          —4—
several geographic measures. Also included in the wage model are several

lifestyle variables intended to control for sample heterogeneity7. The

drug use equation contains psychological, lifestyle, household structure,

and demographic variables as well as income and price variables (Kandel and

Logan 1984, Becker and Murphy 1988). In the drug equation, geographical

location dmuny variables should be a suitable proxy for price, since this is

a cross sectional analysis. The system represented by equations 2 and 3

will be estimated by a 2$LS procedure.

    Equation 3, is inconsistent in several respects, with the model of

"rational addiction" proposed by Becker and Murphy (1988). In their model

the variable of interest is the addictive good's (drug) stock of consumption

capital, while presently, we use the frequency of lifetime, or past thirty

day, drug use as a measure of the stock of drug consumption capital. These

two concepts are clearly different. Our measure ignores depreciation of the

stock and intensity (dosage) of use. We also ignore the intertemporal

aspects of the Becker and Murphy (1988) model which links current

consumption to past and future consumption (or prices). The current data

are not adequate for the purposes of estimating a dynamic model. We do,

however, include variables, such as family structure at age 14 and

psychological indices measured during the late teens, that gauge early

lifetime events that would be expected to influence drug use. In stary,

to the extent that drugs are an addictive good among this sample, equation 3

probably suffers from some mis—specification. As Becker and Murphy (1988)

point out, however, "Addictions involve an interaction between persons and

goods.". It is quite possible that drugs are not an addictive good for the

majority of this sample, and as such the problem of mis—specification would

be diminished.




1103e                               —5—
        There are several problems, associated with estimating equations 2 and

 3,   that distinguish them from the ordinary 2SLS procedure. The first

 problem is that the measure of drug use available in the current data set is

 a categorical variable (see table 1). Thus, the drug use equation, (3), is

 best estimated by maximum likelihood methods. In this paper we make use of

 a probit procedure for the binary case (i.e. no use/use), and an ordered

probit procedure for the multinominal case (i.e. no use, moderate use, heavy

use). It has been shown that the estimates obtained from two stage

procedures, similar to that of the ordinary 2SLS procedures, but with a

qualitative or limited dependent variable, are consistent estimates of the

true parameters (Amemiya 1979, Maddala 1983, Forrest and Nelson 1978). The

appropriate standard errors for the models are somewhat complex and need to

be constructed separately8.

      A second problem has to do with the fact that the analysis is focused on

wage rates, and so by definition only those individuals with positive wages

are included in the sample. This "sample selection" criteria has the well

known    effect   of leading to biased estimates if ignored (Heckrnan 1976,

1979). Fortunately, it has been shown that the Meckman two stage procedure

can   be   applied as part of the two stage least squares procedure (Maddala

1983). In estimating the system of equations the inverse Mill's ratio of

the Heckman procedure, is simply added to the model as another exogenous

variable9.

      To sarize, it is the dual nature of drug use as a consumption and

investment good that necessitates modifying the standard procedure for

estimating the wage equation. The high probability that the inclusion of

drugs in a wage regression will lead to biased estimates calls for the use

of the 2SLS technique. A description of the data will be given next.

THE DATA

    The data set used for this analysis is the youth cohort of the N'LS in

the year 1984. In 1984 the NLS   included       questions regarding the

respondent's current and lifetime frequency of use for a variety of illicit

drugs. The youth cohort (18—27 in 1984) are a group of particular interest,

since much of the concern over the use of illicit drugs is centered on this

age range.   It is unfortunate, however, that an older cohort was not asked

similar questions in order to better identify the long term effects of drug

use. It also should be pointed out that the respondents were only

questioned about their drug use at the 1984 interview, and this limits the

use of the data set to primarily a cross sectional analysis of the

relationship between wages and drug use. The questions regarding drug use

are not extensive enough to build a longitudinal record for individuals,

which would be necessary in developing a dynamic empirical model compatible

with that of Becker and Murphy (1988).

    The current sample consists of males and females who were not in school,

not in the military and not self employed at the time of the 1984

interview. In addition to these criteria, individuals with missing data
                                       10
were also excluded from the analysis        .   This   left a sample of 8282

persons of which 3901 (47%) were male and 4381 (53%) were female. Among the

entire sample, 69 percent were currently employed at the time of the 1984

interview. Male respondents had a labor force participation rate of 77

percent, while female respondents had a 62 percent participation rate as

measured at the time of the 1984 interview.

    Appendix table Al contains a list of the variables used in the analysis

and their definitions. Appendix tables A2 and A3 contain the descriptive

statistics for these variables by gender group. All figures (means) listed




llO3e                                  —7—
 in the the      text are      weighted for   thesampljng    procedures used in obtaining
 the NLS    survey data (Center for Human Resources            1987)11.

        Among   all    respondents (Appendix table A2), the mean          age   is approximately

 23.4 years for both males and           females.      Males have more work experience than

 females with the respective means of 4.8 and 4.2 years. The education

levels are about equal, with both gender groups averaging approximately 12.5

years    of education. The primary difference between male and female

respondents,          is   in regard to what might be considered family structure.

Males    are    more likely to live at home with their parents than females, 42

and 28 percent respectively, and less               likely to be or have    been married, 33

to 52 percent. Also females have more dependents than males with the

respective means, of .52 and .31.

    The characteristics of the respondents who are working are similar to

those of all respondents with the major differences between the                    groups

being; the increase in years of experience and education, especially for

women, the decrease in the proportion of the sample that is black, and the

decrease in the mean number of dependents for women. An interesting finding

is the relative similarities between working males and females with regard

to experience, tenure and education. The mean wage of males however is

significantly higher than that of females.

    Of particular interest in this study are the drug variables. The

respondents were asked about lifetime and current (past 30 days) frequency

of use for cocaine and marijuana. The responses to these questions were

grouped by intervals. Table 1 is a frequency distribution of respondents by

amomt of reported drug use. Table 1 is divided into males (A) and females

(B). About 23 percent of employed male respondents had reported cocaine use

over their lifetime and about 6 percent reported that they bad used cocaine




1103e                                           —8-.
in the last 30 days. For females, these figures are 15 percent for lifetime

use and 3.5 percent for current use. These numbers are somewhat lower than

those   in a National Institute on Drug Abuse study of 18—25 year old adults,

that reported lifetime prevalence in 1982 of 35 percent for males and 22

percent for females (Kozel and Adams 1985)12. The same study reported

past 30 day prevalence of 9 percent for males and 5 percent for females.

Another study by Jobnaton, O'PIalley and          Bachman (1986) report annual and
past 30 day prevalence for young      adults      aged 18—25 in 1985. In this study

24 percent of the males and 17 percent of the females reported past year

cocaine use, and 11 percent of the males and 7 percent of the females

reported past 30 day cocaine use. Finally, a longitudinal study of New York

State high   school   students reported lifetime prevalence of 37 percent for

males and 23 percent for females in 1980 among           a   sample of respondents with

a mean age of 24.7 years (Kandel and Logan 1984).

    The reported frequency of marijuana use is much            higher   than   that   of

cocaine, but still below the numbers reported in other surveys. Almost 72

percent of employed male respondents, and about 62 percent of employed

female respondents reported having used marijuana. For past 30 day

marijuana    use, 27 percent of the males and 14 percent of the females
reported some use. The     New   York State survey had a reported lifetime
prevalence   of marijuana use of 77 percent for males and 68 percent for

females.     The Johnston, 0'Malley   and   Bachman (1986) study reported past 30
day prevalence of marijuana use of 30 percent for males and 21 percent for
females. As was the case      for   cocaine, the marijuana figures appear to be
lower   that those reported elsewhere13.

   An important point to note in table 1, is the similarity between working

respondents and the entire sample. Table 2, suarizea the differences

among the various samples cited regarding the frequency of drug                use.

1103e                                       —9—
        The severity of drug use cannot be identified since dosage is not

 included as a question, but one would expect to find that dosage and

 frequency of use are positively correlated. Among male respondents who have

 tried cocaine in their lifetimes, approximately half have tried it 1—9 times

 and only about 15 percent of the users (3.5 percent of the total male

 sample) have used cocaine more than 100 times. Among male respondents who

 reported lifetime marijuana use there are quite a few with a large number of

 reported times of use. Over 37 percent of the sample of users has used

marijuana more    than 100   times. The same pattern observed for males is

 repeated   among female   respondents. About half of female cocaine users have

tried cocaine approximately 1—9 times and about 10 percent of the users

reported a frequency of use of 100 or more times. The relative severity of

marijuana use among females is comparable to that among males.



ESTIMATION RESULTS

    A variety of empirical models were estimated in order to provide        some

benchmark (OLS) estimates and to highlight the main questions of this

paper. The variables of Interest in the analysis are the reported frequency

of use of cocaine and marijuana. Within each drug category the distinction

between current (past 30 day) and lifetime use is exploited in order to

compare short and long term effects. The drug use measures were entered

into the model in three forms; as a linear term, as a binary (no use/use)

measure, and as a series (no use, moderate use, heavy use) of duiy

variables. OLS estimates were generated for each gender group, drug type

(4), and fmctional form (3) with the results listed in table 314, All

models were estimated with and without a correction for the "selectivity"

bias which arises due to the labor force participation decision of the




ll03e                                   —10—
respondents. Table 3 contains the estimates of the coefficients for the

drug variables. As columns 1 and 3 of table 3 illustrates, there are

several anomalous results that present themselves at this stage of the

analysis. Many of the coefficients associated with the drug use variables

are positive and significant, indicating that increased drug use leads to

higher wages. The only exception to this conclusion is for the male sample

when estimating the effects of marijuana use on wages. These are surprising

results in light of the evidence regarding the effects of drug use on the

physical and psychological well being of individuals, and results that would

appear to support the hypothesis that a more sophisticated econometric

approach is warranted. The first explanation that most economists would

appeal to in order to explain these results, is that the positive

correlation observed in table 3 is primarily the result of an income

effect. This is precisely what has been argued in the earlier part of this

paper. Thus the next part of the analysis is concerned with the results of

estimating a simultaneous system of equations, where drug use and wages are

endogenous.

    before moving to this set of results, three additional points need to be

raised. The first is that the correction for sample selectivity did

remarkably little to change the results listed in table 3. The selection

equation includes all of the other exogenous variables from the wage (2) and

drug (3) equations. It is a reduced form model, since both wages and drug

use might be expected to influence labor force participation. The

correction term (LAMBDA) itself is always insignificant when included in the

regressions, and the effect of this procedure on the parameter estimates of

the model is negligible. In light of these results, all remaining models

will be estimated excluding the correction term, and the procedures used to

derive



llO3e                               —11—
        Secondly, the wage regressions were also estimated with both                 types of

 drug use measures included in the same model, as well as a set of

 interaction terms. The           estimates   from these models (not shown)         do not
 differ significantly from those listed in table 3. The signs and magnitudes

 of   the effects of drugs on wages were          basically       the same, although in some
 cases the significance levels          were reduced.
        A final   point   of   interest, is, whether or not the        relatively young      age
 of the cohort under study           is an important     factor   contributing   to these
 rather   surprising      results.    To investigate this question, the wage models
 were re—estimated        on a sample of respondents who were over 23 years            old.
 The results from this analysis are listed in table 416                   Exij columns
 1 and 3 of table 4,        there appears to     be several   differences    between these
 estimates and the comparable ones            of table   3. In particular, the positive
effects associated with increased marijuana use among females, are smaller

and less
         significant for the older group. The same is true for the effects
of cocaine use on the wage. The effects of cocaine use, however, remain
positive and significant. For the male sample, the results of table 4 are
quite similar to those in table 3. The effects of lifetime cocaine use are
positive, significant, and of the same approximate magnitude. The results
of table 4 are generally consistent with those of table 3, and both are
quite surprising. To           further explore the relationship between drug use and
wages, a simultaneous equations model was estimated.

      The simultaneous model         was estimated including a variety of drug         use

variables. A linear form of drug use (i.e.,               cocaine    lifetime,   cocaine

current, marijuana lifetime, marijuana current)               was used,   and the   system    of

equations was estimated by the traditional 2SLS method. A binary form of

the drug use variable was used, and the system was estimated in two ways;




1103e
the traditional 2SLS method and the two stage method that estimates the

binary drug   use   equation by a probit procedure. Finally, an ordered probit

model of drug use was estimated, and the predicted probabilities of being in

a particular drug use category (i.e., no use/moderate use, heavy use) were

used in place of the series of diy variables in the wage equation.

   The estimation of the structural equations raises the issue of

identification. In this paper it was assumed that the non—wage income

(OThINC) of the respondent is not a factor that affects productivity, and

thus wageg7. Given this assumption, tests of overidentifying

restrictions were carried out on a subset of variables that were thought to

affect drug use, but not wages. The test consists of estimating the exactly

identified model of wages, and testing sets of coefficients using the

appropriate submatrices of the estimated covariance matrix (Wegge 1978,

Bwang 1980). It is important to note, that in several of the models the

covariance matrix needs to be estimated with proper attention to the fact

that one of the right hand side variables is a predicted value (Murphy and

Topel 1985). The results from these tests yielded a set of three variables

that along with non—wage income could be excluded from the wage equation.

This set of variables includes the frequency of religious attendance in

1979, the number of current dependents, and the number of delinquent acts in

1980. This set was tested for all of the models that result from using a

different drug measure. Several other lifestyle and psychological

variables, however, were included in the wage equation. These variables

include, among others, whether the respondent lived with both parents at age

14 (PARENT), a self esteem scale measured in 1979 (ESTEEII), a measure of the

respondents feelings about control over their lives as of 1980 (ROTTER), and

age of the respondent. The results from these models are listed in




llO3e                                  —13—
 table 518   Columns 1 and 3 contain the results for the 18—27 year old

cohort and columns 2 and 4 contain the results for the 23—27 year old

cohort. What table 5 clearly illustrates, is that the anomalous results

obtained from the OLS regressions are not due to the hypothesized income

effect or other simultaneity biases. The magnitude of the positive

relationship between wages and drug use has been increased. The changes are

dramatic. The results hold uniformly for both gender groups, age groups and

both types of drugs. The size of the effect of drug use on wages is

substantial. For example, the results indicate that male respondents who

have tried cocaine earn about 21—22 percent more per hour, than respondents

who have never tried cocaine. The same figure for marijuana is 17—18

percent. Among the female sample, users of cocaine are predicted to earn

about 6 percent more per hour than non—users, and for marijuana the same

figure is 7—8 percent. It should be noted that many of the effects of drug

use on wages are insignificant, although quite large in size. This is

especially true for the female sample. The two stage procedure used to

estimate the model often results in large standard errors, and less precise

estimates. The most powerful finding of table 5, however, is the virtual

absence of negative drug effects, and the relatively large magnitudes of the

positive effects.

    When drug use is constrained to be a linear measure, and estimated by

OLS methods, the sign of the drug coefficient is uniformly positive, and in

the case of the male sample, always significant at conmionly accepted levels

of significance. Several other results in table 5, however, especially

among the female sample, suggest that the effect of drug use on wages is

non—linear. There appears to be a large positive return to initiation into

drug use, but as the frequency of use grows, the positive effect tends to




llO3e                               —14—
diminish. This raises an interesting question concerning the nature of the

effects of drug use on wages. The current data are unable to answer this

question satisfactorily, since drug use is measured by intervals with

relatively large ranges (see table 1).

    There does not appear to be any discernable pattern regarding the

differences in the effect on wages of current (i.e. past 30 day use) versus

lifetime drug use. In some cases, such as cocaine use among males, the

current effects tend to be much larger thin the lifetime effects, while in

other cases the reverse is true. Also, there no longer appears to be a

diminishing of the drug effects with age among the female sample, as that

exhibited between table 3 and 4.

    The simultaneous framework that has been utilized to this point, is not

useful for investigating whether the positive relationship between drug use

and wages is a result of the drug user's relatively high rate of time

preference. To recall, it was hypothesized that an individual who uses

drugs would also be more likely not to invest in on—the—job training, and

could potentially have a flatter wage profile, but a higher wage at this

point in their lives. In order to investigate this, and other differences

in the returns to various human capital measures, an endogenous switching

regression model of wages will be estimated (Lee 1978, Maddala 1983).

Separate wage regressions will be estimated for drug users and non—users.

The dependence of drug use on the wage is retained through the estimation of

an equation which determines selection into drug use. The model can be

represented as follows:19



         (4)       D*=Za+u,
         (5)          =                 if    D   1, P5 >   0,
                          X1 b1 + e1
         (6)          =                 if    0 = 1,    j 0,
                          X2 b2 + e2


1103e                                  —15—
 where       is equal to the amount of desired drug use,    is the wage of
 drug    users,    is the wage of non—users, Z is a vector of attributes that

 affect the quantity of drug use and includes the wage,       and        are
                                                                    X2
 vectors of attributes that affect W1 and W2 respectively, and
                                                                    a,b1 and
 b2 are parameters to be estimated (ICenny et al. 1979, Lee et al. 1980).

 The model assumes that u, e1 and e2 are distributed multivariate

 normal. This i a simultaneous system of equations with 'selectivity based

 on a probit criteria function." In their current form, OLS methods will

yield biased estimates of equations 5 and 6, since the expected value of' the

 error terms are not equal to zero. This problem can be rectified by

applying a tvo stage procedure (Reckman 1976, Lee et al. 1980). The first

stage is to obtain probit estimates for the reduced form of equation 4, and

the second stage is to use the estimates from the first stage to construct

an additional regressor for each wage equation, that along with its

parameter, measure the expected value of the error terms in equations 5 and

6 conditional upon drug use. To complete the second stage, an OLS wage

regression is estimated which includes the additional selection (into drug

use) term. Tables 6 and 7 contain the results for this model. Table 6

sarjzes the effect of an additional year of experience, education, and

age on the wage. Table 7 lists the predicted wage differentials.

    The positive relationship between drug use and wages might arise from

differences in the returns to experience and other human capital variables.

It was argued earlier that a particularly important variable in this respect

is labor market experience. Drug users could be systematically choosing

jobs with flatter experience/earnings profiles, and be receiving higher

wages than non—users at this relatively early point in their careers. The

results reported in table 6, however, do not support such a hypothesis. The




llO3e                                 —16—
returns to   labor   market experience are    in fact larger for drug users in half

of the cases listed in table 6. This is especialy true for males, who also

had the moat statistically significant drug effects. The respondents age

was also included in the analysis, and        it   is expected that age and

experience would be highly correlated. Thus, an examination of the returns

to age could provide the support for the hypothesis that drug            users   have

flatter    age (experience)/earnings profiles. As can be seen in table 6, the
returns to age are sometimes larger for drug users, but often times
smaller.     The results appear to   be inconsistent with the hypothesis of

flatter    age (experience)/earnin.gs profiles for drug users as compared to
non—users.
      The predicted wage differentials between drug users and non—users are

contained in table 20• The first col               of table 7 lists differences in

the endowments or mean characteristics of the sample, while column 2 lists

the differences in the return to those characteristics. In general, the

differences in endowments tend to be quite small, with the only exception

being female cocaine users who would be expected to have a wage 9 to 12

percent higher than non—users. The expected wage differentials due to

differences in the returns to observed characteristics, however, are quite

large, and in most cases would predict that non—users would have a much

larger wage than drug users. For example, among males           18—27, non—users of

drugs    would be expected   to have a 64   percent   higher wage than   drug users.

For   female cocaine   users, the predicted   differential    is substantial,    but the
expected wage premium would be for drug users. The           results   of column 2
appear    to be inconsistent   with the large positive effects of drug use

obtained in table 5. It is important to note that column 2 is calculated

without the inclusion of the intercept or selection term. Column 3 adds the




llO3e                                    —17—
differences in the intercepts between non—users and drug users Co the

 figures in column 2. This additional component of the predicted wage

differential leads to dramatic changes in the sign and magnitude of the

predicted difference. It is now the case that male drug users can expect a

substantial premium (14—26 percent) over non—users, and female non—users

would be predicted to have a much smaller premium than those in column 2,

and in some cases would be predicted to have a lower wage than drug users.

Thus it is not the returns to observed characteristics that is responsible

for the positive effects of drug use on the wage, but the unobserved

component as evidenced by the large differences in the intercepts of the

wage models between drug users and non—users.

    The importance of several variables in explaining differences in drug

use can be seen by examining the results from the estimated drug use

models. The drug use equations were estimated as reduced forms, since there

were no variables that a priori would be expected to affect the wage, but

not drug use. The main concern of this paper is the effects of drug use on

wages, and not the reverse. Table 8 contains the estimates of a model of

lifetime cocaine use where the dependent variable is a binary measure, and

the model is estimated by probit methods21.

    An   interesting   finding contained in table 8 is related to the size and

significance of the variables used to identify the wage equation. The

effects of frequency of religious attendance, number of delinquent acts, and

non—wage income are all significant predictors of drug use. Several of the

other lifestyle variables are also significant, and the signs of the

coefficients are generally what would be expected. For example, respondents

who live at home with their families are less likely to have tried cocaine,

as are those respondents who had a two parent household during their early




llO3e                                  —18—
teen years. It is also the case that non—wage income is positive and

usually significant. This could support the idea that drugs are a normal

consumption good, but the reduced form nature of the model wakes it hard to

interpret the results.



CONCLUSION

   Contrary to popular belief, the results of this analysis suggest that

illicit drug use, as measured by the reported frequency of use, does not

have the expected negative affects on wages. The analysis actually implies

that increased frequency of drug use leads to higher wages. The results

appear to be consistent across gender groups, age cohorts and drug type

(i.e. cocaine and marijuana). The present research also demonstrates the

sensitivity of the parameter estimates to the method of estimation. The

2SLS procedure produced results that were radically different from those of

OLS. The fact that the results of the 2SLS procedure, as compared to the

OLS results, were even more contrary to what was expected, should not

diminish the significance of the findings.

    The results also indicated that the positive relationship between drug

use and wages does not diminish with age. This is inconsistent with the

hypothesis that drug users invest less time in on—the--job training and

therefore would have flatter age earnings profiles, but higher wages. This

explanation of the observed positive relationship between drug use and wages

was also rejected by the evidence from a switching regression model. The

results of this analysis indicate in some cases steeper experience/earnings

profiles for drug users, and smaller returns to other observed

characteristics. Predicted wage differentials were also calculated, and

show that drug users are in moat cases expected to have higher wages than




1103e                                —19—
non—users. The wage premium, however, comes not from differences in the

returns to observed characteristics, but due to differences in the

unobserved characteristics embodied in the intercept of the models. The

positive wage premium generally observed is consistent with the results from

models in which drug use enters directly into the equation.

    The analysis was imperfect in many regards, and there is much need for

further research. The first problem pertaining to this issue, is the

possibility of under—reporting of drug use. If heavy users of drugs

severely tmer reported their usage and were also doing poorly in the labor

market, this might explain the observed results. There does appear to be

some under—reporting in the sample mainly for cocaine, although of what

nature is not determinable. Less than 1 percent of the respondents had

missing values for their responses to the drug questions. Related to this

is the idea that the measure of drug use is inadequate for the intended

purposes. Using the Becker and Murphy (1988) terminology, it is the stock

of drug consumption capital that is of importance but which is unobservable.

    Secondly, there are several unobservable variables that are expected to

be of importance, but were not accounted for in the analysis. These

variables include an individuals subjective rate of time preference, and a

respondents demand for health care or other factors affecting the

depreciation of the stock of drug capital. Any increase in health capital

might offset the negative health consequences of drug use (Grossman 1972,

Becker and Murphy 1988). Finally, the 2SLS procedure is based on several

assumptions     that might have   been violated in the analysis. The drug

equation   is   likely to suffer from some mis—specification bias and the

predicted values from this equation might not be consistent estimates of the

true value. This would affect the results of the parameter estimates of

drug use in the wage equation.

    In somewhat of a different direction, the effects of drugs could be most

evident in the labor Supply and annual earnings      of   individuals as opposed to

their wage   rates. Thus an analysis of yearly earnings         or   annual labor

supply might   be more helpful in uncovering wh&t we expect to be the harmful
effects of drug   use   on labor market outcomes.

   This paper is an initial attempt at identifying the relationship between

illicit drug use and     labor   market outcomes. The analysis has highlighted

several areas of interest for further research and        has   explored one research

avenue in detail. The rather surprising results reported within this paper

should serve as an incentive for future work.

    (Center for Human Resources 1987).

 3. College educated individuals have the highest prevalence of cocaine use
    among   all
              other educational groups (Xozel and Adams 1985).

 4. In the more general case we have the household minimizing a cost
    fimct ion;


           C=wr+PdD+PXX                         W=wage
                                                T     time
    S.T.                                        D =   drug use
                                                X other inputs
           Z =   f(t,D,X)
    The first order conditions are:

           f (t,D,x) =      W


           1d (t,D,x) =

           1x (t,D,x) =
    The solution to this system yield factor demand functions of the
    following form;

           D =   g(w,P4,P)      Z

    We can derive (estimate) the effect of a change in the wage (W) on the
    demand for drugs (1)). Then we will know if the factors are Hicks—Allen
    substitutes or complements. If they are complements, then drug use
    would depend negatively on the wage.

 5. There is a tradeoff between current and future utility because past
    consumption raises the price of future consumption (tolerance). As the
    stock of drug capital increases, the marginal utility of drug use
    declines. See Becker and Murphy (1988) for a thorough treatment.

 6. This procedure, although in the same spirit as that of say Altonji and
    Shakotko (1987), does not totally resolve the basic problem of
    mis—specification. The analysis does include a wealth of explanatory
    variables that should reduce sample heterogeneity problems.

 7. The lifestyle variables were included due to the fact that a test for
    overidentifying restrictions of the wage model rejected the hypothesis
    that they should be excluded.

  8. It is important to note that the standard errors derived from the second
      stage OLS estimates of the wage model (equation 2) are incorrect when
      the measure of drug use is replaced by its predicted value. In this
     paper, drug use is estimated in a variety of ways; by OLS when drug use
      is a linear measure, by probit methods when drug use is transformed into
     a binary measure and by an ordered probit procedure when drug use is
     transformed into a series of duy variables. In the first case, when
     drug use is estimated by OLS methods the correct standard errors are
     those that are derived in any econometrics text (Ementa 1986) and
     produced automatically by most statistical packages (SAS). When drug
     use is estimated by probit methods the correct standard errors need to
     be carefully constructed. Maddala (1983), and Murphy and Topel (1985)
     give the appropriate expressions for calculating the correct standard
     errors of this model, and these are the estimates used throughout this
     paper when drug use is estimated as a binary variable. In regard to the
     case, where drug use is estimated by an ordered probit procedure, this
     paper makes use of the standard errors from an OLS regression, which are
     underestimates of the true values (Murphy and Tope]. 1985).

 9. The model described be equations 2 and 3 thus becomes the following;

    2a)Wa0+a1X+a2D+ if W>O
    3a)fl=bO+blz+b2W+Ed if WO
     4)WD0              if WQ
    The problem in this case, is that the expected value of the error term
     is not equal to zero for the structural or the reduced form equations.
    Thus it is necessary When estimating the reduced form model to account
     for the "selection effect". Carrying out the usual two stage procedure
     (Eeckan 1977, 1979) when estimating the reduced form equations should
    yield consistent estimates of the endogenous variables, which can in
    turn be used to obtain estimates of the structural equations. The
    standard errors should, theoretically, account for the fact that not
    only are the endogenous variables replaced with a predicted value but so
    is an additional regressor, namely the selection term. The standard
    errors used in this paper when estimating the model with "selectivity"
    are those derived from the procedures outlined in footnote 8. The fact
    that there is an additional estimated variable is ignored. It is
    important to note that the problem would be observationally identical if
    only equation 2a was subject to selection, since both reduced forms
    would contain the selection term.
         Since equation 3a is sometimes presented as a binary variable and
    estimated by probit methods, adding the inverse mills ratio amo!mts to
    assuming that Ed, the error term, is normally distributed conditional
    on all the regressors including the inverse mills ratio.

10. Once again the problem of "selectivity" arises. If the exclusion of
    these individuals is systematically related to wage rates, the estimates
    of parameters of the model will be biased. Presently it is assumed to
    be random. Less than 1 percent of the sample were missing responses to
    the drug questions.

    NLS see NLS Handbook. (Center for Human Resources 1988).

12. This is an appropriate study for comparison since the sample was 18—25
    in 1982 which would make them 20—27 in 1984 which is approximately the
    age of the current sample.

13. The large proportion of respondents who live in the south might be the
    reason for part of this discrepancy. People in the south have lower
    rates of reported use of illicit drugs (Abelson and Miller 1985,
    Johnston, O'Malley and Bacbman 1986).

14. The parameter estimates of a representative model are listed in appendix
    table A4. Other estimates are available from the author.

15. All models were also estimated with the selection correction and the
    results were unchanged from those reported in the paper. See footnote 9
    for details on the calculations.

16. The parameter estimates of the models are available from the author.
    The estimates are similar to those in table AS of the appendix.

17. In order to test for overidentifying restrictions, it is necessary to
    make at least one a priori restriction, since it is impossible to test
    an exactly identified model (Huang 1980).

18. The parameter estimates of a representative model are contained in
    appendix table A6. Other estimates are available form the author.

19. The issue of selectivity bias is ignored in this analysis in light of
    the results from the previous models.

20. The predicted differentials are calculated as follows (Oaxaca 1973,
    Gyourko and Tracy 1988):

    1nW -    lnWd =   B    (X - Xj)   +   B   - 6d (X)

a. For each type of            drug     three models were estimated with
   a d.ifferent form of the drug usa variable ; linear,
   binary and isultinomial
b. This model was estimated by ordinary 2SLS method (i.e .OLS)
c. The duy variables for drug usa(e.g. coksltl,cokelt2)
   were estimated by an ordered probit procedure and the
   reported standard error, are from an OLS wage regression
    and are therefore only approximations of the true values.
d. StAdrd arrros in parentheses
