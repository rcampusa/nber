     Job changes often occur without spells of unemployment. Highly educated

workers, for example, rarely suffer unemployment, even though job changes are

common.   A large proportion of their job switches occur   only   after the new job

is secured. These workers, whose skills and ability levels are less homogene—

ous, differ from less skilled, perhaps more homogeneous workers who are more

likely to experience unemployment in the process of changing jobs. Most

research has focused on job changes that imply spells of unemployment.

Indeed, the primary rationale behind the earliest papers on search theory was

to explain unemployment.1 But if there exists what some refer to as a "dual

labor market,"2 these theories may be most applicable to the secondary workers.

This paper attempts to formulate a theory of turnover and wage dynamics that

may better describe the primary labor force, defined as those who change jobs

without unemployment.3 In the process, a number of previously unexamined

phenomena are explored.

     The first task is to understand the relationship between worker quality

and turnover. E markets clear more quickly for the most able workers? Why

is it that there is a tendency to try to hire the most able individual, even

though his wage rate is higher? It appears that prices do not adjust fully

for differences in quality. Buyers constantly seek that diamond in the rough.

This also yields a variation on the Peter Principle: The best workers are

stolen away so those who remain appear incompetent relative to their peers.

     The process that is examined makes "stigma" an important feature of labor

markets. Because of the information that is produced when workers receive or

fail to receive outside offers, workers who are undesired by outsiders are

treated differently from those who enjoy an active outside market. Thus,

stigma, which can be thought of as the consequences of a worker's history of

offers and/or employment, is modeled and treated explicitly.

     Information about worker ability evolves over time. The model provides a

parsimonious description of the process by which a worker's wage converges to

his marginal product. The patterns of turnover and wage change can be related

in a very simple way to the difficulty associated with learning a worker's

ability. For example, when information is difficult to acquire, wages have

little dispersion within an occupation, and stigma is unimportant. Further,

there is only a very weak relation between ability and tenure.    Other

relationships are easily traced.

     A number of implications are derived. Among the more interesting are:

     (1) The best workers are more likely to be raided. Everyone goes after

high quality, higher—priced ones rather than lower quality, lower—priced ones.

     (2) wages of workers who receive outside offers differ from wages of

those who do not. A corollary is that the importance of stigma depends upon

the probability that an outsider recognizes the ability of a given firm's

workers. Stigma is not likely to be as pronounced for assembly line workers

as it is for research academicians. As a result, wages converge less quickly

to true output for assembly line workers than for academicians.

      (3) The wage difference between the best paid and worst paid workers

within an occupation is positively related to that occupation's equilibrium

level of turnover. Turnover is a proxy for market information, which tends to

drive each worker's wage toward his marginal product.

      (4) The difference between the wages of those who turn over and those who

do not is negatively related to the equilibrium level of turnover within an

occupation. Low—turnover occupations are likely to have the most pronounced

differences between the wages of movers and stayers.

      (5) The oldest workers on a given job are the least productive.     This

 paraphrases the Peter Principle4 and results because the most able of the young

 workers are bid away.
                                       —3—



       (6) Workers who search for jobs during time not worked may actually have

lower wages than those who "loaf" during the unworked time. Failed search

carries worse connotations for the worker's productivity than not searching at

all.

       Before any implications are derived, it is necessary to construct a model

and to outline a few basic relations. That is done in the next section.



I. A MODEL


       To focus on competition among firms for workers, we begin with a simple

model that captures the key features of the effects of informational differ-

ences and informed trading. This enables us to examine phenomena such as

raids and offer matching in the labor market.


The Basic Set—Up:

       Suppose that there are two firms, j and k, and that the worker is

currently signed up to work for firm j. In April,      j   announces to the

worker that it will pay him a salary of W, beginning September 1 •      After
that announcement is made, firm k may decide to raid. Raiding means that k

makes a counter—offer to the worker that exceeds W. After the counter—offer

is made,    j   has the option to up its bid, followed by k's counter, and so

forth until one of the two firms drops out of the bidding. All of this occurs

before September 1.

       The worker is worth M at firm j and Mk at firm k. Further,

                                       =   M   +   S


                                    Mk =   M
                                       —4—



so that M is the worker's general skill and S is specific to the current

firm.5 A negative value of S implies that the worker is better suited to

firm k. Both M and S are random variables. For simplicity, it will be

assumed throughout that they are distributed uniformly: M is uniform on the

interval [0, 11 and S is uniform on the interval [—ct/2, a/2]. Thus, Mj

takes on values from —a/2 to      1 + a/2    and Mk takes on values from 0 to 1.

As a increases, the match—specific component becomes more important. At one

extreme, with a = 0,     all skills are general. At the other extreme, assuming

that a < 1,     there is as much variation in the specific component as In the

general one.

     Information about the worker's productivity takes the following form:

                                                       exactly, i.e.,   j   is "informed."
With probability P firm j observes           143


With probability (1      F3), firm j only knows the distribution of 7.5.

Similarly, with probability k' firm k observes TMk exactly. With

probability (1 —    k'   firm k knows only the distribution of Mk.

     In general, one might expect that             >   p.   Still, this does not imply

that k = 0.      As an example, suppose that to become informed of a worker's

productivity, it is necessary to read one of his papers in the AER.                  If a

potential employer reads only one of twenty papers per issue, then the proba-

bility that any one paper is read is .05. Although the current employer is

more likely to read one of his own workers' papers, so that                 >   p,     it is

still possible that an outsider may read one that the current employer over-

looks (for example, when two of his sQorkers have papers in the same issue).

     This notwithstanding, unless otherwise noted, it will be assumed that

=
    k=   P   for notation simplicity. The P can be thought of as an index of

an occupation's "visibility." In some jobs, it is difficult (for insiders and

outsiders) to learn the worker's marginal product. For others, the task is

easier. At one extreme is an assembly line worker, whose individual output is

difficult to separate from that of his co—workers. It is also unlikely to be

observed by a potential raider. At the other extreme is an academic

economist, who publishes his ideas and makes his product easily observed to

insiders and outsiders.

     The situation is depicted in figure 1 •            It   starts after j has announced

a wage offer of W, to which k must react. Wage W, derived below, is the

optimal offer consistent with zero profits. Firm k is either informed, with

probability P, or uninformed. If k is uninformed, then node 1 is

relevant, where k's best strategy is to pass. A raid at any wage greater

than W has negative expected value, and any raiding offer less than W is

doomed to failure.6

     A raiding offer by k at a wage greater than W encounters either an

informed or uninformed j. If j is informed, then j fails to match the

offer only when it exceeds M. But the expectation of Mk, given that

M < Z (for any Z) is

                                                     min(Z,a/2)         M
(1) E(MjM + S       Z) =              1

                                                                            s dMdS

                                                       -2             z —


It can be shown that this is always smaller than W, the initial wage offer

made by j.7 Therefore, no raid by k that can be successful is profitable.

This is a manifestation of "winner's curse." On average, a bid that success-

fully attracts a worker is too high if the bidder is uninformed. A worker who

can be stolen away from an informed employer is a worker that k would rather

do without at the price required to steal him.8 So if j is informed and k

is not it pays for k to pass.

     If j   is uninformed, then k's offer must be interpreted by j. If j

believes that k only raids when k is informed, then j must calculate the
                                               —6—




expected value of M1, given that M > Wk since k would not offer

unless it were less than M:


                         M   > wk) = E(MJ M > wk) + E(S)
                E(MJ j

                                  =         + 1)/2 + 0 > Wk
                                      (Wk


since Wk < 1    and since M and S are independent. Thus, it always pays

for j to match k's offer so k's raid cannot succeed if j                      is

uninformed. Thus, although k does not know whether j                  is informed or not,

it does not pay to raid under either situation.

     If j     assumes that k raids when k is uninformed as well as informed

that M > W, then j's counter—offer will still be high enough to make it

unprofitable for k to raid when uninformed. That is, the equilibrium will

not be rational because j        assumes that k raids when uninformed, but it

does not pay for k to do so when j maintains that assumption.

     The reason is that k knows that it can win a bidding war against j

only when j is informed that M + S < Wk. (If                  j   is uninformed,   j


follows k so k cannot outbid j.) Under those circumstances, when k

wins, it receives


                                 E(MI M + S < wk) — Wk


Equation (1) (and footnote 7) imply that this expression is negative. Thus,

it does not pay for k to raid when uninformed so this violates j's initial

assumption.

     This somewhat lengthy discussion boils down to the conclusion that k's

optimal strategy is to pass when uninformed. Thus, no raids occur at node 1.

This means that j        keeps the worker at wage W and has an expected rent of

(1/2 — W).
                                        —7—



      Things are more interesting when k is informed. Under those circum-

stances, raids can take place, but are not automatic. Node 2 is reached when

k is informed. There are two possibilities: k knows that M > W                   (node
2.1) or k knows that M<W (node 2.2). When M<W, it does not pay for

k to raid because a successful raid would result in losses of W — M.                As it

turns out, j's expected rent at this node is negative as well:9


(2)                   J's Rent at 2.2 = E(M +    sJ M    < W)   —   W


                                       =
                                           E(MJ M < w)    + E(S) -      W


                                       = W/2 —   W   = —W/2


      At node 2.1, when k is informed that M > W, it pays to raid. There

is some positive probability that k will attract the worker at a price less

than M. Th see this, recognize that a raiding k encounters either an

informed or uninformed j. If j        is uninformed (node 2.1.1),           j   must infer

MJ from the fact that k raided. As already noted, j's inference is that

E(MJI H > W) = (w   + 1)/2   > w so j matches every offer by Ic.1° Under these

circumstances, j retains the worker, but the expected rent to j from doing

so is exactly zero since k drops out of the bidding only when the wage offer

has reached H.

      The reason that k engages in this bidding war is that k does not know

that j   is uninformed and when j      is informed, k earns profit from the

battle. That occurs at node 2.1 .2. There,       j    is informed. The only factor

that distinguishes j from k at this point is the specific factor, S. If

S > 0 then j will always end up out—bidding k and will retain the worker.

Since k and j only see Mk and                 respectively, and not M and S

separately, they do not know the outcome of the bidding until it has actually

occurred. This is shown at node 2.1 .2.1 •       There     j    retains the worker, but
                                       —8-



ends up paying M for him because k drops out of the bidding only when the

wage has gone to M. The expected rent that j            receives at node 2.1.2.1. is


                  J's rent at 2.1.2.1 =          —
(3)
                                          E(Mj       MI M > W, S > 0)
                                      = E(SI M >       w),   S > 0)

                                      = ct/4


      If   S < 0, then j will lose the bidding war. This occurs on node

2.1.2.2. Firm j earns no rent (the worker leaves before work takes place),

but firm k earns profit. Firm j drops out of the bidding only when the

wage has reached M ÷ S, or if M +     S   < W, then j never counters. Firm k
receives M in output from the worker, at wage = Max[W, M +              SI. Since M > W
and M > M + S,    k earns rents.

      It is node 2.1.2.2 that generates k's desire to raid. Although k

does nothing other than raise the worker's wages on nodes 2.1.1 and 2.1.2.1,

k is successful in stealing the worker at 2.1.2.2 and earns profit from doing

so. There, k pays either W or M =           M    + S   when S < 0       for the worker,

but receives M. If W <          then j drops out when the wage reaches
                                                                                    M.
Thus, k receives —S on each worker. If W >                     then j    does not even

respond to k's first offer and k receives M — W.                This also shows why it

is important to have some firm—specific output. Firm k wins the worker

when s is negative, If S were always zero, then k would never raid.

Although   cx may be very small, all that is required is that it remain

positive to make it profitable for k to raid.

      Node 2.1.2.2 is special also because it is the only situation in which

turnover occurs. This happens with probability P2(1 — W)/2.              Since, as will

be shown below, W is decreasing in P, turnover increases as P rises.

More "visible" occupations have more turnover. A number of related empirical

implications are discussed later.12

Equilibrium and Offer Matching:

     The interactions described above yield equilibrium:   j   assumes that k

raids if and only if k is informed that M > W. Under that assumption, it

pays for k to do just that. An alternative equilibrium, in which j

assumes that k raids when informed that M > W or when k is uninformed,

is not consistent. Under these circumstances, k prefers not to raid when

uninformed. Other possibilities (k raids only when uninformed or when

informed that M < W) do not yield consistent equilibria either.13

     One interesting feature of battles between j and k is that k hopes

that j is informed. The reason is that if j      is ignorant, j's best

response is to follow k, so that k can never succeed in attracting the

worker. If j is informed, then j allows the worker to leave when S <          0.
It is under these circumstances that k makes money. What is also true, of

course, is that the worker ends up being employed efficiently.

     Also note that it is rational for j to match offers. The pattern of

offer matching varies, however, with j's information. If       j   is uninformed,

then j takes all cues from the market. It always pays to respond to k. If

j is informed,    j only responds to k's offer up to M + S.        If S is

negative, this means that the worker receives a wage less than M, even

 though a raid has occurred. So the worker prefers that k be informed that

M > W,   but that j be uninformed. Under these circumstances, he receives

 M. If both are informed, he receives M when S > 0, but only the maximum

 of M ÷ S and W when S < 0. This is necessarily less than


 Derivation of the Initial Wage Offer:

      Firm j   operates in a competitive labor market and cannot attract

 workers unless it offers the highest wage consistent with zero profits (and

 behaves efficiently). This means that W must be set so that j's expected
                                           —10—



rent on hiring a worker at W is zero. Of course, this takes into account

that the level of W affects the number of raids that occur and that if a

raid occurs, the worker is paid a wage other than W.

       Firm j    earns rent at nodes 1, 2.1.2.1, and negative rent at node 2.2.

Thus, the expected rent is the probability of arriving at those nodes, times

the expected rent at the relevant node. The zero rent condition is given by


(4)      Expected Rent = 0 = (1 —   P)[   1/2 — WI   +   (1_W)[a/4] + PW[—W/2]


Solving (4) for W yields two roots, one of which is always negative and

attracts no workers. The other is given by


(5)           w =j.{cQ2_ 8P + 8 +   /(2_     8P 1-   8)2_ 16P4P — 4 -

       This rather messy expression can be made intuitive in two ways: First,
note   that

(6)                          urn W =   (/T + P — 1)/P
                              aO
Although      a cannot be exactly zero (or k never raids), it is instructive to

examine behavior at the limit.

       As a becomes zero, the rent associated with node 2.1.2.1 goes to zero

as well. This means that the rent that the firm earns on node 1 must offset

the "winner's curse" effect on node 2.2. consider what happens if P = 0.

Under these circumstances, k never raids, so that j             is   left with the

entire distribution of workers. The expected value of M +             S   for the entire

population is 1/2 so W =     1/2. The limit of the r.h.s. of (6) as P goes to
O is 1/2.     If P = 1,   then a raid occurs any time the worker's wage is below

his marginal product. Since S = 0,          this means that the firm ends up paying

M for all workers with M > W (or losing them) which yields zero rent. But

it also ends up paying W for all workers with M < W. This is a losing

proposition for any W > 0 so the solution when P =               1    is w = 0.   Substitu-


tion of P =   1   into (6) yields W = 1.

      For 0 < P < 1, W is bounded by zero and 1/2. The intuition is

straightforward. Firm j knows that for any W,                it will lose P2(1 — W)/2

to firm k. This is illustrated in figure 2 by the shaded area so that j is

left with the unshaded area. It must be the case that the W is chosen so

that the expectation of M, over the distribution reflected by the unshaded

area (normalized), is equal to W. A lower W means that more workers are

picked off. It is clear that W must lie below 1/2 in order for the

expectation after having removed the shaded area to equal W. Only if nothing

were removed from the upper portion (i.e., if P =              0),    would the expectation

of M among the stayers be 1/2.

      Stated in other terms, there are only two reasons that a worker is not

                     ci approaches 0. Either his value to both j               and k is
stolen away when

below W so that k opts not to raid, or that M >                  W    but k is uninformed.

 As P increases, the probability that the worker is unraided merely because

 k is uninformed declines, so that workers who             remain    tend to be lower

 quality. As such, W must fall to compensate.

      When    ci is greater than zero, (5) is difficult to interpret, but numeri-
                                                                                        ci and
 cal solutions are instructive. Table 1 calculates W for values of

 P as given by (5).

       The first two columns of table 1 report the value of W that yields zero

         This observation gives rise to a number of implications.       E'irst, the

 probability of turnover is

 and      i/3P <   0.   Individuals in more visible occupations are more likely to

 change jobs.

         More important, perhaps, is that it is individuals from the top of the

 distribution who get raided. They are both more likely to change jobs and are

 also more likely to have their wages raised above the initial quote. Because

 of imperfect information about worker quality, the initial wage offer tends to

overvalue low quality workers and undervalue high quality ones. Outsiders

attempt to pick off only the high quality ones. All firms know this when they

hire workers of uncertain quality, and that is the reason why W is generally

lower than 1/2. But it is still true that the
                                                    first employer ends up with
workers whose average product is below that of the ex ante distribution.

        It is appropriate for employers to respond to outside offers because

those offers convey information about the
                                              worker. Additionally, even when the
current employer has complete information about

state implications in terms of other

      The conclusion then is that independent of the source of variations in

                                    and the initial wage that j offers (and that

 continues     to match until k outhids him). Thus, the wage that one observes
 in    an occupation   is made up of the    wage       of leavers and stayers. Since stayers
 come from two groups (those who are raided and stay and those
                                                               who are never

         The expected wage for leavers is a convex combination of those who leave

at wage W and those who leave after a battle between j and k, at wage

M + S. This is somewhat messy to derive and is relegated to the appendix. it

is     given by

than after a bidding war, and from the appendix,

        The expected wages for leavers and stayers are given in columns 3 and 4

of table 1. Leavers' wages decline moriotonically in P, but stayers' wages

do riot. Stayers' wages are either W or M. The fall of W with increased

P is offset by the higher probability of receiving M rather than W as P

rises. Leavers' wages fall in P because a higher P                   implies a lower W.

  Iritra—firin Wage Dispersion and Stigma:

         As P increases, the difference between the wage of unraided and wages

 of raided workers who remain with the firm rises.                Recall that workers who are
 raided necessarily have M > W.         Also recall that those workers who remain

 after a raid are paid M (nodes 2.1.2.1 and 2.1.1).                  Now,


                         E(MI M > W and S       > 0) =   E(MI M >

 because     M and S    are   independent.     This implies that the        expected wage at
 both nodes are the same and equal to (1 +         Thus, the gap between the
                                                      W)/2.

 expected wage paid to those who remain, hut are raided and those who are not
 raided is
 (10)             Internal wage gap       (1 +   W)/2 —   W       1/2 — W/2


 Differentiating (10) with respect to P yields

                                /aP   = —1/2   (/aP)          0

Thus,    the difference between the way that raided and unraided workers are

treated depends   positively on the visibility of the occupation.
        This proposition has obvious intuitive appeal. If P is small
                                                                                     then

that M < W. Recall that there are two reasons why a raid does not Occur: The

worker may have M > W, but the outside firm has not discovered this; the

worker is an undiscovered star. Alternatively, the worker has M < W so that

he is already overpaid and is not susceptible to raid. As P rises so that

his output becomes more visible, the likelihood of being an undiscovered star

declines, so that wages of those left unraided must decline.                  Therefore,
workers in visible jobs who do not receive outside offers are worse oft than

those without outside offers in less visible jobs.

 of M among raided workers necessarily rises. After an unsuccessful, raid,

 workers receive M (as opposed to W or M +          5).   Therefore, the variance in

 wages among raided workers who remain rises with occupational turnover rates.

           A similar argument. holds for raided workers who leave. An increase in P

 implies that W falls. Those who Leave either receive W or M +            S   (S K   0).
 The last paragraph implies that increases in P increase the variance in
 M +   S    since S is independent of M. Additionally, since W        declines in

 P, and since the wage of raided workers always equals or exceeds       w, a
 reduction in W adds variance. Finally, since the proportion of job

 switchers who receives the constant W is given by 0, and since 0

 increases in W, an increase in P which reduces W           implies fewer job
switchers with W. Thus, the variance in wages among leavers increases with

 the level of occupational turnover. All of these predictions are empirically

testable as well.


Raiders' Profits:

       The model, as it stands, carries the implication that
                                                                the raiding firm,
k, has positive expected profits, whereas the initial firm, j,         does   not.
This is a direct result of awarding k an exogenous P that is greater than

zero. Since k can raid selectively, and since it sometimes has information

that the worker is underpaid, it owns a specialized factor. When k is

informed and when S < 0, profits are made. The profit that k receives is

the rent to that specialized factor that places k in the right place at the

right time. Competition does not imply that rents to specialized factors must

be dissipated.

       On the other hand, since the new—hire market is competitive,     j must
compete with other firms, including k, that are ex ante identical. Even

though at the time that the worker is hired, M is not known, the
                                                                       possibility

  that it will be learned forces all
                                         i—type firms to push up W Until expected
  profit is zero.

       Raiders' profits would also be zero if we allowed that there were a cost

  to acquiring P. Suppose that there were a number of potential k firms who

 were competing for the right to know a worker's
                                                     output with probability P.
 The price of that information would be
                                            driven up to the point where k's
 expected profits were zero as well. The rent would revert to another factor

 of production. For example, if the information were acquired by
                                                                 reading the
 AER, then the Review's price would rise until
                                                    k's expected profits were
 zero. This trivial change prevents all firms from wanting to enter the

 raiding business, rather than the new—hire business.


 Productivity and Job—Tenure:

      The Peter Principle says that workers keep getting promoted until they

can no longer handle the job. Stated
                                           alternatively, the newest workers in a
job have a higher probability of being promoted out of that job than the older

ones. The fact that a worker has been in
                                              a job for a long time means that he
has not been raided successfully in the
                                            past. That failure reflects one of
Lhree things: 1. The worker was raided, but S > 0 so that the worker

remained at the job. 2. M > W but no outsider discovered it.
                                                                     3. M ( W so
a raid was not profitable.

     Pure job matching predicts the opposite of the Peter Principle since it

implies that over time, workers (Jet sorted to their most productive job.

Thus, individuals with higher levels of tenure in the job are likely to be a

better match than those with low tenure.      As such, the older workers in the

job should have higher productivity. This is the effect of point #1 in the

last paragraph. Obviously, the importance of the matching effect depends on

      To extend the concept to within—firm promotion, it is necessary to think

 of j and k as departments within a firm. This changes things somewhat

 because one expects cooperation between departments to a greater extent than

 between firms. But as long as some rivalry exists, say due to the failure to

 solve all agency problems perfectly, the analysis still holds.19


 Search and kiemployment:

      The implications of this model differ from those of search theory in an

 important respect. The stigma effect discussed above relates to the negative

 information that firms obtain from the failure to be raided. A simple rein-

 terpretation of the model provides implications for the relation of unemploy-

ment to wages.

     Stigma may refer to workers who suffer spells of unemployment and find

that subsequent demand for their services is adversely affected. Indeed, there

is a significant literature that attempts to analyze these spells and to

determine whether they are the result of inherent worker heterogeneity or of

the signalling effect of unemployment.20

     This paper focuses on job changes without unemployment. However, if the

current firm,    j,   is reinterpreted as the state of unemployment and   W is
defined as the reservation wage, then the model applies to unemployed workers

as well. As the worker is "unraided" out of unemployment, the worker's

expectations about his opportunities change. He updates W based on the bad

news. Individuals who leave the state of unemployment quickly have the

highest expected wages since the expected wage of leavers generally exceeds

1/2. Those who are unemployed for longer periods have lower expected wages

because they are, on average, lower ability workers and their reservation

wages are lower on average.

 unemployed during expansions. Intuitively, there is not much stigma

 associated with being unemployed during a recession because few firms are

 looking for workers. But if the worker cannot find a job during an expansion,

 then he is more likely to be a bad apple. The effect of unemployment on

 subsequent wages can be estimated and it is straightforward to test whether

 this varies with business cycle conditions.



 III. Summary and Conclusion

      Since a significant fraction of job changes occur without intervening

 spells of unemployment, it is important that the theory of job turnover and

wage dynamics incorporate this feature. It implies that only certain types of

workers, namely those who are currently underpaid, are raided by outsiders.

Thus, raids and turnover are selective. All firms recognize this fact and

wages adjust accordingly. Worker heterogeneity is at the heart of the

analysis; job changers are different from those who remain with their firm.

On average, leavers have higher levels of general productivity than stayers,

although stayers who have been raided (unsuccessfully) in the past have the

highest average productivity specific to the current firm.

     The theory gives rise to a number of specific implications regarding the

relation of wage levels and changes to job changes.   Turnover, which proxies

market information in equilibrium, moves a worker's wage toward marginal

product. The analysis has attempted to provide a general theory of

occupational wage dispersion. Additionally, the theory implies:

     1. Raids are selective. The best workers are more likely to receive

outside offers. This means that the initial wage does not fully adjust for

quality.
                                    —26—




    2. It is rational for firms to treat workers with outside offers

differently from those without them since the offer carries information about

the relation of productivity to current wage.

     3. The oldest workers on the job are the least productive. This Peter

principle result is the opposite of that suggested by a theory of job

matching.

 include tazear (1979), Lazear and Rosen (1981), and Harris and Holmstrom

 absence of unemployment is Jovanovic (1979).      Although the theory of specific

much indeterminacy remains to have a very informative set of predictions.

                                              —29—



   the firm knows M. Recall that
                                         the firm is only informed P           of the time so
   (1 — P)   of the time   only   knows the distribution and     W is the optimum under
  these circumstances. This means that          1

  demands a wage greater than        W will be let go. For most
                                                                       reasonable values of
  P (likely to be small), it is
                                       optimal for the worker merely to
                                                                                accept w.
  There are two caveats: First, if
                                         the worker costlessly and immediately can
  obtain another job that pays w, then all workers with M
                                                          >                W    try to bar-
  gain. Second, if the demand by the worker conveys the
                                                                     appropriate information
  to the firm about M, it
                                  may pay to bargain even if the firm is uninformed
  (see the discussion by
                            Fudenberg and Tirole (1983) on the effects of adding a
 period to a game). Note also that the higher is M, the
                                                           more the worker has
 to gain so the more likely is the worker to demand a
                                                      wage greater than w.
      131t might seem that an informed j would behave
                                                      differently with
 respect to high_ability workers than with respect to low—ability
                                                                  ones. This
 is not correct. The informed
                                      j could make W a function of M. But
 nothing is gained for workers with        M > W.    No W(M) <   M     acts as a deterrent
 to an informed k. No W(M)
                                    > M is necessary if k is informed and no
uninformed k raids.
                           Nothing is gained by conditioning          w on M, even
when j has the information to do so.

     Further, risk—neutral workers who do not know their abilities
                                                                   will not
sign with any firm that retains the right to reduce
                                                           wages after observing M.
This would result in an
                           expected wage for unraided workers that is less than
W and since w to unraided
                             workers guarantees zero profit, a fixed W to
all unrajded workers dominates.
                                 A fixed W is also less susceptible to moral
hazard where the firm
                      attempts to deceive the worker into
                                                                      believing that M
is small.
