1.   Introduction


     The idea that there is a systematic relationship between yield and

term to maturity on debt instruments is a persuasive one aria accounts for

one of the largest literatures in monetary economics, that of the term to

maturity structure of interest rates.       On a purely descriptive level? the

scatter of points recording observed yield and term to maturity for

securities within a particular class at a given time strongly suggests the

existence of an underlying smooth function relating yield to maturity.

Such a function is called a yield curve.

     The fitting of yield curves to yield/maturity data goes back at least

to the pioneering efforts of David Durand (1942) whose method of fitting

was to position a French curve on the scatter of points in such a way     that

 the resulting curve appeared subjectively reasonable.          Yield •may be

 transformed to present value and 3. Huston PicCulloch (1971, 1975) has

 proposed approximating the present value function by a piecewise polynomial

 spline fitted to price data. 6ary Shea (1982, 1984) has shown that the

 resulting yield function tends to bend sharply towards the end of the

 maturity range observed In the sample.         This would seem to be a most

 unlikely property of a true yield curve relationship and also suggests that

 these models would not be useful for prediction outside the sample• maturity

 range.   Other researchers have fitted a variety of parametric models to

 yield curves, including Cohen, Kramer, and Waugh (1966); Fisher (1966);

 Echols and Elliott (1976); Dobson (1978); and Chambers, Carleton and

 Waldman (1984).    Some of these are based on polynomial regression; and all

 include at least a linear term hich would force extrapolated very long—

    shapes are encountered in the sample.      Study of the residuals reveals
    specific maturity effects not previously identified.       Extrapolation of
    yields outside the maturity range of bills allows us to predict the price

    of a long term bond.         Comparison of the actual bond price with that

    predicted by the basic model suggests refinements to the fitting procedure

    and directions for further research.


    2.     Motivation for the Model


           A U.S. Treasury bill is a promise to pay the amount of its face value

    on a stated maturity date. Since there are no interim coupon payments on a
    bill    the market price Is necessarily less than its face value.   The yield

    on     the bill is defined to be that rate of return which produces the face

    value from an investment equal to the market price in the time remaining

    until maturity.       Arbitrage assures that all bills with a given maturity

    date sell at the same price, and therefore have the same yield, at any

    instant in time.       Bills of different maturities may of course sell at

    prices which imply different yields to maturity at the same point in time.

    The yields on any two bills of different maturities imply a forward yield

    or rate for the time Interval between the maturities of the two bills.     If


    the laturities are, say, m1 days and m2 days (m2 > m1) then an investor can

    secure the forward rate of return for an (m2—m1) day period to begin m1

    days hence by selling bills of m1 days to maturity and replacing them with

S   bills of m2 days to maturity.     The incentive to do this will vary directly

    with the difference between the forward rate available in the market and

    the investor1s assessment of the rates of return which are ljkely to be

    available In the market on bills of (m2—m1) days to maturity m1 days from

it   alec suonests that forward rates il I                             not   exhibit     increasino

tiuctuatione           as         one considers lonoer maturities because it                  seems

implausible      that expected +uture interest rates would vary increasinolv as

crc I coke.   further        into the future.
      considerations cf this sort lead               us   to   posit    that a satisfactory model
for the iel curve must imply forward rates that are smooth as a function
of horizon and that oscillations in the function, if any must damp down.
These will also be properties of the yield curve because yield to maturity
can be expressed as a sTioothinQ of the intervenino forward rates.
Specifically,          consider the forward rate               implied by bills of a days to
maturity and               mi ÷ ) days where        is arbitrarily small.              This is an
instantaneous forward rate which we will denote by r(mi. The definition of
the forward rate implies that


                       =    i/ff      r(x)dx

wnere                as the vied to maturity        on a bill maturinaj in a days.             Thus,

yield to maturity is just an averaae of the forward rates.                             Equivalently,

the forward          rate rim) is given by

               rni) = Rirn. + mP(m;

where R       (in)    is   the slope of the yield curve at maturity m.                  This second
 equation points out that any wrinkles in the yield curve, giving rise to
 large   values of the slope, have a maqnified effect on forward rates as we

 consider laroer maturities.                   IF   our hypothesis that the forward rate
function becomes smoother with increasing a is correct, then the relation

between R(m) and m must be even smoother.

     Do actual yields on bills, plotted against maturity, display the

smoothness we expect to find?     To form a preliminary impression, consider

the plot of U.S. Treasury bill yields displayed in Figure 1.         These are

continuously compounded yields at an annual rate computed from closing

asked discount yields •on the New York Federal Reserve quote sheet for

January 22, 1981.     The yields rise as a function of maturity untjl about

100 days maturity and then decline generally until about 300 days maturity

where they appear to level off.     To be an acceptable candidate to fit this

data a function needs to have the capability of rising to a maximum and

then falling monotonically towards an asymptotic value.

     Polynomials are clearly not acceptable by this criterion.       Whilt they

readily form hump shapes, they do not settle down to an asymptotic value but

instead head off towards plus or minus infinity.       Of course, by choosing a

polynomial of sufficiently high degree we can pet a very close fit to the

data In the senseof generating a curve which comes close to the data

points. .A polynomial of degree equal to the number of data points less one

can be constructed that coincides exactly with each data point.             The

function Itself will fluctuate wildly between the data points and one would

have to be willing to believe that yields on bills ar'e coincidentally close

to one another only at the specific maturities which the Treasury happens

tobave issued. This essential difficulty with the behavior of polynomials

can be mitigating by the method of splines which uses low' degree

 polynomlils •to fit different sections of the maturity spectrum, Joining

 them together at points called knots.       It is easy to imagine that the data

 of Figure 1 could be fitted quite closely by one quadratic polynomial over



                                         5
the range zero to 130 days1 another over 130 to 180 days! and a third over

180 to 350 days.        This would be in the spirit of McCulloch's work although

he fitted splines to prices rather than yields.                   Our view of polynomial

splines is that they are a patchwork approach to the problem which does not

overcome the fundamental shortcoming of polynomials; that their slope tends

to increase labsolutely) topiards longer maturities.                   From the relation of

yields to forward rates it is clear that the forward rate function will

diverge even more rapidly.            Extensive analysis of spline results by Shea

(1982, 1984) shows that even when the fitted yield curve appears reasonable

within much of the maturity range of the data, the implied forward rates

display erratic bhavlor at the high end of the range.                      We would like to

develop a class of models which incorporate Intrinsically the smoothness

and asymptotic damping we expect                      of   yield curves and the implied

forward rates.         Such models could meaningfully address the question: what

is. the yield we may expect to see on a 360 day bill to be issued by the

Treasury, today given observed yield on bills presently trading which have

maturities only up to 330 days? In contrast, polynomial splines are poorly

equipped to predict out—of—sample.

      A. class of models which does possess the properties we seek is that

formed by the solutions to ordinary differential or difference equations.

Since the latter will be more familiar to most readers, consider the second

order difference equation                                                   .
                                                                   .
                                                              .
                                                                                      .

    equation is stable.         If the roots are real and lie outlide the unit circle

    the solution has the form

                                                                                            82

    are constants determined by the initial conditions.             The parameters 1 and

    2 are time constants which determine the rate at which the terms expt—m/11

    decay to zero.     Thus, at maturity m=1 we have exp(—1) =         0.37,    at maturity

    m2T we have exp(—2) — 0.14,               and so forth.       As . gets large both

    exponential terms become small so r(m) approaches                 as its asymptotic

    level. Differing rates of decay implied by 1 and 2 allow rim) to take on

    humped shapes as well as monotonic shapes.

         Some theories of the term structure of interest rates imply forward

    rate equations of this form.           The classical expectations theory equates

    forecasts of short rates, which might be represented by a stochastic

    difference equation, to forward rates.             Richard (1978) studied a model in

    which the term structure depends on two state variables: the real rate and

     the rate of inflation.            Under certainty the forward rate function in

    Richard's model has precisely the above form if the two state variables

     each obey a first order differential equation.                Under uncertainty the

     forward rate is a more complex function of exponentials.            While we do not

     feel obliged to tie our model to any specific model of the term structure,
I
     these considerations add to the presumption that this is a class of models
     worth investigating.




                                                   7
        Implementation of this model presents some practical difficulties

because of the interchangeability of (81,t1) and iD2I2); if the numerical

values of those pairs of parameters are switched around we have the same

function, a potential source of computer confusion.               A more readily

implemented model with similar shape characteristics has the form


(2.1)             r(m) =    + B1 exp(—m/1) + 821(m/I)   *   expl—m/'t)].

This function arises as the solution to the second order difference

equation in the case of equal roots, or alternatively may be derived as an

approximation to the solution in the unequal roots case by replacing one of

the two exponential terms by its Taylor's series expansion (Appendix A).

The parameters of this model are more easily estimated because the model is

linear in B,        and 2 for any provisional value of 1..

        Model (2.1) may also be viewed as a constant plus a Laguerre Eunction,

which      suggests a method for generalization to higher—order models.

Laguerre Functions consist of a polynomial, times an exponential decay term

and are a mathematical class of approximating functions; details may be

found (for example) in Courant and Hilbert (1953, pp..

        While   higher order models could generate more complex shapes, it is

not hard to show that even the second order model given above has

considerable shape flexibility and is therefore parsimoneous.              Note that

r(0)is (B0+Bi) and the limiting value of r(m) as m gets large is simply B0

Setting these. arbitrarily at zero and one respectively for the purpose, of

studying shape and noting again that 1' is only a time scale parameter md

may be set at one for the same purpose, we are left with a function of one

parameter only

            rim) =    1       — t1—am expi—mi.


Allowing this single shape parameter to vary from -6 to 12 in equal

increments produces the range of shapes seen in Figure 2.               Tnese incluae

humps, S—shaped, and monotonic curves.                 Shapes produced by vertically

inverting these curves are also possible under this model, easily allowing

decreasing curves.

        To obtain yield as a function of maturity for the second order model

one integrates r(*) in (2.1) from zero to m and divides by m.                     The

resulting function is


(2.2)      Rim) =    8o +           +    * £1—exp(—m/1)]/(m/1) —
                                                                   2 exp (—mit)
which is also linear in coefficients, given i. The limiting value of R(m)

as m gets large is B and as m gets small is (So+Bj) which are necessarily

the same as for the forward rate function since Rim) is just an averaging

of r(*).      The range of shapes available for Rim) depends again on a single

parameter since for 1              1, B = 1, and (8 + B1) = 0 we have

             Rim) —       1   — (1—a) * [1—exp(—m)]im — a * exp(—mi.


Allowing a to take on valuès'from —6 to 12 in equal increments generates

the shapes displayed In Figure 3 which include humps, 9—ihapes, and

monotonic curves.               On the basis of the range of shapes available to us in

the second order model our operating hypothesis is that we will be able to

capture the underlying relationship between yield and term to maturity

 without resorting to more complex models involving more parameters.              Wood

 (1983) presents yield curves fitted by traditional methods annually from

The expressi 01 in              braces may be      interpreted as trio lone tore component of

starts        out at zero and            also decays at a rate much slower than exponential,

namely        i,e. The second term is the short tore component since it starts at
a value of unity and has the fastest possible texponenti al                          decay to zero.
Thisdocoinposition is illustrated in Figure 4.                         It is easy to see how with
appropriate choice of weights for those components we can generate curves
with humps                in thee and ones which are monotonic '.but not necessarily a
simple exponential function.;

         U.S. Treasury Bills


         The        objective       of   our empirical work is to assess the adequacy of the

second          order model for describing the relationship between yield and term

yield        is   intended to present the bill yield on a basis comparable to that
of      a bond which pays a         half—yearly coupon.              The exact formula +or doing
this        is not,      to   our knowledue, available publically.                           Bill prices
themselves are not displayed but are readily calculated from the discount

yields.           We have converted the asked di scount to the corresponding pra ce

(that paid by an investor) and then calcui ated the continuously compounded

rate of return from delivery date to maturity                         date annualized to a 365.25
day year.            These yields are the data we fit to the yield curve                              model.

Observations on the tirst two maturities,                                 anu lu oavs,       are oeitteo
because           the yields are consistently higher, presumably due to relatively

large       transaction costs over a short term to maturity.                        Thus leaves       thirty
yield/maturity          pairs observed on each of thirty—four market dates                                and

thirty—one         on three dates.

            For purposes c-f fitting yield curves we have paranieterlzed tne model

For any provisional value of 1 we may readily calculate sample values of

over    a   ranoe of values       for T reveals            the overall best—fttinq values of T

a, b, and c.        Recall      that T is a ties constant                which    deteranes the rate           at

which the       reoressor variables decay to zero. Plots of the data sets reveals
that the yield/maturit relationship becomes quite flat in the range 200                                        to
00 days              n   F cure    13   ,   suqaesti na       that    best—fz tt nq values of               would

he in the ranos 50 to               100.       We consequently search over a               grid from. 10 to

200 in increments of 10, and also 250,                        300, and 35.
         Small values of T correspond to rapid decay in the regressors and
therefore will           be   able to fit curvature at               law maturities well, while being

unable        to     fit excessive curvature over                         longer        maturity       ranges.
Correspondingly, large values                        of t     produce slow     decay    in the     regressors

which can fit            curvature      over   longer       maturity ranges but will be unable to
+OiiOJ          extreme       curvature        at    short      maturities.         This    trade—off           is
illustrated         in Figure        5 which shows the yields observed an                    February          19,

 1981.        The yields rise quite sharply at low maturities, from 13.80 percent
at     17   days to 14.94 percent at 59 days maturity. This portion of the data
 is    fitted    such better by a           model    with       = 20   than one with ¶           100   as    shown

 by the two continuous curves plotted in                        Figure   5.      On the other hand, the
 smaller           value produces a          poor    fit    over   the maturity range above            200    days

 relative to that provided by the larger value.                                  The best overall fit          for


 this data set is glven by T = 40 (not plotted).
            It is also         oui te clear         from Fi   oure 5   that    no set   of values       of the
 parameters would fit             the data perfectly,                nor is   it our objective to find a

 model which wou1d do so.                    A more highly parameterized model which could

 follow all the wiggles in the data is less likely to predict well, in our
view, than a more parsimoneous model which assumes more smoothness in the

underlying relationship than one observes in the data.      There are a number

of reasons why we would not expect the data to coniorm to the sct

underlying   relationship between yield and maturity even if we knew what it

was.    For example, there is not continuous trading in all bills, so

published quotes will reflect transactions whicn occurred at different

points in time during the trading day.        Bills of specific maturities may

sell at a discount or premium.    We hope that by studying departures of the

data from the fitted model we can identify !ntgn&Ls as well as
Idosyncratic features of the data which the model is failing to cApture.

       The basic results for the second order model fitted to each of the 37

data sets are presented in Table 1.         The first column gives the data set

number, the second column the best fitting value of 1, the third column the

standard deviation of residuals in basis points (hundreths of a percent),

and the fourth column the value of R—squared.         Median values of these

statistics over the 37 samples are given at the end of the table.           Ihe

first point worth noting is that the model accounts for a very large

fraction of the variation in bill yields; median R—squared is .959.         The

median standard deviation of residuals is 7.25 basis points, or .0725

percentage points, or a .000725 in yield.         Standard deviations range from

 about 2 basis points to about 20.    Best fitting values of ¶ have a median

 of 50.      They occurred at the lower boundary of the search range 1T10) in

 two cases and at the upper boundary (1=365) in three cases. The first data

 set, •which was seen in Figure 1, is displayed In Figure 6 along with the

 fitted yield curve.     It is clear from the pattern of deviations from the

 curve that residuals are not random but rather seem to exhibit some

not   readily apparent in Figure 8 is                    that    the plotted portion of    the     curve

represents only the rising portion of a very long hump see Fioure 9) which

ultimately decays to an asymptotic yield of —.025. Clearly the best fit to

the   S35i e does       not    guarantee sensi ble extrapolation.               Al thouch the best
fitting    values of          vary considerably, as these examples indicate! rather

 little precision of fit is lost + we impose the median value of 50 for                                t

 column of Table 1 and have a median value of 7.82 basis Diflt5q or only .57

 basis    points higher than when each data set was allowed to choose its own

         For a few data sets this cor!straint makes a noticeable difference, as

 in the case of data set No. B,                    for example, a small ¶ seems preferable.

 However in the cases where 1 was 3b5 the constraint costs little in terms

 of   precision.         The     overall results. suggest            that little may be gained in

 practice    by fitting T to each data set individually.

       The ability of the second order model to ocnerate hump shapes was one
of its attractive attributes conceptuaily but the question remains whether
this flexibility is important empirically. n alternative more simple

model would be a simple exponential function for forward rates obtained by

setting 8,      equal        to zero in equation        (2.1).      The corresponding yield

function then has only the first term in which maturity appears in the

denominator but not the second term as can be seen by setting ,, = 0                          in


equation     (2.2).          Only     eonctonic ye1d curves can be generated bY this

restricted model.             The final column of Table               1   shows the standard

deviations of residuals resulting from imposing this constraint (but now

allowing     t to take its best fitting value).                  The median over the 37 data

sets is      9.00 basis         points compared with the 7.25              reported   for the

unconstrained model.             In some   cases the standard deviation rises sharply.

For example,      i.t        is no   surprise that a monotonic curve does not fit the

first data set well: the standard deviation rises from 16.09 to 46.71 basis

 points.      In some cases the standard deviation is reduced slightly because

the constrained model fits about as well and uses one less parameter.                      The

 ability to fit humps seems to have been quite important until the twenty—

 fourth data set (from January 1981 until October 1982) after which point
the shape of the yield curve seems to have become simpler and monotonic.

Thus there appears to be a persistence of shape over time.     Note that this

change in shape also seems to be associated with less dispersion in

residuals. Did the Federal Reserve start to stabilize interest rates again

in late 1982?     A casual inspection of the behavior of the federal funds

rate over this period certainly suggests that it did.


4.   Analysis of Residuals: Maturity and Issue Effects


     Plots of fitted yield curves against the data have suggested some

dependence of residuals along the maturity axis.    We would like to try to

determine whether this is due to a systematic influence of maturity on

yield which our model is unable to capture.      If such an effect persists

through time then we should be able to detect it in the average of the

thirty—seven residuals corresponding to a specific maturity.     Figure 12 is

a vertical stack of residual plots for the thirty—seven data sets with    the


averaged   residual at the bottom.        The individual residual plots are
 separated by intervals of 200 basis points and the scale for the averaged
residuals is lagnified by ten. The last data set appears at    the top of the

 stack.    Note that the first averaged   residual, corresponding to 17 days

 maturity, is positive, the second negative, followed by a rising pattern to

 Just under ninety days, a sharp drop, then a rising pattern again to just

 under 180 days and another sharp drop. This is seen more clearly in Figure

 13 where the magnified scale shows that these maturity effects are in the

 range —5 to +5 basis points which is large relative to a rough standard

 deviation of 1.2 basis points.   We surmise that the positive yield effect

 at 17 days is due.to higher tranmaction costs per unit time for shorter




                                     17
term bills.   Ihe fitted curve is pulled upward by this data point, leaving

the next point below the curve.    We also surmise that the peak at 87 aays

maturity and sharp drop following is due to the fact that 90 days is the

maturity of a substantial portion of the bills issued by the Treasury and

will therefore bulk large in the inventory on dealers shelves.   Similarly,

the Treasury tssues 180 day bills and 360 day bills and indeed we observe

the averaged residual rising to a peak at each of these maturities. To our

knowledge, these supply effects have not been previously documented nor

would they be apparent if our models did not impose quite a bit of

smoothness on the yield curve.     A purchaser of bills may or may not find

these maturity premiums sufficiently attractive to influence maturity

choice, but at least they are now visible.

     Issue effects are distinguished from maturity effects in •that they

pertain to the bills which mature on a particular date rather than to bills

with a pirticular term to maturity.        The issue of bills maturing on

December 31, 1981 were 339—day bills on our first quote sheet (January 22,

1981); became 311—day bills on our second quote sheet (February 19, 1981)

28 days later, and lo on through the months until they appear as 29—day

bills on the November 27, 1981 quote sheet. This gives us twelve residuals

 for this particular issue of bills.      Other issues will appear initially

 with only 178—days to maturity which gives us six residuals until the issue

 matures and disappears.   The plots of residuals are lined up in Figure 14

 so that each issue may be followed through time.    Averages are plotted at

 the bottom with the scale enlarged by a factor of three; these averages are

 shown on a larger scale In Figure 13.      There is some evidence in these

 plots that issue effects exist since large residuals for a particular issue




                                     18
show some tendency to persist t(OiT one quota steet to tre ret.                                 For

                                     the ninth data sat September 3,                1551) anu dad

compelling than that for maturity effects but would sees to warrant further
investigation.

5.      Prediction Out—of-Sample:
        Pricing a Long Term Bond


        One of our criteria -fora satisfactory yield curve model is that it be
able     to predict yields beyond the maturity range of the sample used to fit
it.     An unreasonably exacting test would be to ask it to predict the yaeld
or price of a long term government bond, but this is what we have tried to
do.      The particular bond chosen is the 12—3/4 percent coupon U.S. Treasury
bond maturing in 2010 (callable in 2O0) since this was the longest bond
appearing on all our quote sheets. A bond can of course be viewed as a
bundle of bills with maturities spaced at six month intervals until the
maturity date of the bond.             Each component bill pays an amount equal                   to
 the semi —annual coupon except the last which also pays                     the    face value of
 the bond.        Values      read   off a yield   curve   can be   used     to     discount    each

 component    bill     in the stream and the resulting total value can be compared

 with the quoted price of the bond, adjusting first for accrueo interest

 from   the last coupon       date which the buyer must pay to the seller.

and the secono term goes from unity to .0007 in                the same interval.          The

pricinG of the       bond is therefore determined      largely by the    asymptotic level

cf     the curve given by the intercept in the model             ..     Equival ently     the
value of the        intercept must be close to the yield to maturity on the               bond

if     the model   is to price the bond accurately.   Figure 16 is a plot of               the

actual price of the bond chronologically for the thirty—seven dates in our

sample      (light     ijflE) and the corresponding predicted prices (dark line)

produced by the model when we allow T to take            its   best fi tting value.        Two

predictions are drastically awry, the twelfth (138.063 aoainst an actual

price of ¶100. 34) and the twenty—second (404. 58 aqai nst an actual price of

¶103.59).          These    were both models which had large values of 1 (see Table

 2>.      In both cases the bill yield data was fitted as the rising portion of

 a     long hump    with   eventual decay to a much lower level which       was .079        for

 the     twel fth model and, as the reader may recall              neqative .025 for the
 twenty—second.            The resulting discount rates arm therefore too low and the
 predicted bond price correspondingly too high.                Constraining T    to   a   value

 of 50 in    both cases costs little in standard deviation            of fit (see Table 1)

 but improves the predictions of bond           prices dramatically, to          ¶105.77 and

 ¶102.52 respecti vely.            The improvement is cvi dent    in Figure 17 where the

high    and the yield curve downward sicipi ne the models overesti mated 1oner

the reverse was true when yields were relatively low and the yield curve
was upward slopinu.          Correcting the    price predictions for these systematic

biases by simple linear reqression, we              obtain    a standard deviation -for             the

adjusted bond price prediction of          only S2.63. Evidently4             the value of I         is
best    chosen by +ittin across data sets rather than by select1n the value

        What correspondence is there between the ability of a model to fit the
 bill yield data well and its accuracy in             estrapolating beyond the sample to

 predict the yield on a bond?           The short answer is             none necessarily.                A

h.    Summary and Conclusions


      The solution functIon of a second order differential equation provides
the basis for a             parsimoneous        model capable of representing        the range of
shapes     previ ously associated with the yield/term to maturity rel ationshi p
or    yield        curve.     It        has   a number of properties which are appealing a
priori: smoothness; ability to assume monctonic, humped                         end S—shapes; and

 asymptotic damping.               The mode! is able to account for about 96 percent of
the variation in U.S. Treasury bills across maturities during the 1981—53
 sample    period      with    a standard deviation of          residual errors of 7.25         basis

 points.       inalysis of residuals reveals                 maturity   effects which seem   to    be

 related      to    the specific eaturties issued by              the   Treasury.     E>:trapolation
 of   the fitted curves to price a long term Treasury bond suggests that the
 basic tmo         constant    in tne sodel exhbts consistency over time                and is best

 chosen on          the    basis   of    average experience across data        sets    rather     than

 individually        for    each yield curve. Given an           appropriate   value for the time
 constant the three remaining parameters are fitted by simple least squares,

 making the procedure operational in real time.                          polynomial fits the bill

 yield data as wail but             predicts      poorly out—of—sample.
               APPENDIX A:          THE PROPOSED MODEL AS AN APPROXIMATION
                                    IN THE UNEOIJAL ROOTS CASE


        The proposed Model (2.1)                 is

Our purpose is to show that this                      solution in    the   case of t->o equal roots.   of

the characteristic equation is in tact an appro1eat1On to the unequal root
solution    when those roots are not very different.

        Suppose the two roots give rise to decay rates                           and t   and hence to
the model


                  r(m)      =           +        exp(m/T1) + I exp(—m/T2.

If   we write 1112          = I/T           +   (liT2 — 1Ir1) and      expand   part of the      second


exponential    term to first order in this difference, we find
