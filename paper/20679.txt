                                               ABSTRACT

This study quantifies the importance of private information, separates the extent to which the positive
correlation between the accident probability and insurance coverage reflects adverse selection and
moral hazard, and analyzes market segmentation on objective accident risk. We use data we collected
to examine the importance of potential sources of private information in individuals third- and first-party
insurance choices. Individuals with higher subjective accident probabilities have less liability exposure
post insurance purchase and more often experience an accident, conditional on factors insurers use
for risk classification. This evidence is consistent with the positive correlation between accident occurrence
and liability insurance coverage. We find that the positive correlation almost completely reflects adverse
selection. In analysis of insurer sorting, we find that accident-free drivers obtain coverage from insurers
with higher independent agency quality ratings. High-quality insurers eschew low-quality drivers on
measured dimensions because these drivers are more likely to possess private information about their
driving ability and proclivities that affect expected loss. Drivers with a higher risk on factors observable
to insurers tend to have private information about their accident risk. This sorting process reflects an
institutional response to asymmetric information, and assures a continuous supply of private insurance
to unsafe drivers.

I. Introduction

       Adverse selection and moral hazard plague all types of insurance markets in varying

degrees. An additional anomaly of insurance markets is the important role of underwriting.

Rather than take all potential customers by setting premiums that cover expected losses, insurers

routinely reject applications from some potential customers. Various government interventions

designed to protect consumers have affected private insurance markets, including rules

pertaining to underwriting and premium-setting and mandatory insurance purchase

requirements. At least some of these interventions in combination with adverse selection and

moral hazard might be expected to discourage provision of certain types of coverage as well as

institutional responses by suppliers of insurance.

       Private information held by consumers is the source of adverse selection and moral

hazard. In the case of adverse selection, consumers possess some private information about the

probability of loss that is unknown to the insurer when insurance is purchased. In contrast, moral

hazard arises because having insurance causes behavioral changes of insureds not easily

observable by insurers. In the context of automobile insurance, adverse selection and moral

hazard occur when consumers possess an extensive amount of private information about their

accident risk, ex ante, i.e., before the insurance purchase for adverse selection, and drive with

less care conditional on the insurance purchase for moral hazard. In some cases, observable

information is, for practical purposes, “private” since private insurers are not allowed by statute

or regulation to use the information on accident risk in premium setting.

       This study of the U.S. automobile insurance markets in four states, North Carolina,

Pennsylvania, Washington, and Wisconsin, has three objectives: (1) to quantify the importance

of private information; (2) to explain the positive correlation between the extent of insurance




                                                                                                      2
coverage and ex post accident risk by quantifying moral hazard and hence to separate the extent

of adverse selection from moral hazard; and (3) to analyze the practice of segmenting the market

into good versus bad drivers as a response to private information and state restriction. Market

segmentation may be an efficient mechanism for supplying insurance in a market in which

consumers differ in terms of observable and unobservable accident risk.

       Empirical studies of insurance purchase decisions have demonstrated that consumers

possess private information when deciding whether to, and what insurance contract to purchase,

and importantly, their private information comes in multi-dimensional forms. This information

potentially comes from such sources as private information about risk types, as highlighted in

classical models of insurance markets (Rothchild and Stiglitz 1976), but also in preferences, e.g.,

risk aversion, thrill seeking, tastes for goods that may encourage risk taking such as alcohol, and

in subjective beliefs about the adverse consequences of risky behaviors. Also individuals may

differ in cognitive ability, which affects their knowledge of the law and adverse consequences of

risky behaviors, and, in the context of driving and automobile insurance, in their altruism toward

other drivers and in driving skills, which in turn may affect choice of insurance contract and the

amount of exposure to financial risk the individual bears when driving.

       Even though recent literature has made substantial progress toward understanding the

role of some types of private information, e.g., risk aversion, empirical analysis of sources of

private information available to consumers in making insurance purchasing decisions has relied

on data obtained from secondary sources. General-purpose surveys have sometimes included a

few questions about private information relevant to insurance choices. By contrast, this study

uses data collected specifically for our research. The data can be used to examine the

importance of a wide variety of potential sources of private information simultaneously in




                                                                                                   3
individuals’ choices of third-party and first-party insurance policies.

       We show that individuals with higher subjective probabilities of an accident have less

liability exposure—the objective of liability insurance being to reduce such exposure, and are

more likely to experience an accident ex post, conditional on factors used by insurers in risk

classification. This evidence is consistent with a positive correlation between accident

occurrence and liability insurance. We also show that individuals’ self-rating of driving ability

and subjective probability of reckless driving are important determinants of the individual’s

subjective probability of an accident.

       We use these underlying dimensions of private information about accident risk to

measure moral hazard. In particular, we take advantage of survey questions that elicit how

individuals’ subjective probabilities of reckless driving change in response to changes in

financial penalties from having a traffic violation, which is analogous to having different levels

of financial exposure to an accident. We use relationships previously established in this study

between subjective probabilities of reckless driving and subjective probabilities of an accident

and between subjective probability of an accident and ex post accident risk in combination with

our findings on responses to financial penalties to quantify moral hazard and thus separate

adverse selection from moral hazard.

       Finally, we investigate sorting of drivers among insurers based on drivers’ accident risk.

We observe a pattern that accident-free drivers select insurers, which are higher quality in terms

of ratings by independent agencies. Conceptually, there are two types of drivers, those with a

clean driving record during the past three years and those with prior accidents or violations

during this look-back period. Some insurers may eschew the risky type because these drivers are

likely to have private information about their driving abilities and proclivities that affect the




                                                                                                     4
future probability of a loss. This sorting process, which leads to some insurers specializing in

provision of coverage to high risk/high loss variance drivers, reflects an institutional response to

asymmetric information and assures a continuous supply of private insurance to unsafe drivers.

       This study makes several contributions to research on the role of private information

and its consequences for how insurance markets function. First, our results extend our

understanding of how subjective beliefs are formed, namely that: individuals’ beliefs about the

probabilities of engaging in reckless driving behaviors in the future are directly related to their

subjective beliefs about experiencing an accident in the same future time period: and subjective

beliefs about the probability of an accident are reflected in the extent to which people are

exposed to loss from accidents after purchasing insurance and in subsequent realizations of

accidents. Second, individuals are able to gauge in quantitative terms the extent to which

reckless driving will result in higher insurance premiums, which implies that experience-rated

premiums can deter reckless driving. Third, using our survey data, we implement a method for

quantifying moral hazard, which allows us to separate adverse selection from moral hazard.

Our method for quantifying the extent of moral hazard does not rely on the assumption of

negative state dependence. Fourth, we examine sorting by insurers according to the objective

risk of an accident in an insurance market with mandatory minimum levels of insurance

coverage and discuss why such sorting occurs as a response to adverse selection. To our

knowledge, ours is the second study to investigate how insurer underwriting policies reflect

insurers’ priors about private information, and the first study to do this for an insurance market

in which insurance coverage is mandatory.

       The organization of the remaining sections is as follows: Section II describes institutional

features of the U.S. automobile insurance market. Section III describes basic features of the




                                                                                                   5
survey we conducted for this study. Section IV focuses on the role of private information in the

automobile insurance market—particularly the relationships between individuals’ subjective

probabilities of being involved in an automobile accident in the next year and various other

dimensions of private information, insurance contract choice, and ex post accident risk. In

Section V, we use information from hypothetical scenarios posed in our survey to assess the

extent of moral hazard. In Section VI, we investigate the relationship between observable and

unobservable accident risk and various measures of insurer quality. Section VII discusses

implications of our findings and study conclusions.

II. Background on Automobile Insurance Markets

       Government intervention in the automobile insurance markets reflects financial

externalities of such insurance (e.g., absent insurance, accident victims may not be able to

recover their losses), perceived consumer ignorance of the attributes of insurance policies, and

the widespread notion that driving is a right, particularly since driving is often essential for

employment and performing various household duties. Financial externalities have led to

mandatory insurance coverage. Consumer ignorance has led to review of policy forms to assure

that the terms of the contract of understandable to consumers. The notion of driving as a right has

been a factor in premium regulation, community rating, take all comers, guaranteed renewability

of policies, and formation of public high-risk pools. There is some segmentation of the market by

risk class as reflected by the presence of private surplus line insurers in some states, i.e., insurers

specializing in insuring the highest-risk drivers.

       In the U.S., mandatory liability insurance coverage is nearly universal if one includes

financial responsibility laws, which require that the individual be able to demonstrate the

financial ability to cover the loss in the event of an accident, as a weak form of mandatory




                                                                                                      6
coverage. Every state, except for New Hampshire, requires that drivers offer proof of financial

responsibility.2 All other states mandate financial responsibility, and most states require it be in

the form of a minimum level of liability insurance that covers personal injury and property

damages to a third-party if they cause an accident. Of our four study states, North Carolina,

Pennsylvania, and Washington offer some drivers other options to satisfy financial responsibility

including a choice between liability insurance, self-insurance, proof of assets over a specified

amount, an uninsured motorist fee, or a cash or surety bond deposited with the state, but liability

insurance is often the most practical option for drivers.3 The requirement that drivers purchase

minimum amounts of liability insurance prevents unraveling of contracts offering such minimum

coverage, which has occurred in other insurance markets, e.g., health insurance (Cutler and

Reber 1998).

         In addition to mandatory insurance, there are many types of optional automobile

insurance coverage, including collision insurance which covers property damage to the

policyholder’s own vehicle in the event of an accident. We focus on liability insurance, which

typically has no deductible, and secondarily on first-party collision insurance, which is typically

subject to a deductible.

         Even though most drivers are, in effect, required to carry liability insurance, some

insurers may not insure high-risk drivers. Often the stated reason is that they do not have claims

2
  N.H. Stat. Rev. Ann. § 264.2. New Hampshire requires drivers to obtain liability insurance in the case of a
conviction for motor vehicle law violations, but does not require insurance before a conviction occurs. Among the
four study states, Wisconsin did not mandate liability insurance coverage prior to June 1, 2010. As of this date the
state requires minimum liability coverage. 2 Previously, drivers were not required to obtain liability insurance or
prove financial responsibility in order to register their vehicles. Our data on insurance coverage are for after this
statutory change was implemented.
3
  NC Gen. Stat. § 20-309 (2013); 17 Pa.C.S. § 1782 (2013); Wash. Rev. Code. Ann. § 46.30; § 46.29.550,
46.29.630, 46.29.090, (2013). This option, for most drivers, is not feasible as it frequently requires a large cash
deposit or bond; beyond the reach of the average driver. Furthermore, even though it is authorized by statute, not all
states present this as an option to all consumers and interested drivers must meet certain specifications and work
directly with the state to set up financial responsibility other than liability insurance.




                                                                                                                     7
experience to assess the risk of such drivers. In three of the four states, all except North Carolina,

insurers can refuse to write coverage.

         There are four ways states deal with the underwriting issue that some persons may not be

able to secure “affordable” coverage and hence be unable to drive legally: a high-risk pool; an

assigned-risk system; a state-run reinsurance facility; or a state-funded plan. Of the study states,

only North Carolina has a reinsurance facility.4 All insurers selling automobile insurance in the

state must take part, and as a result, an insurer may choose to insure a high-risk driver under its

regular plan or transfer it to the reinsurance facility.5 In contrast, Pennsylvania, Washington, and

Wisconsin utilize an assigned risk plan. These plans also require all automobile insurers to

participate.6 The state assigned risk plans are run by a state-created office governed by a board

of insurance companies licensed in the state. However, unlike a reinsurance facility, assigned

risk plans do not offer choice of insurer.

         Automobile insurers commonly use experience rating to increase or decrease premiums

according to recent driving history (Lemaire 1995). Some states regulate experience rating with a

statewide point system. Of our study states, North Carolina mandates insurance increases with a

state-created system. Moving violations, including at-fault accidents, speeding tickets, and

Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) convictions, are assigned points and the number of points on

your driving record determines the premium surcharge.7 The other study states regulate



4
  NC Gen. Stat. § 58-37-1 (2013)
5
  Although empirical support is lacking, the underlying rationale is that such reinsurance gives drivers the ability to a
free choice of insurance carrier. It also means that individuals do not know when they are insured under the
reinsurance facility as the individual’s insurance contract is issued by the (primary) insurer.

6.54 (2013).

  For example, in North Carolina a driver with an otherwise clean record who is at-fault for an accident causing less
than $1,800 of property damage will get one point added to his driving record resulting in a mandatory thirty percent
premium increase.




                                                                                                                       8
surcharges but do not require specific schedules.8

         Insurance applications require basic demographic information including location, age,

gender, race, and marital status. However, in some states, these are protected categories and

companies are not allowed to set premiums without proper justification. The rules vary across

our study states.9 In all study states, premiums may reflect accident risk in the location in which

insurance is sold. The statutes are silent regarding insurer requests for information on driving

characteristics, such as annual mileage, vehicle specifications or use. The driving record of an

insured driver may be a significant source of information on driving risk for an insurer. Insurance

companies in the United States can purchase an individual’s three-year driving record—

including convictions, violations, and related activity recorded by the department of motor

vehicles—for a nominal fee.

         Insurers rarely if ever request some types of private information insureds are likely to

possess because it is impossible to verify statements made by potential or actual insureds from

independent sources, e.g., on risk preferences, use of intoxicating substances, and quality of

driving. Insurers might ask about specific chronic conditions known to affect accident risk such

as alcohol use disorder, epilepsy, or narcolepsy. Such information can be verified from medical

records or health insurance claims.

8
  In Pennsylvania, drivers cannot be surcharged or non-renewed if the claim resulting from an accident in the
preceding three years if the insurance company is reimbursed for at least 60 percent of the total amount of the paid
claim(Pennsylvania Insurance Department 2013). Wisconsin requires surcharges be applied uniformly and are
required to be filed with the Office of the Commission of Insurance (Office of the Commissioner of Insurance 2011)
9
  North Carolina prohibits risk classification based on age and gender although insurers are allowed to impose a
surcharge for drivers with less than three years driving experience. NC Gen. Stat. § 58-36-10 (2013). Pennsylvania
prohibits unfair discriminatory underwriting (underwriting not backed by empirical evidence) based on race,
religion, nationality, age, sex, family size, occupation, place of residence, or marital status. 40 P.S. § 1171.5(7)(iii)
(2010). In contrast, Washington prohibits refusal of insurance or limits on benefits payable based on gender, marital
status, or sexual orientation, but allows these factors to be used when “bona fide statistical differences in risk or
exposure have been substantiated.” Wash. Rev. Code. Ann. § 48.30.300 (2013). Similarly, like Pennsylvania,
Wisconsin prohibits denying benefits or refusing coverage based on sex, age, marital status, sexual preferences,
location, race, or religion; however, the state does allow rate setting based on these characteristics, so long as there is
credible supporting information. Wis. Stat. § 632.35 (2013); Wis. Admin. Code Ins § 6.54 (2013).




                                                                                                                         9
III. Data

        Battelle Memorial Institute conducted a three-wave survey of drinkers and drivers on our

behalf in eight cities in four states during 2010-12, called the Survey of Alcohol and Driving

(SAD). When possible, the questionnaire design was guided by questions included in prior

surveys, albeit not all asked in the same survey. This study relies on data from all three waves.10

The first wave, administered by telephone, included questions on: demographic

characteristics/income/wealth; alcohol consumption; accident/traffic violation history; and

altruism. The second wave, administered by computer about a month after wave 1, elicited

information for which visual displays are helpful and/or questions involved detailed scenarios

which would be challenging to pose orally (e.g., for eliciting risk preferences, willingness to pay

to avoid paralysis from an automobile accident), and details about the respondent’s automobile

insurance policy. The third wave, also administered by computer, was conducted about a year

after wave 1.11

        Since the primary focus of the study was on drinking and driving, eligibility for the SAD

required respondents to have driven and to have consumed alcohol during the last month,

residence within one of eight study cities, and be age 18+. The eight cities were: Raleigh and

Hickory, North Carolina; Philadelphia and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; Seattle and Yakima,

Washington; and Milwaukee and La Crosse, Wisconsin. These represent a broad geographic

spread of large and small cities. While eight cities are not representative of the U.S., the four

study states in which the cities are located vary in alcohol consumption, rates of DWI, arrest




10
   Although the SAD began before June 2010, information on insurance policies respondents had was obtained after
this date.
11
   Survey instruments for the SAD can be found at (http://dialog.econ.duke.edu/dapstudy).




                                                                                                             10
rates, criminal laws pertaining to DWI, demographic composition, and insurance law and

regulation.12

          The mean age of the study participants is 43.8. Mean educational attainment is 15.6

years, implying that on average, respondents nearly had a college degree, which is substantially

above the U.S. average. Mean household income is $81,470, also above average. Over half of

sample is female (54.6%); 13.1 percent are non-white, and 46.6 percent are married. The

participant recruitment process was designed to oversample persons who consumed large

amounts of alcohol in order to study DWI decision-making and behaviors of such individuals in

detail.

IV. Private Information and Insurance Contract Choice

A. Overview

          We first assess the role of private information (1) in individuals’ choices of automobile

insurance coverage and hence their maximum exposure to loss, (2) in their accident risks, and (3)

in the correlation between the two. An institutional feature of tort law in the U.S. is that when

the defendant’s liability obligation exceeds the person’s wealth, the defendant is considered to be

judgment proof (Shavell 2005). Our null hypothesis is that individuals in our sample who

purchase very complete insurance and have no financial exposure from automobile accidents are


12
  Per capita consumption of ethanol in gallons in 2007—NC (2.0), PA (2.2), WA (2.4), and WI (3.0) (National
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 2009). Arrest to population ratios varied from 0.25 percent (WA) to
0.67 percent (WI) in 2009 (our calculation from arrest data we obtained from each state). The four large cities—
Seattle, Philadelphia, Raleigh, and Milwaukee—have populations 380,000-1.4 million. The smaller cities—Yakima,
Hickory, Wilkes-Barre, and La Crosse—have populations 37,000-82,800. The racial makeup of each city varies,
e.g., Philadelphia and Milwaukee with large African-American populations, 43 and 37 percent, respectively, Yakima
with a large Hispanic population, 34 percent. Further, auto insurance varies greatly among the cities. According to
(Smith and Wright 1992) in an article entitled “Why is Automobile Insurance in Philadelphia So Damn Expensive,”
automobile liability insurance premiums in Philadelphia were about twice as high as they were in Seattle. Seattle’s
were about 50 percent higher than those in Milwaukee. Raleigh/Durham did not make the list. The authors attributed
high premiums in some cities, at least in part, to large numbers of uninsured motorists in some markets. Ratios of
uninsured motorist to bodily injury claims varied from 0.38 in Philadelphia, 0.14 in Milwaukee, to 0.089 for Seattle.




                                                                                                                 11
no more likely than others to report having an accident after purchasing their insurance. For

example, a person with a net worth of $1 million but with 100/300 (lower limit maximum insurer

payment per person for bodily injury and upper limit maximum total insurer payment per

accident, in thousands of dollars) would face a maximum liability exposure of $700,000.

        Like Finkelstein and McGarry (2006), we divide sources of information into three

categories: (1) information insurers use in risk classification and hence in premium-setting; (2)

information insurers are likely to elicit from consumers but which is not specifically used in

risk classification; and (3) multiple sources of private information not available to insurers. We

examine private information in multiple domains--the financial domain and driving domain,

altruism toward others on the road, and subjective beliefs about the probability the person will

engage in reckless driving in the next year—speeding or drinking and driving—to determine

which types of private information can explain subjective beliefs about the probability of

having an accident in the next year, observed insurance purchases, and ex post accident rates.

B. Three Types of Information

B.1. Objective Factors Used by Insurers in Premium Setting

       Accident determinants used by insurers for risk classification fall into these general

categories: demographic characteristics; driving attributes; driving history; and city. In our

analysis of objective factors, demographic characteristics are: male under age 25; female under

25; and currently married. For driving attributes, we include binary variables for whether the

person reported driving 15,000+ miles per year and type of primary vehicle—sedan, sport car,

SUV, minivan, truck, or other—whether the person reports driving to work, driving a motor

vehicle regularly as part of a job, and primary vehicle age. Driving history includes the number

of: citations for speeding; arrests for DWI; and accidents during the past three years.




                                                                                                 12
       We use a linear probability model to determine the relationship between accident risk and

information used by the insurer for risk classification. We estimate the following equation

                                                                                            (1),

where Accident is a binary variable for whether the person was involved in an accident in the

past three years, and X is a vector of characteristics used by the insurer for risk classification.

The dependent variable takes three alternative forms: (1) any accident; (2) any chargeable

accident—a person is deemed responsible; and (3) any non-chargeable accident—a person is

involved but not deemed responsible for causing the accident.

       Table 1 reports the results of estimating eq. (1) for the three variants of the dependent

variable. Young drivers, male and female, those who drive 15,000+ miles/year, and/or have prior

speeding citations and DWI arrests have higher probabilities of an accident in the follow-up year.

Persons currently married, drive a sports car, and residents of Yakima have a lower probability

of an accident. Since most persons with accidents had non-chargeable accidents, results for the

probability of having a non-chargeable accident are quite similar to those for the probability of

having any accident.

       We use the results from Table 1, col. 2, to calculate the predicted probability of an

accident for each individual and include this predicted probability measure in subsequent

analyses to account for information about accident risk known to the insurer.

B.2. Attributes Observed by Insurers but Not Used in Premium Setting

       Attributes observed by insurers but not used in risk classification are household income,

educational attainment in years, and race/ethnicity.

B.3. Multiple Dimensions of Private Information




                                                                                                      13
       In conceptualizing types of private information we consider these dimensions: driving

skills and precaution levels; risk preferences; cognitive ability; impulsivity; depression; altruism;

and maximum willingness-to-pay to avoid injury and disability. Each of these dimensions of

private information was measured by the SAD.

       Insurers know about the person’s prior accident and arrest records, but the individual may

know more about his or her quality of driving and precaution levels than is reflected in the

person’s driving history. To measure self-rated driving skills, the SAD asked respondents to rate

their driving ability relative to others—worse, about the same, better, or much better. To

measure precaution levels, the SAD elicited at baseline the individual’s subjective probabilities

of speeding 15 miles per hour or more over the speed limit and of driving at least once after

having too much to drink in the next year. The SAD elicited, a year later, actual incidents of

speeding and drinking and driving episodes during follow-up.

        Risk preferences in the financial and driving domains may affect risk-taking in driving

situations as well as demand for insurance. The SAD used the same measure of financial risk

tolerance as the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Following the HRS, SAD posed a

hypothetical scenario to gauge the respondent’s financial risk tolerance. The questions posed a

gamble between a 50 percent probability of doubling lifetime income if the person wins the

gamble and a 50 percent probability, alternatively, of losing half, one third, or one tenth of

lifetime family income. The SAD elicited a more detailed measure of risk tolerance than the

HRS. Based on the responses, we group respondents into three mutually exclusive categories: (1)

least risk tolerant—respondents who rejected a gamble involving a 50/50 chance of doubling

income or reducing income by 10 percent; (2) moderately risk tolerant—accepted gamble when

odds are doubling income and losing anywhere from 10 to 50 percent of income; and (3) most




                                                                                                  14
risk tolerant—accepted gamble involving doubling income versus losing all income (risk neutral

to risk lover) or accepted a gamble involving loss of all income versus increasing income by 67

to 100 percent (risk lover).

       Barsky et al. (1997) showed that this measure is positively associated with various

dimensions of risk taking outside the financial domain. The authors did not compare responses to

the HRS’s questions on financial risk tolerance to driving risk-taking. While financial risk

preferences are assumed to generalize to various decision-making contexts, some empirical

evidence raises a question of the validity of assuming context-invariant risk preferences

(Barseghyan et al. 2011; Einav et al. 2012). A utility function over wealth may relate much more

directly relate to demand for insurance coverage than to risk-taking as a driver since reckless

driving may be enjoyable to some drivers. If so, risk-takers in the financial domain may eschew

insurance coverage for this reason, but they may demand insurance coverage because they

realize that they have a higher probability of an accident because they are risk takers as drivers.

       To measure risk tolerance in the driving domain, the SAD described the following

scenario: “Imagine that you have to go to an important business meeting. There are heavy police

patrols on the road you are traveling. You are a little tight in time to get to the meeting. If you do

not speed, you are certain to be late by 10 minutes. If you speed 15 miles an hour over the speed

limit, you can get there on time if you are not caught by the police. There is a 10% chance that

you will be caught by the police and you will be sure to be late for the meeting by 30 minutes.

Assume that the police only would give you a warning in this case, so that you would pay no fine

or incur premium increases. Would you: (1) not speed and be late for your meeting; (2) speed

less than 10 mph and be late less than 10 minutes; (3) speed 15 mph and take chances on being

caught?”




                                                                                                   15
        Cognitive ability may affect the individual’s ability to weigh potential benefits and costs

of specific choices (Fang et al. 2008) and/or accuracy of a person’s subjective beliefs.13 The

SAD included several measures for cognition, each based on questions from the HRS. To

measure recall, the SAD incorporated an exercise in counting backwards to assess attention and

processing speed, and an object naming test to assess language, and recall of the date and name

of the Vice President of the United States and the Governor of the state in which the respondent

resided. Second, to measure working memory, the SAD included a serial 7 subtraction test based

on a sequence of 5 questions, starting with 100 – 7, with the next question based on the

respondent’s answer to the first question -7, and so on. The maximum (best) score on this

variable is 5. Third, the SAD measured the respondent’s numeracy. The numeracy question

sought to learn whether or not the respondent was able to make percentage calculations.

        Impulsivity is a general term describing a tendency to act on a whim, hence disregarding

a more thought-out rational long-term strategy for maximizing personal welfare (Madden and

Johnson 2010). An impulsive individual may not consider future consequences of present actions

and hence be more accident-prone. In psychology, impulsivity is an aspect of personality. In the

context of subjective beliefs about having an accident, an individual who is impulsive may

recognize that she is likely to act on a whim in the future, thus exposing her to a higher

probability of personal harm (Frank A. Sloan et al. 2013). A parallel is the sophisticate in the

literature on self-control versus the naïf who lacks self-control but is not able to incorporate lack

of future self-control in making current decisions (Gruber and Köszegi 2001).

        To measure impulsivity, the SAD incorporated impulsivity questions developed by

Loewenstein et al. (2001). To conserve interview time, the SAD used an abbreviated version of

13
  Evidence on the relationship between cognitive ability and accuracy of risk assessment from the SAD is mixed
See Frank A. Sloan et al. (2013).




                                                                                                                 16
the Loewenstein et al. scale. In the SAD, respondents were asked at wave 1 to respond on a 5-

point scale to 12 statements designed to measure impulsivity. The scale ranged from strongly

agree with the statement to strongly disagree. The statements to which respondents were to

respond were: “1. I do things on impulse that I later regret; 2. I act on impulse; 3. I finish what I

start; 4. I often do things on the spur of the moment; 5. I plan for the future; 6. I always consider

the consequences before I take action; 7. I control my angry feelings; 8. There are so many little

jobs that need to be done that I sometimes just ignore them all; 9. I fly off the handle; 10. I never

seem to be able to get organized; 11. I rarely make hasty decisions; and 12. I am not a worrier.”

       By leading to a feeling of hopelessness, depression may increase subjective beliefs about

probabilities of adverse events occurring (Hepburn et al. 2009). To the extent that depression

increases subjective probabilities of an accident arising from careless driving, it may increase the

individual’s precaution level. However, it may also lessen the individual’s belief that the

individual can control one’s fate, which may have the opposite effect. The SAD measured

depression with questions from the SIG-E-CAPS, a screener for depression (Guck et al. 2003;

Lieberman 2003), a screening tool widely used in clinical practice (Wise and Rundell 1994).

SIG-E-CAPS contains questions about sleep problems (S), loss of interest (I), guilt,

worthlessness, hopelessness, and regret (G), lack of energy, fatigue (E), reduced cognition or

difficulty with concentration (C), appetite—either increased or decreased (A), psychomotor

retardation (lethargy) or agitation (anxiety) (P), and suicidality (S). In total, the SAD included

nine symptoms, the eight just listed plus depressed mood. The SAD asked survey participants to

respond affirmatively if the person had a symptom during any full two-week period during the

last 12 months. Our depression measure is a count of these symptoms.




                                                                                                     17
         Persons who are more altruistic, especially concerned about harming strangers, may be

safer drivers and hence less accident-prone.14 The SAD made statements relative to altruism

toward non-family members, none of which reference alcohol consumption or DWI. Nine of the

statements dealt with altruism without referring to family members. Cet. par., we expect persons

who are less selfish toward non-family members, i.e., internalize the externalities involving harm

to others without incentives, to be less likely to drink and drive. The statements that did not refer

to family members were: “1. I am hurt if what I do isn’t recognized; 2. I help so I can live with

myself; 3. I am resentful when I do things for others; 4. people think I am selfish; 5. people think

I am cold; 6. I’m not known for generosity; 7. I try to be thoughtful; 8. I think of myself as

charitable; and 9. I go out of my way to help others.” Response options were: 1. “agree;” 2.

“neutral;” and 3. “disagree.” The SAD phrased the statements so that some imply altruism while

others imply selfishness. This was done to encourage respondents to read and consider each item.

         Persons who place a lower value on avoiding injury and/or disability should be more

prone to take risks that increase the probability of personal injury, including automobile

accidents. The SAD included a set of questions designed to value the non-pecuniary loss from an

automobile accident resulting in permanent paralysis. The question design sought to avoid

common pitfalls in contingent valuation research and was based on questions one of us has used

in previous surveys of willingness to avoid multiple sclerosis, a disability, and smoking-related

diseases (Frank A. Sloan et al. 1998; Perreira and Sloan 2002; Khwaja et al. 2009). Respondents

were asked to compare two areas: Area A which has the same monthly cost of living as the place

where the respondent currently lives and is assumed to have a 0.01 probability of a person

14
  There is little empirical evidence on this relationship. Using the same measure of altruism from SAD as in this
paper, Frank A. Sloan and Eldred (2013) found that more altruistic persons toward strangers were less likely to drink
and drive. In a study of adolescent driving behavior, Ulleberg and Rundmo (2003) found that more altruistic persons
were more likely to exhibit positive attitudes toward safe driving.




                                                                                                                 18
getting into a automobile accident per year that results in the person becoming paralyzed. Area B

has a $X per month higher cost of living per year and a 0.008 probability of being involved in an

automobile accident resulting in the person being paralyzed. To avoid starting point bias, the

starting values for $X were randomly assigned. Based on several rounds of questions, a final

value for willingness to pay to avoid a 0.002 probability of being paralyzed from an automobile

accident was assigned. The final value is the amount a person would pay per month in return for

a reduced probability of paralysis of 0.002 per year.

        To examine the relationship between the subjective probability of an accident in the

following year and specific sources of private information, conditional on objective information

used and not used by insurers, we estimate:

                                                                                              (2),

where Private Info. is a vector of individual characteristics and beliefs not observed by the

insurer. X, objective factors used in risk classification, and Z, factors observed by insurers but not

used in risk classification.

        Judging from the mean values of the covariates, most respondents think they are better

than average drivers (Table 2, col. 1). The majority are moderately financially risk tolerant. Only

a few respondents are most financially risk tolerant. On driving risk tolerance, most respondents

also fall into the moderate category. However, almost a quarter of sample persons are most risk

tolerant, higher than for financial risk tolerance. Forty-five percent believe that they would speed

in excess of 15 miles per hour during the next year. By contrast, the subjective probability of

drinking and driving in the next year is 0.17 for the analysis sample as a whole. The objective

probability of an accident is 0.21.




                                                                                                     19
       Self-rating of driving ability is monotonically related to the subjective probability of an

accident—people who believe they are worse drivers than others have a 0.10 higher subjective

probability of an accident relative to those who believe they are much better drivers than others

(col. 2). As one’s self-rated driving ability improves, the subjective probability of an accident

during the following year falls.

       Subjective probabilities of speeding and drinking and driving are positively related to the

subjective probability of an accident. A one percentage point increase in the subjective

probability of speeding or drinking and driving is associated with a 0.03 percentage point

increase in the subjective probability of an accident.

       More impulsive persons attach a lower probability of being involved in an accident in the

next year, possibly because they underestimate the probability of taking impulsive actions in the

foreseeable future. Higher income individuals had lower subjective probabilities of being in an

accident, possibly because they intended to be more careful drivers, given they would be less

likely to be judgment proof in the event of an accident. We find no evidence that risk tolerance,

cognition, depression, altruism, and willingness-to-pay to avoid paralysis from an accident affect

subjective beliefs about accident risk.

C. Choice of Insurance Coverage

C.1. Financial Exposure to Liability from an Automobile Accident

       The SAD asked whether the person had liability insurance, and if so, what the liability

limits were. The liability limits represent a measure of the quantity of liability insurance

purchased, but the ultimate objective of such insurance is to protect the consumer against the

financial risk from an automobile accident, which in turn depends on the individual’s wealth.




                                                                                                    20
       To measure the individual’s maximum financial exposure to loss from an automobile

accident, we subtract the higher liability limit from the person’s household net worth with zero as

the lower bound on exposure. For individuals without liability insurance, this is simply equal to

the maximum of zero and net worth. Higher liability exposure corresponds to less complete

insurance coverage. We estimate the following relationship:

                                                                                                   (3).

The coefficient of interest is   , which measures the effect of an individual’s subjective

probability of being involved in an accident during the following year on the maximum financial

exposure to an automobile accident, given the individual’s level of insurance coverage. For X,

we use the predicted objective probability of an accident in the following year (from eq. 1). The

classic model of uni-dimensional asymmetric information about risk type implies that               —

an individual with a higher subjective probability of an accident will choose more complete

insurance, or lower maximum liability exposure.

       We find a statistically significant negative relationship between the subjective probability

of an accident and level of liability exposure conditional on the objective predicted probability of

an accident (Table 3, col. 5). Each additional 0.01 increase in the subjective probability of an

accident in the following year leads to a $4,207 decrease in maximum loss exposure. The

parameter estimate on the objective probability is positive but statistically insignificant,

reflecting higher premiums for higher objective accident risk, and possibly sorting on objective

risk, as discussed below. We perform the same test on only those individuals who have liability

insurance and obtain similar result (col. 6). The marginal effect of a 0.01 increase in the

subjective probability is slightly higher in absolute value than before -$4,574.

C.2. Demand for Collision Insurance




                                                                                                    21
        Substituting binary variables to measure the individual’s collision coverage, we estimate

determinants of collision coverage. The relationship between the subjective probability of an

accident and having collision insurance is also consistent with the classic prediction because the

first dependent variable is defined for no collision coverage, but the parameter estimate is

imprecisely estimated (col. 7). When the dependent variable is 1 for persons with collision

insurance with a deductible exceeding $500/year, neither parameter estimate on the subjective

probability of an accident nor its objective counterpart are statistically significant at conventional

levels (col. 8).

D. Private Information and Ex Post Accident Risk

D.1. Relationship between Ex Ante Beliefs about Accident Probability and Ex Post

Accident Risk

        The results in Table 3 show that the subjective accident probability affects individuals’

choices about liability exposure. The importance of this finding depends on the degree to which

individuals’ subjective accident probabilities predict ex post accident risk. We explore this

relationship next.

        To investigate whether the subjective probability of an accident also affects individual

accident risk, conditional on the insurer’s classification of the consumer’s accident risk, we

estimate:

                                                                                               (4).

The dependent variable is a binary variable for whether the person had an accident in the year

after the SAD elicited the subjective probability of an accident. The parameter of interest is        ,

which relates the subjective probability of an accident to actual accident occurrence. If

individuals’ subjective probabilities are accurate,          If individuals’ subjective probabilities




                                                                                                      22
are unrelated to individuals’ objective probabilities of an accident,           . If, in general, people

can, but have difficulties forming subjective probabilities,                .

        Although the parameter estimates on the subjective probability of any accident during

follow-up are positive, the parameter estimates have large associated standard errors (Table 4,

cols. 1 and 2). The parameter estimate on the predicted objective probability of an accident is

0.30 and is statistically significant at better than the 0.01 level (col. 2). In an alternative

specification with the total number of accidents, the number of chargeable, and the number of

non-chargeable accidents as the dependent variables (cols. 3-8), the parameter estimates on the

subjective probability of an accident in the following year are uniformly positive and statistically

significant at conventional levels for the number of accidents (cols. 3-4) and the number of

chargeable accidents (cols. 5-6). The corresponding parameter estimates on the subjective

probability in the analysis of number of non-chargeable accidents are about of the same

magnitude as for chargeable accidents but not statistically significant. The predicted probability

of an accident, however, while positive in the analysis of all three dependent variables, is not

statistically significant in the analysis of number of chargeable accidents, possibly reflecting a

lack of statistical power. Taken in combination with the result showing that people with a higher

subjective probability of an accident buy more complete liability insurance, these results imply

adverse selection.

        It remains possible that there are other dimensions of private information not captured by

the subjective probability of an accident in the following year, e.g., unmeasured dimensions of

risk and time preferences related to insurance coverage. For this reason, and to compare our

results with those from previous studies, we perform two additional statistical tests.

D.2. Positive Correlation Tests




                                                                                                      23
         Most previous studies of asymmetric information in insurance markets have focused on

adverse selection. However, some recent empirical studies have found evidence of favorable

selection (Fang et al. 2008). Favorable selection might arise in automobile insurance markets if

persons who are not risk averse in the financial domain tend to be more careless drivers, thereby

increasing the probability of an accident. Thus, depending on their previous driving records,

persons who are not risk averse in the financial domain may be more likely to purchase complete

automobile insurance coverage. Or favorable and adverse selection may offset each other.15

         We perform two versions of the correlation test. First, we estimate a linear probability

model of accident occurrence as a function of insurance coverage, controlling for risk

classification, similar to Finkelstein and Poterba (2004):

                                                                                                             (5),

where CInsurance is a vector of insurance coverage characteristics. With asymmetric

information about risk type,              .

         The parameter estimate on the binary variable for zero exposure is positive and

statistically significant. (Table 5, Panel A). Fully insured are 0.047 more likely to have an

accident in the following year (col. 2) than are individuals with above $225,000 maximum loss

exposure. Even after conditioning on insurer risk classification, fully insured individuals are

0.044 more likely to have an accident (col. 3). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis of

symmetric or offsetting dimensions of private information in liability insurance. The parameter

15
  In addition, the literature, e.g., Finkelstein and Poterba (2004), has shown that asymmetric information may
manifest itself in ways other than the positive correlation property. Aspects of insurance contracts chosen by the
individual may reveal their private information. In FP’s analysis, such a dimension was a minimum payment from
the annuity irrespective of longevity (“guaranteed payment”). In our study’s context, insurers may differ in both
underwriting policy and, except for North Carolina, in the extent to which violations and accidents are experience-
rated. Thus, a person with a clean driving record but with private information that she has a relatively high
probability of a violation and/or accident may be unlikely to purchase insurance from an insurer with strict
underwriting and experience-rating policies.




                                                                                                                    24
estimates on level of the collision insurance deductible are very imprecisely estimated. Results,

not shown, using number of accidents as a dependent variable, are very similar to those reported

in Panel A. Thus, the main takeaway is persons with complete insurance have a higher accident

probability in the following year.

       Second, we employ a procedure suggested by Chiappori and Salanie (2000)—that is, we

estimate two equations with bivariate probit:

                                                                                            (6a)

                                                                                            (6b),

where Zero Exposure is a binary variable set to 1 if the individual has zero liability exposure,

i.e., complete liability insurance coverage. We measure the correlation, , between the error

terms of these two equations. With asymmetric information about risk type, there should be a

positive correlation between the residuals of these two equations—i.e.,        .

       The correlation is positive and statistically significant, 0.15 based on data from the whole

sample, and 0.14 when we condition on persons with liability insurance, which further supports

our finding that people with more complete liability insurance coverage—i.e., with less exposure

to financial risk following an accident—are more likely to be involved in an accident during the

follow-up year (Panel B). This positive correlation between completeness of insurance coverage

and ex post accident risk may reflect both adverse selection and moral hazard. In the next section

we disentangle these two phenomena.

V. Separating Adverse Selection from Moral Hazard

A. Overview

       Abbring et al. (2003) used panel data from insurance companies to distinguish between

adverse selection and moral hazard based on negative state dependence. In the absence of moral




                                                                                                   25
hazard, an individual’s probability of getting involved in an accident this year should be

independent of whether or not the person was involved in an accident last year. With moral

hazard, however, and experience-rated premiums, having an accident in the previous year should

lead to higher levels of precaution and a lower probability of an accident this year. This implies

that a finding of negative state dependence can be taken as evidence of moral hazard.16

           We do not use this approach for two reasons: (1) our panel consists of only two periods

and (2) the probability of a chargeable accident in a year is low, providing in combination with

our sample size, little statistical power to reject the null hypothesis of no negative state

dependence. Fortunately, responses to a set of questions posed as hypotheticals in our survey

allow us to employ an alternative approach for quantifying moral hazard and hence to parse

effects of moral hazard and adverse selection.

           Our approach involves several steps (Fig. 1). We describe our method for estimating each

step below.

B. Step 1. Relationship between Expected Premium Increases and Reckless Driving

           The penalty from reckless driving was measured in the SAD by the change in the

expected premium after speeding 15+ miles per hour over the posted speed limit, which reflects

the probability of being pulled over and convicted for speeding by this amount of the limit, both

elicited by the SAD. Given this expected premium increase, the SAD asked respondents to

estimate the (subjective) probability of speeding in the next year. After eliciting this probability,

the SAD posed scenarios for which the probability of being pulled over for speeding varied, first

by randomly chosen values of 0.10, 0.20, or 0.30, and second for three times these values. For




16
     See Ceccarini (2008) for an application of this idea.




                                                                                                   26
each scenario, the SAD asked for the probability that the person would speed. For each scenario

we calculate the following expected premium increase:




                                                                                                            (7)

We use individuals’ subjective probabilities as elicited by the SAD for each of the four terms in

eq. (7) at baseline and at the one-year follow-up, which yields six observations for each person.17

We pool these observations and estimate the following equation with individual respondent fixed

effects and standard errors clustered at the individual level:

                                                                                                            (8)

The coefficient of interest is       , which measures the mean individual change in subjective

probability of speeding due to a given percent increase in premium. The null hypothesis is

        —i.e., no moral hazard.

         In addition, the SAD elicited the individual’s subjective belief about the expected

premium increase following a DWI conviction and the probability of drinking and driving in the

next year given the person’s subjective beliefs about a DWI conviction. Respondents were also

asked the probability of drinking and driving if the expected premium increase doubled. We thus




17
  The SAD asked for the subjective probability of being convicted for speeding conditional on speeding. In both
waves the mean subjective probability of being pulled over for speeding, conditional on speeding, was 0.24 and the
mean subjective probability of being convicted, also conditional on speeding, was about 0.5. This puzzling result
may reflect the possibility that, at least in some of the SAD study cities, e.g., Seattle, the individual receives a
speeding citation other than by being pulled over, such as by automated camera. Alternatively, some respondents
may have interpreted the question about conviction as conditional on being stopped. Our calculation assumes the
latter.




                                                                                                                  27
obtain four observations/person and follow the same approach as for the speeding scenarios to

estimate eq. (7) with Drinking and Driving replacing Speeding.

C. Step 2. Relationship between Reckless Driving and Subjective Probability of an Accident

       The second step measures specific dimensions of private information that determine the

residual component of individuals’ subjective probabilities of an accident—the component not

explained by the objective probability of an accident. The results of this analysis are reported

above in Table 2.

D. Step 3. Relationship between Subjective Probability of an Accident and Ex Post Risk

       Third, we measure the relationship between the subjective probability of an accident and

the ex post probability of an accident. The parameter estimate     from eq. (4) measures this

relationship.

E. Results

       On average, the mean subjective probability of speeding 15+ mph over the speed limit in

the next year is 0.45 at baseline and 0.40 at the follow-up interview (Table 6). In both waves the

mean subjective probability of being pulled over for speeding 15+ mph, conditional on such

speeding, is 0.24, and the mean subjective probability of being convicted, conditional on being

pulled over for speeding, is about 0.5. The mean expected premium increase due to a speeding

conviction is 0.28 at baseline and 0.33 at follow-up. In both waves the mean subjective

probability of drinking and driving is 0.17, and the expected premium increase due to a DWI

increased from 0.77 at baseline and 0.86 at follow-up. The mean subjective probability of being

pulled over conditional on drinking and driving is 0.10 and 0.11 in the two waves, respectively.

The probabilities of a DWI conviction conditional on being pulled over for drinking and driving

are 0.60 and 0.61.




                                                                                                   28
       Doubling the expected premium increase from speeding leads to a 0.23 lower probability

of speeding, and doubling the expected premium increase from drinking and driving leads to a

0.10 lower probability of drinking and driving (Table 7). These relationships capture the first

step in Fig. 1. The parameter estimates on the subjective probability of speeding of 0.026 and

0.031 for the subjective probability of drinking and driving in the next year (Table 2, col. 2)

capture the second step in Fig. 1. To measure the third step in Fig. 1, we use the parameter

estimate on the subjective probability of an accident of 0.048 (Table 4, col. 2), and in sensitivity

analysis, the parameter estimate on the subjective probability of 0.130 col. 4).

       Table 8 summarizes the parameter estimates for each step in Fig. 1, for each of the two

types of reckless driving. The product of the estimates from the three analysis steps for speeding

is -0.0003 or -0.03 percent. Similarly, the corresponding effect for drinking and driving is -0.03

percent. Using the alternative estimate for the relationship between objective and subjective

probability of an accident yields slightly higher estimates of -0.08 percent for speeding and -0.04

percent for drinking and driving. What makes the moral hazard effects so low is that the

marginal effects of reckless driving on the probabilities of accidents are low. This is plausible for

anyone who has observed the many speeders on a highway. Very few accidents result per

speeding episode. In sum, the presence of asymmetric information in the automobile insurance

market contributes substantially more to adverse selection than to moral hazard.

VI. Sorting of Policyholders Based on their Accident Risk

A. Rationale for Sorting

       A major attribute of insurance markets is that insurers often reject applicants rather than

sell insurance to all comers at an actuarially fair price plus a load for administrative and market

expense plus profit. A commonly stated reason noted by insurers is that they cannot develop an




                                                                                                  29
actuarially fair premium for some consumers. Hendren (2013) formalized this argument. In his

framework, there are low- and high-risk types. For the low-risk types, consumers are likely to

have little private information. However, high-risk individuals may consist of persons who were

simply unlucky in the past in being involved in accidents and who filed claims for this reason

and those who have private information about their risk type. The unlucky persons may have the

ex ante accident risk of low-risk insureds. Hendren showed empirically that indeed high-risk

persons who are rejected by insurers often possess additional private information about their risk

types.

         Hendren’s empirical analysis encompassed markets for long-term care, disability, and life

insurance, all types of coverage voluntarily demanded by consumers. By contrast, automobile

liability insurance coverage is mandatory in nearly every state. So outright rejections are not a

possibility, although insurers may reject applicants for coverage above the mandatory liability

limits. Rejections of applications for automobile insurance are rare. According to the SAD,

only2.2 percent had been rejected by an insurer in the last three years at baseline and only 1.7

percent had been rejected in the past year at follow-up.

         A plausible mechanism for harder-to-rate drivers in the automobile insurance market is

for insurers to sort drivers on the basis of objective accident risk, as in Hendren (2013), with the

difference being that the drivers are accepted for some level of coverage rather than being

rejected outright, but the high-risk drivers “pay” for their additional risk in part by being insured

by lower-quality insurers, where quality is measured by such attributes as poorer customer

service, e.g., greater hassles in collecting from insurers, a smaller network of firms available for

repairs of damage, and generally offering lower value for the money. By specializing, lower-

quality insurers become specialized in gauging not-easily observed characteristics of their




                                                                                                    30
customers and dealing with their “hard-luck” stories. Few respondents to the SAD were covered

by surplus line insurers on high-risk pools.

       Our empirical analysis of sorting in the automobile insurance market involves two steps.

In Step 1, we show that higher-risk drivers measured on objective characteristics used by

insurers for risk classification tended to be insured by lower-quality insurers. In Step 2, we show

that higher-risk drivers based on the same objective characteristics tended to have more private

information about their accident risk.

B. Step 1: Choice of Other Dimensions of Insurance Contracts

       We obtain data on insurers from three additional sources: J.D. Power, Insure.com, and

Consumer Reports. Each of these sources report consumer ratings along multiple dimensions of

quality for large automobile insurance companies. Insure.com also reports coverage options and

discounts offered by each insurer that is included in the study. The large insurers reported in

these studies cover approximately 83 percent of our sample for J.D. Power ratings and 77 percent

of our data for Consumer Reports ratings and Insure.com ratings and insurer characteristics.

       Consumer Reports, available online by subscription, publishes automobile insurance

ratings based on a survey of 102,207 subscribers. The reader score is a measure of overall

satisfaction with claims handling based on the subsample of 29,116 survey respondents who had

a claim during 2009 to mid-2012. The score ranges from 0 to 100, where 100 indicates all

respondents are completely satisfied; 80, very satisfied; 60, fairly well satisfied; and 40,

somewhat dissatisfied on average. The premium satisfaction rating reflects satisfaction with

premium paid based on the entire sample, and it varies from 1 to 5, increasing in satisfaction.

       Insure.com published ratings of 20 large automobile insurance companies based on a

survey of 5,600 insurance customers conducted from September-November 2012. The overall




                                                                                                  31
score, which varies from 0 to 100, is an aggregate measure of: satisfaction with claims

processing, customer service; premium paid given the coverage; the percent of respondents who

said they would renew their coverage (plan to renew); and the percent of respondents who said

they would recommend or already recommended the insurer. Insure.com also reports coverage

options, including whether or not the company offers accident forgiveness (accident forgiveness

offered), and a distribution of reasons that respondents bought from the company (e.g., saw

commercial).

       J.D. Power also publishes customer satisfaction ratings of U.S. automobile insurance

companies online. It also reports ratings of customers’ claims experience, as does Consumer

Reports, they also report ratings based on customers’ experience purchasing a new automobile

insurance policy. Ratings include: (1) overall claims satisfaction, (2) overall purchase

experience, (3) claims service interaction, which is based on claimants’ ratings of the insurer

representative or agent handling the claim, and (4) local agent interaction, which reflects

purchasers’ experiences interacting with the insurer’s local agent or staff. All ratings vary from 2

to 5, where 5 is among the best, 4 better than most, 3 average, and 2 the rest.

       Given that private information affects individuals’ choice of the level of liability

coverage to purchase, a question remains whether private information affects individuals’ choice

of insurer based on other dimensions of insurance contracts such as coverage options, discounts,

and insurer quality scores. We base empirical tests of the effect of private information on choices

concerning other coverage attributes using the following general specification.

                                                                                              (9),

where Attribute alternatively measures consumers’ ratings, policy options, or discounts reported

in Consumer Reports, Insure.com, or J.D. Power for the SAD respondent’s insurer. Of particular




                                                                                                     32
interest are the parameter estimates on the vector     from each equation. If         in eq. (9),

then an individual’s subjective probability is related to the attribute represented by the dependent

variable.

       Table 9 reports the results of estimating these two sets of equations on the subsample of

SAD respondents whose insurers have a reported value for a particular attribute. Panel A

includes attributes measuring the overall quality of an insurance contract. An individual with a

higher objective probability of an accident is more likely to be insured by a low quality insurer

(Panel A, cols. 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). This result is consistent with sorting based on observable risk

and is robust across many different measures of overall quality. Relative to their objective

counterparts, the estimated parameters on the subjective probability of an accident are generally

small, albeit positive, and mostly statistically insignificant. Conditional on the objective accident

probability, individuals with a higher subjective belief of an accident are more likely to choose a

high quality insurer. An individual with private information about his risk type is likely to put

more effort into seeking a high quality insurer relative to an individual with the same observable

risk type but no private information because he anticipates that his true risk type will be revealed

over time and he would prefer to be with an insurer with a high rating, which reflects claims and

premium satisfaction.

       Panel B includes specific quality attributes of an insurance contract. Individuals with high

objective accident risk tend to have insurers with lower premium satisfaction, claims service

interaction, and local agent interaction scores. They are more likely to have a policy with

accident forgiveness and more likely to be insured by an insurer with a high proportion of

customers who bought from that insurer because they saw a commercial. With the exception of

premium satisfaction, coefficients on the covariate for the subjective probability of an accident




                                                                                                    33
are insignificant and vary in sign. For premium satisfaction, the coefficients are positive and

significant at the 0.10 level or better. A plausible reason is that high-risk individuals think that

they have a higher probability of an accident than the insurer does and the insurer’s prediction

determines the premium.

       These findings suggest a number of mechanisms by which sorting occurs in the market

for automobile insurance. First, dissatisfaction with premiums based on the objective probability

of an accident simply reflects consumer dissatisfaction with paying experience-rated premiums.

Second, dissatisfaction with claims service and local agents could also reflect provision of lower

quality service by insurers frequented by drivers with a high objective accident risk. Moreover,

since lower-quality drivers have more accidents, they have more negative interactions with their

insurers. Accident-free drivers have less reason to complain about poor service. Third, people

with high accident probabilities would understandably be more likely to rely on commercials for

information about insurers than rely on advice from friends who might be reluctant to encourage

an accident-prone friend to purchase coverage from their insurers.

C. Step 2: Private Information by Risk Type

       To gauge the importance of private information for persons with difference objective

accident risk, we rank order the sample by predicted accident risk and split the sample into

terciles according to the objective accident probability. We re-estimate eq. (3) with the sample

split into terciles, low, medium, and high objective accident risk. The dependent variable is a

binary for whether or not the respondent had an accident during the follow-up year. The

explanatory variables are the subjective probability of an accident during the follow-up year and

the objective risk of an accident during this period.




                                                                                                       34
        The results are striking (Table 10). The high-risk tercile has private information about

accident risk that could not be detected across the whole sample or for the low and medium

(objective) risk individuals. This leads to the conclusion that as insurers suspect, drivers who are

classified as high risk have private information about their accident risk that drivers in the other

risk categories do not possess.

VII. Discussion and Conclusion

        Not surprisingly, the information insurers routinely collect on their customers predicts the

objective probability of an accident during the policy year. Factors such as youth, gender, miles

driven/year, and prior speeding citations and arrests for DWI, are predictive of the probability of

an accident. The subjective probability of an accident in the following year is systematically

related to the individual’s projection of his or own care in driving. It is not only possible to elicit

subjective probabilities of speeding 15 or more miles per hour over the speed limit and of

drinking and driving during the past year, but these probabilities are systematically related to

subjective beliefs about having an accident. People make judgments about the quality of their

own driving ability that are systematically related to their subjective probabilities of having an

accident. And the objective probability of an accident is positively related to its subjective

counterpart.

        We find that drivers who reported higher subjective probabilities of an accident in the

following year were more likely to purchase more complete liability insurance coverage after

accounting for the probability of an accident based on information used by insurers in risk

classification.

        Findings from positive correlation tests and bivariate probit analysis also show a positive

relationship between maximum exposure to loss from an automobile accident and ex post




                                                                                                     35
accident risk. However, this relationship is consistent with both adverse selection and moral

hazard. Using a series of questions posed by our survey, we estimate the amount of moral hazard

to be very small, which implies that the positive correlation test and bivariate probit results

mainly reflect adverse selection, which is consistent with our earlier results showing that persons

with higher subjective beliefs about the probability of an accident in the following year tend to

purchase more complete liability coverage. Along the way to determining the extent of moral

hazard, we document that persons who expected higher premium increases conditional on their

being cited for speeding 15 miles per hour and over and arrested for drinking and driving have

lower subjective probabilities of speeding and drinking and driving, suggesting a deterrent effect

from imposing higher premium penalties on reckless driving.

       Unlike most other lines of insurance, state laws require that drivers purchase a minimum

level of liability insurance coverage. Thus, even in the presence of asymmetric information, there

will be no unraveling of coverage at the statutorily-determined levels of liability coverage. There

could be unraveling of contracts offering deeper coverage and collision coverage, but we do not

observe this. Most respondents to our survey had liability coverage well above the statutory

liability limits. One mechanism that mitigates unraveling of the latter contract types is sorting of

insured by objective risk. Sorting may reduce the adverse effects of private information by, for

example, making it more difficult for accident-prone drivers to collect damages since they are

more likely to have a lower-quality insurer. Persons classified as high risk on objective factors

which insurers use in risk classification do possess more private information about their accident

risk, but insurers that specialize in covering such individuals can account for this in premium-

setting given segmentation in this market. Our findings on sorting are new.

       Another factor making unraveling less likely in the automobile insurance market is that




                                                                                                    36
claims frequency is relatively high and the claims tail is relatively short compared to other lines

of third-party insurance, such as medical malpractice insurance. Thus, to the extent that there is

learning about customer riskiness, it occurs fairly rapidly.

       When we began this study, we sought an answer to the question of why in the presence of

adverse selection insurers do not obtain more information about their customers. The answer

seems to be that they do not have to. Drivers with a high accident risk, as determined by

objective factors used in risk classification, are more likely to possess private (Frank A Sloan and

Chepke 2008) information about their driving skills and risk-taking propensities. According to

our survey, insurers outright rejected very few persons outright. Rather than formally reject

applicants, there are more subtle mechanisms for rejecting high-risk drivers, an example being a

receptionist in a high-quality insurer’s office advising a high-risk driver to take his business

elsewhere. Poorer drivers pay more, not only in terms of higher premiums but in lower-quality

service.

       According to the old adage, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” In the automobile insurance

market, institutional responses by private firms have done the fixing. Although there are minor

suggestions, e.g., highly experience-rated premiums may deter reckless driving, in contrast to

other lines of insurance, such as medical malpractice insurance and workers’ compensation, there

is no important constituency for reform. Rather, empirical research on risk perceptions as in this

study clarifies the role and sources of private information and market responses for coping with

it.
