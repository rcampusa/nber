Continuous time is a superior representation of both the economic and climate systems that Integrated
Assessment Models (IAM) aim to study. Moreover, continuous-time representations are simple to
express. Continuous-time models are usually solved by discretizing time, but the quality of a solution
is significantly affected by the details of the discretization. The numerical analysis literature offers
many reliable methods, and should be used because alternatives derived from “intuition” may be significantly
inferior. We take the well-known DICE model as an example. DICE uses 10-year time steps. We first
identify the underlying continuous-time model of DICE. Second, we present mathematical and computational
methods for transforming continuous-time deterministic perfect foresight models into systems of finite
difference equations. While some transformations create finite difference systems that look like a discrete-time
dynamical system, the only proper way to view the finite difference system is as an approximation
of the continuous-time problem. DICE is an example where the usage of finite difference methods
from numerical analysis produces far superior approximations than do simple discrete-time systems.

1. Introduction

       Climate and economy are both continuous-time systems. The mutual
interaction between these two systems forms the core of any Integrated As-
sessment Model. Nevertheless, it is common practice in the IAM literature
to specify the climate-economy in discrete time, typically assuming very long
discrete time-steps of 5 or 10 years. If IAMs use e.g. decadal time steps, it
would be highly desirable that they properly represent the true continuous
time dynamics of the underlying system and address the appropriate policies
to cope with adverse effects of climate change. The insights obtained from
IAMs are frequently used by policy makers to design and evaluate various
climate policies, such as carbon taxes and global warming targets. For ex-
ample the United States government (Interagency Working Group on Social
Cost of Carbon, 2010) has recently engaged in determining the social costs of
carbon, the dollar value on damages from one more ton of carbon emissions.
The DICE model was one the three models used for this analysis. It comes at
not surprise that DICE was part of the study. It is well known amongst the
climate and economics communities and widely used in the IAM literature.
Furthermore, it is well documented and simple.
       Because of it simplicity and commendable openness DICE has been used
and modified extensively over the last 20 years.1 Moreover, some attempts

   1
    Professor Nordhaus, the author of DICE, has always made available all equations and
codes of his model. Furthermore, his calculations are extensively documented and anyone
can scrutinize them. Unfortunately, within the IAM community, this is one of the few
exceptions, rather than the rule. See Cai, Judd and Lontzek (2012a) for a comment on


                                          3
have been made to incorporate intrinsic stochasticity into the DICE frame-
work to study optimal climate policies under risk and uncertainty. Most
of the modifications and extensions also adopte the 10-year time step for-
mulation, and reduce the state space. We argue that, in particular when
studying intrinsic uncertainty within an IAM such as DICE, great care has
to be taken. For example, dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)
models in economics use relatively short time periods; usually at most a year.
10-year time steps are too long and might jeopardize economically plausible
and quantitatively reliable policy analysis. If one wants to know how car-
bon prices should react to business cycle shocks or tipping events, the time
period needs to be at most a year. Cai, Judd and Lontzek (2012b) provides
such a 1-year time step DSGE version of DICE with stochastic shocks (called
DSICE). Lontzek, Cai and Judd (2012) investigates the impact of the tipping
point on optimal mitigation policy based on the annual DSICE model. No
one would accept a policy that takes ten years to respond to current shocks
to economic or climate conditions.
   For the reasons outlined above, we develop DICE-CJL, a continuous-time
formulation of DICE that allows an analyst to choose among several time pe-
riod lengths without recalibrating the model for each different period length.
A continuous-time formulation allows us to show how to use finite-difference
methods from numerical analysis to formulate discrete-time versions that

openness in integrated assessment models.




                                            4
can be used in computations. We demonstrate that many substantive results
depend critically on the time step, strongly supporting our contention that
short time periods are necessary for quantitatively reliable analysis.
   In addition to the 10-year time-step length, the DICE2007 model is in-
consistent in its use of finite difference methods. DICE2007 uses an explicit
method for the economic module, but the climate model uses an implicit
finite difference method. This mixing of explicit and implicit finite difference
methods has no mathematical foundation and may lead to errors. We ap-
ply two finite difference methods to the DICE-CJL system: the Euler finite
difference method, and the implicit Crank-Nicolson finite difference method.
Since the true underlying model is in continuous time, modelers should ask
themselves how large can the time-step be and still approximate the solution
of the continuous time problem with small errors. They also need some di-
agnostics that tell them they have made a reliable choice. To address these
issues, we apply Richardson extrapolation (Richardson and Gaunt, 1927) to
DICE-CJL. We find that an annual version of DICE performs very well using
either method. In addition, we compare the annual version to much shorter
time-step versions. Indeed, we find that the solution of the annual version
is identical to e.g. a weekly version, which de facto can be thought of as
a continuous time version of DICE. We also find that a ten-year time step
using Crank-Nicolson produces a good approximation. The issue is not re-
ally what is the right time step. The question is finding reliable numerical
methods, and using appropriate time steps for the method we use. Overall,


                                       5
we find that the optimal policy results from the basic decadal DICE model
are significantly distorted due to the use of an inappropriate finite difference
method.
   This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a summary of the
DICE2007 model. Section 3 critically assesses some core assumptions of
the model. Section 4 introduces the continuous-time version of DICE2007.
Section 5 provides an example on how to specify the terminal value func-
tion for discrete time specifications. Section 6 offers a general discussion on
how to apply a feasible finite difference scheme and calibrate parameters on
DICE-CJL. Section 7 describes the DICE-CJL models using appropriate fi-
nite difference schemes. Section 8 discusses the calibration models for the
DICE-CJL models. Section 9 shows the numerical solutions of DICE-CJL.
Section 10 focuses on the numerical implementation and evaluation of the
DICE-CJL models. Section 11 concludes.

2. DICE2007

   DICE2007 (Nordhaus, 2008) maximizes social welfare with tradeoffs be-
tween carbon dioxide (CO2 ) abatement, consumption, and investment. DICE2007
assumes ten-year time steps, and maximizes total discounted social utility
subject to economic and climate constraints.
   Nordhaus (2011) claims that DICE2007 has 18 dynamic equations. This
description overstates the true complexity of DICE, which de facto has only




                                       6
six state variables.2
         The annual social utility function is

                                             (ci /li )1−γ − 1
                               u(ci , li ) =                  li ,
                                                  1−γ

for i = 0, 1, . . . , 59, where i is the number of decades from 2005, γ = 2 in
DICE2007, ci is annual consumption and li is labor supply at the decade i:

                          li = 6514e−0.35i + 8600(1 − e−0.35i ),

which is inelastic and equals world population in millions of people. There-
fore, the total discounted social utility over 600 years in (Nordhaus, 2008)
is
                                    59
                                    X
                                           β 10i 10u(ci , li ),
                                     i=0

where β = 1.015−1 is the annual discount factor.
         The production side of DICE2007 is a basic optimal growth model. Out-
put during decade i is produced from capital, ki (measured in trillions of
2005 U.S. dollars), and labor supply li according to the production function

                                  fi (ki , li ) = Ai kiα li1−α ,                          (1)

where α = 0.3 is the capital share, and Ai is total productivity factor defined

     2
    DICE2007 includes the cumulative resource stock of carbon as a state variable. It
enters the model as a constraint on the cumulative extraction of fossil fuels. This constraint
is not binding. Therefore, we omit this redundant state variable throughout our analysis.

                        EiInd (ki , µi ) = σi (1 − µi )fi (ki , li ),     (7)

so the annual total carbon emissions (billions of metric tons) during decade

3. Numerical Issues with DICE2007

      Before we formulate a continuous time version of DICE and proceed with
our analysis, we would like to point out some critical issues with the current
version of DICE. Users familiar with the DICE2007 version (or other versions
of DICE) will find different results when running DICE-CJL. These difference
come from using shorter time-steps and the adjustments described in this
section.

3.1. Nonphysical Nature of DICE2007

   The equations in DICE2007 differ from the corresponding ones in earlier
versions of DICE. Nordhaus (2008) explains these changes:

          “The lags in the system are primarily caused by the diffusive
       inertia of the different layers. We have changed the timing slightly
       to improve the match of the impulse-response function with cli-
       mate models. Additionally, we have adjusted the climate sensitiv-
       ity to the center of the IPCC range of 3°C for an equilibrium CO2
       doubling. The timing is calibrated to match model experiments
       for the IPCC Third and Fourth Assessment Reports.”

The changes implied nonphysical phenomena. In the program of DICE2007,

                                                  MiAT + Mi+1

                                                               

                   Fi              = η log2
                                                     2M0AT

and
                                                        >
                  Ti+1 = ΦT                         AT

This implies that

                                                                   >

                                                2M0AT

Thus, Ti+1
        AT
           depends on Mi+2
                       AT
                           . For example, if you set t = 2015, then warming
between 2015 and 2025 is affected by the stock of atmospheric CO2 in 2035,
implying that emissions between 2025 and 2035 will increase warming during
the ten years between 2015 and 2025. Nonphysical specifications of a physical

                                              12
system are problematic in general, but particularly in an optimal control
problem, the focus of DICE, where the non-physicality of the climate system
will introduce non-Markovian features to what is really a Markov decision
problem.
   Following standard practice in the IAM literature, Nordhaus (2008) chose
the parameters of the climate system so that a particular finite difference
method with a ten-year time period matches some target results. This is
not a standard way to deal with numerical design questions. The underlying
problem, a combination of climate and economic systems, is a system of
differential equations. The fundamental parameters are fixed by empirical
evidence. If a finite difference scheme is not producing accurate results then
it is natural to change it, but only to a theoretically valid finite difference
method of the given continuous-time econo-physical system.
   Climate models are run at time resolutions far shorter than ten years;
some are run at resolutions measured in minutes. Climate models aim to
solve continuous-time models. It is unclear that it is possible to produce a
specification of the climate system with a time resolution of ten years that
can match important features of a continuous-time model. A more standard
response to problems with lags due to large time steps would be to solve the
model at a finer time resolution. Doing this for DICE is straightforward.
It just requires a proportional change of those parameters with time unit
dimensions; otherwise, no change in parameters or functional form of the
equations is necessary. Therefore, for the DICE diffusivity parameters, it is


                                      13
easy to solve the problem with one-year time steps.
   We recomputed DICE2007 for time steps ranging from three months to
ten years. The results for the short time periods were very close, but differed
substantially from the ten year results. In particular, the ten-year formula-
tion produced carbon taxes 50% greater than the results using shorter time
periods. See Cai, Judd and Lontzek (2012a) and the accompanying website.

3.2. Terminal Condition

   DICE2007 imposes an additional constraint on terminal capital by assum-
ing that investment at the terminal time must be at least 2% of the capital
stock at the terminal time. Moreover, DICE2007 assumes that the terminal
value function is 0 everywhere. This is not a reasonable assumption, as this
implies that people will consume the capital stock as much as possible before
the terminal time and do not control carbon emission or temperature at the
last period.

3.3. Flexible Savings Rate

   In the program of DICE2007, the savings rate is fixed at 0.22 for stan-
dardization. A fixed savings rate is a good approximation here because of the
inelastic labor supply and the power utility function over consumption. How-
ever, in general, it is inappropriate to take a fixed savings rate as a solution,
although it is fine to use a fixed savings rate in preliminary computation to
generate an initial guess to feed into the real problem. We cancel this fixed
savings rate constraint in our examples.



                                       14
3.4. Extraneous Variables

   DICE2007 looks complicated to some users. Its GAMS code has 1263
equations and 1381 variables. However, there are many variables (and equa-
tions) that could be cancelled, as they are, in fact, autonomous and time-
dependent parameters. These extra variables and equations make it time-
consuming for users to understand the essence of the model. After cleaning
up these extra variables and equations, DICE-CJL (with the same 10-year
time periods) has only 466 equations and 584 variables, about only one third
of the original DICE code.

4. A Continuous-Time Reformulation of DICE

   The first step towards understanding the computational points we raise
below is to see the true underlying continuous-time model.
   First, the total discounted utility is
                             ˆ   ∞
                                     e−ρt u(c(t), l(t))dt,
                             0


where ρ = 0.015 is the discount rate, c(t) is the consumption function. We
assume that labor supply l(t) is inelastic and equal to the population, which
evolves according to

                   l(t) = 6514e−0.035t + 8600(1 − e−0.035t ),           (10)

for any continuous time t in units of years.
   Second, in the production function (1), the total productivity factor is


                                           15
computed by the recursive formula (2), but in fact it could be represented
by a function of the continuous time:

                 A(t) = A0 exp 0.0092(1 − e−0.001t )/0.001 ,                   (11)
                                                          


and in the industrial emission function (7), instead of the recursive formula
(5), the technology factor is also represented by a function of continuous
time:
                σ(t) = σ0 exp −0.0073(1 − e−0.003t )/0.003 .                   (12)
                                                          


Moreover, the function (4) for the adjusted cost for backstop becomes

                                   1.17σ(t) (1 + e−0.005t )
                        θ1 (t) =                            .                  (13)
                                             2θ2

With these continuous-time formulas, the net output at time t is

                                  1 − ψ(t)1−θ2 θ1 (t)µθ2
           Y(k, T AT , µ, t) =                             A(t)k α l(t)1−α ,   (14)
                                 1 + π1 T AT + π2 (T AT )2

for any capital k > 0, surface temperature T AT and emission control rate
µ ∈ [0, 1], where ψ(t), the participation rate, is assumed to be equal to 1 in
our examples. Thus, the differential equation of capital is

                         k̇ = Y k, T AT , µ, t − c − δk,                       (15)
                                              


for any continuous time t.
   Third, with the continuous time formulas of the productivity factor, the
technology factor and the adjusted cost for backstop, the rate of carbon



                                          16
emissions at time t becomes

              E(k, µ, t) = σ(t)(1 − µ)A(t)k α l(t)1−α + E Land (t),

for any capital k > 0 and emission control rate µ ∈ [0, 1], where

                                E Land (t) = 1.1e−0.01t

is the rate of carbon emissions from biological processes. Thus, the carbon
cycle system is
                      Ṁ = ΦM M + (E (k, µt , t) , 0, 0)> ,            (16)

where                                                            

                                                                 

                                                                  

                          0       φ23      −φ23 ϕ2

where ϕ1 = M∗AT /M∗UP and ϕ2 = M∗UP /M∗LO , where M∗AT , M∗UP and M∗LO
are the preindustrial equilibrium states of the carbon cycle system.
   Moreover, the total radiative forcing rate becomes

                  F M AT , t = η log2 M AT /M0AT + F EX (t),           (18)
                                               

                                                         otherwise.


                                          17
Thus, the temperature system satisfies the following differential system

                                                   >
                         Ṫ = ΦT T + ξ1 F M AT , t , 0 ,                   (19)

where                                                  
                               −ξ1 η/ξ2 − ξ1 ξ3 ξ1 ξ3 
                         ΦT =                         ,                  (20)
                                      ξ4         −ξ4

where ξ2 is the climate sensitivity (we choose ξ2 = 3 in this paper).
   Therefore, the continuous time model becomes
                            ˆ   ∞
                  max            e−ρt u(c, l(t))dt

where there are six continuous time state variables (k, M, T) and two con-
tinuous time control variables (c, µ).

5. Terminal Value Function

   DICE2007 solves a 600-year horizon optimization problem. Hence, we
change the infinite-horizon continuous time model to a 600-year horizon prob-
lem by replacing the integration of discounted utilities from the terminal time
(the 600th year) to infinity with a terminal value function. We estimate the
terminal value function using the summation of discounted utilities which is
discretized over [600, ∞) using a one-year interval. Some might argue that,


                                         18
due to discounting, economic costs and benefits in the far distant future have
little value from today’s point of view.4 Nevertheless, our aim is to provide
the IAM community with numerical tools which facilitate the design and
execution of an IAM in accordance with accepted standards in mathematics
and economics.
       Assume that at the terminal time, the capital is k̃, the three-layer CO2
concentration is M̃, the two-layer global mean temperature is T̃. For any
time t ≥ 600, we assume that the population is l(t) = ˜l = 8600, the to-
tal production factor and the adjusted cost for backstop will be the same
with the numbers at the terminal time respectively, i.e., A(t) = 1.7283 and
θ1 (t) = 0.00386. We assume that at terminal time, the world reaches a partial
equilibrium: after the terminal time, capital will be the same, and emission
control rate will always be 1, so that emission of carbon from industry will
always be 0, i.e., k(t) = k̃ and µ(t) = 1, for any time t ≥ 600. Thus, using
the explicit Euler method discussed in Section 7, the one-year discretized
dynamics of the climate system becomes

                                                      >
                  Mt+1 = Mt + ΦM Mt + E Land (t), 0, 0 ,
                                                    >
                  Tt+1 = Tt + ΦT Tt + ξ1 F MtAT , t , 0 ,

for any year t ≥ 600, where M600 = M̃, T600 = T̃.
       To keep the above partial equilibrium, the consumption at year t ≥ 600

   4
    E.g. a one percent annual discount rate over 600 years results in a discount factor of
roughly one quarter of a percent.


                                           19
is
                           ct = Y(k̃, TtAT , 1, t) − δ k̃.

Therefore, we have our terminal value function:
                                        ∞
                                        X
                     V (k̃, M̃, T̃) =           e−ρ(t−600) u(ct , ˜l).
                                        t=600

To compute the terminal value function, we will use the summation of dis-
counted utilities over 800 years from t = 600 to t = 1399 with one year as the
time interval for each period instead. It will be a very good approximation of
the summation of the infinite sequence, because e−800ρ ≈ 6.1 × 10−6 is small
enough. That is,
                                        1399
                                        X
                     V (k̃, M̃, T̃) ≈           e−ρ(t−600) u(ct , ˜l).
                                        t=600

     It would be too time-consuming to use the terminal value function of the
above formula in optimizers to compute optimal solutions, so we will use its
approximation to save computational time. In our examples, we will use a
degree-4 complete Chebyshev polynomial approximation, V̂ (k, M, T), over
the 6-dimensional state space where k ∈ [50000, 90000], M AT ∈ [650, 1050],
M UP ∈ [1400, 1800], M LO ∈ [19000, 21000], T AT ∈ [1, 3], and T LO ∈ [1.5, 3.5].
Detailed discussion of complete Chebyshev polynomials can be found in Judd
(1998), Cai (2009) and Cai and Judd (2010).

6. Solving and Calibrating Differential Equation Models

   Suppose that you have an ODE

                                  dx(t)
                                        = f (x(t), t),
                                   dt

while x(t0 ) = x0 is given at the initial time t0 . Integrating the ODE,
                                              ˆ   t
                            x(t) = x(t0 ) +            f (x(s), s)ds.
                                              t0


Defining a sequence of times tn = t0 + nh where h is the “step size”, we have
                                              ˆ    tn+1
                      x(tn+1 ) = x(tn ) +                 f (x(s), s)ds.
                                                  tn


We denote by xn a numerical estimate of x(tn ), i.e., xn ≈ x(tn ), by estimating
the integration of f over [tn , tn+1 ], for n = 1, 2, . . .. There are many ways
to numerically compute the integration. The explicit Euler method has the
form
                               xn+1 = xn + hf (xn , tn ).




                                          21
From numerical analysis (Iserles, 1996), the explicit Euler method is conver-
gent5 and its numerical error decays as O(h), i.e., linearly when h is halved.
       The integration of f over [tn , tn+1 ] can be estimated more accurately by
the trapezoid rule, so the Crank-Nicolson method is derived:

                                      h
                     xn+1 = xn +        (f (xn , tn ) + f (xn+1 , tn+1 )) .
                                      2

Since xn+1 can not be produced explicitly by knowing xn and computing
a value of f like the explicit Euler method, the Crank-Nicolson method is
said to be implicit. From numerical analysis (Iserles, 1996), the Crank-
Nicolson method is convergent and its numerical error decays as O(h2 ), i.e.,
quadratically when h is halved.
       Suppose one has some unknown parameters of the ODE in the function f
and wants to choose them so that the solution hits some target points. Denote
a as the unknown parameters, and the function f has the form f (x, t; a).
Assume that x∗n is a given state sequence that we want to match. Then we
can write this as a minimum norm problem. We can use L1 or L2 objectives.

   5
    The method is convergent if there exists a real constant λ such that the function f
that maps Rd × [t0 , ∞) to Rd satisfies that

                 kf (x, t) − f (y, t)k ≤ λ kx − yk    for all x, y ∈ Rd , t ≥ t0 ,

in a given norm k·k, and the Taylor series of f about every (x0 , t) ∈ Rd × [t0 , ∞) has a
positive radius of convergence.

7. Finite Difference Methods of Continuous Time DICE

   In this section, we apply the ideas in the previous section to our continuous-
time IAM.

7.1. Explicit DICE-CJL Model

   We use the explicit Euler finite difference rule to discretize the continuous
time model with any time interval h. First, the total discounted utility over
the first 600 years is
                                   N
                                   X −1
                                          e−ρnh u(cn , ln )h,
                                   n=0

where labor supply ln = l(nh) from the function (10) for n = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1.
   Second, from the explicit Euler finite difference rule for the continuous
time differential equation of capital (15), the next-stage capital is

                 kn+1 = (1 − δh) kn + Y kn , TnAT , µn , nh − cn h,                 (23)
                                                               


where the function Y is defined in (14).
   Third, from the explicit Euler finite difference rule for the continuous time

climate system (16) and (19), the next-stage climate state becomes
                         h                                 i
             Mn+1 = Mn + ΦM Mn + (E (kn , µn , nh) , 0, 0)> h,
                        h                         > i
                           T              AT
             Tn+1 = Tn + Φ Tn + ξ1 F Mn , nh , 0           h.

   Therefore, the discretized model with the explicit Euler finite difference
method becomes

                  X −1
         max             e−ρnh u(cn , ln )h + e−ρhN V̂ (kN , MN , TN ) ,      (24)

                  n=0
          s.t.    kn+1 = kn + Y kn , TnAT , µn , nh − cn − δkn h,
                                                             
                                h                                 i

                  Mn+1 = Mn + Φ Mn + (E (kn , µn , nh) , 0, 0) h,
                              h                           > i
                  Tn+1 = Tn + ΦT Tn + ξ1 F MnAT , nh , 0        h.

7.2. Trapezoidal DICE-CJL Model

   We use the trapezoidal rule (the Crank-Nicolson method) to discretize the
continuous time model with any time interval h. First, we use the trapezoidal
rule for the integration in the continuous time model (21) to estimate the
total discounted utility over the first 600 years, which is
                                 N
                                 X
                                       e−ρnh wn u(cn , ln )h
                                 n=0

where wn are the weights with wn = 1 for n = 1, . . . , N − 1 and w0 = wN =
0.5, and labor supply ln = l(nh) from the function (10) for n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1.
   Second, from the Crank-Nicolson method for the continuous time differ-

where the function Y is defined in (14).
   Third, from the Crank-Nicolson method for the continuous time climate
system (16) and (19), the next-stage climate state satisfies
                  h                                              ih
    Mn+1 = Mn + ΦM Mn+1 + (E (kn+1 , µn+1 , (n + 1)h) , 0, 0)>      +
                                                                  2

                                                  2

                                                              2

                                                 2

   Therefore, the discretized model with the trapezoidal rule becomes
                    N
                    X
           max            e−ρnh wn u(cn , ln )h + e−ρN h V̂ (kN , MN , TN ) ,   (28)
           cn ,µn
                    n=0

subject to the constraints (25), (26) and (27).

7.3. Detrended Finite Differences

   Since the population is growing, the productivity factor is increasing and
the adjusted cost for backstop is decreasing, the capital path will be explosive.
This causes systematic bias in the standard finite difference methods we
discussed above. Curvature in the solution is a source of error when one is
using piecewise linear approximations.


                                           25
   Next, we transform the differential system to detrend the capital stock
path, and apply a finite difference method to the detrended variable. This
path is bounded with less curvature, and should be better for the finite
difference method. We transform k(t) to its detrended variable e−λt k(t) where
λ is an estimated parameter such that e−λt k(t) has less curvature. One typical
choice of λ is ln (kN /k0 ) /(N h) by giving an estimated terminal capital kN .
   From (15), we have
                                               
        d −λt        −λt              d
           e k(t) = e       −λk(t) + (k(t))
        dt                             dt
                      −λt           AT
                                                                
                   = e     Y kt , Tt , µt , t − ct − (λ + δ) k(t) .

By discretizing the new differential equation using the explicit finite difference
formula for the capital, we have

 e−λ(n+1)h kn+1 − e−λnh kn = he−λnh Y kn , TnAT , µn , nh − cn − (λ + δ) kn ,
                                                                          


which implies that

      e−λh kn+1 = (1 − (λ + δ) h) kn + h Y kn , TnAT , µn , nh − cn .        (29)
                                                                  


Similarly, if we use the Crank-Nicolson method to discretize the new differen-
tial equation of the detrended capital, we have the detrended implicit finite
difference method:

                                                                          h

7.4. Richardson Extrapolation

   The true model is a continuous-time model. We hope that the solutions
converge to the continuous-time solution as we reduce the time period. Also,
our optimizer may not give a good optimal solution with a very small time
step. For both reasons, we want to check if our discrete time solutions con-
verge to a common limit.
   Richardson extrapolation (Richardson and Gaunt, 1927) is a standard
way to check if our solutions are consistent with convergence. We apply
Richardson extrapolation to our solutions and find that they are consistent
with convergence. Let x∗t,h be the optimal solution at time t of an ODE with
h as the time interval. The 3-point Richardson extrapolation of x∗t,h , x∗t,h/2 ,
and x∗t,h/4 is defined as

                                  1
                       xR           8x∗t,h/4 − 6x∗t,h/2 + x∗t,h .
                                                               
                        t,h/4 =
                                  3

From numerical analysis, we know that the 3-point Richardson extrapolation
has less errors than x∗t,h/4 .

8. Calibration

   In the equations of the carbon cycle and temperature systems, there are
five unknown parameters, φ12 , φ23 , ξ1 , ξ3 , and ξ4 , that we should calibrate.
At first, we generate the Business-As-Usual (BAU) paths of carbon cycle and
temperature, which are optimal solutions of the integrated models separating
the climate part and the economic part by fixing the emission control rate to


                                           27
be 0 at any time. We denote MD (t) and TD (t), respectively, as the carbon
cycle and the temperature paths of DICE2007, and let ED (t) be the path of
the carbon emission rates. Then we find the parameters so that the paths of
the carbon cycle and the temperature of the continuous time model match
the BAU paths of DICE2007, by assuming that both models have the same
path of the carbon emission rates.
   If we choose the L2 norm in the equation (22), then the calibration model
becomes
                           N

where Mn and Tn are the sequences generated from the equality constraints
(26) and (27) by assuming E (kn , µn , nh) = ED (tn ).
   If we choose the L1 norm in the equation (22), then the calibration model

      Using the above three models to calibrate over 500 years, we have the cal-
ibrated parameters listed in Table 1. The first data row gives the calibrated
values of the five parameters using the model (31), where we choose the time
interval as h = 1 year. Since the BAU paths are given in the decadal unit, we
use the picewise linear interpolation to generate the values of emission ED (t)
at each year, and then minimize the sum of square of relative errors of every

decadal node. Table 1 also lists the calibrated values using the above three
models with the time interval as h = 10 years. We see that the difference
between these values and the first data row is not large. Thus, we can say
that the first data row of Table 1 is a close estimate of the five parameters in
the continuous-time DICE-CJL model. Therefore, we use the first data row
of Table 1 as our calibrated values in our examples.

9. Numerical Results

   We apply the explicit Euler method to discretize the climate and eco-
nomic dynamic system and then solve the optimization problem (24) with
various time steps. We also apply the trapezoid rule and then solve the op-
timization problem (28) with various time steps. Numerically, if the time
step h is large, then the numerical errors may become too large so that the
numerical solutions may not be trusted. We use various time intervals to see
the difference of solutions of DICE-CJL with these different time steps h. We
use CONOPT in the GAMS environment (McCarl, 2011) to solve DICE-CJL
with different time period lengths in our GAMS code.




                                       30
9.1. Starting Point Strategy

   It will become more challenging to solve DICE-CJL with a smaller time
interval h, because the number of variables and constraints and nonzero
elements in the system will increase proportionally.
   A good initial guess of solutions will be very helpful for an optimizer
to solve such a large-scale optimization problem. In our examples, one good
initial guess is the linear interpolation of optimal solutions of DICE-CJL with
a larger time interval. For example, we could use the linear interpolation of
optimal solutions of the 2-year DICE-CJL as the initial guess for the annual
DICE-CJL problem.

9.2. Running times of DICE-CJL

   Table 2 lists the running times of DICE-CJL with various time intervals
in the GAMS environment on a single-processor Mac. For the explicit model,
the one-year version takes less than 1 second and the weekly version only take
33 minutes. And for the trapezoidal model it takes only 4 minutes to solve
the monthly version. It seems surprising that the 2-year version (or larger
time step for the trapezoidal model) takes more time than 1-year and even
6-month versions. This happens because we do not use the starting strategy
for the 2-year version (or larger time step for the trapezoidal model), but for
other smaller time steps we use the starting strategy.

9.3. State Paths of DICE-CJL

   Figures 1-3 plot the optimal paths of the capital stock, the atmospheric
carbon stock, and surface temperature of the explicit DICE-CJL model (24)

with 1-year time steps. For other smaller time steps and the solutions of the
trapezoidal DICE-CJL model (28) with various time steps from 10 years to
1 month, the paths are close to the 1-year solutions of the explicit model,
so we omit them here. We see that the line of DICE2007 using Nordhaus’s
program diverges strongly from our solutions in each figure.

9.4. Carbon Tax Results in DICE-CJL

   One application of DICE2007 was to compute the optimal carbon tax;
see Nordhaus (2007, 2008) and Interagency Working Group on Social Cost
of Carbon (2010). Figure 4 displays the optimal path of the carbon tax for
three numerical approaches. DICE2007 is the path produced by DICE2007.
The dotted line is the path when we use DICE-CJL with the same diffusivity
rates as used in DICE2007, and is the path whether we use the non-causal
specification for warming in DICE2007 or use the DICE-CJL specification.
The solid red line is DICE-CJL with one-year time steps where the diffusivity
parameters are chosen so that the continuous-time climate system matches

                                      32
the results for the climate system in DICE2007. The results are striking.
The ten-year time period in DICE2007 consistently produces much higher
path for the carbon tax than other models with shorter time periods. This
example shows clearly why the continuous-time approach is the only proper
foundation for these models, and that finite-difference approximations must
be based on numerical methods for differential equations.

10. Error Analysis of DICE-CJL Model

   We next analyze and compare the errors of alternative methods.

10.1. Explicit DICE-CJL Model

   Figures 5-7 show that our solutions from the explicit finite difference
method are good. The vertical axis in each figure is
                                                 !
                              x∗t,h − xR
                                       t
                      log10              + 10−7 ,
                                   xR
                                    t


where x∗t,h is the optimal solution at time t of the explicit DICE-CJL model
with h being the time interval, xR
                                 t is the 3-point Richardson extrapolation

of the optimal solution with 1 month, 0.5 month and 1 week (equals to 1/4
month by our assumption) for the explicit model, i.e.,

                           1
                    xR       8x∗t,1/48 − 6x∗t,1/24 + x∗t,1/12 .
                                                             
                     t =
                           3

   Figures 5-7 plot the relative difference over time intervals of optimal paths
of capital, carbon concentration in the atmosphere, and surface temperature
respectively. We omit the figures of the other three state variables, as they


                                        33
show a similar pattern. Each line represents the difference between the solu-
tion for a time step and the Richardson extrapolant.
   From the figures, we see that Nordhaus’ solution has a O(1) error in
the optimal capital, and O(10−1 ) errors in the atmospheric carbon and sur-
face temperature, and even for the first 100 years the errors are still around
O(10−1 ) or even worse. However, the explicit DICE-CJL model has O(10−2 )
errors for each state variable when the time step is 2 years, and then it de-
cays down to O(10−4 ) when the time step drops to 1 week almost uniformly
along the time path and along the time step. Moreover, since 1 week (equals
to 1/4 month by assumption) is equal to 1/96 of 2 years, and the error of
1-week explicit DICE-CJL is also about 1/96 of the error of 2-year explicit
DICE-CJL, we see that the error of each state variable is decreasing linearly
as we reduce the time step in the explicit DICE-CJL model.

10.2. Trapezoidal DICE-CJL Model

   Figures 8-10 show that our solutions from the trapezoidal rule are more
accurate than the solutions given by the explicit DICE-CJL model. The
vertical axis in each figure is
                                                      !
                                  x∗t,h − xR
                                           t
                          log10         R
                                             + 10−7       ,
                                       xt

where x∗t,h is the optimal solution at time t of the trapezoidal DICE-CJL

                                    t is the 3-point Richardson extrapolation
model with h as the time interval, xR
of the optimal solution with 1 month, 2 weeks and 1 week (equals to 1/4



                                      34
month by our assumption) for the trapezoidal model, i.e.,

                           1
                    xR       8x∗t,1/48 − 6x∗t,1/24 + x∗t,1/12 .
                                                             
                     t =
                           3

   From the figures, the trapezoidal DICE-CJL model has O(10−2 ) ∼ O(10−3 )
errors for each state variable when the time step is 10 years which has almost
the same accuracy with the 1-year explicit DICE-CJL model. When the time
step is reduced to 1 month, the error has already converged to O(10−6 ). The
1-month trapezoidal DICE-CJL results also show the convergence. Since 1
month is equal to 1/40 of 10 years, and the error of 1-month trapezoidal
DICE-CJL is about 1/1000 of the error of 10-year trapezoidal DICE-CJL,
we see that the error of each state variable decays about quadratically as we
reduce the time step in the trapezoidal DICE-CJL model.

10.3. Detrended Finite Difference

   From Figure 1, we see that the capital path has a high curvature, so
we use the detrended finite difference method by detrending the capital path
k(t) to e−λt k(t), where we choose λ = ln (70000/k0 ) /600 = 0.0104. Figure 11
gives the relative errors of optimal capital under logarithmic scale from the
detrended finite difference method using 10-year step size. We see that the
detrended explicit finite difference method using (29) (the dotted line) has
less errors than the explicit DICE-CJL without detrending (the dot-dashed
line). Moreover, the detrended trapezoidal finite difference method using (29)
(the dashed line) improves half a digit accuracy than the trapezoidal DICE-
CJL without detrending (the dot-dashed line). For other climate states, the

                                        35
detrended DICE-CJL has solutions close to those without detrending because
we just do detrending on the economic side.
   Figure 12 verifies that the detrended capital has less curvature: it ranges
from 125 to 200 while the optimal capital has a much wider range along the
time.

11. Conclusion

   Both the climate and economy are continuous-time systems. Climate
system modelers have always based their work on continuous-time models,
but economists have used discrete-time models with long time periods. Using
DICE as an example, we show that continuous-time formulations of IAM
models are natural, that many reliable methods from numerical analysis are
available to solve such models, and that the choice of time step and finite-
difference method can have economically significant effects on the answers to
basic questions in economic policy.
   The DICE example is a simple one which can be solved by a variety of
numerical methods that are reliable when one takes very short time steps.
However, as we move to multisector and multiregional models that signifi-
cantly increase the dimensionality of the system of ordinary differential equa-
tions, it will become increasingly important to use efficient finite difference
methods that allow for time steps of moderate size without losing accuracy.
The value of the arguments mentioned in this paper will be even higher in
these more realistic models.
