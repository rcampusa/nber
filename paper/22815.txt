                                         ABSTRACT

Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, we examine the effects of the Affordable Care
Act (ACA) on retirement. We first calculate retirements (and in related analyses changes in
expected ages of retirement and/or Social Security claiming) between 2010, before ACA, and
2014, after ACA, for those with health insurance at work but not in retirement. This group
experienced the sharpest change in retirement incentives from ACA. We then compare retirement
measures for those with health insurance at work but not in retirement with retirement measures
for two other groups, those who, before ACA, had employer provided health insurance both at
work and in retirement, and those who had no health insurance either at work or in retirement. To
complete a difference-in-difference analysis, we make the same calculations for members of an
older cohort over the same age span. We find no evidence that ACA increases the propensity to
retire or changes the retirement expectations of those who, before ACA, had coverage when
working but not when retired.

An analysis based on a structural retirement model suggests that eventually ACA will increase
the probability of retirement by those who initially had health insurance on the job but did not
have employer provided retiree health insurance. But the retirement increase is quite small, only
about half a percentage point at each year of age. The model also suggests that much of the effect
of ACA on retirement will be realized within a few years of the change in the law.

    The Affordable Care Act as Retiree Health Insurance: Implications for Retirement and
                                 Social Security Claiming

                  Alan L. Gustman, Thomas L. Steinmeier, and Nahid Tabatabai


     The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed in 2010. It increases the availability of health

insurance for those who did not have coverage from their employer, or who were not working.

ACA also provides a range of subsidies based on family income. It mandates standards for

qualified plans, and imposes penalties on individuals without insurance and on certain employers

who did not insure their full-time workers. Different provisions of the legislation continue to be

phased in over time. 1

     Policy concerns include the question of whether ACA encourages earlier retirement. Concern

about this issue stems from the findings in an extensive literature suggesting retiree health

insurance accelerates retirement. 2 ACA may be expected to have a similar effect to retiree health

insurance since it provides health insurance to those who would not be covered until they

become eligible for Medicare should they choose to retire before age 65. If ACA accelerates

retirement, this side effect might undermine decades of public policies that were designed to

increase the retirement age. 3


1
 The tax on individuals who are not insured has increased from the higher of $95 per adult, or 1
percent of household income in 2014; to $325, or 2 percent of income in 2015; to $695, or 2.5
percent of household income in 2016.

 Studies of the relation of retiree health insurance to retirement include Clark (2015), Currie and
Madrian (1999), French and Bailey Jones (2011), Gilleskie and Blau (2006), Gustman and
Steinmeier (1994, 2000), Madrian (1994), Marton and Woodbury (2006) and Nyce et al. (2011).

and Hermes (2015), Gustman and Steinmeier (2015), Henriques (2012), Shoven and Slavov
(2012, 2014), and Song and Manchester (2007).

  Policies designed to encourage delayed retirement include: the increase in the Social Security
full retirement age; the abolition of the earnings test after full retirement age; the increase in

                                                                                                     1
    In contrast to the suggestion from the literature on retiree health insurance, Levy,

Buchmueller and Nikpay (2015) do not find those under the age of 65 have changed their

retirements following the implementation of ACA. Their approach is to contrast changes in

retirements through mid-2015 between individuals residing in states that participated in ACA

with changes in retirements observed for individuals from states that did not participate. They

recognize that too short a time may have elapsed for the full effects of ACA on retirement to be

observed. 4 Nevertheless, if their analysis holds over the longer term, it would suggest there are

no unintended side effects of ACA on retirement to be of concern to policy makers.

    A goal of this paper is to help to fill the gap in our understanding of the effects of the

Affordable Care Act (ACA) on retirement. Our aim is to bridge the contradictory findings

between the retiree health literature and the recent analysis of the retirement effects of ACA.

    We focus on three major groups of employed individuals, categorized by their employer

provided health insurance coverage before the adoption of ACA. A first group consists of

individuals with employer provided health insurance when working, but with no employer

provided retiree health insurance to cover them should they retire before age 65. This group is

subject to an incentive from ACA that is similar to the incentive created by retiree health


Social Security’s delayed retirement credit; the abolition of mandatory retirement; and
enforcement of rules requiring defined benefit pension plans to be actuarially fair in determining
benefits after normal retirement.
4
  Levy et al. (2015) suggest the problems with the start-up of the exchanges may have adversely
affected perceptions as to the availability of alternatives to employer provided insurance. The
short time frame also creates other reasons for the absence of an observed effect. There has been
little time for those very near retirement age to reoptimize. For example, to fund an earlier
retirement, an individual may need to accumulate additional wealth. It might also be that the
effects of ACA on retirement will not be visible until the near retirement age population better
understands the change in retirement incentives introduced by ACA.



                                                                                                     2
insurance. ACA would not induce as large a change in the marginal incentive to retire for two

other groups, those whose employers provide health insurance both on the job and in retirement,

and those with no employer provided health insurance either at work or when retired.

   First, using two cohorts from the Health and Retirement Study, we conduct a difference-in-

difference analysis of the actual effects of ACA on retirement in the short term. This analysis

uses data from the HRS Mid Boomer cohort to calculate the differences in retirement outcomes

between those whose retirement incentives are modified by ACA and those whose marginal

incentives are not affected by ACA. Retirement changes are calculated over the 2010 to 2014

period. The analysis then compares the changes between the three groups over the period since

ACA was adopted with the analogous changes over an earlier period when ACA did not affect

incentives. Note that our approach, comparing the differences in outcomes among these three

groups between two periods, differs from, and is somewhat complementary to, the approach

taken by Levy, Buchmueller and Nikpay (2015).

   In view of the possibility that it is too early to find effects of ACA on actual retirements, our

second step is to extend the time period for measuring retirement. We do this by considering

changes in respondent reports of their expected retirement and Social Security claiming dates.

For Mid Boomers the changes in expectations are calculated for each of the coverage groups

over the 2010 to 2014 period. For Early Boomers calculations are made over the comparable age

span. Many expect to retire after 2014. Thus the period of analysis is not limited to the 2010-

2014 period used to observe actual changes in retirements. Using the change in retirement

expectations as the dependent variable allows individuals to consider changes over a much

longer period. As a result, it allows them to enhance the attractiveness of retiring earlier by

changing saving and other related behaviors, changes that are not possible in the short run.



                                                                                                       3
   Our third step is to project the potential effects of ACA over an even longer period. For this

exercise, we use a structural model of retirement. The model was previously estimated to explain

the retirement behavior observed for members of the original HRS cohort. Our model includes

the role that health insurance plays in buffering against small probability catastrophic health

events that may create very large declines in assets and consumption.

   To simulate the effects of ACA on retirements, we introduce ACA into the budget constraint

facing each individual. This procedure allows us to simulate the effects of ACA in the long run,

i.e., the full adjustments in retirement that might be observed for those who entered the labor

market with ACA already in place. It also allows us to simulate adjustments in outcomes over

the short and intermediate terms. We do this by introducing ACA at an older age and allow

respondents to reoptimize their behavior in view of the unexpected change in the law. Thus a

major advantage of the structural approach is that it allows us to compare the effects of ACA on

retirement in the short, intermediate and long run.

   We are aware of an important potential pitfall in analyzing the relation of retiree health

insurance to retirement. Availability of employer provided health insurance is correlated with

coverage by a defined benefit pension. Previous analyses have at times confounded the effects of

retiree health insurance with those of DB pensions. To avoid this pitfall, after we explore the

retiree health insurance--pension relation in descriptive data, we standardize for the influence of

correlated pension incentives on retirement in a multivariate, and then in a structural setting. This

is designed to eliminate any specification error that would otherwise result from failing to

standardize for the covariance between employer provided health insurance and incentives from

pensions.




                                                                                                      4
   In Section II we estimate the size of the groups classified by their health insurance coverage

in 2010. We use the panel feature of the HRS to document the changes in employer provided

health insurance at work and in retirement between 2010, before ACA, and 2014, after ACA was

implemented. These descriptive data are followed by tables that include other sources of health

insurance beside that provided by employers, including health insurance purchased in the private

market, coverage from a spouse’s employment, and from other sources. After that we explore the

relation between employer provided health insurance and two key covariates, pension plan

coverage and plan type.

   Section III estimates the relation between initial type of health insurance coverage and

retirements observed between 2010 and 2014. We then compare retirements by initial health

insurance coverage between the cohort affected by ACA and an older cohort over a four year

period involving the same initial age span.

   Section IV examines changes in retirement intentions before vs. after adoption of the ACA.

We focus on changes in intended retirement dates, and on changes in intended date of claiming

Social Security benefits. Once again we conduct a difference-in-difference analysis of retirement

intentions. This compares differences in retirement intentions between members of the younger

cohort affected by ACA over a four year span with differences in retirement intentions for

members of an older cohort over the same age span. The difference-in-difference analysis

standardizes for any longer term trends, as well as changes in actual retirements and in

expectations that arise over the period just before retirement age.

   Section V modifies our structural model to project responses to ACA in the long term, as

well as in the short run and intermediate run. Section VI concludes.




                                                                                                    5
II. Descriptive Analysis of the Availability of Health Insurance

    We arrange the descriptive analysis around three groups. ACA is most likely to affect

marginal retirement incentives for members of the first group, those who had health insurance on

the job, but did not have employer provided health insurance should they retire before age 65.

After ACA, the private health insurance market and exchanges provide retiree health insurance,

often subsidized, reducing the incentive for members of this first group to stay on the job. In

contrast, ACA does not affect incentives for a second group, those who before its

implementation had employer provided health insurance on the job and in retirement. Nor does it

affect incentives for those who initially had no employer provided health insurance, either while

working or when retired. 5

    The data in this section is from members of the Mid Boomer cohort of the Health and

Retirement Study, individuals who were born from 1954 through 1959. We restrict the sample to

respondents who were ages 51 to 56 when they first entered the HRS. 6 Observations begin in

2010, before ACA affected the availability of health insurance. The last HRS observations

available at the time of the writing of this study are from 2014.




5
  Second order effects would arise if, in response to ACA, employers changed the relative
availability of health insurance on the job and in retirement. There is no evidence of major
changes in employer offerings after ACA was adopted, however. There also may be other second
order effects of ACA. Employers might, for example, change the subsidies for employee vs.
retiree health insurance, either modifying required contributions, or changing deductibles and
copays. Retirement incentives would also be affected if employers created or modified any
compensating wage differentials. HRS does not provide information on the extent of employer
subsidization of health insurance. Nor has ACA been in effect long enough to reliably identify
any changes in compensating wage differentials.
6
  By limiting the analysis to individuals who were ages 51 to 56 when they entered the HRS, we
exclude those who entered the HRS before 2010 as a younger or older spouse to an age eligible
household member. That is, we exclude cases where the spouse, but not the Mid Boomer
respondent, was 51 to 56 years old at the time of entering the survey.
                                                                                                    6
    IIA. Health Insurance Coverage from Employers.

    Table 1 begins with data on insurance from work related sources only. The sample in each

year is restricted to those who have a current job in that year. Percentages of observations in the

indicated year are reported below the counts in each cell.

    From row 1, column 1 of Table 1, 1054 respondents in 2010, or 39.3 percent of 2010

respondents who were currently employed, had employer provided health insurance while

working on their current job, but did not have employer provided health insurance in retirement.

This juxtaposition of health insurance availability generates the strongest first order incentive

influencing retirement prior to ACA, encouraging the individual to postpone retiring. Moving

down column 1, 42.7 percent of respondents had no employer provided health insurance either

on their current job or in retirement. When a person has no employer provided health insurance

either before or after retirement, health insurance does not differentially affect the incentive to

retire. The third group includes 18 percent of employed respondents. In 2010, these individuals

had employer provided health insurance whether working or retired, so that employee provided

health insurance did not create a strong incentive affecting retirement. 7

       There are very small differences between years in the proportion falling within each

health insurance group. 8 This can be seen by comparing values across the three columns of Table




7
  The relative sizes of each of the three groups are similar for both males and females. When the
sample is restricted to those who had been on the job for at least ten years, the fraction with
health insurance on the job, but no health insurance in retirement, increases slightly. For
example, in 2010, 42.6 percent of the sample of long term job holders had health insurance on
the job, but not in retirement. The group with health insurance both when working and when
retired increases from 18.0 percent of all employed to 22.2 percent of long term employed.
8
  Comparing columns 1 and 3 of Table 1, bottom row, between 2010 and 2014, the total number
respondents to the survey who reported themselves as employed declined 14.2 percent (1 -
                                                                                                      7
1. Between 2010 and 2014, the fraction of the employed with health insurance on the job and no

health insurance in retirement decreases from 39.3 percent to 37.6 percent of the employed. The

fraction with no health insurance either on the job or in retirement decreases from 42.7 percent of

the employed in 2010 to 42.4 percent in 2014. Lastly, the percentage of employees with health

insurance both at work and when retired increases from 18.0 to 20.0 percent.

*The sample is restricted to Mid Boomers who had a current job and were ages 51 to 56 when
they first entered the survey.


        The summary statistics in Table 1 do not provide a full picture of the changes

experienced by those falling in different health insurance groups before ACA. Those in one

category of health insurance in 2010 frequently are found in another category in 2014. 9 While

the flows into and out of a particular category roughly offset, it would appear from the row and

column totals of Table 1 that the changes between 2010 and 2014 are relatively small. Similarly,



2300/2681). The attrition rate for the overall sample of Mid Boomers between 2010 and 2014 is
17.5% (691/3940).
    9
      For this analysis, Table 2 is restricted to Mid Boomers who responded to the HRS in 2010
and 2014, and who held a job in those years. For completeness, we also include a small category
consisting of those who report having health insurance in retirement, but not on the current job.
Presumably their coverage must have come from a previous employer, or it may simply be the
result of reporting error.

                                                                                                   8
the summary statistics in the final column and bottom row of Table 2 do not suggest major

changes in health insurance status in the aggregate.

        In fact, from the perspective of individuals there is a substantial probability of moving

from one health insurance category to another, although the probability of having the same

coverage at work and in retirement in 2014 as in 2010 is substantially greater than 50 percent.

Consider row 1 of Table 2. In 2010, before the ACA was implemented, 40.9 percent of

respondents were covered by health insurance on their current job, but not in retirement. Looking

across row 1, by 2014, 66.2 percent of those individuals (522/789) still had health insurance on

their current job, but not in retirement. From row 1, column 2, however, by 2014, 13.6 percent

(107/789) had lost health insurance on their current job and still had no health insurance in

retirement. In contrast, among those with health insurance on their current job in 2010 but not in

retirement, by 2014 19.8 percent (156/789) had maintained their insurance on their current job,

while also gaining retiree health insurance.

        From row 2 of Table 2, which begins with the 40.3 percent of respondents in 2010 who

had no health insurance either on the job or in retirement, we see that 16.6 percent (129/777)

gained health insurance on the job by 2014. An additional 6.9 percent (54/777) of those with no

insurance in 2010 gained health insurance both while employed in their 2014 job and also when

they retired.

        Lastly, although 54.5 percent (188/345) of those who had both current and retiree health

insurance in 2010 were also insured in 2014, 32.8 percent (113/345) lost their retiree benefits,

although they maintained insurance on their current job, while by 2014, 11.0 percent (38/345) no

longer had either current or retiree health insurance.

       IIB. Health Insurance Coverage from All Sources

       The goal of ACA is to increase health insurance coverage, whether that coverage is

through the employer or from other sources. The shares of respondents with each source of

employer provided coverage in 2010 are reported in the last column of Table 3. Shares of

employed respondents by source of coverage in 2014 are reported in the bottom row. The cells in

the table trace the changes in sources of coverage between 2010 and 2014, before and after ACA.

For purposes of comparison, Appendix Table 1 reports the same flows for the Early Boomer

cohort between 2004 and 2008, when they fell in the same age span as the Mid Boomers, but

were unaffected by the ACA.

       Health insurance coverage is considerably higher when one considers sources beyond

own current employer. Looking down the last column of Table 3, these other sources of coverage

increase the health insurance coverage rate from 56 percent of employed individuals based on


                                                                                               10
insurance from own employer up to 81 percent. (In 2004 the Early Boomer cohort shows an

analogous increase from considering other sources of health insurance from 59% to 86%.) Aside

from own employment, in 2010 the spouse’s employer (13%), private insurance (4%) and

insurance through self-employment (3%) are the three most important sources of coverage. 10 The

results in Appendix Table 1 for Early Boomers in 2004 are similar.

     From row 9, right hand column (12), when health insurance coverage from private insurance,

Medicare, Medicaid, from military service and from other sources are included, 19 percent of the

continuously employed had no health insurance in 2010. (In 2004 14 percent were uninsured.)

After ACA, from row 10, column 11 of Table 3, the group with no insurance had fallen to 15

percent. Thus between 2010 and 2014, the share of currently employed individuals without

health insurance coverage had fallen by about 4 percentage points. (Between 2004 and 2008,

there was a 1 percentage point decline in the share of the employed who were uninsured.)

Among 1080 respondents who had coverage from a current employer in 2010, 87 percent (941)

had insurance from a current employer four years later. Of the remainder, 5.2 percent (56/1080)

ended up with no health insurance; 2.8 percent (30/1080) were newly insured through a spouse,

and 2.4 percent (26/1080) had purchased private insurance.

     Of 373 individuals who had no insurance in 2010, just over half (50.9 percent = 190/373)

still had no insurance by 2014; 23.1 percent (86/373) gained insurance from a current employer;

11.8 percent (44/373) secured private insurance; and 7.5 percent (28/373) gained coverage from

Medicaid. The transitions observed between 2004 and 2008, before the advent of ACA, were

similar.



10
  Disaggregating the Mid Boomer statistics by gender, 11.7 percent of males and 13.5 percent of
females are covered via their spouse’s health insurance.

                                                                                                11
       Not shown in Table 3, the percentage of the sample with retiree health insurance from

their own current employer, a previous employer, or a spouse’s employer, increased from 19.2

percent in 2010 to 22.5 percent 2014.

       There are three lessons to take away from these data. The first is that the transitions from

the period before to after ACA are not very different from the comparable transitions observed

for an older cohort over the same age span. The second lesson is a caveat about our

methodology. We will attempt to measure the effects of ACA on retirement incentives by

focusing on the group that, before ACA, had employer provided health insurance on the job, but

not in retirement. We assume they gain coverage in retirement from ACA that they otherwise

would not have had, so their incentive to keep on working is reduced. But as Table 3

demonstrates, some of them would have secured health insurance in retirement from the other

sources listed in that table. For those respondents, we will overstate the effects of ACA on their

retirement incentives. Members of other groups would also have experienced a change in their

insurance status before reaching retirement age. For some, ACA would have a greater effect on

their retirement incentives than we are supposing. The third lesson is that others would have

secured health insurance coverage outside of their own employment. This means that our attempt

to identify the affected group by focusing only on insurance from the employer tells only part of

the story. This approximation should be borne in mind when interpreting our later results.

       II C. Health Insurance Coverage and Pensions

   To understand the relationship between retirement and retiree health insurance, as Gustman

and Steinmeier (1994) strongly suggests, one must eliminate the effects of any covariation with

incentives created by defined benefit pensions. There is a very close relationship between

coverage by a defined benefit pension and the availability of retiree health insurance. Omitting

the incentive created by an early retirement spike due to a defined benefit pension from a

retirement analysis invites specification error. The effect on retirement of the omitted pension

incentive, which varies with the terms of the pension benefit formula as well as the work history

of the covered individual, will be attributed to retiree health insurance.

   Descriptive data on the relation between pension coverage and the availability of employer

provided retiree health insurance, and type of pension plan and the availability of employer

provided retiree health insurance, are reported in Table 4. From the bottom row, columns 1 and

2, we see that 45.2 (1212/2681) percent of the sample has no pension from their current job.

       Turn to Table 5, which reports the column percentages of Table 4. From column 2, row 3,

we see that only 5 percent of those with no pension on their current job have health insurance in

retirement. From Table 5, row 2, column 2, almost three fourths (73 percent) of those who do not

have a pension on their current job also do not have either health insurance on that job or in

retirement. Just over one fifth of those without a pension (21.9 percent) has health insurance on

the job, but does not have retiree health insurance.
                                                                                                   14
       Looking across row 1 of Table 5, whatever the pension plan type, 53 to 54 percent of

those with a pension have health insurance on the job, but do not have retiree health insurance.

The next most likely outcome for those with a pension is to have both health insurance on the job

and retiree health insurance. That probability is highest for those with both a DB and DC pension

at 36.1 percent. Of those with a DB plan only, 29.2 percent have employer provided insurance

both on the job and in retirement. In addition, 24.9 percent of those with a ‘DC plan only’ have

health insurance both when working and into retirement. Roughly a fifth of those with a DB only

or DC plan only have no health insurance either when working or retired (17.5 percent and 21.4

percent respectively). Those who have both DB and DC pensions have only a 9.8 percent chance

of having no health insurance both when working and when retired.

       Table 6 reports the type of pension conditional on retiree health insurance coverage on

the current job and/or retiree health insurance. From the bottom row, the percentages of the

currently employed with a DB pension only, a DC pension only, and both types, are 13.4, 26.8

and 14.1 percent respectively. (Similar results are found when plan type is computed for

pensions from any job, not just the current job.) In Table 6, row 3, we see that half of those with

retiree health insurance have a DB plan only, or both a DB and a DC plan on their current job

(21.7 + 28.4). Yet of the total sample, only 27.5 percent have a DB plan, whether alone or in

combination with a DC plan. Given the overwhelming evidence that DB pension incentives


                                                                                                   15
strongly influence retirement outcomes, this confirms the importance of controlling for the

relationship between retiree health insurance and coverage by a defined benefit plan in

retirement equations.

       From Tables 7, row 3, we see that as pension wealth increases, so does the share of

respondents who have both health insurance on the job and health insurance in retirement. From

row 2 of Table 7, the number with no health insurance either on the job or in retirement declines

as pension wealth increases.

*Column percentages of Table 7.

        Table 8 reports the column percentages from Table 7. Looking across row 3, the

percentage with health insurance on the job and in retirement rises from 24.1 percent of those in

the lowest pension wealth category (column 2, row 3) to 34.8 percent of those in the highest

pension wealth category (column 5, row 3).

        Table 9 reports the row percentages from Table 7. Looking across row 3, we see the share

of those with health insurance at work and in retirement that comes from each pension wealth

category. From column 4, row 3, 30.9 percent of those with retiree health insurance come from

the third quartile of respondents ranked by pension wealth. Those falling in the highest pension

wealth quartile account for a smaller share of those with retiree health insurance at 26.7 percent.

       III. Health Insurance Coverage and Actual Retirement Age

       Levy, Buchmueller and Nikpay (2015) studied the effects of ACA on actual retirements

by relating the probability of retirement to the availability of ACA in the indicated state. We

begin with a simple relation between observed retirements (an answer from the CPS type labor

market status question in the HRS that the individual was retired in 2014 after having reported a

job in 2010) and the type of health insurance held.

       Table 10 reports retirement rates over a four year period for the three groups of

employed, categorized by their health insurance coverage in the base period. Retirements for

those in the Mid Boomer cohort are reported in column 1. Retirements by members of the Early

Boomer cohort are in column 2. Differences in retirement rates between cohorts are reported in

column 3. The row headings differentiate the three groups according to their employer provided

health insurance while working and when retired.

       If the results in Table 10 were produced by a natural experiment, the differences in

column 3 would indicate the effect of ACA on retirement. The expectation would be that

retirement rates would increase by more for those in row 1 of the table since ACA reduces their

marginal incentive to stay at work, while it does not affect marginal incentives for members of

other groups.

       There are two takeaways from Table 10, neither of which is very helpful in isolating the

relation between ACA and retirement. First, looking down column 1, retirement is higher in the

Mid Boomer cohort for those with health insurance both on the job and in retirement (row 3, 7.6

percent) than it is for those with health insurance on the job but not in retirement (row 1, 3.6

percent). But retirements are even lower for those with no health insurance on the job or in

retirement (row 2, 2.7 percent). A similar relation is found for the Early Boomer cohort.



                                                                                                   18
   The second take away is from column 3. Here we compare changes in retirement over the

four year age span between cohorts. This comparison suggests that the absolute reduction in

retirement was greater over the period ACA was phased in for those who had employer provided

health insurance both on the job and in retirement than it was for members of the other two

health insurance groups. The fact that retirements were reduced for all three groups probably

reflects the effects of the Great Recession. In particular the labor supply response probably

discouraged early retirements. In contrast, the policies adopted by employers to deal with

downturn in demand are likely to have encouraged retirements, but these policies probably

differed among employers offering different health insurance options. The changes in retirements

observed in column 3 may be expected to reflect the joint effects of ACA and the different

reactions to the Great Recession. In any case we can find no direct evidence in simple descriptive

statistics that ACA accelerated retirements.

   To further analyze the relation between health insurance type and actual retirement between

2010 and 2014, and over the analogous period for an older cohort, Table 11 presents the results

of a probit analysis. Here we pool the samples from the Early Boomer and Mid Boomer cohorts


                                                                                                19
and observe their retirement behavior from the year they entered the HRS until four years later.

The dependent variable is 1 if the individual retired over the four year period, either between

2010 and 2014 for Mid Boomers or 2004 to 2008 for Early Boomers.

   The probit coefficients reported in column 1 are for dummy explanatory variables indicating

type of health insurance coverage in the base period, and for interaction variables between cohort

(Mid Boomer) and indicators of the type of employer provided health insurance. The interaction

variables reflect the difference in retirements between the Mid Boomers and the Early Boomer

cohort. A dummy variable for cohort is also included separately, but the coefficient is not

reported in Table 11. There are no other covariates in the probit underlying column 1.

   Those with health insurance on their current job but not in retirement, and those with health

insurance both on the job and when retired, are more likely to have retired than those without

health insurance either at work or should they retire. This result is consistent with the descriptive

statistics in Table 10. However, neither interaction variable is significant. That is, we can find no

statistically significant evidence that compared to Early Boomers, Mid Boomers with health

insurance on the job, but with no retiree health insurance, were less likely to stay in the labor

market as a result of ACA.

   As seen from the coefficients reported in column 2, when other covariates are added to the

probit underlying column 1, the findings remain unchanged. The additional covariates are related

to demographics, education, health, pension coverage, and unemployment. Thus we find no

statistically significant evidence that ACA accelerated the relative retirement rates of those who,

before ACA, had health insurance when working, but did not have retiree health insurance.

     To be sure, the effects of ACA on retirements may have been obscured by major differences

in employer behavior between the Early Boomers’ and Mid Boomers’ retirements. It might also

be that not enough time has passed to see the basic effect of ACA on retirement. In view of these

possibilities, we turn to alternative approaches to estimating the effects of ACA on retirement.

        IV. Health Insurance Coverage and Expected Claiming and Retirement Ages

     To set the stage for our analysis of the effects of ACA on retirement in the intermediate term,

in Table 12 we report the expected ages of claiming Social Security benefits (or the expected

retirement age – the age at which the individual stops work entirely) from 2010 through 2014,

and relate those dates to health insurance coverage in 2010. 11 Consider Table 12, column 1, row


11
  The sample in Table 12 is conditioned on the respondent having held a job in all three years. It
includes those who answered don’t know or refused to the age of claiming or retirement age
questions. For those whose claiming age is missing, we use age 62. For those who report a
claiming age over 70, we change the claiming age to 70. For those with missing expected
retirement age, we use the expected claiming age. Appendix Table 2 reports the claiming and
retirement ages for the subsample of respondents who did not answer “don’t know” or “refused”

                                                                                                   21
1, in the top panel. On average respondents with health insurance on the job but not in retirement

in 2010 expected, as of 2010, to claim benefits at age 65.0. From column 1, row 2, respondents

with no health insurance either on the job or in retirement expected to claim benefits at 64.6.

Thus respondents who in 2010 had health insurance on the job, but not in retirement, expected to

claim their Social Security benefits 0.4 years later than those with no health insurance on the job,

or in retirement. A person with health insurance on the job but not in retirement also expected to

claim benefits half a year later than someone with health insurance both on the job and when

retired (65.0 vs. 64.5). 12

        The relation of type of health insurance to expected retirement age differed somewhat

from the relation of type of health insurance to Social Security claiming age. From the lower

panel in Table 12, in 2010, those with health insurance on their current job, but no health

insurance in retirement, expected to retire 7 tenths of a year earlier than those with no health

insurance either on the job or in retirement (64.5 vs. 65.2). They expected to retire 0.4 years after

those with health insurance both at work and in retirement (64.5 vs. 64.1).

        Next compare results between the two panels in Table 12, beginning with row 1, column

1 in each panel. Those with health insurance on the job and no health insurance in retirement in

2010 expected to claim their Social Security benefits at age 65, half a year after they retired.

Those with no health insurance on the job and no health insurance in retirement expected to

claim benefits 0.6 years before they retired, while those with health insurance both on the job and

in retirement expected to retire four tenths of a year before they claimed their benefits.


to the expected age questions. The comparisons among cell values are similar, but not identical,
to those described in the following paragraphs.
12
 Note that for both the expected age of claiming and of retirement, all medians are age 65 and
do not differ by health insurance coverage.

                                                                                                   22

*2010 weights. Includes only respondents who held a job in all three years.

       Next consider the statistics relevant to the effects of ACA on age of benefit claiming or

retirement expectations. Compare the expected ages of claiming or retirement in 2010 with the

expected ages in 2014. There was little change in the expected age of Social Security benefit

claiming. More importantly, the movement in the expected age of retirement is in the opposite

direction of what was expected from changes in ACA. If no other influences were operating

except for the change in ACA, our expectation is that the expected age of claiming and of

retirement should decline for those who had health insurance on the job, but not in retirement.

Instead, from the lower panel, first row, between 2010 and 2014, the expected age of retirement

increased by seven tenths of a year for those who had health insurance when working, but no

retiree health insurance.

       To be sure, the increase in retirement age in all categories may reflect an adjustment to

capital losses and job losses suffered during the Great Recession. However, the increase in

expected retirement age for those with health insurance at work but not in retirement was larger

than the increase observed for those who had no employer provided health insurance from their

employer while working, or in retirement.

                                                                                                   23
       Clearly the descriptive statistics on changes in expected retirement age conditional on

initial health insurance coverage are not sufficient to test the underlying effects of health

insurance availability on retirement. There are many considerations beyond the availability of

health insurance that drive the claiming and retirement decisions. If these are systematically

related to the availability of health insurance on the job and/or in retirement in 2010, we will not

observe the expected relationship between health insurance and retirement in simple descriptive

statistics. To isolate the effects of health insurance availability at work and in retirement on

retirement outcomes, it will be necessary to take account of the role of pensions and other

covariates that are correlated with the availability of health insurance and are also correlated with

retirement outcomes. Accordingly, we turn to multivariate regressions of changes in expected

retirement age on initial health insurance coverage.

   The sample underlying Table 13 includes members of both the Early and Mid Boomer

cohorts. It is restricted to those who reported a claiming or retirement age in the initial and final

year, either 2004 and 2008 for the Early Boomers, or 2010 and 2014 for the Mid Boomers. To be

included, the respondents could not have answered “don’t know” or “refuse” when asked about

their expectation. Table 13 is also restricted to respondents who in the initial year they were in

the survey reported they expected to claim benefits or retire at ages 65 or earlier, since ACA only

affects availability of health insurance when retired for those under 65. The first two columns in

Table 13 report results for regressions with the claiming age as the dependent variable. The next

two columns report results where expected retirement age is the dependent variable.

   In all cases, the key independent variable is the coefficient reported in row 3, the coefficient

on a dummy variable indicating that the individual had health insurance at work but not in

retirement, interacted with an indicator that he or she was a member of the Mid Boomer cohort.



                                                                                                     24

regressions include an indicator of coverage on the job but not in retirement, an indicator of

coverage both on the job and in retirement, and an interaction between coverage on the job and

in retirement with an indicator the individual is from the Mid Boomer cohort. Those with no

health insurance while employed and with no retiree health insurance fall within the excluded

category. The multiple regressions in columns 2 and 4 also include variables measuring gender,

age, a series of dummy variables measuring schooling, education, health, occupation and type of

pension coverage.

    The fits for all regressions are very poor. The coefficients reported in row 3, columns 3 and 4

are in the wrong direction, suggesting that compared to those with no health insurance on the job

or in retirement, ACA would increase the expected retirement date for those with health

insurance on the job but not in retirement. This small effect is not statistically significant,

however. The coefficients in the regressions for expected claiming age are very near zero and

also are not statistically significant.

    The bottom line is that there is no statistically significant evidence that ACA has affected

retirement intentions.

    Once again, it is possible that too short a time has passed for ACA to have affected

retirement expectations, especially since many in the sample would have been a number of years

away from retirement, even in 2014. Reoptimization may take time, and not enough time may

have passed for plans to have been fully readjusted.

      It is also possible that the new incentives are not yet fully understood. Learning may take

  time, or the time period may be too short to allow other adjustments, such as the additional

  saving required if retirement is to be accelerated. Or as the dynamics of health insurance

  coverage examined in Section II suggest, the specification of the expected retirement date

  equation may be too simple. When we allow for other sources of health insurance coverage, type

  of employer provided health insurance in 2010 may be an imperfect measure of the incentive

  facing some individuals. This error in measurement may obscure a true effect of ACA on

  retirement.




                                                                                                    26
   To further investigate the reasons for this finding in the intermediate term, we now turn to an

analysis of a structural model that has been useful in explaining various discontinuities in the

retirement hazard, and the relation of nonlinear retirement incentives to retirement outcomes.

   IV. A Simulation Analysis Based on a Structural Model

   Our structural analysis simulates the effects of the Affordable Care Act on retirement. The

simulations are based on a model we developed under a grant from the National Institute on

Aging (Gustman and Steinmeier, forthcoming). The model is dynamic. Life expectancy and

health are stochastic.

   There is considerable heterogeneity built into the utility function. Time preference and

preference for leisure over work differ among individuals. Although time preference varies

among individuals, time preference is assumed to be constant over time for any individual.

Leisure preferences can change after retirement, possibly inducing some individuals to return to

work after an initial period of retirement.

   The budget equation includes earnings in full and part-time employment, detailed

specification of formulas governing employer provided pension plans, Social Security benefit

rules, health insurance and health expenditures, and spouse’s income. Because the analysis

explicitly models the incentives from defined benefit pensions, it avoids a fundamental mistake

of studies that focus on retiree health insurance, but ignore or mismeasure the accrual profiles of

each individual’s DB pension. Typically such studies attribute some of the (omitted) effects of

DB pensions on retirement to retiree health insurance.

   An important simplification in this model concerns the relation between Social Security

benefit claiming and retirement. Here we impose the assumption that Social Security benefits are




                                                                                                   27
claimed as soon as possible. For a study that allows the claiming date to vary and also allows the

retirement date to differ from the claiming date, see Gustman and Steinmeier (2015).

    A point of emphasis is the relationship between detailed health outcomes, health risks, wealth

and retirement. The health section of the model includes several individual health behaviors,

such as smoking, drinking, and obesity, as well as the effects of several medical conditions, such

as diabetes, heart problems, and lung problems. These help to determine the health status of an

individual, which can change over time. The health status, in conjunction with the individual’s

insurance status, determines the distribution of out-of-pocket health costs.

    Within this framework, individuals make labor force choices and savings choices to

maximize expected utility over time. Maximization of utility, subject to the budget constraint

over the life cycle, governs the retirement decision and the decision to increase work effort once

retired.

    The estimated effects of ACA are only approximated. We begin the simulation by modifying

the budget constraint to reflect the situation just before the adoption of ACA. We then simulate

the effects of the changing availability of health insurance due to ACA by assuming full

subsidization of health insurance expenditures through ACA. We then compare outcomes before

and after ACA, where the opportunity set is gleaned from our descriptive analysis, and the

changes fostered by the ACA are modeled both in the short term and in the long term. Note that

this approximation will exaggerate the reduction in the work incentive for higher income

individuals who are not eligible for a subsidy under ACA while employed. It will also exaggerate

the reduction in work incentives if ACA is inferior to employer provided health insurance. We

find only a small effect of ACA on retirement even after standardizing for income group.




                                                                                                   28
   The model was estimated for individuals in the original Health and Retirement Study cohort,

ages 51 to 61 in 1992. These individuals are now in their seventies and eighties, well past

retirement age. To make the simulations more relevant to individuals currently on the cusp of

retirement, several changes have been made to the budget sets for the individuals in the sample.

First, the full retirement age for Social Security has been set to 66. For most of the individuals in

the original HRS cohort the full retirement age was 65, but for individual currently retiring it is

66. For the same reason, the value of the delayed retirement credit has been adjusted to 8% for

the entire sample; it was considerably less for most of the members of the original HRS cohort.

Thirdly, the earnings test has been eliminated for individuals above the full retirement age,

reflecting a change in the law in 2001. Finally, for individuals who had only a defined benefit

pension, 43% of them were randomly reassigned to have a defined contribution pension. This

roughly reflects the change in the pension environment between the original HRS cohort and the

more recent Early and Mid Boomer cohorts who are currently in the age range where they are

making retirement decisions.

       The results of the base simulation, which omit the effects of the Affordable Care Act, are

shown in Tables 14 through 16. The last two columns at the top of Table 14 give the simulated

percentages of individuals who are retired from full-time work and who are fully retired, by age.

The first two columns in the top part of the table give the increase in the percentages of

individuals in the associated retirement state. For instance, at age 61, 48.6% of the individuals

are simulated to be retired from full-time work, and at age 62, 64.7% are simulated to be retired.

The difference, 16.1%, is the net increase in the number of individuals retired from full-time

work. It is the net flow of individuals who are newly retired from full-time work less the

individuals who were not working full-time at age 61 but have returned to full-time work at age



                                                                                                      29
62. The bottom of the table indicates the hazard rates for retiring at the indicate ages. As

expected, the hazard rate has a sharp peak at age 62, the Social Security early entitlement age,

and a secondary peak at age 65, the Medicare eligibility age.

       Table 15 breaks down the percentage of individuals working full-time, part-time, and not

working at all by lifetime income status. To do so, we calculated the potential lifetime income

from the Social Security records and divided the sample roughly into thirds. The lower income

groups are simulated to have much higher rates of part-time work, probably because the wage

penalty for part-time work vs. full-time work is not nearly as severe for lower wage workers.

Conversely, higher income individuals are much less likely to be in part-time work, implying

that they have a much greater probability of moving from full-time work to full retirement.

       Table 16 is similar to Table 15, except that here the breakdown is by current health status

rather than lifetime income group. Health status is derived from a combination of mobility

limitations, pain levels, activity of daily living (ADL) limitations, and self-assessed overall

health. Fair health is generally associated with one or two mobility limitations, while poor health

is associated with several mobility limitations but none or one ADL limitation. “Terrible” health

is associated with multiple ADL limitations. As expected, the worse the health status, the lower

is the percentage of full-time work and the higher is the percentage of full retirement. The

difference between the good and fair health states is not as dramatic as the difference between

fair and poor health, or between poor and terrible health.

       Table 17 begins the exploration of the effects of introducing the Affordable Care Act

(ACA). As discussed in the descriptive analysis, there are basically three groups that are relevant

to the ACA. The first group is those who have no insurance on their current job and therefore no

insurance in retirement. This group is simulated to have insurance after the ACA is introduced,

and in the model this means that their medical costs are largely eliminated relative to the base

simulation. The second group is those who have insurance on the job but no retiree health

coverage. This is the group that is subject to the situation frequently called “job lock,” where

they feel that they have to keep on working in order to keep their insurance. As noted previously,

one would expect to find the largest effect of the ACA on this group, since after the introduction

of the ACA this group will no longer feel that they have to continue working in order to keep

health insurance. The third group is those who have health insurance in their job, and this

insurance will continue when they are retired up to the Medicare eligibility age. The ACA will

have only a small if any effect on the retirement behavior of this group.

       Table 17 relates to full-time work by individuals who have insurance in their job but no

retiree insurance, that is, the individuals subject to job lock. The columns of the table pertain to

the age at which the ACA is introduced. The first column pertains to the situation when the ACA

is introduced at age 25. Since the simulations start at age 25, this simulation corresponds to the

effects of a fully anticipated ACA over the full lifetime. The next three columns suppose that the

individuals are 50, 55, and 60 at the time the ACA is introduced. Prior to those ages, the

individuals have not anticipated the ACA and had made labor force and savings decisions as

though there would be no ACA. After the introduction of the ACA, the individuals reoptimize

their decisions, given the labor force and savings decisions they have made up to that point.




                                                                                                     34
Columns for ages after 60 are not included, since at age 65 Medicare becomes available and the

ACA essentially becomes irrelevant.

       The figures in Table 17 are the percentages of individuals retired from full-time work in

the relevant simulation with ACA minus the percentage of individuals retired from full-time

work in the base simulation, in which there was no ACA. For instance, the figure of 0.7 in the

third column of the row for age 62 indicates that in the simulation for the introduction of the

ACA at age 55, retirement from full-time work at age 62 was 0.7 percentage point higher than

the corresponding percentage in the base simulation. In general, these percentages are relatively

low, but even more interesting for the present research is that these percentages do not move

much as one goes across the columns. That is, the effect of the ACA at a particular age does not

change very much regardless of whether it was introduced two years ago or twenty years ago, or

whether it has always been there.

       This last result is perhaps a bit surprising, so it may be useful to ask what might be

generating it. The answer appears to be in the response of saving to the relatively small

probability of encountering high health costs before age 65, when Medicare kicks in. Another

way to ask the question is to think about how much of saving is attributable to the prospect of

having high medical expenses before age 65. Since the probability of these expenses is fairly

small, the answer is probably not much. In response to the possibility of realizing these expenses,

there are two possible outcomes. One is to accumulate resources before the expenses, and the

other is to adjust consumption after the expenses. These results seem to indicate the latter, that is,

cumulative saving is probably not that much different, especially relative to retirement saving,

whether or not ACA has been around for a long time.

       This does not imply that ACA has no effect on retirement. The ACA has some wealth

effect because it offsets some of the potential future expenses, and it also makes the value of

current employment somewhat less for individuals currently covered in their jobs but not as

retirees, since with ACA they would be covered anyway even if retired. Both of these effects

reduce incentives for full-time work, which is what the table suggests. But if the effect is coming

from these considerations and not from accumulated savings, then the magnitude of the effect

will not depend very much on the length of time since the ACA was introduced.

       The first panel in the table deals with the overall sample of those with insurance while

working but without retiree health insurance, while the next three panels deal with the three

income groups within this overall sample. One might expect individuals in the lowest income

group to have the largest effect, but this does not seem to be the case. One explanation is that

individuals with low incomes are more likely to have little savings, and if high medical expenses

arise they fall back on the safety net (Hubbard, Skinner and Zeldes, 1995), which for the

purposes of these simulations takes the form of a minimum consumption standard. The middle

income group is less likely to follow this route, so their response to the ACA is a bit more

pronounced. For the high income group, on the other hand, medical expenses (which are

assumed to be dependent on health status but not on income) are a smaller percentage of income,

and hence the responses will be more muted.

       The last two panels of the table deal with the responses of those in good health and those

in poor health, respectively. One might expect the group in poor health to be more responsive to

the introduction of the ACA, and that does indeed seem to be the case. Individuals in poor health

face higher medical expenses and would be more reluctant to give up full-time jobs and expose

themselves to these expenses without the ACA. With the ACA, however, this disincentive to

retire disappears, and they are therefore more likely to increase their retirement rates relative to

those with lower medical expenses. Even here, though, the effect is not large.

       Table 18 looks at increases in retirement from full-time work for the sample whose

individuals are not covered by health insurance either in their job or in retirement, that is, for

those who are not covered at all in the absence of the ACA. In these simulations, a rather

unexpected pattern emerges: with the ACA, these individuals are simulated to reduce retirement

from full-time work before about age 62 but increase it thereafter. That is, before age 62 they

actually increase full-time work in the presence of the ACA.

       One explanation for this pattern relies on the fact that the bulk of individuals with no

insurance on their full-time jobs are relatively low wage workers with relatively little, if any,

savings. If they leave work before age 62, the Social Security early entitlement age, their

alternative may be to rely on the minimum consumption standard, in which case their medical

expenses are effectively covered. If they work, however, they must pay their medical expenses

out of their earnings, which effectively reduces their compensation from which they can

purchase other consumption goods. In essence, for this group, they are insured if they leave their

full-time jobs but not if they remain in their jobs. Introducing the ACA reduces the medical

expenses they incur if they remain in their jobs and hence effectively increases their

compensation, which in turn induces them to increase their full-time work.

          At age 62, however, they are eligible for Social Security, and the medical expenses do in

fact reduce the amount available for consumption regardless of whether or not they are working.

At this point the ACA no longer alters the relative incentives between work and retirement, and

the remaining incentives have to do with the income effect of the ACA. These incentives work in

the direction of inducing earlier retirement, so the signs of the effects of the ACA tend to change

around the time of the Social Security early entitlement age.

          Looking at the three income groups in the second through fourth panels, it is evident that

the middle income group of the sample with no insurance has the greatest effect of the

introduction of the ACA. In the face of high medical expenses, low income workers are more

likely to be driven to the minimum consumption standard than are middle income workers, and

at that point they become effectively insured. High income workers, on the other hand, are

proportionately less affected by medical expenses and hence have a relatively low response to

the introduction of the ACA.

          Tables 19 and 20 repeat the exercises reported in Tables 17 and 18 except that these

tables look at full retirement rather than retirement from full-time work. The effects of the ACA

on full retirement seem to follow the same general patterns as for retirement from full-time work,

however, so much the same discussion as applied to Tables 17 and 18 also applies to these

tables.

V. Conclusions

       Simulations based on a previously estimated structural model of retirement and saving

suggest that the group subject to the largest marginal effect on their retirement incentives from

Affordable Care Act – those who initially had health insurance at work but not in retirement --

will increase their retirement as a result of passage of ACA. But the reduction in work effort is

quite modest, amounting to an increase of half a percentage point per year in the percent retired.

These simulations also suggest that the period of adjustment to a change in the law will be

relatively short. In contrast, they suggest that ACA will reduce the probability of retirement at

earlier ages by those who had no health insurance coverage either at work or in retirement prior

to ACA.

       Empirical data indicating the actual changes in retirement and retirement intentions

observed to date are consistent with the simulations based on the structural model estimated with

pre-ACA data. There is no statistically significant evidence in HRS panel data that respondents

who initially had health insurance at work, but not in retirement, have begun to retire early as a

result of ACA. Nor is there evidence of changes in expected retirement dates and dates of

claiming Social Security as a result of adoption of ACA.

       The simulations based on the structural model lead us to expect only small changes in

retirement as a result of ACA, even in the long term. It is, however, possible that once ACA has

been in place for a while, changes might be found in actual and expected retirements. The current

strong penalties for not conforming to ACA have only just come on line. Thus at the time of the

HRS survey of Mid Boomers in 2014, people may not yet have focused on the implications of

the law for their looming retirement, and therefore may not have changed either their retirement

behavior or their retirement intensions in response. Moreover, looking forward to the 2016 HRS



                                                                                                     47
survey results, there are a couple of other reasons why one might expect to eventually find some

effects of ACA on retirement. First, despite a temporary program to subsidize employer provided

health insurance for early retirees (WHITEHOUSE.GOV/HEALTH REFORM), employer

offerings of early retiree coverage will probably decline further (Kaiser Family Foundation,

2016). As a result, the group most affected by the change in incentives (the "current employer

coverage/early retiree coverage NOT available") will grow. That would yield larger effects in the

medium/long run. Second, should more states expand Medicaid over time, that would also mean

a larger effect.

        Nevertheless, we did not uncover any evidence to suggest that ACA will have large

effects on retirement. Thus the effects of ACA on retirement would, at most, have only a minor

influence on any evaluations of ACA. Both supporters and critics will have to look elsewhere

when drawing conclusions about the welfare effects of ACA.
