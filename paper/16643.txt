When Opportunity Knocks, Who Answers? New Evidence on College Achievement Awards

                                               ABSTRACT

We evaluate the effects of academic achievement awards for first and second-year college students
on a Canadian commuter campus. The award scheme offered linear cash incentives for course grades
above 70. Awards were paid every term. Program participants also had access to peer advising by
upperclassmen. Program engagement appears to have been high but overall treatment effects were
small. The intervention increased the number of courses graded above 70 and points earned above
70 for second-year students, but there was no significant effect on overall GPA. Results are somewhat
stronger for a subsample that correctly described the program rules. We argue that these results fit
in with an emerging picture of mostly modest effects for cash award programs of this type at the post-secondary
level.

I. Introduction
         As many as 40 percent of U.S. and 30 percent of Canadian undergraduates have yet to
finish college six years after matriculating (National Center for Education Statistics, 2010,
Grayson and Grayson, 2003). These delays, which are typically due to a failure to meet academic
degree requirements, may be both privately and socially costly. Struggling students pay a higher
cost in foregone earnings, while those who fail to complete a degree program forgo the benefit of
any possible “sheepskin effects.” Time on campus is also subsidized in public colleges and
universities, so repeated course failures and long completion times are costly for taxpayers.
         In an effort to boost their student’ grades, most universities deploy an array of support
services. There is little credible evidence that these efforts justify their cost. A randomized trial
discussed by Scrivener and Weiss (2009) finds that campus support services generate small
improvements in grades and reduce student attrition, but Angrist, Lang, and Oreopoulos (2009)
and MacDonald, Bernstein, and Price (2009) find virtually no effect from remedial services. Part
of the problem seems to be that take-up rates for most services are low. On the other hand, results
from recent evaluations by Scrivener, Sommo, and Collado (2009) and Bettinger and Long
(2009) suggest mandatory remedial services can benefit college freshman at risk of dropping out.
         In a parallel effort, motivated in part by the mixed results for support services alone,
researchers and policy-makers have experimented with financial incentives for college
achievement. Merit scholarships for high achievers have long been a feature of college life, but
most merit scholarship recipients are, by definition, students who could be expected to do
reasonably well with or without scholarship support. Financial awards for weaker students have
traditionally been need-based, and performance-based awards for weak students are a relatively
new development. In a series of randomized trials, Angrist et al. (2009), Cha and Patel (2010),
MacDonald et al. (2009), and Barrow et al. (2010) studied the impact of large merit scholarships
tied to college GPA thresholds in the B-C grade range. These studies find that merit scholarships
had positive effects on academic performance, especially when combined with extra academic
support services. However, these improvements were short-lived and concentrated in subgroups,
so that the overall effects are modest.1

    Georgia Hope and a host of similar state programs award scholarships to students with a high school GPA of B or
    better (see, e.g., Dynarski, 2004). See also Garibaldi et al. (2007), who report faster degree completion by Italian
    women in response to gradually increasing tuition payments and Leuven, Oosterbeek, and van der Klaauw
    (2003), who find mixed effects of small financial incentives for Dutch university students.
       Randomized trials and quasi-experimental evaluations of financial incentives have been
more encouraging for elementary and secondary students than for college students. Here too,
however, student responses often appear to be limited to subgroups of the population under
study. Studies showing substantial positive effects on elementary and secondary school students
include Angrist et al. (2002), Henry and Rubinstein (2002), Kremer, Miguel, and Thornton
(2009), Angrist and Lavy (2009), Deardon et al. (2009), Dee (2009), and Pallais (2009). Other
recent experimental studies have generated less reason for optimism about the promise of
incentives in schools: the randomized trials described by Bettinger (2008), Sharma (2010), and
Fryer (2010) show little effect of an array of awards on achievement for elementary and middle
school students in a wide variety of settings, and Rodriguez-Planas (2010) reports negative long-
run effects of financial incentives for high school men.
       This paper reports on the “Opportunity Knocks” (OK) experiment, an award program
piloted at a large Canadian commuter university. The setting is similar to non-flagship campuses
in American state systems. First and second-year students who applied for financial aid were
offered the chance to participate in the program. Those who agreed were randomly assigned to
treatment and control groups. Treated students earned $100 for each class in which they attained
a grade of 70 or better and an additional $20 for each percentage point above 70 percent. A
student with a full-course load scoring 75 in every course qualified for $2,000 over the course of
the school year (10  ($100 + (5  20))). Randomly assigned peer advisors, upper-class students
who had been trained to provide advice about study strategies, time management, and university
bureaucracy, also contacted participants. The OK program structure was developed in view of the
results from an earlier evaluation on a similar campus, the Student Achievement and Retention
(STAR) project (Angrist, et al., 2009). STAR offered three interventions, the most successful of
which combined financial incentives with academic support services. In the hopes of boosting
motivation further, the OK award threshold was chosen to be attainable for most students
(subject to a budget constraint). We opted for a partially linear payout scheme on theoretical
grounds (see, e.g., Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1987).
       OK awards were generous; high achievers could earn up to $700 per class. Almost 90
percent of OK participants had some kind of interaction with peer advisors and/or the program
web site. On balance, however, the experimental results were disappointing. Second year
students who were offered incentives earned about 13 percent more than expected based on the


                                                 3
distribution of control-group grades, suggesting the program had an incentive effect. The
strongest effects appear around the award threshold, where the number of payment-qualifying
courses increased, especially among students who appeared to understand the program well. But
these gains did not translate into substantially and significantly higher GPAs. There is also little
evidence of any impact on academic outcomes measured one year later.
       The following section describes the OK campus setting, program rules, and our random-
assignment research design. Section III covers descriptive statistics and reports on indicators of
program engagement. Section IV discusses the experimental results, which show that treated
second year students earned more in award payments than would have been expected in the
absence of an incentive effect. OK also increased the number of second-year courses graded
above 70 and grade points earned above 70, but these effects were not large enough to generate a
significant increase in students’ overall GPAs. Section V reports on participants’ impressions of
the program as revealed in post-program surveys. The paper concludes in Section VI.


II. Background and Research Design
       OK was implemented on an Ontario commuter campus affiliated with a large public
university in the fall of 2008. The six-year completion rate on this campus is about 73 percent.
There are about 2,500 students in an entering class. In late summer of 2008, we invited 1,056
first years and 1,073 second years to participate in OK. Eligible students are those who had
requested financial aid, had an email address, had a high school GPA recorded in the university
administrative information system, and had enrolled for at least 1.5 credits (half of a full load) in
the fall semester. Invitees who completed the intake survey and gave consent were eligible for
random assignment. Of the 1,271 students who completed the survey and were eligible, 400 were
treated. Treatment assignment was stratified by year (first and second) and sex, with 100 in each
group. Within sex-year cells, assignment was stratified by high school GPA quartile, with 25 in
each group (the analysis below controls for strata).
       The OK intervention combined incentives with academic support services. This was
motivated by the fact that a combination of incentives and services appeared to be especially
effective in the earlier STAR evaluation, which ran in a similar setting. The services delivered
through STAR were more elaborate and expensive, however. STAR included the opportunity to
participate in facilitated study groups as well as email-based peer mentoring, while OK services



                                                 4
consisted of email-based peer-mentoring only. We opted for email because the take-up rate for
facilitated study groups was low. Also, because a number of STAR participants saw the awards
as essentially out of reach, OK award rates were designed to be much higher. OK awards were
also paid out more frequently, in this case, every term. Unlike STAR, the OK population
consisted only of students that had applied for financial aid prior to the start of the school year.
This was partly in response to political constraints but it also seemed likely that the aid
population might be most responsive to the opportunity to earn additional awards.
         OK participants earned $100 for each class in which they received a 70 percent grade,
and an additional $20 for each percentage point above 70.2 For example, a student who earned a
75 in each of five classes over one semester (five classes constitute a full load) would have
received 5 × (100 + (5 × 20)) = $1,000. We focused on grades near 70 because anything worse is
typically seen as unsatisfactory and because awards for lower levels of achievement are likely to
be prohibitively expensive (a GPA of at least C- is required for graduation; this translates to a
percentage grade in the low 60s). In an effort to gauge our subjects’ understanding of program
rules, we asked those eligible for random assignment to apply the award formula to hypothetical
grades. Most calculated the award values correctly (those who responded incorrectly received a
clarification by email).
         The services component of OK matched all treated students with (trained and paid) same-
sex peer advisors. Peer advisors were enthusiastic upper-year students or recent graduates with
good grades. Each peer advisor covered 50 participants. Advisors emailed advisees once every
two to three weeks, whether or not the advisees responded. These emails offered advice on
upcoming academic events and workshops and guidance relevant for key periods in the academic
calendar, such as midterms and finals. Advisors also provided information about OK
scholarships, including reminders of the scholarship calculation and payment schedules.
Advisors invited their clients to turn to them for help with any academic or personal issues that
seemed relevant to academic success.




III. Descriptive Statistics and Program Response
         The data for this study come primarily from the university records containing information

2
    Payoffs were doubled and issued in the spring for year-long courses.


                                                         5
on applicants, enrolled students, and course grades. We supplemented this with data from a
baseline survey used to identify the population eligible for random assignment, as well as more
descriptive focus-group style information collected from a few subjects after the experiment.
       Table 1, which presents descriptive statistics, shows that OK participants were mostly
college students of traditional age. Control group students had average grades around 82 percent
in high school. Less than half of the control group spoke English as a first language, reflecting
the relatively high proportion of immigrants on the OK host campus. About half of control group
parents graduated from a postsecondary institution (44 percent of mothers and 53 percent of
fathers), while nearly 80 percent of parents graduated from high school, a figure comparable to
the Canadian average for college student parents. Table 1 also documents the fact that random
assignment successfully balanced the background characteristics of those in the treatment and
control groups (as evidenced by insignificant effects in the “Treatment Difference” columns).
Although not documented in the table, student course selection as measured by difficulty or
subject area is also well balanced between treatment and control groups (random assignment
occurred after students had pre-registered for courses).
       The OK intake survey, included in the packet describing the program to those eligible for
random assignment, included two questions meant to gauge subjects’ understanding of program
award rules. The first asked students to calculate the award amount for one class, and the second
asked them to calculate the total award amount from five classes. Two-thirds of the students
answered the second question correctly, and over 80 percent answered the first question
correctly, facts also documented in Table 1. In the program analysis, we look at treatment effects
for the entire sample and for those who answered the second assessment question correctly to see
if those who understood the scholarship formula also had a stronger program response.
       Student involvement with OK was high. This can be seen in Table 2, which shows that
about 73 percent of treated students checked their scholarship earnings on the program website.
Women were nine points more likely to check than men. Only 38 percent of treated participants
sent an email to their assigned peer advisor in the fall, but this number increased to 50 percent in
the spring. By years end, 70 percent had emailed an advisor at least once over the course of the
year. First year students and women were more likely to contact advisors than were second year
students and men. At least eighty-six percent of treated students made some kind of program
contact: they emailed a peer advisor, checked scholarship earnings, or emailed program staff.



                                                 6
Following a presentation of intention-to-treat effects, we discuss two-stage least squares (2SLS)
estimates of treatment effects using a dummy for any program contact as the endogenous
variable. The idea here is that subjects who made no contact of any kind are unlikely to have
been affected by treatment, so any impact must driven by the subpopulation that did make
contact. 2SLS estimates the effect of treatment on the treated in this case.


IV. Program Effects
A. Main Findings
         A natural starting point for our analysis is a comparison of the amount earned by the
experimental group with the earnings that students in the control group would have been entitled
to had they been in the program. A large program effect should be reflected in larger-than
expected earnings, where expected earnings are measured using the grade distribution in the
control sample. 3 Our estimates of earnings and other effects come from regressions like this one:
                                             yij = αj + βTi + δ’Xi + εij,                                         (1)
where yij is the outcome for student i in stratum j, the αj are strata effects, Ti is a treatment
assignment indicator, and Xi is a vector of additional controls.4 Causal effects of the OK
program are captured by β. Since treatment is randomly assigned, covariates are unnecessary to
reduce omitted variables bias in the estimated treatment effects. Models with covariates may,
however, generate more precise estimates.
         The OK program had no impact on earnings for first-year men and women, a result that
can be seen in columns 1, 4, and 7 of Table 3. On the other hand, there is some evidence of
higher-than-expected earnings for second-year treated students, especially second-year men. The
estimated effect on second year men in the spring term, reported in column 5, is a significant 170
dollars. Estimates over the course of the year are about 255 dollars for men and 180 dollars for
all second years. Both of these estimates are at least marginally significant and amount to 15-20
percent of a standard deviation of hypothetical control group earnings.5

3
    Ashenfelter and Plant (1990) use a similar hypothetical payment outcome to measure the labor supply effects of
    exposure to a negative income tax.
4
    Additional controls include parental education, an indicator for English mother tongue, and indicators for
    students who answered scholarship formula questions correctly.
5
    Restricting the fall and spring samples to be the same as the full-year sample generates effects for the full year
    equal to the sum of the fall and spring effects. Estimated effects for the full year need not equal the sum (or
    average) of the two semester effects because the full-year sample differs slightly from the sample for either
    semester alone.


                                                          7
         The question of whether the OK program caused more complex distributional shifts in
hypothetical earnings is explored in Figure 1, which shows treatment and control earnings
distributions in separate panels by sex and year. The only (marginally) significant distributional
contrast in the figure is for second year men (using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). On the other
hand, the contrast by treatment status for second year women looks similar to that for men. For
both men and women, treatment seems to have shifted second year earnings from below a level
around 1,500 to more than 1,500 dollars. The shift emerges roughly one hundred dollars above
mean earnings for controls.
         The evidence for an effect on average grades (measured on a 0-100 scale) and GPA is
weaker than that for earnings. The grades results appear in Table 4a and the GPA results appear
in Table 4b. Average grades for second-year men increased by about 2.5 percentage points in the
spring but this estimate is only marginally significant, and it’s the only significant result in the
table. The corresponding GPA effect amounts to about 0.27 GPA points, an estimate significant at
the 5 percent level.6
         The earnings gains documented in Table 3 are necessarily explained by increases in the
number of courses graded at least 70 and grade points over 70. Table 5 reports full-year program
effects on each of these components of the scholarship award formula. Panel A shows effects on
the number of courses in which a student earned a grade of at least 70. Treatment appears to have
increased the number of over-70 grades awarded to second year men by almost a full course. The
number of over-70 courses increases by about half a course for all second years. These estimates
are reasonably precise. On the other hand, the estimated effects on grade points earned over 70
are not estimated very precisely. The only (marginally) significant point gain is for all second
years, an effect of 6.2 percentage points. It’s also worth noting, however, that the magnitudes
come out such that effects on total earnings are equally distributed between a threshold effect at
70 and awards for points over 70.
         We looked for additional evidence of effects concentrated around the award threshold.
The results of this investigation are reported in Figure 2 in the form of treatment effects on
indicators for grade>c, where c runs from 60-80 (these plots also show the control grade
distribution). This investigation uncovers no evidence of an increased likelihood of crossing any


6
    GPA is not a linear transformation of average grades, so we expect slight differences in results. Effects on GPA
    should be more similar to effects on earnings, since GPA also jumps at 70 percent.


                                                         8
threshold for first years. Treatment appears to have increased the likelihood second-year women
earned a grade of 72-74, a series of effects concentrated around the minimum award threshold.
Effects concentrated around the threshold may be evidence of strategic grade-seeking behavior
on the part of treated students. For example, students who earned a 69 may have made a special
effort (through negotiation or extra work) to clear 70. On the other hand, treatment appears to
have boosted the grades of second-year men over a wide interval running from 60-75 percent.
This pattern of effects weighs against a purely strategic view of the incentive response, at least
among men.
       Although most students appeared to understand the OK program rules and award
formula, a non-trivial minority did not. Those who misunderstood the formula linking grades and
awards seem less likely to have been motivated by the awards. We therefore report estimates for
a sample restricted to participants who correctly applied the OK earnings formula to an example
in the baseline survey. Two-thirds of the sample evaluated the example correctly. Estimates
limited to this sample are reported in Table 6, which shows full-year estimates for the same
dependent variables covered by Tables 3 through 5.
       Estimates in the restricted sample show larger program effects on earnings than the
estimates computed using the full sample. Specifically, earnings gains are estimated to have been
370 for second year men and 245 for all second years, both significant at the 5 percent level. On
the other hand, neither GPA nor grade effects are significantly different from zero. The apparent
difference in findings for grades and earnings is explained by the last two rows of Table 6, which
reports estimates for the components of the award formula in the restricted sample. These
estimates show reasonably clear effects on the number of courses above 70 with weaker effects
on points earned above. The shift in grades around the 70 percent threshold was apparently
inadequate to boost overall GPA by a statistically significant amount.
       Given the modest program effects observed during the treatment period, it seems unlikely
that OK boosted achievement substantially in the longer-run. This conjecture is confirmed in
Table 7, which reports full-sample treatment effects for fall 2009 (the semester after the program
ended). The results in Table 7 show marginally significant positive effects on average grades and
GPA for first year women and in the pooled sample of first years (who are second years in the
post-treatment period), but these effects are small. The post-program outcomes also offer a
specification test for the analysis above, since we would not expect to see threshold effects



                                                9
around 70 percent in the post-program period. There is no evidence of a treatment effect on the
number of fall 2009 courses graded at or above 70 percent.7


B. Additional Results
         We might expect OK incentives to be more powerful for financially constrained students.
But treatment effects come out similar in subgroups defined by expected financial aid and
whether students expressed concerns about funding.                   Effects are somewhat larger in the
subsample of students whose parents had not been to college than among those with college-
educated parents, but the gap by parents’ schooling is not large or precisely estimated.
         The effects of program assignment reported in Tables 3 to 7 are diluted by non-
compliance, that is, by the fact that some of those assigned to treatment did not really participate
in the program. It’s therefore worth estimating the effect of treatment on participants. The
decision to engage with the program is not randomly assigned; this is a choice made by those
offered the opportunity to participate. However, we can use the randomly assigned offer of OK
treatment as an instrument for program take-up. By virtue of random assignment the OK offer is
unrelated to characteristics of eligible students. The OK offer is also highly correlated with
participation status: As shown in Table 2, 86 percent of those offered OK were engaged in some
way, while no one in the control group had access to OK awards or services. The overall first
stage effect of OK offers on participation is therefore around 0.86. Moreover, because no one in
the control group participated, 2SLS estimates in this case capture the effect of participation on
program participants, as described in Angrist and Pischke (2009, Section 4.4.3). Effects on
program participants are of interest because they give a kind of theoretical upper bound on
program effects for this particular intervention. These estimates tell us how much achievement
was boosted for those who responded to incentives in some measurable way.
         The first stage effect of OK offers on participation rates is between 0.84 and 0.9 in the
full sample and between 0.86 and 0.92 in the subsample that appears to have understood OK
program rules. The first-stage estimates appear in the first row of each panel in Table 8, which
also reports 2SLS estimates of the effect of participation on participants. Adjusting reduced-form
offer effects (i.e., the estimates of program effects reported in Tables 3-6) for non-compliance


7
    Roughly 100 program participants dropped out between the first and second years. Dropout rates were similar in
    the treatment and control groups.


                                                       10
necessarily leads to somewhat larger treatment effects, in this case larger by about 10-20 percent.
       The most impressive effects in Table 8 are for the number of courses in which students
earned a grade above 70. Here, effects on second years in the full sample are on the order of two-
thirds of a course, while the gains among those who understood the program well amount to
almost a full course (an estimate of 0.91 with a standard error of 0.33, reported at the bottom of
column 8). The last column of Table 8 shows a marginally significant effect on the number of
courses in which students earned at least 70 among all students who understood the program well
(i.e., pooling men and women, and first and second years). The effect for all men is also
significant at the 5 percent level in this sample, with a marginally significant impact on second-
year women. A robust and substantial impact on hypothetical earnings and points above 70 also
emerges from the 2SLS estimates in Panel B. At the same time, neither the earnings effects nor
the increase in the number of courses graded above 70 translated into higher overall average
grades among participants.


V. Student Impressions
       The OK sign-up survey asked students to predict their average grades in two scenarios,
one as an OK participant and one as a non-participant. To encourage a thoughtful response to this
question, we offered those who answered the opportunity to win a $500 prize to be given to the
student whose predictions came closest to the mark. About 60 percent predicted the same grade
either way and the average predicted effect on grades was about 2.2 points. This is considerably
larger than most of the effects reported in Tables 6 and 8. It also seems noteworthy that those
who predicted a positive response do not appear to have responded more strongly than those who
predicted no effect.
       After the program ended, we asked students who predicted no effect in the intake survey
why they had expected this. Of the 226 emails sent to treated participants predicting no effect,
only 34 responded. Most of these respondents said they were planning to do as well as possible
either way. For example, one said: “Before starting courses, I had already decided that I would
do my best. And so, I felt a scholarship would be an added motivation, but fundamentally it came
down to my own ability and commitment.” Two thought the award was too remote, commenting:
“I predicted the program would have no effect because it provides a long-term reward for regular
short-term behavior (daily intense studying).” Only 3 respondents said the incentives were too



                                                11
small. One said OK was “not too catchy and/or something worth dying for.” Another mentioned
the 70 percent threshold: “I believe the cash reward for each course was not high enough per
percentage point above 70 percent. If the cash reward was perhaps 30 or 40 dollars per percent
point above 70 percent, I would've worked even harder.”
       We also surveyed a random sample of 50 students from the treatment group at the end of
the school year (May 13, 2009), offering $25 movie gift certificates to those who responded.
Among the 30 respondents to this survey, 27 said the scholarships motivated them. Some thought
the program was very effective. For example, one respondent commented: “Every time I began
to lose interest in a particular course, I would remind myself that I just need to well . . . keep with
it; the rewards will be tremendous. A scholarship is one such reward . . . and it sure is helpful, as
it lifts a lot of the financial burdens I’m faced with when it comes to paying tuition & other fees.”
Others saw the program was somewhat effective, as in this comment: “This scholarship did
affect my motivation to study at some point . . .” Respondents often cited concerns about tuition
and fees as a motivating factor that boosted their interest in OK.
       Half of the post-program treated respondents felt the program led them to study more,
though some felt their opportunity for more study time was limited. This comment was typical:
“The program made me study more, but not much. I usually follow my schedule between work
and school. So the amount of time I could have spent on study is somehow limited.” Others felt
the program helped them focus on schoolwork: “As someone who gets sidetracked easily, I kept
it in mind that staying focused would pay off in more than one way, and so yes, it did affect the
amount of time I devoted to studying”. Another said, “I think what’s great about the program is
that when you feel like you’re beginning to procrastinate, you think about the outcome of this
program and want to get back to studying.” On the other hand, one second year student reporting
feeling somewhat demoralized by OK: “I did abnormally poor this year compared to my usual
standards and it just so happened to coincide with Opportunity Knocks. The money reminder just
kind of made me feel ‘worse’ about myself.”
       Among those who responded to the post-program follow-up survey, almost all felt the
program improved their academic performance. Some appreciated the opportunity to earn
scholarships for good but not necessarily outstanding grades: “Personally, I don’t find that [the
university] offers as many scholarship opportunities as other [universities], so I think it was
rewarding to know that my academic performance was acknowledged and rewarded.” Some felt



                                                  12
they increased performance out of financial concerns: “[E]specially now with the economic
downfall, it is extremely difficult to muster up the finances to help pay for tuition without relying
on OSAP [financial aid]. I kind of looked at Opportunity Knocks as my employer who gives me
more money the better I performed in my studies.” One student volunteered the view that the
program would have a long-lasting effect on him/her: “The program had significantly improved
my grades! And I cannot wait to see what I can accomplish next year.”
       Everyone we contacted afterwards reported that they received peer advisor e-mails about
once or twice a month. All but one of the respondents said the advisor e-mails were helpful. One
noted, “I think the advisor made good decisions between sending us important reminders and
information without being redundant. It was especially important to receive the e-mails about the
scholarship money quickly after marks were sent in.” Another said, “I find it very useful that
someone was actually helping me through school.” All but one respondent felt the program was
worth continuing. Virtually everyone seemed grateful for having being selected for OK. One
respondent closed with this endorsement:
       The OK Program has been an essential part of my student experience, and in many
       ways crucial to my academic performance. I think that having a peer advisor as
       opposed to just the regular counselors working in the University is very important.
       With all the stress that universities cause their students – financially or otherwise,
       it's really nice to know there is a program like Opportunity Knocks to help students
       every step of the way.

Overall, this feedback leaves us feeling that most treated students were aware of and engaged
with OK, and that a large minority expected some benefit. Others who thought the program
would have little effect seem to feel this way because they were already anxious to succeed and
willing to devote time to their studies.


VI. Summary and Conclusions
       The OK program was popular with participants: sign-up rates and program engagement
were high, and in follow-up focus group interviews many program participants were enthusiastic
about the experience. At the same time, overall program effects on achievement were modest.
Treated second-year students earned more in OK scholarship money than we would have
expected based on the control-group grade distribution, increased the number of courses in which
they earned a grade of 70, and gained a few grade points above 70. This localized response to the



                                                 13
large program incentive to earn a grade of 70 percent did not translate into a substantial boost in
overall achievement, but it was noticeably stronger in the subsample of students who appear to
have understood the award scheme well.
         The past decade has seen a growing number of randomized evaluations of pay-for-
performance schemes for students at various levels. Table 9 summarizes studies using
randomized designs to look at financial incentives in college.8 A number of these studies show
effects on credits earned in response to incentives for course completion and grade thresholds
(Barrow et al., 2010, Cha and Patel, 2010, and MacDonald et al., 2009). These results, along
with the findings in Angrist et al. (2009) and those reported here, suggest that students react to
threshold targets more strongly than to marginal incentives beyond the initial target. Incentives
also seem to be more effective when combined with academic support services. Overall,
however, the picture that emerges from the research summarized in Table 9 is one of mostly
modest effects. In particular, overall GPA seems largely unaffected except in some subgroups,
and Angrist et al. (2009) is the only randomized evaluation to date to find college achievement
effects persisting into the post-treatment period. It’s also worth noting that the OK demonstration
failed to replicate the strong positive results for women seen in the earlier experiment.
         One explanation for the muted effectiveness of merit scholarships may be that poor
performing students have trouble developing effective study strategies. For example, Israeli high
school students have easy access to test-focused remedial study sessions in public school, a fact
that may explain some of the stronger Angrist and Lavy (2009) results on achievement awards
for high school girls. Fryer (2010) similarly argues that incentives for learning (in his case,
reading books) look more promising than pay for performance on achievement tests. These
intriguing results come from elementary and secondary school settings. Investigation of the
merits of as-yet-untried recipes combining learning incentives with academic support schemes
seems a worthy priority for future research on college achievement.

Difference" columns report coefficients from regressions of each variable in the left-most column on a treatment dummy, with sampling strata controls (gender, year in
school, and high school grade quartile). The last row presents within-column F tests of joint significance of all the treatment differences. Standard deviations for the
control group are in square brackets, robust standard errors are in parentheses, and p values for F tests are in curly braces. Some respondents did not answer the parents'
education questions. They are coded as a separate category (“missing”) and therefore are not coded as high school or college graduates.

Notes: “Control Mean” rows list averages and standard deviations of program earnings, within the relevant gender-year subgroup. “Treatment Effect” rows report coefficients
from regressions of program earnings on a treatment dummy, with sampling strata controls (gender, year in school, and high school grade quartile) and controls for high
school grade average, whether students' first language is English, parents' education, and whether students answered questions on program rules correctly. Control earnings
are hypothetical; treated earnings are actual. Full year courses are double-weighted in the earnings calculation. The sample used for the full year estimates includes students
with grades in fall and spring. The fall analysis omits full year courses. If we restrict the fall and spring samples to be the same as the full year sample, then the effects for the
full year are the sum of the fall and spring effects (this is also true in later tables). Robust standard errors are in parentheses; standard deviations are in square brackets.

Notes: “Control Mean” rows list averages and standard deviations of GPA, within the relevant gender-year subgroup. “Treatment Effect” rows report coefficients from
regressions of GPA on a treatment dummy, with sampling strata controls (year in school, and high school grade quartile) and controls for high school grade average, whether
students' first language is English, parents' education, and whether students answered questions on program rules correctly. GPA is on a four point scale. The sample used for
the full year estimates includes students with grades in fall and spring. The fall analysis omits full year courses. Robust standard errors are in parentheses; standard deviations
are in square brackets.

Notes: The dependent variable in Panel A is the total number of courses in which the student received a grade at 70 percent or higher over both semesters. In Panel B, the
dependent variable is the sum of the percentage points by which the student's grades exceeded 70 percent. “Control Mean” rows list averages and standard deviations, within
the relevant gender-year subgroup. “Treatment Effect” rows report coefficients from regressions on a treatment dummy, with sampling strata controls (gender, year in school,
and high school grade quartile) and controls for high school grade average, whether students' first language is English, parents' education, and whether students answered
questions on program rules correctly. Full year courses are double-weighted in the calculation of both dependent variables. The sample used to make this table includes
students with grades in fall and spring. Robust standard errors are in parentheses; standard deviations are in square brackets.

Notes: “Number of Courses with Grade of At Least 70 Percent” is the total number of courses in which the student received a grade at 70 percent or higher. “Total Grade Percentage
Points Over 70 Percent” is the sum of the percentage points by which the student's grades exceeded 70 percent. Each row reports coefficients from regressions of the indicated variable
on a treatment dummy, with sampling strata controls (gender, year in school, and high school grade quartile) and controls for high school grade average, whether students' first
language is English, parents' education, and whether students answered questions on program rules correctly. Full year courses are double-weighted in the calculation of the dependent
variables. The sample used to make this table includes students with grades in fall and spring. Robust standard errors are in parentheses.

Notes: “Number of Courses with Grade of At Least 70 Percent” is the total number of courses in which the student received a grade at 70 percent or higher. “Total Grade Percentage
Points Over 70 Percent” is the sum of the percentage points by which the student's grades exceeded 70 percent. Each row reports coefficients from regressions of the indicated variable
on a treatment dummy, with sampling strata controls (gender, year in school, and high school grade quartile) and controls for high school grade average, whether students' first
language is English, parents' education, and whether students answered questions on program rules correctly. Full year courses are excluded from the calculation of all five dependent
variables. “First Year” and “Second Year” continue to refer to the students' standing during the program period. Robust standard errors are in parentheses.

Notes: “First Stage (Any Contact)” rows report coefficients from a regression of a dummy variable equal to one if the student made any program-related contact (see Table 2) on a
treatment dummy. “Second Stage” rows report coefficients from IV regressions, instrumenting for the program contact dummy with the treatment dummy. All regressions also include
sampling strata controls (gender, year in school, and high school grade quartile) and controls for high school grade average, whether students' first language is English, parents'
education, and whether students answered questions on program rules correctly. Full year courses are double-weighted in the calculation of second stage dependent variables. The
sample used to make this table includes students with grades in fall and spring. Standard errors are in parentheses.

Note: The figure shows treatment effects on the number of courses in which students earned a grade at or above a given threshold,
where the thresholds are plotted on the x-axis. Control densities are kernel density plots of grades at the course level using a normal
kernel, taking only grades between 60 and 80 percent (inclusive). Treatment effects were estimated using the same models as for
Table 3.
