                                         ABSTRACT

We measure the evolution of dominant firms in the U.S. economy since 1960, and globally since
1990. Contrary to common wisdom, dominant firms have not become larger, have not become
more productive, and their contribution to aggregate productivity growth has fallen by more than
one third since 2000.

                                                         Abstract

       We measure the evolution of dominant firms in the U.S. economy since 1960, and globally since 1990.
       Contrary to common wisdom, dominant firms have not become larger, have not become more productive,
       and their contribution to aggregate productivity growth has fallen by more than one third since 2000.

A large and growing literature argues that changes to the economic environment have led to the rise of
`super-star' firms. This rise is then linked to a wide range of aggregate trends across advanced economies ­
from rising concentration to declining labor shares and declining business dynamism.
    Our contribution to the literature is simply to look directly at the largest, most valuable companies in
the world. We define two main sets of global stars: the top 100 firms by global sales in any given year, and
the top 20 firms in each of our 25 industries. Similarly, we define two set of US stars: the top 20 firms by
(global) sales and the top 4 firms within each 3-digit industry.
    We uncover five stylized facts that contradict the common wisdom. We find that, over the past 20 years:

   1. The market share of dominant firms has not increased.

   2. The value gap between leaders and followers has not increased.

   3. The relative productivity of dominant firms has not increased.

   4. Their Hulten growth contribution has decreased to approximately zero.

   5. The contribution of top firms to aggregate labor productivity has decreased by about 40%.

Two issues explain the differences between our findings and those in the literature. The first difference is that
we actually look at the largest companies, which, perhaps surprisingly, is not what the literature has done
so far. The second difference is that we distinguish domestic and global sales. A commonly used metric
in the literature is consolidated sales over domestic GDP. This metric does not provide a reliable picture of
the evolution of large firms when there is an upward trend in globalization combined with rapid growth in
emerging markets. We argue that one should use either global sales over global GDP, or domestic sales over
domestic GDP.

Literature Review      There are several versions of the `super star' story. Autor et al. (2020) argue for a
"winner-take-most" mechanism driven by increased price-sensitivity of consumers, perhaps thanks to lower
search costs and easier price comparisons. Increased price competition then lowers firm-level markups and
also relocates sales towards high markup/high productivity firms. Haskel and Westlake (2017) argue that
the growing importance of intangible capital leads to increasing returns to scale. Alexander and Eberly
(2016) and Crouzet and Eberly (2018) show that intangible investment is indeed correlated with rising con-
centration and declining investment in the US; and Bessen et al. (2020) shows that intangible investment by
dominant firms leads to greater persistence and reduced leapfrogging by newcomers. Aghion et al. (2018)
and Ridder (2019) assume that ICT technologies increase returns to scale. Aghion et al. (2018) assume that
firms have heterogenous levels of productivity and that intangible capital increases the span of control of
manager. Productive firms can then use intangible capital to enter new markets. In Ridder (2019), some
firms are more adept at using intangible capital to reduce marginal costs, which allows them to scale up
relative to competitors. Relatedly, Akcigit and Ates (2019a) argue that falling diffusion has allowed leading
firms to pull away from the rest. Table 1 in the appendix highlights some predictions of existing theories.
    Despite the widespread discussion of large/super-star firms, there is actually little direct evidence on
their evolution in the US or globally. The difficulty arises in part from the confusion about what is meant
by star firms: are they productive but potentially medium-sized firms? Or are they very large firms with
billions of dollars in revenues? In a well-known paper, Andrews et al. (2015) documents an increased dis-
persion in productivity between global "frontier" firms and "laggard" firms. "Frontier" firms as defined by
Andrews et al. (2015), however, are productive but they are not large. The average frontier firm in Manufac-
turing in their data has about $50 million in revenues and 74 employees (see their Table 1b). The average
frontier firm in Services has about $80 million in revenues. These firms are productive medium enterprises
but they are not the Google's and Amazon's that seem to motivate the literature. Hsieh and Rossi-Hansberg
(2019) similarly build a model motivated by the expansion of the Cheesecake Factory as a prime example of
standardization in retail services. The Cheesecake Factory generates about $2.3 billion in revenues and $290
million in operating cash flows. It is a successful business but its market value of $1.8 billion in February
2020 is less than 1% of the market value of Verizon or AT&T, let alone those of Apple or Google. Finally,
several papers (Grullon et al., 2019; Autor et al., 2020) document increases in concentration ratios within
industries. Setting aside the debate about the proper definition of the market (Shapiro, 2018), we point out
that these results do not speak directly to the impact of very large firms and are silent about their contribution
to growth.

1 Data and Definitions
1.1 Data
We focus on the largest companies in the world, both public and private. For the US, we use Compustat
North America, the US Census, and Forbes' annual publication of "America's Largest Private Companies."
For the rest of the world, we use Compustat Global. We also use aggregate and industry level data from the
BEA, KLEMs and OECD STAN.

Firms' Consolidated Sales, Profits and Market Value We use firm-level sales, market value and em-
ployment data to identify stars. All nominal quantities are converted to US dollars using the exchange rates
provided by Compustat. Compustat covers 100% of market capitalization in the U.S. and Canada; over 96%
in Europe and over 88% in Asia. Data for the US starts in 1950 but provides stable coverage since 1965.
Global data starts in 1987 but provides good coverage for most countries starting in 1990.

US Industry Employment, Prices and Wages           We obtain Employment, as well as Gross Output quanti-
ties and prices from the BEA GDP by Industry accounts. These data cover 20 sectors since 1948 and 62
industries since 1977. We use these data to estimate industry-level labor productivity (used as a benchmark
measure of productivity, for both comparison and reallocation calculations) and to deflate Compustat sales
and compute firm-level labor productivity. We obtain payroll, employment and sales for the top 4 firms in
each industry and the industry as a whole from the U.S. Economic Census concentration accounts, which
are used to compute a labor-quality adjustment and perform robustness analyses on the relative productivity
of stars.

Foreign vs. Domestic Sales      We have two independent ways to measure domestic and foreign sales. At
the industry-level we obtain domestic and foreign sales from the BEA's Data on the Activities of U.S.
Multinational Enterprises. Industry segments roughly follow the 62 industries in the GDP by Industry
accounts. We estimate the share of foreign sales in a given industry as the ratio of sales by `Majority-owned
Foreign Affiliates of U.S. Multinational Enterprises' (MOFA) to total sales, defined as the sum of U.S. Parent
sales and MOFA sales. We refer to domestic sales estimated using this approach as `Dom 1'. At the firm
level we use Compustat Segments to separate domestic from foreign sales. This gives us another measure
of domestic sales, `Dom 2' below.

Global Industry Prices, Labor Force and PPP For Global analyses, we complement our firm-level
dataset with three additional sources: first, we use industry-level national accounts to obtain industry-level
deflators and measure global industry-level labor productivity. Industry-level deflators are used to compute
firm-level labor productivity in Compustat. Global industry-level labor productivity is used as a benchmark
for reallocation calculations. Industry-level data is gathered primarily from OECD STAN (which covers 37
countries including nearly all advanced economies), plus the BEA's GDP by industry accounts for the US;




                                                      3
and the KLEMS accounts of China and India given their importance. In order to use consistent industry seg-
ments, all data are mapped to 24 sectors which largely match those of EU KLEMS plus an `Other' category
for NAICS code 999.1 When necessary, we fill-in missing values by applying the weighted average change
at the global-industry level to the country-industry quantities. Finally, we gather measures of Global GDP
and Global Labor Force from the World Bank's development indicators; and country-level PPP measures
from the OECD.


1.2 Definitions
Stars     Defining star firms requires two choices: the choice of a cutoff to define the stars, and the choice
of a metric along which to rank the firms. For the cutoff we use a global/US rank, and a rank by global/US
industry. For the metric, we consider revenues and market-values. Both are unambiguously well defined.
Market values more closely resemble the discussion of super-star firms and, since stock prices incorporate
investor's growth projections, more quickly incorporate the fast-growing firms of the new economy. In 2016,
for example, the Top 20 by market value of equity includes the complete GAFAM but the Top 20 by sales
includes only Apple and Amazon. By contrast, sales over-weights manufacturing firms and discounts tech
firms which are at the core of the discussion.
    Nonetheless, we focus on revenue-based stars in the body of the paper for comparison with the literature
(mainly Autor et al. (2020)) and between Compustat and Census Concentration accounts. We report key
results using market value-stars in the appendix.2 In particular, we consider the following groups:

    · Global stars

           ­ Top 100 firms by global sales in any given year (Top 100).
                  These are economy-wide global stars, and include most of the household names. The indus-
                  try composition varies somewhat over time. The stars in the 1990s include a large number
                    of manufacturing and retail firms (GE, Walmart, Toyota), which are often replaced by new
                    economy firms starting in 2000 (Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook). The largest
                    firms are heavily weighted towards the US until recent years, when Chinese firms such as
                    Tencent and Ali Baba reach the Top 20 firms.
           ­ Top 500 firms by global sales in any given year (Top 500).
                  These incorporate additional stars. We include it for reference since it is used by Autor et al.
                    (2020).
           ­ Top 20 firms by global sales within each industry (Top 20 by Industry).
                  These are industry stars. Since we have 25 industries, there are 500 such industry stars each
                    year. The main advantage of this sample is that, by construction, the industry composition
                    is constant. These industry stars include virtually all economy-wide stars.
    1
      We keep this industry because several super-stars, including General Electric and Berkshire Hathaway, are assigned this
NAICS code. We use the weighted average productivity across all other industries as the benchmark for reallocation.
    2
      By incorporating the period of fast-growth, using market values tends to increase the reallocation contribution of the stars but
depress their economic footprint.


                                                                  4
   · US Stars

            ­ Top 20 firms by global sales in any given year (Top 20).
                   These are economy-wide stars. The industry composition varies significantly over time.
                     The stars of the 1950s were often manufacturing firms (GM, GE). IBM appears in the
                     1960s. Microsoft and Walmart appear in the 1990s. And of course Google, Amazon and
                     Facebook in recent years.
            ­ Top 100 firms by global sales in any given year (Top 100).
                   These are larger economy-wide stars. The industry composition again varies over time.
            ­ Top 4 firms by global sales within each 3-digit industry (Top 4 by Industry).
                   These are industry stars. Since we have 62 industries, there are 248 such industry stars
                     each year. By construction, the industry composition by number of firms is constant. These
                     industry stars include most of the economy-wide stars unless a national star happens to be
                     the fifth in an industry. This actually happens early in the sample, especially when including
                     Oil.

Productivity        We define labor productivity of firm i in industry j in year t as

                                                                salesi,t
                                                       zi,t 
                                                               pj,tqj,tni,t

where ni,t is the number of employees, pj,t is an industry price deflator, and qj,t is a labor quality adjustment
based on relative wages. We use this gross output measure as opposed to a value added measure for two
main reasons. The first is that we can easily map this measure into census data. Sales is the only measure
available in the Census for non-manufacturing industries. The second reason is that imputing value added
using Compustat creates a lot of measurement errors because wages are badly measured. We perform a
full robustness analysis using a common wage for the industry from the BEA and adjusting it to match the
industry's value added to gross output ratios.
    To perform the labor quality adjustment we obtain the average wage of employees in the top 4 firms in
each industry from the census and we define q as the ratio to the average wage in the industry. We select the
reported NAICS industries that most closely match those in GDP by Industry accounts. We compute wages
as the ratio of `Annual Payroll' to `Paid employees for pay period including March 12', and then compute
the relative wage of the top-4 firms in each industry as the ratio of wages in the top 4 relative to wages in
their industry.3 The adjustment (q ) is then given by changes in relative wages, normalizing the value to 1 in
1997. Industries not covered in the Census Concentration accounts are assigned the weighted average wage
adjustment across industries. When we compute relative productivity, we use a common industry deflator
as a benchmark and a PPP adjustment in our robustness checks for our global firms. For US firms we use
BEA sector average productivity as benchmark.

   3
       We could use Q1 payroll, but it overstates the differences because most bonus payments are included in Q1.


                                                                 5
2 Are Top Firms Becoming Larger?
We compare the size of top firms to the size of the economy where they operate. Most papers compare
consolidated global sales to domestic GDP, but most large firms earn substantial revenues outside their
domestic markets. Thus, even if their relative efficiency does not improve, a increase in globalization would
increase their size relative to their home country. Instead, one should either compare domestic sales to
domestic GDP (Panel A of 1) or consolidated global sales to global GDP (Panel B of 1). We find that top
firms have not grown faster than the Global economy in the past 20 years. Their domestic share of domestic
GDP has been roughly constant over the past 40 years. The global footprint of top firms has slightly declined
since 2000.
    Let us start with domestic (US) stars, in Panel A of Figure 1. We define the Domar weight i,t of firm i
at time t based on domestic sales:
                                                  (1 - ei,t ) salesi,t
                                           i,t                         ,
                                                       GDPt
where ei,t is the share of foreign sales in total sales, or equivalently (1 - ei,t ) salesi,t are domestic sales.
The left graph uses Gross Output as a denominator, the right graph uses GDP. The results are similar. The
circles and triangles show that consolidated sales have increased relative to GDP as a consequence of global
trade. If we consider the domestic sales of star firms, the shares are flat post 1990 and the peak is in fact
in the late 1970s. We have two ways to compute domestic sales: `Dom 1' uses BEA MNE accounts, and
`Dom 2' uses firm-level segments. They give essentially the same trends. The data shows that the reason
leading firms appear larger today than in the past is because of their foreign revenues. In terms of domestic
revenues, today's stars are exactly the same as the stars of the past 40 years. To give a concrete example,
consider AT&T and Apple. In 1987, AT&T's sales were 1.05% of US GDP and almost entirely domestic. In
2017, Apple's sales were 1.18% of US GDP but more than half were foreign sales. Apple's domestic sales
were 0.5% of US GDP.
   Panel B of Figure 1 looks at Global Stars. We compute consolidated global sales relative to World
Gross Output and GDP. We see a rise in the late 1990s, but since 2000 the footprint of global stars has been
constant or slightly declining. This is consistent with our results in Panel A and simply shows that global
firms grow at the same rate as global GDP, but not faster.
Fact 1. The market share of dominant firms has not increased.
    Fact 1 is important because it appears to be inconsistent with theories that argue that today's stars have
relatively higher productivity advantages than the stars of the past. In standard models an increase in the
relative productivity of the top firms leads to increase in their relative size measured by sales. Relative
productivity differences could of course be present lower in the distribution of firms and in specific sectors
of the economy. But Fact 1 says that size is not a defining feature of today's top firms.


3 Are Top Firms Pulling Away?
Some theories of the recent dynamics of leading firms emphasize a decrease in the diffusion of knowledge.
Andrews et al. (2015) and Akcigit and Ates (2019a) argue that falling diffusion has allowed leading firms to

                                                       6
pull away from the rest. In the model of Akcigit and Ates (2019a), the prediction is about the market value
of the leading firm relative to that of its direct follower. In the data, we find that the value of the leading firm
compared to the value of its direct industry followers has not increased since 2000.
    Panel A of Figure 2 looks at US stars. The first plot uses the market value of equity. Across all industries
the top firm is roughly 75% more valuable that its direct follower and there is no upward trend. The red circle
line expands the comparison group to the top 5 firms. On average, the top firm is 1.5 times more valuable
than the average of its top 4 followers. Once again, we do not see an upward trend. The right plot shows
relative sales. There is no overall trend but we do see a decline in the 1990s followed by a recovery, which
is consistent with the view of the 1990s as a period of fast entry and growth by relatively young companies.
    Panel B considers global stars and reaches similar conclusions. Consider for instance the top 10 global
firms of a particular industry. The average revenues of a top-3 firm are double those of a top 4-10 firm, and
its market value is about three times higher. These are large differences indeed, but they have not increased
in recent years.

Fact 2. The value gap between leaders and followers has not increased.


4 Are Top Firms Becoming More Productive?
Panel A of figure 3 shows the relative productivity of top US firms. The left graph compares their productiv-
ity to BEA average productivity in their respective industries. We observe an increasing trend in the 1970s
and 1980s. After 1995, however, relative productivity remains roughly constant. The right graph compares
star firms to other firms in Compustat. This comparison is thus within a group of large firms. As expected,
the productivity gap is smaller, around 10% instead of 40%, but the trends are similar. In particular, star
firms' relative productivity has not increased since 1995.
    Panel B figure 3 considers global stars, starting in 1990. The productivity gap on the left figure is larger
than in Panel A, reflecting higher overall dispersion of productivity outside the US, a fact which is consistent
with Hsieh and Klenow (2009). The global trends, on the other hand, are similar to the trends in the US. In
particular the relative productivity of the global stars has declined since 2000. This basic fact is inconsistent
with models that assume that star firms enjoy a growing productivity advantage.

Fact 3. The relative productivity of dominant firms has not increased over the past 20 years.

    This fact is important because the super-star literature is motivated by the examples of Google, Facebook
and Amazon. Amazon was founded in 1994, Google in 1998, and Facebook in 2004. Since these years, the
stars have become neither larger nor more productive than the rest of the economy.
    Figure 6 in the appendix breaks down the relative productivity by sectors: manufacturing, non manu-
facturing, ICT-intensive and non-ICT-intensive. The trends are broadly similar to the ones in Figure 3 but
Figure 6 brings some new insights. The first insight is that the results are the same if we use Census data
instead of Compustat. The second insight is that ICT intensive industries lag other industries. We find that
non-ICT top firms doubled their relative productivity advantage in the 1970s from 19% to 38%. ICT stars



                                                         7
experienced the same increase later, between 1985 and 2000. Since 2000, however, relative productivities
have been either flat or declining.
    In the Appendix we obtain similar facts using the US Economic Census. We compute the weighted
average relative wage, labor productivity and wage-adjusted labor productivity of the Top 4 firms by industry,
and report results by level of industry granularity. The Census data confirms the fact that star firms have not
become relatively more productive over the past 20 years. In fact, quality-adjusted relative labor productivity
has been slightly declining between 2002 and 2012: the Top 4 firms by NAICS 6 were 1.11 times more
productive in 1997 and only 1.09 times in 2012. This reflects the fact that unadjusted productivity has been
roughly flat together with the fact that top firms have been increasingly hiring top workers. It is consistent
with the literature on increased assortative matching (Song et al., 2018).


5 Contribution to Productivity Growth
5.1 Hulten
The classic Theorem of Hulten (1978) ­ recently extended by Baqaee and Farhi (2018) ­ shows that the
contribution of an individual firm to aggregate productivity growth equals its own productivity times its
Domar weight. The Hulten contribution is defined as the Domar weight times the firm level increase in
log sales per employee. It is a "within" contribution since it uses the initial Domar weight times future
productivity growth:4
                                                       h                z
                                                      gt            i,tgi,t ,
                                                              iSt

where St denotes the set of star firms, as defined earlier. Our baseline specification uses sales to compute
the Domar weight i,t as defined earlier, and costs as a robustness check. Productivity growth is averaged
over 3 years:
                      z
                     gi,t   log zi,t +  log zi,t+1 +  log zi,t+2 = log zi,t+2 - log zi,t-1 ,

where zi,t is quality adjusted labor productivity defined earlier. This adjustment makes only a small differ-
ence to the Hulten component, but it is important for the reallocation measure, and we introduce it here to
be consistent.
    Figure 4 shows the Hulten contributions of top firms, in the US since 1960, and globally since 1990.
The figure shows that top firms have played a key role in making the economy grow. Historically, they
have contributed more than half a percent to total labor productivity growth. In recent years, however, their
"within" contribution to overall productivity growth has been close to zero.

Fact 4. The Hulten contribution of dominant firms has decreased from about 50 basis point per year to
approximately zero.

    The result is the same if we use sales or total cost (appropriate under market power) as Domar weights.
One possible explanation is that ideas are becoming harder to find as argued by Bloom et al. (2018).
    4
      Our results hold with or without oil companies, but oil shocks in the 1970s create a lot of noise in reallocation measures so
we choose to exclude oil and gas in our benchmark figures.


                                                                8
5.2 Reallocation and Total Contribution
The Hulten contribution is the main contribution to aggregate growth when revenue factor productivities
are equalized across firms. If top firms have higher revenue productivity than other firms, however, they
can contribute to productivity growth simply by drawing in more resources. We define the reallocation
contribution of top firms as
                                                  r                            n
                                                 gt            (zi,t - z
                                                                       ¯I,t ) gi,t ,
                                                         iSt

      ¯I,t is labor productivity in industry I at time t. The growth of employment is averaged over 3 years:
where z
 n   log n +  log n
gi,t      i,t       i,t+1 +  log ni,t+2 = log ni,t+2 - log ni,t-1 . Recall that zi,t is quality adjusted.
This adjustment is small before 1995 but reaches 30% in the 2000s, as shown in the Appendix, where we
                                    ¯I,t .
also discuss various benchmarks for z
    We can now combine our two measures. Figure 5 shows the total contribution (Hulten plus reallocation)
of top firms to aggregate labor productivity growth in the US and globally. In the US, the reallocation con-
tribution was large in the 1990s. As a result the total contribution of Stars was large, around 1.5 percentage
point per year. This is a truly remarkable result. In the late 1990s, just 100 firms added 1.5% of labor
productivity growth to the US economy.
    Since 2000, the reallocation contribution has declined but, unlike the Hulten contribution, it has re-
mained positive.5 Overall the total contribution of US Stars to US labor productivity is one third of what it
used to be.
    Panel B of Figure 5 shows the contribution of global stars to global labor productivity growth. Once
again, the mid-1990s stand out as a period where large firms contributed enormously to overall growth,
more than one percentage point each year. We observe an increase in the reallocation component in the
1990s, but it is more muted than in the US and it has been closed to zero in recent year. As a result, the total
contribution is not very different from the Hulten contribution and is close to zero since 2005.

Fact 5. The contribution of top firms to aggregate labor productivity has decreased by about 40% since
2000.


6 Conclusion
Our results challenge the common wisdom about dominant firms in the new economy and shed light on the
productivity paradox. The paradox is often framed as a gap between tremendous innovations at large digital
companies and lackluster aggregate productivity growth. Our findings suggest there might not be a paradox
after all: the top firms of today are neither larger, nor more productive than the top firms of the past. In fact,
their contribution to overall growth has declined in recent years, therefore explaining (some of) the paradox
instead of reinforcing it.
    5
      The overall increase in the reallocation contribution comes in part from the growing importance of non-manufacturing sectors.
The average contribution of reallocation is larger outside manufacturing than inside manufacturing. This is consistent with the
evidence in Mansury and Love (2008) who argue that innovation in business services has a positive effect on growth (size) but not
on measured productivity. In other words, in the service sector, the "innovation" might be to reach and convince new clients, as
opposed to reducing the unit cost of existing services.


                                                                 9
   If we are correct, the most important question is to understand what has changed between the 1990s and
the 2000s. During the 1990s large firms made tremendous contributions to overall growth, both internally
(Hulten) and externally (reallocation). In the 2000s these beneficial effects have all but disappeared. Why
are star firms not contributing as much as they used to? We do not have a definite answer but it is clear that
something changed around 2000. Perhaps ideas are becoming harder to find as Bloom et al. (2018) argue.
Or perhaps declining competition and rising barriers to entry have allowed incumbents to cut genuinely
useful investment and innovation as Gutiérrez and Philippon (2019) argue.

Note: Figure reports the relative value of stars vs. near-followers. Each series is constructed as follows: we first compute the
average market value and sale for each group of firms (Top 1 and 2-5 in US, and Top 1-3, 4-10 and 11-20 globally, as noted in the
legends). We then compute the relative-difference between the two groups, and aggregate across industries by taking the median.
The vertical line at 1990 denotes the initial year in our global sample. It is included to facilitate comparisons across datasets.

Note: Figure plots weighted average log-difference in sales per employee between star firms and their corresponding industry.
Top charts focus on the US. Left plot uses the average and labor quality-adjusted sector productivity from the BEA (solid and
dotted, respectively) as benchmarks. Labor quality adjustment based on the divergence in relative wages of the stars and non-
stars, estimated using the census concentration accounts. Right plot uses the weighted average productivity across all Compustat
firms in the given industry as benchmark. Bottom charts use global data. Left plot considers the weighted average global industry
productivity (solid) and the PPP-adjusted global average productivity (dotted), all based on a common global industry deflator.
Right plot uses the weighted average productivity across all Compustat firms located in the US, EU or Japan to account for the
increasing entry of developing economy firms over time.

A    Appendix: Additional Results and Robustness
This appendix presents additional results, including some robustness analyses.
    · Theory and Data

         ­ Table 1 highlights some predictions of existing theories of superstar firms.
         ­ Table 2 shows the coverage of Economic Census statistics over time

    · Relative Productivity

         ­ Compustat-based
              Figure 6 breaks down the relative productivity by sectors: manufacturing, non
                manufacturing, ICT-intensive and non-ICT-intensive. The trends are broadly similar to the
                ones in Figure 3 but Figure 6 brings some new insights. The first insight is that the results
                are the same if we use Census data instead of Compustat (top-left plot, line with squares).
                The second insight is that ICT intensive industries lag other industries. The right graphs of
                Panel A shows that non-ICT stars doubled their relative productivity advantage in the
                1970s from 19% to 38%. ICT stars experienced the same increase later, between 1985 and
                2000. Since 2000, however, relative productivities have been either flat or declining.
              Figures 7, 8 and 9 present robustness analyses for the measurement of relative productiv-
              ity. Figure 7 measures productivity using value added instead of sales. Figure 8 considers
                market value-based stars instead of sales-based stars. Last, figure 9 uses country x indus-
                try deflators instead of a common global industry deflator. As shown, all variations yield
                similar trends in the relative productivity of the stars as sales.
         ­ Census-based
              Figure 10 shows our wage adjustment series, which is based on non-manufacturing indus-
                tries at the Top-4 firms vs. the rest.
              Table 3 shows that using the US Economic Census to measure relative productivity yields
                similar conclusions as Compustat. The table reports the weighted average relative wage,
                relative labor productivity and relative wage-adjusted labor productivity of the Top 4 firms
                by industry. All of these quantities have remained stable.
              Table 4 breaks down the evolution of census-based relative productivity by industry. The
                only industries where top firms appear to have increased their relative productivity
                between 1997 and 2012 are Transportation and Wholesale Trade. The increase in
                Wholesale Trade is consistent with Ganapati (2018).

    · Hulten Contribution

         ­ Figures 11 and 12 present robustness analyses for the Hulten contribution. Figure 7 measures
           productivity using value added instead of sales. Figure 8 considers market value-based stars in-
           stead of sales-based stars. As shown, all variations yield similar trends in the Hulten contribution
           of the stars.

                                                         17
  · Reallocation Contribution

       ­ Figure 13 shows the impact of using alternate benchmarks when estimating the reallocation
         contribution of the stars.
       ­ Figure 14 presents a series of robustness on the reallocation contribution of US stars. The first
         plot shows the outside impact of the oil shocks on reallocation. The second plot considers
         backward-looking reallocation contributions (i.e., when the contribution of a star today is based
         on it's growth the past three years instead of the next two years. The third plot considers value
         added ­ instead of revenue ­ productivity. The last plot considers market value instead of sales
         stars. The conclusions remain largely stable across variations.
       ­ Figure 15 presents the same robustness analyses as figure 14, for Global stars instead of US
         stars.

  · Total Contribution

       ­ Figure 16 contrast the total contribution of the stars against the economy-wide productivity
         growth as measured by Fernald (2014).
       ­ Figure 17 contrasts the Compustat-based contribution of the stars to an analogous census-based
         estimate for non-manufacturing industries.
       ­ Figure 18 presents a series of robustness on the total contribution of stars to using value added
         productivity instead of revenue productivity as well as alternate deflators for the Global calcula-
         tion.
       ­ Figure 19 presents robustness on the total contribution of stars when using market value instead
         of sales-based stars.

Note: Figure shows the relative productivity of stars by sector/ICT-intensity. Relative productivity defined as the employment-
weighted average log-difference in productivity between the stars and their industry/sector. See figure 3 for details on the construc-
tion. Top plots focus on the US and use the average BEA sector (left) and Compustat (right) productivity as benchmarks. Top-left
plot includes the weighted average relative productivity as measured in the Economic Census, using SIC-4 industries up to 1992 and
NAICS after 1997, normalized to match the Compustat series in the initial period. Bottom plots are global. Left plot uses the global
industry average as benchmark. Right plot uses the average among Compustat firms in the US, EU and Japan. ICT manufacturing
industries include `Electrical, electronic and optical equipment', `Machinery and equipment n.e.c.' and `Transport equipment' (26
to 30). ICT non-manufacturing industries include Transportation and storage, Publishing, audiovisual and broadcasting activities,
Telecommunications, IT and other information services (49 to 53, 58 to 63). For global analyses, we also include Professional,
scientific and technical activities; administrative and support service activities (69T82) as ICT given the use of a combined industry
to match the KLEMS data of China and India to the more recent vintages of STAN.

A.2.2 Census-based

Given the potential measurement issues associated with the use of Compustat data (e.g., firms operate across
narrowly defined industries, in many geographies, etc.), we replicate our main results for non-manufacturing
industries using the U.S. Economic Census concentration accounts. The Census' concentration accounts are
based on establishment-level data as reported to the Economic Census. They cover the entire population
of firms and classify economic activity to NAICS codes at the establishment-level, so that multi-industry
firms are properly allocated across industries. For non-manufacturing industries, these accounts report the
value of shipments, payroll and employment for the largest 4, 8, 20 and 50 firms within each narrowly
defined industry, which we use to compute the labor productivity and labor shares of the stars relative to
their narrowly defined industry.
    Data are reported following the 1987 SIC system in both 1987 and 1992, though there are small adjust-
ments across years. Data after 1997 is based on NAICS, with each of the 1997, 2002, 2007 and 2012 reports
using slightly different NAICS vintages. Data for service industries are reported by tax-paying segments.
We keep tax-payable firms because they are reported consistently over time and are closest to our analy-
sis. Data for wholesale trade are reported as a total and by type of merchant (e.g., merchant wholesaler,
manufacturer). We keep only the total.
    The industries covered increase over time, as summarized in Table 2 in the appendix. From 1987 to
1992, this includes all Service industries, Retail and Wholesale Trade as well as partial coverage of Trans-
portation and Communication industries. Together these accounted for 40% of GDP over the period. From
1997 onwards, coverage of Transportation and Communication industries is complete, and Utilities enter the
sample ­ so that the complete sample accounts for over 65% of GDP and 75% of the output of private indus-
tries. The main excluded sectors are agriculture (1.2%), mining (2.5%), construction (3.6%), manufacturing
(12%) and government output (14%).
    Table 3 reports the simplest results. We compute the weighted average relative wage, labor productivity


                                                             23

and wage-adjusted labor productivity of the Top 4 firms by industry, and report results by level of industry
granularity. The Table confirms the fact that star firms have not become relatively more productive over the
past 20 years. In fact, quality-adjusted relative labor productivity has been slightly declining between 2002
and 2012: the Top 4 firms by NAICS 6 were 1.11 times more productive in 1997 and only 1.09 times in
2012. This reflects the fact that unadjusted productivity has been roughly flat together with the fact that top
firms have been increasingly hiring top workers. It is consistent with the literature on increased assortative
matching. For instance, Song et al. (2018) find that high-wage workers have become more likely to work in
high- wage firms and with other high wage workers.
