                                         ABSTRACT

The paper discusses policy relevant models, going from (1) chronic inflation in the 20th century
after WWII, to (2) credit sudden stop episodes that got exacerbated in Developed Market
economies after the 2008 Lehman crisis, and appear to be associated with chronic deflation. The
discussion highlights the importance of expectations and liquidity, and warns about the risks of
relegating liquidity to a secondary role, as has been the practice in mainstream macro models
prior to the Great Recession.

                                 I.      Introduction

The organizers of this conference have asked me to distill in a few pages my
experience with macroeconomics, focusing on issues that are relevant for
policymaking. After several false starts, I concluded that I could better serve the
objective if I identified a few theoretical topics that helped in the discussion of
critical policy issues during the period covered. Rational Expectations (RE) stands
up, given its role in the flourishing of macroeconomics since the 1970s. Whether or
not one endorses its relevance for positive theory, RE has proven to be immensely
useful to sort out analytical issues and offer useful insights on applications. Like the
Modigliani-Miller theorem or Ricardian equivalence, the RE insights provide
benchmarks that shed light even on cases in which RE do not hold.

Macroeconomics is a very rich and varied field. To keep the paper within
reasonable bounds I confined the discussion to two grand themes, namely, Chronic
Inflation and Chronic Deflation, and associated issues. Chronic inflation took center
stage in Developed Market economies (DMs) in the 1970s (a period called the Great
Inflation), and in Emerging Market economies (EMs) during much of the 20th
century after WWII. The Great Inflation has been subject to a good number of
studies (for a recent discussion, see Bordo and Orphanides (2013) and McKinnon
(2013)). Therefore I will focus on EM episodes. Simple rules for stopping inflation,
inspired by available theory, failed to work and, in several instances, gave rise to
serious distortions and costly crises. On the other hand, chronic deflation is
galvanizing world attention since the dramatic financial crisis episodes in EMs and,
more recently, the ongoing Great Recession that started in 2007.

Research on EM chronic Inflation focused mostly on local or domestic factors and, as
a general rule, assumed that DMs were stable and provided the services of deep
capital markets. This view started to be challenged by the rise of EM financial crises
in which external factors have a significant, if not necessarily dominant, role, e.g., the
Debt crisis in the 1980s – partly triggered by Volcker's stabilization program – and
Mexico 'Tequila' crisis in 1994/5, which followed on the heels of a more modest but
still important rise in US interest rates. These crises involved a host of financial
factors, but the conventional wisdom tended to attribute them to EM weak domestic
institutions and domestic policy mistakes. Global capital markets might have played
a role, but they were not seen as the main culprit. This view proved harder to
defend after the Asia/Russia crises in 1997/8, because some of epicenter economies
had followed the Washington Consensus. At any rate, the succession of these crises
gave a strong impetus to research that pointed sharply in a different direction. For
example, towards Sudden Stop, i.e., severe supply-driven crunch in international
capital flows, a phenomenon alien to well-oiled financial markets, for example.
Moreover, given that the above crises involved several economies outside the crisis
epicenter, research focused on systemic Sudden Stop. This set off a search for factors
that may turn a regular contraction in international capital flows into systemic
Sudden Stop (e.g., Calvo (1998), Calvo, Izquierdo and Mejía (2016), Cavallo and
Frenkel (2008)).


                                                                                        1
These crises raised the suspicion that the explanation went beyond standard
"fundamentals" and that liquidity phenomena were at work. "Liquidity" is a
slippery word. For my purposes here, it will suffice to define Liquidity services as
the services provided by assets or, more generally, arrangements that may facilitate
market transactions. Assets that provide those services will be called liquid assets.
This does not imply that they are mostly employed as means of exchange. Liquid
assets could be easily transformed into means of exchange but could be held as
store of value or employed as credit collateral, for example. It is important to notice,
though, that liquidity services depend on implicit compacts in which the equilibrium
value of, say, a liquid asset is a function of the compacts themselves. Therefore,
Liquidity is inherently illusory. Its value can collapse on the spur of the moment,
giving rise to what is usually called Liquidity Crunch. Moreover, the latter can occur
in absence of real shocks. To be true, real and liquidity shocks are seldom
independent of each other. The main point, though, is that liquidity shocks can be
rationalized without appealing to other kinds of shocks, e.g., TFP shocks. In fact, as
argued below, liquidity shocks can give rise to Sudden Stops, and issues associated
with Liquidity Trap and Price Deflation.

In a nutshell, the paper will be divided in two parts, the motivation of which will
become self-evident as we proceed. Expectations, spiced up with chronic inflation
issues, will be the theme of the first part of the paper; while Liquidity, spiced up
with recent capital market episodes, will be the theme of the second part. Context
and more details follow.

                       II.    Setting the Stage and Overview

Most people would likely agree that Keynes's (1936) General Theory (GT) played a
pivotal role in establishing macroeconomics as a field different from, but not
incompatible with, microeconomics. The GT was born during the Great Depression
and was greatly influenced by issues that have become once again relevant during
the Great Recession, e.g., Liquidity Trap. The GT downplayed the relevance of
monetary policy for the recovery phase, and gave rise to the view that "money does
not matter." The appeal of this view, however, started to fade in the wake of WWII
when inflation spiked, the world economy recovered from the initial slump and
started to grow at relatively high rates, despite the large contraction of public
expenditure after the war. As a result, Liquidity Trap became a bogeyman of the
past, and the view that "money matters" came back with renewed vigor. Friedman
and Schwartz (1963), for instance, argues that the Fed caused the Great Depression
by ignoring the harmful effects of price collapse and failing to adopt a more
aggressive easy-money stance. The relevance of monetary policy got further
support from the 1970s Great Inflation episode in DMs (see Bordo and Orphanides
(2013), McKinnon (2013)), and Chronic Inflation in EMs (see Calvo and Végh
(1995)).




                                                                                       2
First attempts to accommodate inflation in a Keynesian context involved sticking a
Phillips curve (an empirical regularity that suggests a tradeoff between inflation and
unemployment) in Hicks (1937) IS/LM model, subject to little microeconomic
backing (or microfoundations). This gave rise to a highly fruitful literature around
the question of whether the tradeoff could be used to lowering unemployment by
raising the rate of inflation. This literature is very well known and needs not be
discussed in great detail here (see Gordon (2011)). However, I think it is worth
pointing out that the Phillips curve literature brought "expectations" to center stage
and helped to establish the view that in the long run inflation is ineffective for
lowering unemployment, and could even make it worse (see Phelps (1972) and
(Friedman (1977)). This view got further support from the Rational Expectations
(RE) literature, in which context it can be shown that inflation ineffectiveness could
also hold in the short run (Lucas (1972)) and, more fundamentally, that empirical
regularities like the Phillips curve could be misleading for policymaking (Lucas
(1976), Sargent and Wallace (1981)).

Moreover, the RE literature illustrated the possibility that frank and well-
intentioned policymakers could throw the economy into a destructive black hole,
given that in a RE context policymaking is subject to a serious birth defect: Time
Inconsistency. Time Inconsistency arises when policymakers renege from earlier
policy announcements or commitments. It is a birth defect because policymakers
have incentives to engage in time inconsistency, even though cheating is not in their
DNAs, their foremost objective is to maximize social welfare and, not a minor detail,
RE imply that individuals cannot be easily fooled (see Kydland and Prescott (1977),
Calvo (1978)). The time inconsistency literature offers support for the adoption of
rules rather than discretion; and central bank independence is a natural corollary.
All of these insights are in the toolkit of modern macroeconomists, and several have
already been incorporated in governments' macroeconomic models around the
globe.

The RE approach allows analyzing policy credibility issues in isolation from other
perhaps important but disparate issues like the public’s imperfect information
about the relevant model. RE does not answer all relevant questions concerning
policy credibility but signifies a major step forward compared to the case in which
expectations are assumed to be backward looking, e.g., adaptive expectations. I will
illustrate this by discussing some key policy roadblocks faced by EMs subject to
chronic inflation problems in Section III.

As pointed out in the Introduction, since the mid 1990s the world economy has been
buffeted by crises in which the role of financial dysfunction became increasingly
evident. Moreover, these crises are severe and bear an eerie resemblance to the
Great Depression. Expressions like Liquidity Trap or Price Deflation, popular in the
1930s, have become part of the daily lingo. This prompted the profession to look
back to the 1930s and to brush up on the rich menu of new financial instruments
that were created since the 1990s (see Eichengreen (2015), Ohanian (2016)). Prior
to that, a macroeconomist could get her paper published in a top-ranked journal by


                                                                                    3
assuming, say, that debt contracts took the form of state-contingent bonds, free from
default risks. Moreover, she would not have faced major referee’s objections if the
paper assumed that liquidity was confined to an object called money, which did not
interfere in a major way with the workings of the capital market. Issues in which
unplanned over-indebtedness and default are the order of the day could not be
accommodated in that type of model – and the long time to recovery that we are
currently experiencing, accompanied by unrelenting deflationary forces, particularly
in the Eurozone and Japan, even less so. This is very troubling and policymakers are
clamoring for a rapid analytical response.

What to do? Compared to the tame "reality" prior to the Great Recession, the new
reality looks extremely complex. It is, thus, easy to fall in the temptation of
increasing models' complexity. This could be a serious mistake. Taking that route
might make macroeconomics look like a feather in the wind – which is driven by the
flow but it is unable to change the direction of the wind. For macroeconomic policy
to have a chance to make a difference, theory has to identify a few key factors that
could have major impact on the direction of the wind. As mentioned in the
Introduction, I think Liquidity is one of them, and I will argue that one can get useful
insight tidbits ('intuition pumps,' as Krugman (2011) calls them) by setting Liquidity
at the center of the macro universe. This will be fleshed out in Section IV.

Much of the literature that I refer to is available in print (especially that in Section
III) and, therefore, I thought that it would be more useful if I focused on the flow of
ideas and leave out technicalities, unless they are necessary to clarify the argument.
I should note, incidentally, that I will confine the discussion to narrow economic
models, and will have to apologize for not covering attendant and highly relevant
political economy issues.




                                                                                       4
              III.    Chronic Inflation: Theory and Practice in EMs

Chronic inflation – i.e., high inflation and/or stop-and-go high inflation episodes that
occur over an extended period of time – has been the nemesis of several large EMs
during the 20th century (see, e.g., Dornbusch and Simonsen (1983), Bruno et al
(1988), Bruno et al (1991)). Many stabilization programs employed the exchange
rate as a nominal anchor. This was prompted by the existence of shallow domestic
capital markets that made interest rates ineffective monetary policy instruments,
and the growing evidence that monetary aggregates have a weak and volatile link
with inflation – especially when inflation rates are high. In the 1970s, exchange-
rate-based stabilization programs were expected to produce quick results. This
view was based on the belief that purchasing-power parity will bite and force
domestic prices to grow at about the same rate as international prices, plus the rate
of devaluation. In general, this was not to happen. Domestic prices continued
unabated and caused unwanted (and, I must say, unexpected for many well-trained
economists) major real currency appreciation. Moreover, many of these programs
started with a consumption boom that increased fiscal revenue and gave the
impression that fiscal imbalance – a common feature in high inflation economies –
was going away without additional sacrifice. These optimistic expectations were
hard to change because, of course, policymakers (and international financial
institutions, especially those that endorsed these stabilization and reform
programs) became enthusiastic cheerleaders. Besides, as I will argue below, some
of the popular monetary models until 1970s were unsuitable for discussing some
critical issues like imperfect policy credibility.

III.1. Imperfect Credibility and Excessive Inflation. To motivate this section, I
will start by referring to a provocative paper by Milton Friedman (1971) that,
abstracting from credibility issues, concludes that inflation in several seigniorage-
dependent economies was excessive, in the sense that a lower rate of inflation
would collect higher seigniorage. This looks puzzling. However, the puzzle is a
result of focusing on a restricted set of policy options. Friedman (1971) focuses on
permanent or steady state inflation paths and, thus, rules out inflation spikes. If the
public is taken by surprise, for example, it can easily be shown that inflation spikes
could be effective in further increasing revenue from inflation.

To illustrate, consider a standard model in which the demand for money is a
decreasing function of the expected rate of inflation. Suppose inflation is set to
maximize seigniorage à la Friedman (1971), and consider an unexpected once-and-
for-all spike in the rate of inflation, coupled with a credible policy announcement
that future inflation will remain unchanged. The inflation spike lowers the stock of
real money but it does not affect the demand for money, because expected inflation
would stay the same. Thus, the public will be willing to spend extra resources to
restore the steady-state demand for money, which results in seigniorage higher than
what would be attained if authorities stuck to Friedman's seigniorage-maximizing
inflation rate.



                                                                                      5
Repeated use of surprise inflation is unlikely to be successful in increasing
seigniorage, because the public will start to expect a rate of inflation larger than the
one that optimizes steady-state revenue from inflation. Thus, eventually the
economy may land on the excessive-inflation territory highlighted in Friedman
(1971). However, this is not due to an elementary economics error on the side of
the central bank, as Friedman's results might lead us to conclude. An inflation spike
is, in the short run, one of the cheapest and most expeditious manners for securing
additional fiscal revenue. Moreover, this "carrot" is always there. As noted, though,
a problem arises if the government repeatedly reaches out for the carrot. But, even
in this case, the evidence presented in Friedman (1971) does not prove that
authorities were making an error. To assess that, one needs information of how
quickly the public catches up with the inflation-spike strategy.

The central lesson from the above example is that there are harmful incentives that
lead policymakers to implement inflation levels that they may eventually come to
regret. These incentives are no rarity; they are very common in economies that do
not have the instruments to reach a first-best equilibrium. Moreover, these
incentives cannot be ruled out even under Rational Expectations. This is shown in
the Time Inconsistency literature (see, e.g., Kydland and Prescott (1977), Calvo
(1978)). However, there is room for policy. In the above example one could try to
neutralize these harmful incentives if the central bank is banned from extending
loans to the fiscal authority. 1

Inflation surprise is effective for liquidating the real value of financial assets other
than high-powered money. Important examples are public debt obligations
denominated in nominal terms (e.g., principal or coupon not indexed to the price
level). Thus, in designing public debt instruments policymakers should take these
seigniorage incentives into account, especially if the fiscal authority is constrained
to small fiscal room. Calvo and Guidotti (1990) address these issues and discuss
public debt configurations in terms of maturity and indexation. Price indexation, for
example, would remove incentives for surprise inflation but, on the other hand, may
make public debt service too rigid in the face of real shocks (more on this in
Subsection III.3). Moreover, short-maturity nominal debt may also remove
incentives for surprise inflation if fiscal cost grows exponentially with the rate of
inflation (e.g., making the cost of a price-change surprise much higher if it takes




1 However, this is not a foolproof solution to the excessive-inflation problem. See
Calvo (1986 a) for a discussion of an episode in which the central bank of Argentina
was banned from lending to the treasury and, hence, private banks took that role.
When the treasury went bankrupt, though, the central bank bailed out private
banks, which was equivalent to taking a long and tortuous route to lending to the
treasury.


                                                                                       6
place, say, in a day than in a month). But, on the other hand, the government gives
up the resilience provided by long-term debt. 2

Remark 1. An Embarrassing Error and a Warning. These insights were not
common knowledge at the time of Friedman (1971), partly because the profession
did not have the instruments for modeling forward-looking expectations. At the
time, Adaptive Expectations, a backward-looking scheme, was in vogue. It was
employed to model inflation expectations. Thus, inflation expectations at time t
were assumed to be a function of the path of inflation prior to t, weighted by a factor
that declined geometrically with the distance between time t and the time of the
inflation realization. The rate of decline was determined by a parameter that I will
denote by 𝛾 > 0, such that the larger is 𝛾, the steeper the decline of the weighting
factor. Cagan (1956) showed, in the context of a simple monetary model, that there
is a critical 𝛾 = 𝛾̅ , such that if 𝛾 > 𝛾̅ , the system becomes unstable. This implies, for
example, that if the economy starts off steady state, it is possible for the model to
generate hyperinflation even though money supply is constant over time! This
counterfactual implication led to the conclusion that the RE approach was
incompatible with realistic monetary models, because RE were identified with the
case in which 𝛾 → ∞. This is, of course, wrong because no matter how large is the
weight given to very recent observations, it does not make adaptive expectations
rational: they are doomed to be backward looking! It is interesting to note, though,
that it took around fifteen years and the RE revolution to get rid of this error (see
Sargent and Wallace (1972)). 3 This episode should send a warning to the
profession because it shows, in an emphatic manner, that formal models can be
dangerously misleading if they are not disciplined by a good dosage of common
sense. ∎

III.2. Inflation Stabilization and Incredible Reforms. In the 1980s several EM
exchange-rated-base stabilization programs failed to achieve their objectives (see
Kiguel and Liviatan (1994) and Little et al (1993)). An unwanted side effect was a
large real currency appreciation accompanied by consumption boom and large
current account deficits. This took policymakers – and the profession at large – by
surprise, because according to the, then, prevalent conventional wisdom – much
based on DM experience – inflation stabilization is associated with a slump in
economic activity. The opposite happened. Disconnect between conventional
wisdom and practice was dramatic and, as it happens in these occasions, brought to
the surface a myriad of lightweight and even opportunistic comments. Neoclassical
theory and "monetarism" were easy targets, but an answer from the beleaguered


2These ideas were developed at the International Monetary Fund, and helped to
make debt indexation and maturity part of IMF program design. See Guidotti and
Kumar (1991) and Calvo (1991).

3This does not invalidate the relevance of Adaptive Expectations. In fact, they can
be useful complements to Rational Expectations, see Sargent (1999).


                                                                                         7
camp did not take long to come. It relied on the assumption that these stabilization
programs were likely imperfectly credible. The analysis is very simple thanks to the
RE revolution. Calvo (1986 b) shows, for example, that if the public expects that the
stabilization program will eventually be abandoned and high inflation stages a
comeback, it might be rational for the public to anticipate consumption, which
obviously enlarges the current account deficit and, under normal circumstances,
lowers the real exchange rate (i.e., the relative price of tradable with respect to
nontradable goods). The model assumes that the total cost of consumption includes
the purchase price plus the cost of holding money in advance to carry out the
transaction (i.e., Clower (1967)). The latter is an increasing function of the nominal
interest rate, which rises with expected inflation, and makes the total cost of
consumption is expected to be higher after the program is abandoned.
Intertemporal substitution trivially follows and gives a rationale for the
consumption boom. For a recent version of the model, which can accommodate the
usually sizable consumption booms, see Buffie and Atolia (2012). 4 The argument
would also go through if inflation increased the cost of credit as a result of high price
volatility, for example. 5

This model can also be employed to study the impact of temporary trade
liberalization (see Papageorgiou et al (1991)). Consider the case in which the
government announces that trade tariffs will be permanently eliminated, but the
public believes that they will eventually be reestablished. As in the monetary
example, this amounts, in the mind of the private sector, to making tradable goods
cheaper "today" relative to "tomorrow." Calvo (1986 b)), for example, shows that
this brings about a current account deficit that would not take place if the
government's announcement was fully credible. Moreover, the implied
intertemporal substitution is Pareto inefficient, because it is based on an
intertemporal distortion. Even if the government does not intend to abandon trade
liberalization, lack of credibility brings about the same deleterious effects. The
government could disappoint expectations by never reestablishing trade barriers,
but that will not undo the damage! This is, thus, a glaring example of the power of
credibility for the success or failure of economic reform, a phenomenon that I coined
in the (tongue-in-cheek) phrase "Incredible Reforms" (see Calvo (1989 c)).

An implication of these models that policymakers should take into account is that
lack of credibility could give rise to short-run effects that might give the impression
that policies are highly successful. For example, the consumption boom that follows

4 Calvo and Drazen (1998) extend the basic model to account for uncertainty about
the duration of policy announcements.
5 Sargent (1981) is closely linked to this literature. It makes a strong case for

credible stabilization programs. However, the paper focuses on short-lived
astronomic inflation episodes that could hardly be called "chronic." Moreover, it
seems unlikely that individuals believe in the sustainability of hyperinflation, which
would tend to enhance the credibility of any reasonable stabilization program and,
thus, its effectiveness.


                                                                                       8
the announcement of an exchange-rate-based stabilization program brings about an
increase in the demand for money, which gives rise to larger international reserves.
If the program is prompted by high inflation, these developments are likely to be
interpreted as stemming from greater trust that those in charge are serious and able
to carry out the necessary reforms.

It is worth noting that the deleterious effects of lack of credibility highlighted here
depend on the existence of intertemporal trade, e.g., credit. Without this channel,
the economy would not benefit from intertemporal trade geared to the
fundamentals stressed by conventional trade theory, but, on the other hand, the
economy would be free from credibility distortions. Thus, these types of models are
especially relevant for EMs that have access to financial markets but have not
succeeded in developing resilient market-friendly institutions. Depending on the
circumstances, the model may justify imposing controls on capital mobility, for
instance. But a major contribution of this literature is to highlight the relevance of
expectations' management and, above all, ensuring policy credibility. 6

III. 3. Expectations Dominance. Chronic inflation is typically associated with
Fiscal Dominance, i.e., a situation in which the central bank loses control on money
supply because it is forced to finance the fiscal deficit by issuing domestic money (as
in Section III.1). The phenomenon is especially relevant when the central bank faces
a recalcitrant fiscal authority that, say, for political reasons, is not willing to lower
the fiscal deficit. But (what appears to be) Fiscal Dominance can also arise in an
analytically much more interesting situation in which the fiscal authority is fully
committed to support the inflation stabilization program, as announced.

This is illustrated in Calvo (1998), which was motivated by trying to understand
why Brazil struggled to stop high inflation when public debt and the primary deficit
were not grossly out of line. Let 𝑏, 𝜋 and 𝜋 𝑒 denote real public debt, one-period
public forward-looking inflation and expected inflation, respectively. For simplicity,
I will assume that, at RE equilibrium, the real one-period interest rate is equal to
zero. Thus, under risk neutrality, the equilibrium interest rate will equal expected
one-period inflation, 𝜋 𝑒 , in which case next-period debt service bill (including
amortization) in real terms equals

                                             1+𝜋 𝑒
                                         𝑏           .                                (1)
                                             1+𝜋


Therefore, given the rate of inflation, the larger is expected inflation, the larger will
be the real debt service burden. For simplicity, let us assume that the government is
bound to service debt in its totality at the end of next period and that the central

6The consumption boom phenomenon associated with stabilization programs
received a lot of attention. Some outstanding alternative explanations do not rely on
imperfect credibility but on a combination of lower nominal interest rates, as a
result of lower inflation expectations and sticky prices. See, e.g., Rodriguez (1982).


                                                                                       9
bank is obliged to rebate seigniorage to the private sector in the form of lump sum
subsidy (so that seigniorage net of rebate equals zero). The government is assumed
to manage the rate of inflation, 𝜋, by manipulating the rate of devaluation. Thus, for
instance, if output is homogeneous and there are no barriers to trade, and
international prices are constant in foreign exchange, it follows that inflation equals
the rate of devaluation, i.e., 𝜋 = 𝜀, where 𝜀 stands for the rate of devaluation.

Under the above assumptions, expression (1) denotes the real tax revenue
necessary for debt service. I will assume that the fiscal authority can comfortably
generate tax revenue to service its debt if 𝜋 = 𝜋 𝑒 , but not a cent more. 7 It follows
that the government will have to default if it sets 𝜋 < 𝜋 𝑒 and, if default is too costly,
it will be forced to make 𝜋 ≥ 𝜋 𝑒 , and become hostage of inflation expectations. For
the casual observer, this would be a case of Fiscal Dominance but, in essence, the
situation is better characterized as a case of Expectations Dominance, which
becomes effective through the credit channel. Notice that across RE equilibriums in
which 𝜋 = 𝜋 𝑒 investors get the same revenue. Hence, if the economy generates
inflation higher than the government's target, the solution is Pareto inefficient. This
problem holds even in a world of Rational Expectations, in which individuals are
fully aware that the government's inflation target is feasible if expectations are
equal to the target. In this case, however, Rational Expectations depend on beliefs
about market expectations. A single individual has no command on the latter, and
rationally aligns her expectations to the expectations of others, a phenomenon that
the GT calls "expectations of expectations."

An interesting implication of the above example is that RE equilibrium may be
validated, not because individuals are rational, but because policymakers are forced
to corroborate individuals' expectations!

Calvo (1988) also shows that the problem would go away if the interest rate on
government bonds were indexed to the rate of inflation. In terms of the above
example, it is clear that if the rate of interest ex post was set equal to the realized
rate of inflation, the government would be able to implement the target inflation
rate, independently of market inflation expectations! 8 This rule has been adopted in
Chile through the UF (Unidad de Fomento) and may have helped to support inflation
targeting. Moreover, there seems to be wide consensus that eliminating inflation
uncertainty in financial contracts has helped financial deepening and the
development of the mortgage market (Fontaine (1996), Shiller (1998)). In other
instances, e.g., 1989 Bonex plan in Argentina, Expectations Dominance led to
denominating financial contracts in terms of USD. In the simple model developed


7 In Calvo (1988) government is allowed to collect higher tax revenue.
8 In practice, inflation indexation is applied with a lag. This may make indexation
less effective for shielding investors from inflation risk, especially during periods of
high and accelerating inflation. Moreover, financial indexation may lower
policymakers' incentives for price stability.


                                                                                       10
here, USD indexation gives similar results, but this would not be the case if one
allows for the existence of nontradable goods, for example.

Expectations Dominance can also have a deleterious effect on the private sector. For
example, if the economy comes from high inflation and people have structured their
contracts on the expectation that inflation will continue unabated, a cold turkey
stabilization program, which stops inflation in its tracks, will cause the same kinds
of problems highlighted above. At one point in the 1980s, for example, Brazil
inflation was about 30 percent per month. Imagine the impact of lowering inflation
to single digits, annually! Several stabilization programs had to be abandoned
because keeping the course meant sky-high ex post real interest rates that would
wreak chaos in the financial sector and the payments system. This phenomenon has
been recently discussed in Lara Resende (2016). It bears some resemblance to
Irving Fisher's (1933) Debt Deflation. The latter, inspired by the Great Depression,
is a case in which the real value of debt skyrockets as a result of a sharp and
unexpected fall in the price level (in the Great Depression wholesale prices fell by
more that 30 percent). In contrast, the harmful effects of cold turkey stabilization
highlighted here would arise even though prices do not fall and may continue rising,
albeit at a sharply lower rate than expected.

These problems are akin to what is called "peso problem," an expression
popularized in the 70s and 80s as Mexico's interest rates exceeded the rate of
devaluation by a wide margin (Lewis (2016)). An explanation that, in a way,
foreshadowed RE was that the phenomenon was triggered by the expectation that
Mexico's peso would exhibit a maxi-devaluation. This type of devaluation involves
isolated jumps in the exchange rate. Thus, interest rates will look "too large" over
stretches in which the exchange rate is constant. The peso problem is indeed very
close to the example discussed above. However, in Calvo (1988) the authorities are
forced to validate devaluation expectations, despite the existence of another more
benign RE equilibrium. The latter has important policy implications because, for
instance, it highlights the relevance of indexation for stopping high inflation, even
though policymakers are fully credible. Notice that these implications would be
missed in models displaying equilibrium uniqueness, a feature that policy-oriented
macro models tend to favor. 9

So far, the discussion has abstracted from debt default. A government that is
adamant on stabilizing inflation but is facing high inflation expectations may
entertain the idea of default. This case is analyzed in Calvo (1988) and further
developed by Corsetti and Dedola (2016). A sketch follows.



9The literature also abounds on backward looking "wage indexation" as a factor
preventing speedy price stabilization. Although this could be reinterpreted as a case
of backward-looking expectations, I will refrain for discussing this issue here, given
this paper's emphasis on Rational Expectations.


                                                                                    11
Debt default can be analyzed in the context of a non-monetary economy employing
the framework developed above. I will reinterpret inflation, 𝜋, and inflation
expectations, 𝜋 𝑒 , as rate of default and expected rate of default, respectively. In this
instance, the expectation that the government will default would force the
government to default. In contrast to the inflation example, solving this problem is
likely to be more difficult. In the inflation example, the problem could go away by
adopting new types of contracts (i.e., indexation). This is less likely to work if
default is in the cards, because the private sector may be less predisposed to believe
the government will honor its contracts. Therefore, to improve the situation it may
be necessary to bring in independent parties that are willing and capable to credibly
insure investors against sovereign default. This is not easy, given the legal
privileges enjoyed by sovereign states. But it seems to have worked in the
Eurozone. Worried about the high interest rate premium in satellite Eurozone
economies, reflecting investors concern about the solvency of those economies,
Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, gave a speech on July 26th, 2012, pledging to "do
whatever it takes" to lower those interest rates. This was read by the market as an
ECB commitment to purchase as much of those sovereign debt instruments as
necessary to squash their risk premium to default-free levels. It resulted in an
astonishing fall in those rates of interest, as predicted by the model. Why can the
ECB muster such an impressive muscle is an important issue. A common conjecture
is that Germany is the actual credible Lender of Last Resort in view of Germany's
strong fundamentals. But another conjecture that cannot be dismissed is that the
ECB can print credible liquidity. I will revisit that issue in Section IV.

Once again, intertemporal trade and non-state-contingent financial contracts are at
the heart of these problems. Fortunately, there is room for policy, as illustrated by
the Chile and ECB experiences mentioned above.

Remark 2. Staggered Prices. Calvo and Végh (1993) extended the credibility
discussion to the case in which prices are set in advance in a staggered
uncoordinated manner à la Calvo (1983). Results are in line with the above analysis
but the richer environment helps to show that, for instance, a non-credible inflation
stabilization program faces an additional powerful challenge. If agents fail to be
persuaded that authorities have the determination and public support to carry out
the program, prices may continue rising at a high rate despite tight monetary policy.

Calvo and Végh (1993), taken at face value, implies that controlling inflation might
become easier if prices/wages were flexible. However, this conclusion, which
enjoys widespread appeal among policymakers, would be hasty. Section IV will
argue that staggered prices could play a fundamental role in a monetary economy.
They could provide a stable output anchor to fiat monies and units of account,
without which a monetary economy may become unstable, unless the currency is
credibly anchored (not necessarily pegged) to a resilient foreign currency, e.g., the
USD. This is common practice in EMs (see, e.g., Calvo and Reinhart (2002)), but




                                                                                       12

Calvo et al (2013)). ∎

         IV.     Sudden Stop, Chronic Deflation and Sluggish Recovery:
                            Liquidity Explanations

The discussion in the previous section was framed in terms of conventional macro
theory under the assumption of Rational Expectations. Until recently, the
corresponding models were taken with a high degree of confidence by
policymakers. However, amid that placid scenario, the Great Recession rose with
shattering force, putting into question everything, from Rational Expectations to the
feasibility of capitalism. Minsky's (2008 a) nightmares could no longer be
discounted!

In this Section this paper will start to explore the new issues by giving "liquidity" a
more central role than it had in mainstream macro theory prior to the Great
Recession. Otherwise, however, the models stick to the assumption of Rational
Expectations and other assumptions of traditional economic theory. This
smoothens out the transition from the previous Section but the reader must be
prepared for a sharp turn, because the new vistas that the liquidity approach
conveys are anything but ordinary.

"Liquidity" is an issue that only recently has been given serious attention in the
literature (see, e.g., Holmström and Tirole (2011), Calvo (2016)). This situation
may be partly due to the fact that mainstream models appeared to be adequate for
monetary policy before the Great Recession, at least for DMs. But I would not
discard the possibility that model-builders were reluctant to focus on liquidity
issues because they cannot be easily accommodated in canonical general
equilibrium models. In other words: intellectual inertia.

This section will argue that liquidity offers promising insights but we have to make
sure that we are walking on firm grounds. Although liquidity has become a
ubiquitous word, "fashion over substance" seems to dominate. For example, several
observers claim that the Lehman 2008 crisis involved a phenomenal Liquidity
Crunch on financial assets backed up by real assets, e.g., ABS. And they seem
undisturbed to say, in the same breath, this shock was accompanied by a flight to
quality involving the USD, a fiat money. Something is amiss here, and forces us to
delve into the reasons for fiat money to hold positive value in terms of output, a
characteristic of fiat money that conventional macroeconomics tends to take for
granted.

Section IV.1 considers Frank Hahn's (1965) fundamental observation that, as a
general rule, conventional general equilibrium monetary models cannot rule out the
existence of barter equilibria. This result makes the flight-to-USD phenomenon
even more puzzling, and enhances the relevance of finding plausible explanations
for the resilience of money. The flight-to-money phenomenon was a central issue in


                                                                                         13
Keynes's GT (and it is associated with what was elsewhere called Liquidity Trap). 10
In an isolated and wholly ignored paragraph, the GT puts forward a simple, but in
my opinion insightful, conjecture that I labeled the Price Theory of Money (PTM). 11
The PTM claims that money derives its liquidity and positive purchasing power
from the existence of staggered prices. Staggered prices provide an output backing
to money that, as a general rule, governments fail to give. Notice that this output
backstop does not extend to other liquid assets with flexible nominal prices.

While staggered prices give a real platform for liquidity of money that helps to
explain its resilience during financial crisis episodes, this does not rule out liquidity
fragility or liquidity shortage – because money's output backstop is anything but
ironclad. This leads naturally in Section IV.2 to consider a world with multiple
monies and a variety of nominal liabilities, e.g., Asset-backed securities, EM USD-
denominated bonds. Under these conditions, resilient and fragile liquid assets live
next to each other. Since, by definition, liquid assets are transactions facilitators,
Liquidity Crunch of a subset of liquid assets generates a sudden deceleration of
transaction flows that rely on those assets. In practice, this takes the form of credit
Sudden Stop – i.e., large and largely unexpected fall in credit flows – that could
become systemic, given that liquidity is in the eye of the beholder. 12 These insights
can also be employed as a guide for monetary policy. It can be shown, for instance,
that standard open-market operations could be ineffective for restoring potential
output – and that the latter may be better served by unconventional monetary
policy instruments, which do not call for lowering the central bank's policy interest
rate.

Section IV.3 will focus on the case in which the official sector is unable to increase
the stock of real liquidity. This could be the result of having increased liquid public
debt far beyond its output backing. I will show that this situation may generate
Chronic Deflation. Finally, Section IV.4 will argue that liquidity shortage can also
help to rationalize "Sluggish Recovery" (aka "Secular Stagnation").




10 I conducted a search in a Kindle edition of the General Theory and could not find
the expression "liquidity trap."
11 See Calvo (2012, 2016).
12 As noted in the Introduction, Sudden Stop is an expression introduced to refer to

severe contraction in international capital flows. The phenomenon has also being
observed in Europe during the Great Recession (see Merler and Pisani-Ferry
(2012)). Nowadays it has been extended to credit flows. To avoid confusion, I
choose to dub them "credit" Sudden Stops.


                                                                                       14
IV. 1. Hahn's Problem, the Price Theory of Money, and Fear of Floating

The typical mainstream macro model assumes that there exists an object called
money – usually denoted M – that provides liquidity services. A popular assumption
in the literature is "cash-in-advance," according to which, in order to conduct
market transactions, agents have to bring to market a quantity of M proportional to
the monetary (or nominal) market value of planned purchases (e.g., the Clower
(1967) constraint). In simple models, the proportionality coefficient is assumed to
be constant. Despite its simplicity, the cash-in-advance assumption dramatizes an
important fact that is easily ignored in nonmonetary economics, namely, that
liquidity services are essential for trade. In this setup, if M = 0, no trade is possible!

Let planned purchases be denoted by c (in terms of homogeneous real output), and
the real (or output) price of money (i.e., the inverse of the price level) by Γ, then,
setting the factor of proportionality = 1, the cash-in-advance condition can be
expressed as:

                                  𝑀Γ = 𝑐.                                              (1)

Thus, as pointed out above, in equilibrium, if M = 0, then c = 0, and there cannot be
trade. But, what if Γ = 0? Clearly, the result is the same: agents will be doomed to
operate under full autarky. Is Γ = 0 a possible equilibrium outcome? Hahn (1965)
shows that it is. The proof is trivial if M has no intrinsic market value, because in
that case money cannot buy output and the situation is equivalent to bringing no
money to the market! 13 This is a deep observation that does not apply to regular
goods: if the price of bread is zero in terms of other goods, say, there is likely to be
excess demand for bread.

There have been attempts to show conditions under which zero-output value of
money can be ruled out; for example, assuming that real monetary balances, i.e., 𝑀Γ,
enter utility functions, that satisfy Inada-type conditions. 14 These conditions sound
somewhat artificial in this case and, moreover, I do not think they are enough to rule
out Γ = 0. For, if the latter holds, then 𝑀Γ = 0, independently of how large is M. No
matter how valuable would monetary balances be for individual agents, there is
nothing single individuals can do to make 𝑀Γ > 0. In fact, as noted in footnote 12, if
holding worthless M involves just a minor nuisance, agents would dump M even
though they are starving for 𝑀Γ > 0!

The GT offers a conjecture for why Γ > 0. In short, the conjecture is that Γ > 0
because agents employ nominal prices to communicate to the market the quantity of

13 Notice that if holding M were a minor nuisance, its demand would be nil, causing
excess supply in the money market. However, by Walras Law, that does not
generate excess demand in the rest of the economy because the real price of money
Γ = 0.
14 See Obstfeld and Rogoff (1983 and 1986).



                                                                                       15
units of account (money, in this case) at which they are ready to sell their staples
and, moreover, they are prepared to keep those prices 'live' for some interval of
time. Hence, nominal prices come first: we are in the world of "prices-in-advance."
For an individual agent to have incentives to set her price in advance, it helps that a
substantial number of other agents have already posted their prices in similar
fashion, and that most of those prices can be taken for granted by present price
setters. This is, thus, also a world of "staggered prices." In this world, individual
price setters have a clear reference when setting their prices in terms of money
because at time t, say, Γ𝑡 is (essentially) predetermined and positive. 15 Moreover,
keeping their price quotations 'live' for a period of time does not involve great risks
of price misalignment if the expected rate of inflation is low. 16

The PTM can be criticized for being no more than a tautology: Γ > 0 because Γ > 0.
But the case is subtler. The PTM states: Γ𝑡 > 0 because Γ𝑡−1 > 0, and just a few
agents can/will change their prices at t. This mechanism is incentive compatible:
price setters at t will have no incentives to set their money prices = ∞ (which is
equivalent to refusing to quote their prices in terms of money). Compare this with
canonical models like the cash-in-advance, or models in which real monetary
balances are an argument in utility or production functions – and prices are
perfectly flexible. Even if Γ𝑡−1 > 0, in these canonical models individuals have no
incentives that would rule out Γ𝑡 = 0! Notice that the PTM does not rely on the
existence of physical money. It is a theory that applies equally well to a cashless
economy with a unit of account in terms of which prices are set in a staggered
manner (see Woodford (2003)). To be sure, it would be interesting to explore the
process by which units of account are established, but that does make canonical
models superior to the PTM, because models that are anchored on M instead of Γ
also need a rationale for the choice of a particular unit of account.

The PTM helps to rule out Γ = 0 but does not guarantee that Γ will be stable in
realistic situations, because not all prices are set in terms of the same unit of
account. 17 To wit, the world displays many units of account subject to variable
bilateral exchange rates. Interestingly, though, there is more stability in bilateral
exchange rates than the existence of multiple of currencies would lead one to
expect. For example, Calvo and Reinhart (2002) show that EMs tend to peg their
currencies to so-called reserve currencies, a phenomenon called "fear of floating."

15 However, this does not necessarily imply "inflation in advance." Thus, the output
backup of money will also be a function of inflation expectations, and the issues
raised in Section III still apply.
16 However, the risks of setting prices in advance could be large in periods in which,

say, the economy is buffeted by large swings in its terms of trade, which involve
prices set outside the domestic economy.
17 The PTM does not ensure uniqueness of the Γ path even if there exists a unique

unit of account. Uniqueness may require rules like Taylor rule, a central topic in
New Keynesian literature. See Woodford (2003) and also Calvo (2016) for a
skeptical assessment about the relevance of New Keynesian models in that respect.


                                                                                        16
Reserve currencies are units of accounts that are employed as invoice currencies in
a wide variety of international trade and financial transactions (see Gopinah
(2015)). Consequently, pegging to a reserve currency strengthens EM currencies
output backing, making them more reliable as stores of value, which, in turn,
enhances the liquidity of reserve currencies. The USD is the king among reserve
currencies, and has shown its muscle during the Lehman crisis, as the USD
appreciated relative to other currencies, even though the US economy was at the
epicenter of the crisis. The USD privilege is rooted on considerations that fall
outside the scope of the present paper, and I will not discuss them here. However, it
is worth pointing out that, especially in small EMs, the realm of their national units
of account is very limited, implying that unless their currencies are pegged to a
reserve currency, their currencies' output backing would be very narrow, which
could make them easy targets of currency runs' episodes, and large currency
devaluation or appreciation (recall the sharp and surprising appreciation of the
Swiss franc in January 2015).

To make the previous statements more intuitive, it is useful to think of currencies in
terms of a T-account with the stock of money on the liability side and a pot of goods
(output) on the asset side. The pot of goods stands for the currency's output
backing. This is similar to a bank's balance sheet with deposits on the right-hand
side and illiquid loans on the left-hand side. In the present case, the pot of goods
stands for the goods and services that money holders can grab in exchange for
money if they wish to. The pot of goods is likely to be smaller than the output value
of money, Γ𝑀. Hence, as in banking models, there may exist multiple equilibriums
(see, e.g., Diamond and Dybvig (1983)). In a "good" equilibrium Γ𝑀 could far exceed
the pot of goods, while in a "bad" equilibrium Γ𝑀 would be just equal to the pot of
goods. 18 Accumulating international reserves in terms of reserve currencies
increases the pot of goods. It is intuitive that pegging, especially if accompanied by
reserve accumulation, is likely to diminish the probability of currency runs and,
thus, lowering the need for trade to rely on derivative markets, which are costly and
not easily available for small- and medium-sized enterprises. This helps to give a
rationale to "fear of floating" and international reserve accumulation.

It should be noted that fear of floating is not unique to EMs. During the Lehman
crisis, for example, the Fed signed a large currency swap agreement with the ECB to
prevent a wave of massive bankruptcies in the Eurozone (with possible spillover
effects on the US), given that the Eurozone was undergoing a severe USD shortage
episode. Thus, despite the large menu of national currencies, the world economy
appears to be groping towards a Bretton-Woods-like scheme with the USD as the
nominal (and, hence, real) anchor, and enjoying some partial Lender of Last Resort
services from the Fed, especially if the US economy is part of the problem. Even the
Fund, a cheerleader for floating exchange rates, has started to realize the rationale


18Equilibria could be Pareto ranked by Γ𝑀 in models in which Γ𝑀 is an argument in
utility and/or production functions and exhibits positive partial derivatives.


                                                                                   17
for fear of floating, and becoming more permissive about intervention in the foreign
exchange market.

IV. 2. A Larger Set of Liquid Assets: Sudden Stop

In practice, national currencies' own-rates of interest are nil. Thus, unless price
deflation is rampant, there are incentives to create quasi-monies. This process goes
back to at least medieval banking (see Cipolla (1989)) and ran at full steam prior to
the Great Recession. The phenomenon has already been covered in multiple sources
(e.g., Brunnermeier (2009)), so I will just highlight some salient features that relate
to the discussion in the previous subsection. A common characteristic is that quasi-
monies take the form of fixed-income obligations denominated in terms of a unit of
account. The age-old example is bank deposits backed up by a credible Lender of
Last Resort (typically, a central bank able to print currency or public liabilities
denominated in the bank deposits' unit of account). A more recent example is
Mortgage Backed securities (MBS), which are large pools of mortgage contracts
denominated in terms of a unit of account. Barring systemic shocks, pooling allows
MBS to take advantage of the Law of Large Numbers, reducing the need for
information about individual contracts, and exhibiting low return volatility in terms
of the corresponding unit of account. As a result, securitized assets like MBS can
come to resemble interest-bearing money.

The similarity between money and quasi-monies does not stop there. Hahn's
problem also applies to quasi-monies because they are subject to runs that are akin
to those discussed in the banking literature (see Diamond and Dybvig (1983) and
the notes about national monies in previous section). In those models, bank
deposits provide liquidity services but, unless there is a credible Lender of Last
Resort, there exist other equilibriums in which a sizable share of depositors tries to
get their money out of the bank at the same time, the bank goes bankrupt and the
liquidity services of the associated deposits evaporate. Runs on quasi-monies can
occur even though their fundamentals show no fissure prior to the run, similar to
the phenomenon referred to under the Hahn's problem. Except for bank deposits
fully ensured by a Lender of Last Resort, most other liquid assets have flexible
prices in terms of the unit of account. Hence, if the market refuses to take them as
means of exchange, their price may plunge. Prices may not go to zero because, say,
MBS involve obligations that will eventually be at least partially honored, but the
price fall of these securities may still be significant.

Quasi-monies play an important role as credit collateral (e.g., Repurchase
Agreements or repos). They do not circulate as fiat money or bank deposits, but are
important transaction facilitators for intertemporal trade transactions. Therefore,
quasi-monies fall under the category of liquid assets as defined here. Positive
welfare effects generated by stable liquid assets are bound to be very large, given
that credit is essential for trade in modern capitalist economies. Without liquid
assets it would be hard to realize gains from trade. A major problem, though, is that
these assets are subject to liquidity crunch without warning and cause major


                                                                                    18
interruption of credit flows. There is still no good understanding how liquidity
crunch takes place, which leaves the credit market at the mercy of large shocks that
are hard or impossible to insure against. This problem is exacerbated by the fact
that, given that liquidity is only partially linked to standard fundamentals, credit
crunch triggered by liquidity crunch in one corner of the market can easily spread to
the rest of the economy. Thus, a local liquidity crunch episode could become
systemic, a situation for which insurance markets are ineffective. This phenomenon
was clear in the 1998 Russian and 2007/8 Subprime crises (see Calvo (2016)). As
noted above, a large interruption of credit flows under these circumstances is called
Sudden Stop, and typically cause (a) large capital loss in the financial sector and,
more importantly, (b) casts serious doubts about the reliability of liquid assets. The
latter, in particular, contributes to making these crises highly persistent (see
Reinhart and Reinhart (2010), Calvo (2016, Chapter 6)). The Great Recession is a
telling example.

The above observations were not central to the DM policy discussion prior to the
Great Recession. Rather, the opposite view prevailed. There was wide consensus
that DM financial system ran as clockwork driven by the hand of sophisticated
operators (see NYT (2008)). And, moreover, if crisis erupted, the view was that
reserve-currency central banks could rapidly stabilize the situation by lowering
their interest rates just a few basis points. This view was partly based on Friedman
and Schwartz (1963) highly influential conjecture that the Great Depression would
have been a regular US recession if the Fed kept the price level from plunging (e.g.,
in the Great Depression the WPI fell by more than 30 percent, peak to trough).
Unfortunately, the Great Recession put a question mark on the Friedman-Schwartz
conjecture. The Fed and other reserve-currency central banks followed the advice,
price-level deflation was avoided and, yet, this did not prevent a deep and long
lasting recession. In the Eurozone, for example, GDP has not (as of April 2016)
recovered its level prior to the Lehman crisis. To be sure, the evidence suggests that
monetary expansion was helpful, perhaps because it partially prevented a replay of
I. Fisher (1933) Debt Deflation, 19 but results are much worse than expected. What is
missing? The above discussion offers a clue: central banks' liquidity does not
necessarily solve liquidity problems triggered by Liquidity Crunch, unless such
liquidity is directed to restore the market for liquid assets hit by crisis (see Calvo
(2012)). Without that, credit flows stop and can cause major damage. Liquid assets
are not born equal, indeed!

DM central banks became aware that something was seriously amiss when they hit
the Zero Lower Bound, and adopted policies aimed at unclogging the credit channel
in a more direct fashion. It took the form of Quantitative Easing (QE), e.g., central
bank purchases of MBS, and measures that directly stimulate credit to the private
sector. The ECB, for example, has announced a modus operandi on March 7, 2016,
that, among other things, expands the scope of a liquidity window for some

19However, the Fed did not prevent Debt Deflation in the housing market where
dollar prices fell by around 30 percent.


                                                                                   19
corporate bonds, and de facto subsidizes loans to the private sector. All of this is
consistent with the view that Liquidity Crunch calls for heterodox central bank
policy which, incidentally, is dangerously close to being catalogued as a
surreptitious form of fiscal policy.

Remark 3. Some microfoundations. To clarify the discussion, let us consider a
simple case in which there is an asset-backed security, which underlying asset I will
identify with "land". Land, denoted by 𝑘, is in fixed supply and subject to no
maintenance costs. Output is a function of land as a standard factor of production
but, in addition, land is a transactions facilitator for firms; land's liquidity (measured
in terms of output) also has a positive effect on output. Hence, I will assume that
output is given by 𝑓(𝑘 + 𝜃𝑞𝑘), where 𝑞 and 𝜃 are the output price of land and a
liquidity coefficient, respectively; 𝜃 is between 0 and 1. Let the real interest rate
(i.e., the own-interest rate on output) be denoted by 𝑟. Then, at a steady state in
which 𝑞 is expected to be constant over time, profit maximization at k > 0 implies
the following first-order condition with respect to 𝑘: 𝑓′(𝑘 + 𝜃𝑞𝑘)𝜃 = 𝑟. One can
show that if function 𝑓 is Cobb-Douglas, the price of land 𝑞 rises with the liquidity
coefficient 𝜃. Hence, a liquidity crunch on land could bring about a collapse in the
relative price of land with respect to output. In this simple setup, money supply has
no role to play. Therefore, if the price of land causes side effects like unplanned
over-indebtedness, standard monetary policy cannot help. One needs instruments
that can have an impact on 𝑞. The unconventional purchase of 'toxic' assets, as in
the US QE1, is a possible, albeit not foolproof, example. 20 ∎

As noted above, Liquidity Crunch is no DM monopoly. The systemic EM crises in the
1990s can also be characterized that way. But there are important differences.
Consider the 1997/1998 Asian/Russian crises, which involved a run against EM
bonds floated in the international capital market. First and foremost, unlike in DMs,
those bonds were denominated in USD or other reserve currency, not EM domestic
monies. The meltdown could have been prevented by a massive purchase by EMs
using international reserves, or drawing on credit lines from an International
Lender of Last Reserve (e.g., the IMF). But the latter was not available, and EMs had
neither the resources (i.e., international reserves) nor the ability to launch a
coordinated counteroffensive. Therefore, this gave rise to a Sudden Stop episode
that, employing the metaphor in Subsection IV.1, lowered the pot of goods backing
up domestic money and triggered currency devaluation, not appreciation – in sharp
contrast with the US during the Lehman crisis. Furthermore, currency devaluation
weakened EM balance sheets, because foreign-currency-denominated debt is partly
employed to fund projects denominated in domestic currency. Thus, large
devaluation – a hallmark of EM Sudden Stops – brought about harmful effects that
are akin to I. Fisher Debt Deflation, as the value of debt obligations skyrocketed
relative to the flow of domestic currency revenue, exacerbating the depth of the


20These issues are discussed in greater detail in Calvo (2012) and Calvo (2016,
Chapters 3 and 5).


                                                                                       20
financial crisis. Clearly, high initial debt and low levels of international reserves
enhance the severity of the crisis. These conditions prevailed prior to the Russian
crisis because, in my opinion, few investors and policymakers foresaw the massive
systemic meltdown that was going to occur in the Russian crisis.

Interestingly, after the Asian/Russian crises, favorable circumstances that gave rise
to improving current account balances and large accumulation of international
reserves in several Asian and Latin American economies placed those economies on
a stronger footing to face the 2008 Lehman crisis (see WEO (2010)). The shock was
felt but recovery was fast, and was followed by a string of relatively high growth
rates, which suggests that the size of the "pot of goods" makes a difference. This is
also borne out by empirical research (see Calvo, Izquierdo and Mejía (2016), Calvo,
Izquierdo and Loo-Kung (2013), and Calvo (2016)).

As argued in Subsection IV.1, "fear of floating" could be traced back to an attempt by
EMs to anchor their currencies on reserve currencies. This works for regular shocks
but it is probably too costly to prevent currency runs in a Sudden Stop episode.
Still, sizable international reserves could help to contain runaway inflation. The
reason is simple: employing the metaphor in Subsection IV.1, devaluation increases
the nominal value of the asset side of the balance sheet (the "pot of goods"), without,
in principle, changing the supply of money. Therefore, money's output backup
becomes stronger and gives the central bank more ammunition to stop inflation
from spiraling. On the other hand, it is easy to show that if the central bank
intervenes and stops devaluation in its track, money's output backup would weaken,
in the normal situation in which monetary domestic liabilities exceed international
reserves. This helps to explain why during the recent sizable contraction of capital
flows to EMs, many countries in Latin America decided to meet the shock with large
devaluation and only modest sacrifice of international reserves. Spiraling inflation,
the nemesis of these economies in the 1980s, has not been a major problem (see
WEO (2016)).

Remark 4. Endogenous Liquidity: Currency Substitution. Liquid assets have a
long history in which tyrants and wars play a major role, but also liquid assets owe
their existence to much more friendly technical change and run-of-the-mill
incentives. EMs are a rich laboratory that illustrates that high inflation, for instance,
can give rise to the creation of local liquid assets in the form of foreign currencies, a
phenomenon labeled "currency substitution," (see Calvo-Végh discussion in Calvo
(1996)). Foreign currencies in question are typically reserve currencies, but need
some help from domestic agents to become liquid at the local level. Incentives for
the creation of liquid assets or arrangements can also take very different forms.
Gorton and Metrick (2012), for instance, claim that Shadow Banks were partly
prompted by attempting to offer more reliable deposit insurance arrangements for
large depositors, like pension funds.




                                                                                      21
The topic of endogenous liquidity is still in its infancy. The currency substitution
literature called attention to some constraints that the phenomenon imparts on
monetary policy, but I feel that the literature has scarcely scratched the surface.
Taking an approach similar to that of the micro banking literature (e.g., Diamond
and Dybvig (1983)), for instance, suggests the existence of sharp discontinuities or
non-linearities that I do not think have been fully exploited in the currency
substitution literature. Moreover, a better understanding of endogenous liquidity
could help to get a more solid grasp about the implications of low reserve-currency
interest rates, a highly topical issue. This type of theory may help to rationalize the
commonly heard statement that low international interest rates are spawning EM
fragile liquid assets that are subject to costly runs. ∎

IV. 3. The Deflation Cycle: Chronic Deflation

Price deflation has pushed out Chronic Inflation from center stage, and issues from
the distant past like Liquidity Trap have come back with a vengeance. Thus,
momentarily at least, the voluminous inflation literature will be swapped for old-
fashioned deflation papers, and a few essays by economic historians of the Great
Depression. It is worrisome, though, that past deflation episodes occurred under
very different circumstances and data is scant. Moreover, although Chronic
Deflation could be partly explained by over-indebtedness and balance sheet
problems (e.g., Koo (2009)), these problems could well have arisen in an
hyperinflationary context, highlighted in Sargent (1981). This motivated me to try
alternative explanations.

In this subsection, I will explore a tentative road inspired by the PTM. The basic
idea is straightforward. Consider an economy in which (fiat) money is the only
liquid asset. Money enjoys some output backup thanks to the existence of sticky
prices. Doubling the stock of money supply in that context, doubles real monetary
balances – but it does not necessarily double money's output backup. If money's
output backup stays constant, for instance, the expected purchasing power of money
may less than double. In Calvo (2016) I call this effect Liquidity Deflation. It is
tantamount to a pecuniary externality for atomistic agents. The initial doubling of
money supply may make people feel that their monetary wealth has doubled in real
terms, but they will soon be disabused as they realize that they would have to share
money's output backup with the rest of the agents, even if prices are sticky.

It is interesting to compare the above situation to the conventional one in monetary
theory, in which individuals assess money's liquidity services by their individual
holdings of real monetary balances. Suppose, for simplicity, that prices are flexible
and the demand for the liquidity of real monetary balances is constant. Hence, in
the conventional model, doubling money supply, will double the equilibrium price
level. In contrast, if Liquidity Deflation is at work, prices may less than double.
Therefore, Liquidity Deflation gives a rationale for the difficulties central banks may
find in stopping deflationary forces by expanding their balance sheets. This



                                                                                     22
reasoning applies with special force for reserve currencies, for which it is difficult to
find more reliable alternative liquid assets. Formal details follow.

To stay on familiar grounds, I will start focusing on the Pigou effect, a pivotal
concept for the 'classicals' (as defined in the GT) argument against the relevance of
Liquidity Trap, who argued that wage and price flexibility could help to restore full
employment. Formally, the argument is that the liquidity of real monetary balances,
𝑀Γ, rises without bound as the price level falls, i.e., as Γ rises. Under normal
circumstances, the associated wealth effect will lift aggregate demand (this is the
Pigou effect), a process that will not stop until full employment is restored. This
argument ignores I. Fisher (1933) Debt Deflation, but I will not let this distract us
because the main point is to show that the argument could be fallacious nonetheless.

The Pigou effect relies on the assumption that economic agents will take 𝑀Γ as a
highly reliable yardstick of how much output can be fetched in the market by
exchanging 𝑀Γ for output, even in cases where aggregate 𝑀Γ exceeds by a large
margin total non-monetary wealth. This assumption is consistent with individual
rationality under the assumption that there is no run against money. The latter may
not sound as a strong assumption for the US dollar, but runs cannot be discounted if
M contains quasi-monies, even if the latter are indexed to the US dollar (as
illustrated by Asset Backed securities' meltdown in the Lehman crisis, see Gorton
and Metrick (2012)). Thus, if runs are in the cards, it is plausible to argue that,
beyond a certain point, an increase in 𝑀Γ may be equivalent to less output in case of
a run, as individuals rush to exchange money for output and take advantage of price
stickiness, while it lasts (recall the metaphor in Subsection IV.1). Therefore, agents
that take runs into consideration will attach a liquidity coefficient to 𝑀Γ, which is
less than unity. This corresponds to the Liquidity Deflation effect mentioned above.
Following these lines, I will assume that the liquidity of money for a single
individual is given by the expression:

                          𝑀Γ + 𝑍((𝑀Γ)𝑒 ), 𝑍′ < 0,                                     (2)

where (𝑀Γ)𝑒 stands for equilibrium aggregate real monetary balances, and function
Z captures Liquidity Deflation. This is equivalent to assuming that it is rational for a
single individual in an atomistic environment to take her own 𝑀Γ as real wealth, but
adjusts liquidity services of money downwards as a function of aggregate 𝑀Γ.
Liquidity Deflation opens the possibility that the expansionary effect of a larger
stock of real monetary balances fizzles out as monetary balances become large.

To couch the discussion in more familiar terms, consider the cash-in-advance
equation (1), and stick on the left-hand side the new definition of liquidity services
from equation (2). Since in a Rational Expectations equilibrium with a
representative individual (𝑀Γ)𝑒 = 𝑀Γ, we get

                                  𝑀Γ + 𝑍(𝑀Γ) = 𝑐.                                     (3)



                                                                                      23
Clearly, it is now conceivable that the Pigou effect is nil, because the wealth effect is
offset by the negative liquidity effect. Hence, a fall in the price level, or an increase
in money supply, given the price level, could have no effect on aggregate demand.
Suppose, for example, that real liquidity hits the upper bound and the associated
aggregate demand is below full capacity output. This would tend to depress the
price level, which exacerbates liquidity deflation – lowering money's output backup,
and eventually triggering a run against M that destroys money's liquidity. Notice
that the failure of the Pigou effect – and the resulting Liquidity Trap – highlighted
here is due to supply-side considerations. I will call it "Supply-Side Liquidity Trap."
This is radically different from the GT rationale, which relies on the assumption that
the demand for money is infinitely elastic with respect to "the" interest rate. It is
worth noting, though, that GT Liquidity Trap and Liquidity Deflations are
complementary rationales for situations in which increasing money supply has a
hard time stimulating output.

Remark 5. ECB Puzzle. At the end of Section III.3 I referred to the highly
successful ECB strategy for lowering risk premiums on some Eurozone sovereign
bonds, which consisted in announcing that the bank "would do whatever it takes" to
achieve this objective. Given the small ECB capital relative to the stock of sovereign
bonds from vulnerable economies, e.g., Italy, Spain, a popular and plausible
conjecture is that success of the strategy stems from the expectation that Germany
would bail out the ECB if necessary. This conjecture is in accord with the above
discussion because Germany would be providing the "pot of goods" behind the ECB
liabilities. It is interesting, though, that in 2007/8, when the Great Recession
reached a boiling point, the actual lender of last resort happened to be the Fed! The
Fed's comparative advantage over Germany under those circumstances was its
capacity to "print" USD, an asset towards which the whole world was running for
safety. This suggests that even though the ECB was very successful in lowering risk
premiums in the Eurozone, it may again need the support of the Fed if, for instance,
the Federal Funds rate rises faster than expected. Thus, it would be a mistake to
think that the euro is runs-free, simply because the ECB was able to lower risk
premiums. This implies that the assumption behind Liquidity Deflation above is not
vacuous, even in the case of a reserve currency like the euro. ∎

Remark 6. More on supply-side Liquidity Trap. The above results may look
confusing to those familiar with the standard approach in monetary theory (see, for
instance, Patinkin (1965)) where individuals internalize the pecuniary externalities
introduced in expression (2). Thus, if one follows the standard approach, the cash-
in-advance constraint would take form (3) above. Let ����   𝑀Γ denote the value of real
monetary balances that maximize 𝑀Γ + 𝑍(𝑀Γ). If 𝑀Γ      ���� is not large enough to
generate full capacity utilization, the situation would be one of "real money
shortage." But it would not correspond to Liquidity Trap, because an increase in
money supply will paradoxically generate excess supply of money and, if nominal
prices are upward flexible, it would result in a fall in Γ (i.e., an increase in the price
level) that pushes real monetary balances back to 𝑀Γ  ����. This would validate the view,


                                                                                       24
popular among well-trained economists, that an increase in the supply of money
raises nominal prices, unless GT Liquidity Trap holds and the demand for money is
infinitely interest elastic.

In contrast, if the pecuniary externality is not internalized, as assumed in expression
(2), increasing 𝑀 when 𝑀Γ = ����𝑀Γ, given Γ, implies, of course, that 𝑀Γ > 𝑀Γ����. The
larger stock of real monetary balances 𝑀Γ yields lower not higher liquidity services
because 𝑀Γ + 𝑍(𝑀Γ) is maximized at 𝑀Γ    ����, and individuals will vie for more real
monetary balances – not less as implied in the standard approach. This situation, if
anything, will put downward pressure on the price level, raising 𝑀Γ even further,
and driving the system into a vicious chronic deflation cycle. ∎

An interesting extension of the model that can also help to make the new results
more intuitive is to assume that (𝑀Γ)𝑒 runs behind 𝑀Γ. Consider the following
example:

                                    (𝑀Γ)𝑒𝑡+1 = 𝑀Γ𝑡 ,                                  (4)

which, taking equations (2) and (4) into account, implies

                          𝑀Γ𝑡 + 𝑍(𝑀Γ𝑡−1 ) = 𝑐𝑡 .                                      (5)

Hence, an increase in money supply will succeed in stimulating aggregate demand at
time t but money stock will have to continue rising to prevent Liquidity Deflation
from catching up.

In this example, even if initially 𝑀Γ = ����
                                         𝑀Γ (recall Remark 6), the central bank would
be able to generate full capacity utilization by helicopter money, say, but it will have
to continue doing so to prevent renewed recessionary pressures and, possibly price
deflation. This is interesting because it is an example in which deflation is a
persistent threat requiring an endless expansion of money supply: Pigou meets
Sisyphus!

An interesting twist is to replace equation (3) by

                𝑀Γ + 𝑍(𝑀Γ) = 𝐿(𝑖 − 𝑖 𝑚 , 𝑦), 𝐿𝑖−𝑖 𝑚 < 0, 𝐿𝑦 > 0,                      (6)

where L is the standard textbook liquidity preference function, and 𝑖 𝑚 stands for the
interest rate on money. The latter is a shortcut of Calvo and Végh (1995) model in
which money is a mix of cash and treasury bills, and 𝑖 𝑚 can be interpreted as the
interest rate controlled by the central bank (e.g., the Federal Funds rate in the US). 21



21Technical note. The absence of the Liquidity Deflation term Z from the demand
side in equation (6) holds if derived from a standard representative-individual


                                                                                      25
To put equation (6) through its paces, note that in the IS/LM apparatus, equation (6)
corresponds to the LM curve. Thus, a rise in 𝑖 𝑚 will increase the demand for money
(i.e., shifts up the LM curve) and generate output contraction. Note that contraction
holds even in the case in which QE is ineffective. This helps to rationalize the opinion,
popular in current debate that QE is no longer effective, but a rise in the Fed's rate
can deepen the extent of recession.

However, the impact of increasing 𝑖 𝑚 could have the opposite sign. For the sake of
the exposition, I will assume equation (4). Suppose that money (including other safe
assets) has a role as a medium of exchange for firms' transactions. This can be
captured by assuming that real monetary balances, 𝑀Γ, enter the production
function. Let the latter be denoted by 𝐹(𝑀Γ𝑡 + Z(𝑀Γ𝑡−1 )), where function 𝐹 is
strictly concave and satisfies Inada conditions around 0. The representative firm's
profit (in real terms) is given by

                          𝐹(𝑀𝑡 Γ𝑡 + Z(𝑀𝑡−1 Γ𝑡−1 )) − (𝑖 − 𝑖 𝑚 )𝑀𝑡 Γ𝑡 .               (7)

Thus, the first-order condition with respect to 𝑀𝑡 is

                             𝐹′(𝑀𝑡 Γ𝑡 + Z(𝑀𝑡−1 Γ𝑡−1 )) = 𝑖 − 𝑖 𝑚 .                   (8)

Hence, lowering the central bank interest rate 𝑖 𝑚 leads to a fall in output (and the
Zero Lower Bound is a non-issue), because it increases the opportunity cost of
money holdings. The negative output effect from lower 𝑖 𝑚 would also hold if money
had a role as credit collateral. I find it curious that the literature and policy debate
systematically assumes that "easy money" is expansionary, despite the popularity of
the literature that highlights collateral assets (e.g., Kiyotaki and Moore (1997)), and
the central role of collateral meltdown in the Lehman crisis (see Gorton and Metrick
(2012)). 22 Notice that under these assumptions maximum steady-state output is
achieved at 𝑀Γ = 𝑀Γ ����. If this output level is thought to be too low, interest rate
policy alone could not help to take the economy off that rut. As in the previous case,
the central bank will be doomed to rely on unconventional monetary policy in
aeternum.

In sum, liquidity deflation could generate Chronic Deflation. Standard and
unconventional monetary policy may fail to generate liquidity necessary to restore
full employment. Moreover, as deflation proves to be much more resilient than
expected, and output is dragged down by lack of aggregate demand, the private
sector may start considering money an attractive investment vehicle, exacerbating
price deflation. These effects will be less acute if the economy operates below ����
                                                                                𝑀Γ,
but they may start to be felt, leading policymakers to turn their attention to
alternatives like fiscal policy. This may be the right way to go. However, given

model in which 𝑀Γ + 𝑍((𝑀Γ)𝑒 ) in an argument in the utility function. However, this
would not hold true if the Z function multiplies 𝑀Γ.
22 For further discussion on this topic, see Calvo (2016).



                                                                                      26
credit market difficulties, it would be misleading to analyze the effects of fiscal
policy ignoring financial constraints. Liquidity shortage could have a major impact
on the size of the Keynesian multiplier. Ilzetzki, Mendoza and Végh (2013), for
instance, found that the multiplier is negative in highly indebted economies.

Remark 7. Spillover effects. Liquidity shortage and deflation in DMs could spill
over to EMs, generating new liquid assets centered on EM liabilities (Gorton (2015),
Calvo (2016)). For EMs that display large international reserves this situation may
enhance the liquidity of public sector obligations, for example, leading to lower
pass-through coefficients and making inflation targets easier to achieve. This is, in
principle, good news for EMs but, as usual, there is also a dark side: liquidity of EM
liabilities is likely to be sensitive to DM interest rates. ∎

In closing, it is worth pointing out that the Supply-Side Liquidity Trap phenomenon
discussed here is a close relative to the burgeoning Safe-Asset Shortage literature
(see Caballero et al. 2016). Both emphasize difficulties in stimulating aggregate
demand or output supply due to supply-related factors. The value-added of the
approach in this paper is that these factors are linked to Liquidity, traced to the
large loss of liquidity in e.g., the inception of the Great Recession, and the difficulty
of increasing liquidity by pumping in reserve currency public sector liabilities, or a
fall in the international (e.g., USD-denominated) price level. Moreover, the
discussion suggests that Supply-Side Liquidity Trap for reserve currencies is linked
to collateral trouble in the credit channel that lowers the output backstop of liquid
assets, a topic addressed next.

IV.4. Sluggish Recovery

Empirical evidence shows that economies may take long to recover from severe
financial crises (e.g., Reinhart and Reinhart (2010)). The Great Recession is a
striking example. The EU is still struggling to recover its output peak in 2008. The
US has been more successful but output is still below trend. This phenomenon has
been attributed to credit boom prior to crisis and resulting over-indebtedness (e.g.,
Koo (2009), Reinhart and Reinhart (2010), Taylor (2015)). Naturally, theory has put
financial frictions and imperfections at center stage – although, it should be noted,
more as amplifiers than main triggering factors (see, e.g., Queraltó (2013)). Less
attention has been paid to liquidity fragility, a birth defect of the financial sector. I
am afraid that this bias may result in losing sight of some valuable "low-hanging
fruits" that help to explain not only sluggish recovery, but also other central features
of systemic financial crises, e.g., nominal price deflation. A model displaying those
features is discussed in Calvo (2016, Chapter 5). I will sketch it out in what follows.

Consider a closed-economy, representative-agent model under perfect price
flexibility. Output can be allocated on a one-to-one basis to consumption or raw
materials, and households are subject to a cash-in-advance constraint, similar to
equation (1) above, where now M stands for fiat money. The representative firm is



                                                                                       27
also subject to a liquidity-in-advance constraint for their raw material purchases.
Moreover and realistically, I assume that the firm can hold both fiat money and
highly liquid securities, say, ABS. The return on ABS, including liquidity services, is
also a function of its liquidity coefficient, indicated by 𝜃 in the formal model
(0 ≤ 𝜃 ≤1). Clearly, if 𝜃 = 0, ABS cannot be employed to satisfy the firm's liquidity
constraint, and the firm will hold liquidity entirely in the form of fiat money. On the
other hand, if 𝜃 = 1, ABS would be perfect substitutes for fiat money and, under
normal circumstances, will return-dominate the latter. Thus, I will assume that if
𝜃 = 1, firms would prefer to hold their entire liquidity portfolio in ABS. The formal
model considers intermediate cases but the two limit cases are enough for
illustration.

Liquidity Crunch is defined as a sudden exogenous fall in parameter 𝜃. For
motivation, this can be thought of as a run on ABS along Diamond-Dybvig (1983)
lines. Consider the case in which, initially, 𝜃 = 1 and as a result of Liquidity Crunch
𝜃 goes all the way down to 0. Since the return on ABS prior to crisis is higher than
the return on fiat money, return on the liquid portfolio that the firm is constrained
to hold in advance will be lower after Liquidity Crunch – which increases the cost of
raw materials and, if the production function satisfies Inada’s conditions, induces a
fall in output. If consumers were the only holders of fiat money and money supply
was given, the slump would cause a rise in the price level, because output
contraction would bring about a fall in the demand for fiat money. But in this model
there is an additional effect pointing in the opposite direction because, as noted,
Liquidity Crunch provokes a massive switch in firms’ liquid portfolio from ABS to
fiat money. This switch can offset the fall in the demand for money from households
and cause price deflation. The model can, thus, rationalize price deflation even
though the cards were stacked against it by the assumption that households are
subject to a cash-in-advance constraint.

The model can be extended to a growth context in which the liquidity-in-advance
constraint applies to investment. In an AK model in which output is proportional to
the stock of capital, one can show that the rate of capital accumulation is a negative
function of the opportunity cost of liquidity. Thus, for instance, a Liquidity Crunch
would bring about a fall in growth, i.e. sluggish recovery. Moreover, if liquidity-in-
advance also applies to the purchase of raw materials, Liquidity Crunch will bring
about output contraction on impact, possibly accompanied by price deflation (as in
the previous paragraph).

Some policy experiments in terms of this model are conducted in Calvo (2016,
Chapter 5). Here I just like to note that, despite its simplicity, the model captures
several realistic features associated with Liquidity Crunch. This suggests that
policies that aim at restoring the economy’s vitality after Liquidity Crunch should
pay special attention to factors that caused Liquidity Crunch and moderate its
effects. Actually, some popular policies that do not address those issues may fail to
work. For instance, an increase in money supply or government expenditure would
be totally ineffective, unless they help to restore ABS’ liquidity without

return that do not include liquidity services).
