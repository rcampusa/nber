                                            ABSTRACT

The Shadow Open Market Committee was formed in 1973 in response to rising inflation and the apparent
unwillingness of U.S. policymakers to implement policies necessary to maintain price stability. This
paper describes how the Committee’s policy views differed from those of most Federal Reserve officials
and many academic economists at the time. The Shadow argued that price stability should be the primary
goal of monetary policy and favored gradual adjustment of monetary growth to a rate consistent with
price stability. This paper evaluates the Shadow’s policy rule in the context of the New Keynesian
macroeconomic model of Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999). Simulations of the model suggest that
the gradual stabilization of monetary growth favored by the Shadow would have lowered inflation
with less impact on output growth and less variability in inflation or output than a one-time reduction
in monetary growth. We conclude that the Shadow articulated a policy that would have outperformed
the policies actually implemented by the Federal Reserve during the Great Inflation era.

“The failure to control inflation was not inevitable. The policies did not fail because they
were poorly executed. They failed because they were poorly conceived.” — Shadow
Open Market Committee, August 23, 19731


         The Shadow Open Market Committee (SOMC) held its first meeting on

September 14, 1973. The SOMC was formed in response to rising inflation in the United

States and the apparent failure of either the Nixon administration or the Federal Reserve

to formulate effective policies to control inflation. Under the leadership of Karl Brunner

and Allan Meltzer, the SOMC met twice a year to review U.S. economic policy and

discuss policy-related research. At the conclusion of every meeting, the Committee

issued a statement evaluating current policy and proposing an alternative course of

action.2 In this paper, we describe the monetary policy framework of the SOMC and the

statements the Committee issued during the Great Inflation period. Further, we simulate a

New Keynesian macroeconomic model embedding a representation of the SOMC policy

rule to evaluate whether the Committee’s proposals could have resulted in a lower

average and more stable rate of inflation than actually occurred.

         First, we describe the economic environment in which the SOMC was created and

the policy views that the SOMC sought to counter. We then describe the SOMC policy

framework by highlighting how the views of SOMC members differed from most Federal

Reserve officials and many academic macroeconomists. That discussion is followed by a

description of the SOMC policy rule. Importantly, the SOMC rule called for a transparent

and gradual adjustment of money stock growth to a steady-state rate. We simulate a New

Keynesian macroeconomic model embedding the SOMC policy rule to gauge how

different the path of inflation might have been if the Federal Reserve had followed the

SOMC’s policy recommendations. Our simulations illustrate that a gradual adjustment of

money stock growth similar to that advocated by the SOMC is likely to result in less

impact on output growth and less variability in inflation or output growth than a large

one-time adjustment.

The Great Inflation and the SOMC

         When the SOMC first met in September 1973, the United States had already

experienced eight years of rising and increasingly variable inflation. Whereas inflation

averaged a mere 1.4 percent between January 1952 and December 1964, it averaged 3.9

percent between January 1965 and August 1973, and reached 7.4 percent for the 12

months ending in August 1973.3

         The Nixon administration’s response to inflation, with the strong support of

Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns and many academic and professional

economists, was to impose controls on wages and prices.4 A first round of controls was

announced on August 15, 1971, and some controls remained in effect into 1974. Burns

continued to champion wage and price controls even when most observers had concluded

that they were not working. For example, in a speech on June 6, 1973, Burns argued that

“the persistence of rapid advances in wages and prices in the United States and other

countries, even during periods of recession, has led me to conclude that governmental

   Nearly 93 percent of respondents to a 1971 survey of members of the National Association of Business
Economists favored the use of wage and price controls or guidelines (“Top Economists Are Extremely
Ebullient Over 1972 Prospects, Back Nixon Program,” Wall Street Journal, September 28, 1971, p. 3), and
61 percent of surveyed members of the American Economics Association supported the administration’s
freeze on wages and prices (“President to Give Post-Freeze Plan in Speech Tonight,” New York Times,
October 7, 1971, p. 1).
                                                                                                            3


power to restrain directly the advance of prices and money incomes constitutes a

necessary addition to our arsenal of economic stabilization weapons.”5

        Burns attributed the inflation of the late 1960s and early 1970s mainly to rising

factor costs, especially labor and energy costs, as well as to government budget deficits,

social programs, and regulations.6 He argued that wage and price controls were necessary

to stem “cost-push” inflation. For example, in a 1970 speech, he contended that

“Governmental efforts to achieve price stability continue to be thwarted by the

continuance of wage increases substantially in excess of productivity gains. … The

inflation that we are still experiencing is no longer due to excess demand. It rests rather

on the upward push of costs – mainly, sharply rising wage rates.” He argued, moreover,

that “monetary and fiscal tools are inadequate for dealing with sources of price inflation

such as are plaguing us now – that is pressures on costs arising from excessive wage

increases.”7

        Burns’s views about inflation were widely shared by leading economists and

policymakers throughout the 1960s and 1970s. For example, Samuelson and Solow

(1960, p. 181) argued that “the essence of the [inflation] problem” stemmed from the

absence of perfect competition in factor and product markets, whereas Bronfenbrenner

and Holzman (1963) cited the power of “economic pressure groups,” such as labor unions

and monopolistic firms. Throughout the 1960s, the Economic Report of the President

blamed inflation on “excessive” wage and price increases. For example, the Economic

Report for 1965 explained that “in a world where large firms and large unions play an

  Retrospectively, Burns (1979) cast blame for the Great Inflation widely but emphasized the effects of
government budget deficits, social programs, and regulations, as well as a political and economic climate
that favored the pursuit of full employment over price stability.

essential role, the cost-price record will depend heavily upon the responsibility with

which they exercise the market power that society entrusts to them” (1966, p. 179).

        Like Burns, some economists and policymakers claimed that government budget

deficits contributed to rising inflation. Federal Reserve Governor Sherman Maisel (1973,

p. 12), for example, wrote that the increasing rate of inflation of the late 1960s and early

1970s was caused by “government deficits; … speculative investment in plant,

equipment, and labor by business corporations; … use of economic power to raise wages

and profits; … But most significant were the government deficits.”

        The SOMC was formed to promote an alternative to these widely entrenched

views about the causes of inflation and to recommend policies for restoring price

stability. The policy analysis and recommendations of the SOMC reflected the monetarist

orientation of its members. Accepting Milton Friedman’s dictum that “inflation is always

and everywhere a monetary phenomenon,” the SOMC argued that price stability could be

restored only by slowing the growth of monetary aggregates. The SOMC advocated a

policy rule characterized by an announced, gradual reduction in money growth to a rate

consistent with long-run price stability. The SOMC made specific recommendations for

money stock growth at its twice-yearly meetings throughout the Great Inflation period

and for several years thereafter (provided in Appendix 1).

The Shadow’s Framework

        The SOMC represented a monetarist challenge to the Keynesian views that

dominated the economics profession and the Federal Reserve during the 1960s and

1970s.8 The fundamental differences between the monetarist and Keynesian views have

  We do not wish to leave the impression that all Federal Reserve officials shared the same views. In
particular, Darryl Francis, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis from 1966 to 1975, advocated

been elaborated at length elsewhere.9 Here we highlight key differences between the

SOMC and Federal Reserve policymakers about the causes of inflation and conduct of

monetary policy to bolster our contention that monetary policy would have been radically

different during the 1970s under a Shadow-led Fed.10

         1. Inflation is a monetary phenomenon: Fed officials often blamed inflation on

labor unions, monopolistic pricing, energy price shocks, and government budget deficits

and dismissed the notion that money growth and inflation are closely connected. Burns,

for example, testified in 1974 that “The role of more rapid monetary turnover rates …

warns against assuming any simple causal relation between monetary expansion and the

rate of inflation either during long or short periods.” Burns acknowledged that “excessive

increase in money and credit can be an initiating source of excess demand and a soaring

price level. But the initiating force may primarily lie elsewhere, as has been the case in

the inflation from which this country is now suffering.”11

         By contrast, SOMC members and other monetarists dismissed “special factors”

explanations for inflation and remained adamant that inflation is caused solely by

excessively rapid growth of the money stock. For example, Karl Brunner argued that

“Persistent increases in the price level are hardly likely to occur … without a similarly

persistent monetary growth. Alternatively, in the absence of persistent and excessive



policies that were much closer to those recommended by the SOMC than to those accepted by a majority of
his Fed colleagues. See Hafer and Wheelock (2003).
9
   For example, see Laidler (1981) or Nelson and Schwartz (2007).
10
    Romer and Romer (2004) argue that throughout the Fed’s history, the success of monetary policy, or
lack thereof, has been mainly due to policymakers’ views about how the economy works and what
monetary policy can accomplish. They attribute the Fed’s inflationary policy during the 1960s and 1970s
initially to a belief in a permanent trade-off between inflation and unemployment, and later to a natural rate
view with a highly optimistic estimate of the natural rate of unemployment and a highly pessimistic
estimate of the sensitivity of inflation to economic slack.

monetary growth we will not experience any persistent inflation. Moreover, any

persistent acceleration of the money stock eventually unleashes a rising inflation. On the

other side, no inflation was ever terminated without lowering monetary growth to the

relevant benchmark level.”12

        2. The market system is inherently stable and economic growth reverts to a

natural rate: Keynesians often argued that expansionary fiscal or monetary policy might

be required to ensure that aggregate demand is sufficient to generate full employment,

especially in the face of downwardly rigid wages and prices. Samuelson (1960, p. 265),

for example, wrote that “with important cost-push forces assumed to be operating, there

are many models in which it can be shown that some sacrifice in the requirement for

price stability is needed if short- and long-term growth are to be maximized, if average

long-run unemployment is to be minimized, if optimal allocation of resources as between

different occupations is to be facilitated.” Further, Samuelson and Solow (1960) argued

that policies directed at limiting inflation in the short run might increase structural

unemployment and reduce economic growth over the long term. The long-run trade-off

between inflation and unemployment would worsen, they argued, because an increase in

structural unemployment would increase the amount of inflation required to achieve a

given reduction in the unemployment rate.

        Monetarists held a very different view. Brunner, for example, argued that “the

market system acts as a shock absorber and tends to establish a normal level of output.

This means that we consider the market system to be inherently stable.” Further, he

argued that the trend in output “is dominated by real conditions and shocks summarized

by technology, preferences, and institutions.”13 And, “monetary impulses do not produce

permanent real effects on output, employment and real interest rates, apart from longer-

run real effects exerted via the expected inflation rate or distortionary institutional

constraints (e.g., tax rates specified in nominal terms).”14 In other words, as Friedman

(1968) and Phelps (1967) argued, in the long run, output growth converges to a natural

rate that is independent of the rate of inflation.15

        3. Monetary policy should focus on price stability. In addition to believing that

monetary policy has little or no impact on output in the long run, monetarists were

skeptical of using policy to “fine-tune” economic activity in the short run. Monetarists

argued that the Fed’s attempts to steer a path between inflation and unemployment in the

face of inevitable uncertainty about the short-run impact of policy actions and other

shocks had exacerbated instability in both inflation and unemployment. For example,

William Poole (1975) argued that “By trying to do too much, policymakers have put

themselves into a vicious ‘stop-go’ cycle with ever-widening oscillations. Each period of

monetary expansion has been higher than the previous one – considering the 1965, 1967-

68, and the 1972-73 expansions. Each of the inflations since 1965 has been worse than

the previous one. And each setback in real activity since 1965 has been deeper than its

predecessor – in the sequence 1967, 1968-70, 1974-75. This pattern must be broken, and

the only method in which I have any confidence is that of stabilizing money growth.”16

        Brunner argued similarly: “The best contribution monetary policy can make to

lower the variability of output relative to normal output is the committed adherence to a

   If anything, monetarists believed that inflation would depress economic growth (e.g., Friedman, 1977).

predictable and stable monetary control path credibly understood by the mass of price

and wage setters.”17

        4. Adverse supply shocks reduce potential output: SOMC members argued

against basing policy actions on estimates of the gap between actual and potential output,

noting that there was little evidence that doing so reduces fluctuations in output. For

example, Brunner argued that “short-run adjustments of monetary growth to the

magnitude of the gap in the context of an economy with long inflation experience

contributes little to the closure of gaps over time.” Furthermore, the occurrence of supply

shocks “reminds us that we cannot infer from output movements alone whether or not a

recession has occurred.”18

        The decline in output and increase in unemployment that followed the first oil

shock in 1973 prompted calls for expansionary monetary policy to return the economy to

full employment. Brunner, however, argued that the shock had increased the natural rate

of unemployment and lowered potential output. Further, he argued that “The distinction

between a ‘real shock decline’ in output and a ‘cyclic decline’ in output … [is] important

for policy making. The latter creates an ‘output gap’ absent from the former. A disregard

of the two distinct processes thus magnifies estimates of the ‘potential gap’ to be

removed by expansionary policies. An inadequate analysis of the decline in output

observed since November 1973 thus reinforces the danger of inflationary financial

responses on the part of policymakers.”19 He also argued that if a decline in output

reflects a decline in potential, then “no increase in money stock whatever its magnitude

will raise output again.”20 Allan Meltzer argued similarly: “Money cannot replace oil, and

monetary policy cannot offset the loss of real income resulting from the oil shock. The

attempt to do so converts the one-time increase in the price level into a permanently

higher maintained rate of inflation.”21 Although the impact of oil shocks on potential

output was noted in the academic literature (e.g., Phelps, 1978), Fed policymakers seem

to have relied on overly optimistic estimates of full-employment output growth produced

by the Council of Economic Advisers.22

         5. The cost of disinflation reflects the monetary authority’s credibility: Whereas

the SOMC argued that money growth should be gradually reduced to lower the inflation

rate, Burns and many other economists often claimed that reducing money growth to the

extent required to halt inflation would result in excessively high unemployment and lost

output. For example, in testifying about the rise of inflation in the late 1960s and early

1970s, Burns argued that “an effort to use harsh policies of monetary restraint to offset

the exceptionally powerful inflationary forces of recent years would have caused serious

financial disorder and economic dislocation. That would not have been a sensible course

for monetary policy.”23

   Orphanides (2003) and Romer and Romer (2004) conclude that reliance on an over estimate of potential
output can explain much of the Fed’s failure to rein in inflation during the 1970s. Orphanides (2003)
estimates a Taylor rule using original (i.e., real-time) data and concludes that policy was broadly consistent
with a 2 percent inflation target throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Orphanides shows, for example, that
estimates of potential output available to policymakers at the time suggested that during 1978-79 output
was far below potential when in fact revised data suggest a much smaller gap in 1975-76 and little or no
gap in 1977-79. The SOMC estimated that the 1973 oil shock had reduced normal output by about 5
percent (SOMC policy statement, September 17, 1979). For an extended discussion, see Brunner’s SOMC
position paper, “Monetary Policy, Inflation and Economic Expansion” (September 13, 1976, pp. 16-18).

        Brunner countered that the cost of disinflation reflects the clarity and credibility

of the announced policy, and, echoing Lucas (1976), argued that estimates of the

resulting loss in output associated with tighter policy generated by standard models are

highly suspect: “The structural properties and response patterns of an economic system

are not invariant relative to different policies and policy patterns. The mechanical

simulation of a policy program substantially different from the policy patterns prevailing

over the sample period used to estimate the model yield … little information about the

consequences of the program proposed. In particular, the simulations of a model

estimated over a period of accelerating inflation probably exaggerate the longer-run

unemployment effects of an anti-inflationary program.”24

        Brunner (1983) argued that “The social cost of a disinflationary policy is not

predetermined by the magnitude or duration of monetary retardation. … The social cost

depends crucially on the public’s belief in the persistence of the disinflationary action.”

And, “Credibility depends … on the history of policymaking and the behavior of the

policy institution. Low credibility offers little incentive to modify price-wage setting

behavior, and the social cost of disinflation rises correspondingly.” Further, “A dominant

conviction by market participants that the Federal Reserve Authorities truly,

unwaveringly and persistently lower monetary growth produces a decline in the rate of

inflation with a comparatively small and rapidly eroding gap [between actual and

potential output]. Emergence and magnitude of a gap in the context of an anti-inflationary

policy depends foremost on the credibility of the policy.”25

        6. Policy should be rules based and transparent: Most Fed officials rejected the

call for rules-based policy, especially those involving control of monetary aggregates.

Fed Governor Andrew Brimmer, for example, argued that “it would be a disastrous error

for the Federal Reserve to try to conduct monetary policy on the basis of a few simple

rules governing the rate of expansion of the money supply” (1972, p. 351). And Burns

claimed that “The appropriate monetary growth rates will vary with economic conditions.

They are apt to be higher during periods of economic weakness … than when the

economy is booming…. Special circumstances may, however, call for monetary growth

rates that deviate from this general rule.”26

        By contrast, the SOMC favored rules-based policy, arguing that discretionary

policy can succeed only if monetary authorities have full knowledge of the deterministic

and stochastic structure of the economy. Hence, Brunner (1983) argued, “A constant

monetary growth regime [is] … an optimal risk-minimizing strategy in a state of

uncertain and shifting information.” Brunner’s preferred policy did, however, allow

changes in the monetary growth rate in response to changes in the trend of normal real

growth and velocity.

        7. Money market (nominal interest rate) targeting is flawed: The Fed used a

“money market” strategy to implement its policy. This strategy evolved from the Fed’s

borrowed reserves strategy of the 1920s and the interest rate-pegging regime of World

War II.27 After the Fed-Treasury Accord in 1951, the Fed remained committed to

maintaining an “orderly” market for government securities and policy often reflected a

desire to keep the government securities market on an “even keel,” especially when the

Treasury was issuing new debt. Fed officials gauged the “tone and feel” of the money

markets and judged the stance of policy by movements in nominal interest rates – rising

rates were interpreted as reflecting tighter policy and falling rates as looser policy.28

        Fed officials justified their focus on the money market by claiming that “financial

market behavior is too complex for simple monetary rules to work” (Gramley and Chase,

1965, pp. 1403-04). Burns explained that “we pay close attention to interest rates because

of their profound effects on the working of the economy.”29

        Monetarists, however, argued that the Fed’s focus on interest rates had misled

policymakers into thinking that they were tightening policy in response to rising inflation

when, in fact, policy was increasingly loose. Brunner, for example, noted that “An

interest rate target policy misleads monetary authorities and many spectators into

believing that expansive (or restrictive) actions have been initiated when nothing has

been done or even worse, when actually restrictive (expansive) measures have been

introduced. A decline in interest rates resulting from falling credit demand possesses no

expansionary meaning and simply reflects one aspect of the ongoing deflationary process.

Its interpretation as an expansive action by the Fed is a dangerous illusion.”30 Allan

Meltzer argued similarly in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in 1975:

“Changes in interest rates convey inaccurate information about the direction or thrust of

current monetary policy.” He described the use of nominal interest rates as a guide to

policy as “one of the principal errors that the Federal Reserve has made throughout its

history.”31

        8. Money demand is stable. Many economists and monetary policymakers

dismissed monetary growth rules, arguing that money demand is too unstable to permit

the use of such rules. Policymakers often claimed that financial innovations and changes

in regulation unpredictably altered the relationship between monetary growth and

nominal spending. Burns, for example, claimed that “From one month to the next, the

public’s demand for money is subject to variations that are usually of a short-run

nature…. If the Federal Reserve tried to maintain a rigid monetary growth rate … [then]

interest rates could fluctuate widely, and to no good end. The costs of financial

intermediation would be increased, and the course of monetary policy would be

misinterpreted.”32

        SOMC members questioned the Fed’s analysis, however, especially estimates of

money demand equations that included only short-term interest rates. Brunner, for

example, conjectured that “money demand functions using long term in lieu of short term

interest rates supplemented with a measure of returns on equities produces different

results.”33

        9. The money stock is controllable: Fed officials often claimed that they had little

control over the money stock and, hence, that monetary aggregate targeting would not be

feasible even if it were desirable. Board staff economists Lyle Gramley and Samuel

Chase (1965) argued, for example, that “Traditional [i.e., monetarist] analysis … fails to

recognize that substitution between time deposits and securities may be an important

source of pro-cyclical variations in the stock of money even in the face of countercyclical

central bank policy.”34 Burns argued similarly that the growth of monetary aggregates

can give a misleading indication of the stance of policy. In testimony before the House

Banking Committee in July 1975, he stated that “the narrowly defined money supply,

M1, can actually be a misleading guide to the degree of monetary ease or restriction. For

example, in periods of declining economic activity both the transaction demand for cash

and the private demand for credit will tend to weaken and thus slow the growth of M1.”35

         By contrast, Brunner and other SOMC members argued that the apparent

endogeneity of money to movements in income reflected the Fed’s practice of targeting

nominal interest rates. According to Brunner (1983), “Interest rate targeting is the most

important condition contributing to ‘reverse causation.’ Interest rate policy converts the

monetary base, and consequently the money stock, into an endogenous magnitude

sensitively exposed to all ongoing shocks affecting market rates of interest. These shocks

are transmitted via interest rate targeting into accelerations or decelerations of monetary

growth.” Further, he argued, “The effect on the base is a consequence of the Federal

Reserve’s interest target policy and would disappear with proper monetary control.”36

        In 1975, Congress adopted House Concurrent Resolution 133, which required the

Fed to establish target ranges for monetary growth. The Fed set ranges as required, but

growth frequently fell outside those ranges. Fed officials blamed the deviation of

monetary growth from the target ranges on financial innovations and changes in

regulation that affected money demand. The SOMC rejected that explanation, however,

contending that their studies showed that by controlling the growth of the monetary base,

the Fed could control the growth of the money stock at a horizon of some two to four

quarters.37 Brunner noted, however, that “effective monetary control also requires some

adaptations of inherited institutions … [including] radical simplification of reserve

requirements [and] in the manner of computing required reserves.”38

        The preceding discussion should clarify how the SOMC’s views diverged from

those of the Fed. The SOMC reflected the emerging New Classical views of Friedman,

Lucas, and others, many of which are features of mainstream macroeconomic models

today. Although today there are few proponents of money supply policy rules, many

aspects of the SOMC policy framework are now widely accepted. These include the

natural rate hypothesis; the value of transparent, rules-based policies; the importance of

credibility; and the notion that in the long run, inflation is determined solely by monetary

policy.39 Like many monetary economists today, the SOMC held that price stability

should be the paramount objective of monetary policy, and that efforts to limit

fluctuations in economic activity or to promote financial stability are unlikely to succeed

in the absence of price stability.

        The following section describes the SOMC policy rule and presents results from

simulation of a modern macroeconomic model that embeds the SOMC rule in an effort to

determine how different the path of inflation might have been if the Fed had followed

such a rule.

The Shadow’s Policy rule

        The SOMC articulated a consistent and transparent policy rule throughout the

Great Inflation era. Karl Brunner explained the rule in a position paper written in

September 1979:

        This procedure is based on an estimate of the desired target of monetary growth.
        This selection depends on the desired longer-rate movements of the price-level
        and the economy’s normal real growth. A second step formulates estimates of the
        time profile for the monetary multiplier. These two steps imply the required
        growth rate of the monetary base. Projections of the source components of the
        base other than Federal Reserve Credit determine ultimately the anticipated path
        of the Fed’s net open market operations over various horizons ahead. … [T]he
        “ultimate target” for the growth of the monetary base should be announced
        together with the stepwise reduction proceeding over the next three to five
        years.40

Although the SOMC policy rule specified a steady-state growth rate for the monetary

base, it was more than a simple, fixed-rate monetary rule. As noted previously, Brunner

indicated that it might be necessary to adjust the steady-state monetary growth rate in

response to permanent changes in economic growth or velocity. Moreover, the SOMC

rule emphasized the transition from the current monetary growth rate to the steady-state

growth rate. As the statement above makes clear, the SOMC rule implied that the

adjustment of monetary base growth to the ultimate target should be gradual and publicly

announced.

          SOMC statements often called for transparent, consistent policies, and the SOMC

was critical of the FOMC’s practice of announcing monetary growth targets starting from

the most recently observed level of the money stock – a practice that came to be known

as “base drift.” In contrast, the SOMC’s rule avoided base drift by establishing a growth

rate from the previous target value:

(1)       ln( M tT,t 1 )  ln( M tT1,t )   t

where M tT,t 1 is the target value for the money stock at time t + 1 established at time t.

Base drift was avoided by recognizing the most recent policy error:

(2)       ln( M t )  ln( M tT1,t )   t

An example of this approach can be found in the SOMC policy recommendation of

March 1975:

          We renew the recommendation made at our September meeting that the
          growth rate of money be held at 5-1/2 percent. However growth should
          not start at that rate from the current low level. We recommend that the
          money stock be brought to a level it would have reached in March 1975, if
          our policy had been followed. A one-time increase in money – currency
          and demand deposits – to $290 billion should be announced and provided
          by April 15. This increase would put money growth back on the path
          leading the economy toward full employment at lower rates of inflation
          than in recent years.41

The SOMC’s policy rule was forward looking, extending reductions in the money growth

rate into the future until a noninflationary monetary growth rate had been achieved. The

SOMC never advocated an abrupt, “cold turkey” adjustment of the monetary growth rate

to a long-run target. Instead, the policy rule was inherently gradualist, calling for

adjustments in the monetary growth rate depending on initial conditions and the historical

trend.

         Typically, SOMC recommendations advocated a 1 percentage point reduction in

the target growth rate of the money stock per year until a noninflationary rate of growth

was achieved. At that point, the policy rule called for a constant noninflationary monetary

growth rate.42

(6)      ln( M tT,t  n  k )  ln( M tT,t  n  k 1 )   , k = 1, …

For example, this approach is reflected in the policy statement of March 1978:

         One, the rate of monetary expansion in the past year was between 7% and
         7.5%. We urge that the rate be maintained at 6% in 1978.

         Two, we recommend reductions of 1% a year in the average rate of
         monetary expansion until a noninflationary rate of monetary expansion is
         achieved.43

SOMC policy statements generally specify 4 percent as the noninflationary rate of money

growth.44 We use this value in our simulation of a model of money demand discussed

below.

         Two equations are necessary for a complete specification of the SOMC policy

rule: i) a definition of velocity:

42
   The SOMC rule also permitted adjustments to monetary base growth for structural shifts in velocity.
Note that the SOMC rule differed from that of McCallum (1988), who proposes a monetary base growth
rule that responds to deviations between actual and desired growth in nominal output, as well as to long-run
shifts in velocity.

and ii) a model of the demand for money (or the monetary base).

        SOMC documents rarely articulated an explicit demand for money.45 However,

Brunner and Meltzer (1963), Meltzer (1963), and Brunner and Meltzer (1964b) present a

demand for money (or velocity) that depends on a long-term interest rate. Subsequent

research found evidence of a stable money demand relationship, at least through the

1970s.46

        The relationship between base-money velocity and a long-term nominal interest

rate is shown in Figure 1, which is adapted from Anderson and Rasche (2001). This

figure shows a scatter plot of annual data on the natural log of base velocity and the

inverse of the Aaa bond rate over the years 1919 through 2006. The years of the Great

Depression starting in 1931 and extending until 1940 are outliers, but otherwise the

relationship is highly linear. The values for the years 2000-06 are also highlighted in

Figure 1. These years are after the sample that Anderson and Rasche (2001) examined.

Note that the data for 2000-06 fall on top of the scatter from the earlier sample. Table 1,

reproduced from Anderson and Rasche (2001), shows the estimated values of the slope of

the scatter in Figure 1 over a sample period from 1919 through 1999. The estimated

equation is also augmented with an additional variable that measures the rate of default

on corporate bonds to capture the increase in risk during the Great Depression period and

the flight to currency that occurred after the first wave of bank failures in 1931. The

estimated slope of the relationship between the log of base velocity and the inverse of the

long rate is robust across estimators and invariant to the addition of the risk variable. The

lower part of the table relaxes the restriction that the income elasticity of the demand for

real base money is unity. The restriction is not rejected.

           Following the SOMC, and in light of the evidence from Anderson and Rasche

(2001), we specify the following a nonlinear demand function for base money:

(8)        ln(Vt )   1   2 (i tL ) 1

where itL is the long-term nominal interest rate.

           The noninflationary rate of money growth,  , can be defined in terms of this

model. If inflation is constant and expected to be constant, then, assuming that the

equilibrium real rate of interest is constant, the long-term nominal interest rate is also

expected to be constant. Thus, velocity is expected to be constant in this equilibrium.

The noninflationary money growth rate is then the growth rate of trend output  plus the

trend inflation rate that is defined as price stability  * . For simplicity, we assume

 *  0 . A low positive and steady trend in measured inflation could be consistent with

the SOMC’s position on price stability, although various SOMC policy statements

explicitly advocated a target of zero inflation or a stable price level.47 Under these

conditions, the number of years expected until a return to price stability under the

SOMC’s rule is n = 100*(  t   ) , and the noninflationary growth rate of money is

  .

           The model of money supply and demand can be respecified in terms of deviations

of money growth from the assumed trend growth of real output and in terms of an output

gap.

       To complete the analysis, we embed the SOMC’s policy rule and the money

Simulation of the SOMC Policy Rule for the Great Inflation

Linearized Model

         The only nonlinearity in the above model is the interest elasticity of the demand

for money. In the following analysis, we present a linearized version of the model,

recognizing that the semielasticity of money demand (  3 below) varies inversely with

the nominal interest rate. We examine the sensitivity of the model to various assumptions

about the value of this parameter.

         We define the linear operator F such that F j z t  E t z t  j . Hence,

F  j  E t z t  j  z t  j  L j z t . With this notation the five equations (1), (7'), (9), (10), and

Hence, the steady-state solution of the model is independent of  , and the only steady-

state impact that is affected by  3 is that of the price level in response to a real interest

rate shock, g t . From one steady state to another, the price level varies one-to-one with

the money stock. Across steady-state equilibria with a nonzero growth of money, both the

nominal interest rate and the inflation rate vary one-to-one with the growth rate of the

money stock. Hence, the Fisher effect holds across steady states.

        Across steady states with nonzero money growth, the only effect that depends on

the value of  is the response of real output to the change in money growth. Beginning

in 1968, monetarists consistently assumed that the long-run Phillips curve is vertical (see,

e.g., Friedman, 1968; Andersen and Carlson, 1970; Poole, 1978; Brunner and Meltzer,

1976, 1993; and Mayer, 1978), which, as noted previously, has become a standard feature

of mainstream macroeconomic models. Hence we assume   1.0 , with the result that

the steady-state impact of money growth on real output is zero.

Dynamics

         We need to calibrate the four remaining parameters to investigate the dynamics of

the model. We chose a range of values for  3 corresponding to a nominal interest rate

from 14 percent to 8 percent and assume  2 = 0.032, consistent with the estimates

reported in Table 1.48 We set  = 0.94 following Shiller (1979, Table 1, p. 1206), and we

use estimates of   0.125 and   0.025 , consistent with typical values found in the

literature adjusted to a model calibrated to annual data.49 With these assumptions we

compute the roots of the determinantal polynomial of A(F ) , which are the primary

drivers of the dynamics of the model. These roots are shown in Table 2.

For the parameter values that we have chosen, the polynomial always has one real root

that lies within the unit circle and two roots that lie outside the unit circle. At high

nominal interest rates (> 10 percent) the latter two roots are real. At lower nominal rates

these roots are complex. However, when expressed in polar coordinates, the polar angle

of the complex roots (  in Table 2) is always close to zero.50

The determinantal polynomial can be written in terms of its roots as

14) )    detA( F )    ( /(1   )   3 )r2 r3 F 1 ( F  r1 )(1  r21 F )(1  r31 F .

Assume that r2 and r3 are outside the unit circle and define the invertible polynomial

15)      R( F )    ( /(1   )   3 ) r2 r3 (1  r21 F )(1  r31 F ) ,

   The Aaa corporate rate in 1981 was 14.17%. By 1986 this rate had fallen to 7.78%.

   We thank, without implicating, Ed Nelson for helpful suggestions on values for these parameters.
50
   We computed the roots of this polynomial assuming values of  in the range of [0.96, 1.0],  in the
range of [0.005, 0.045],      in the range of [0.075, 0.145],      in the range of [0.92, 0.98] and   3
corresponding to nominal interest rates in the range of [0.08, 0.14]. In all cases, we found one real root less
than unity. The other two roots were sometimes complex, but in all cases were outside the unit circle.

16) )      detA( F )  F 1 ( F  r1 ) R( F .

Since )F 1 ( F  r1 )  (1  r1 F 1 )  (1  r1 L , the model can be rewritten as

17)        (1  r1 L)Yt  R 1 ( F ) * Adj[ A( F )] X t  B( F ) X t .51

The elements of the first column of B(F ) (coefficients of the current and expected future

money stock) for the parameter values in Table 2 are shown in Figures 2 through 4. The

low-order polynomial coefficients for the response of output and the long-term nominal

interest rate are moderately sensitive to the level of the nominal interest rate around

which the model is linearized, but the sensitivity of the higher-order coefficients in these

polynomials disappears as the coefficients rapidly approach zero. The polynomial

coefficients in the response of the price level die off much more slowly than those for

output and the long-term nominal rate and the low-order coefficients show considerable

sensitivity to the level of the nominal interest rate around which the model is linearized.

Consequently, we simulate the model with different assumptions about the value of  3

corresponding to different assumed levels for the long-term nominal interest rate.

Policy Experiments

           Clearly, if money demand is stable, prices and wages are flexible, and supply

shocks are limited, then a monetary growth rule like that advocated by the SOMC would

yield superior inflation control with less output variability than the “stop-go” policies

actually pursued by the Fed during the 1970s. Monetary policy can affect real output in

the short-run in the modern New Keynesian model, such as CGG (1999) and some other

models with nominal rigidities. We compare two policy rules for money stock growth in

the model specified above. The first experiment is the gradualist monetarist proposal of

                           1
51
     Expressions for R ( F ) are shown in Appendix 2.

the SOMC. We assume the economy is initially in a steady state with an expected

constant nominal money growth rate of 10 percent. This translates into a nominal interest

rate of 14 percent, since we assume a 4 percent equilibrium real interest rate. At some

point in time after expectations of future money growth, output, and inflation have been

set, the monetary authority surprises private agents by implementing an immediate one

percentage point reduction in the money growth rate and announcing that money growth

will be reduced by an additional one percentage point in each subsequent year until the

growth rate reaches 4 percent. We assume that the policy announcement is fully credible

so that agents adjust their expectations in future periods accordingly. The only policy

shock occurs in the first period.52

         The second policy experiment is a one-time “cold turkey” adjustment of money

stock growth. We again assume that the economy is initially in a steady-state equilibrium

with a constant nominal money growth rate of 10 percent. In this case, the monetary

authority surprises agents by implementing a one-time six percentage point reduction in

money growth and announcing that the money growth rate will be maintained at the new

value. Again, the announcement is assumed to be fully credible so that agents adjust their

expectations in future periods accordingly.

         Figure 5 shows the response of the model economy to the gradualist experiment.

With expectations set for future periods, the economy moves along a very flat short-run

Phillips curve. The inflation rate is almost unchanged in the first period, while real output

falls sharply. As a result, real money balances fall (inflation is higher than money growth)

and the long- and short-term nominal rates increase slightly. In subsequent periods, the

52
  If the policy announcement occurred before agents set their expectations, there would not be any policy
surprise, output would be unaffected, and inflation would fall in advance of the expected future reductions
in money growth.
                                                                                                           28

continued reduction in the growth rate of the nominal money stock is fully anticipated, so

the inflation rate falls in advance of the decline in money growth, as does future expected

inflation, and real balances rise. With the sharp decline in near-term expected inflation,

the short-run Phillips curve shifts down and output rises above the steady-state level. The

long-term and short-term nominal interest rates fall, but the short-term nominal rate falls

more precipitously. Adjustment to full equilibrium takes time because of the

autoregressive structure built into the model.

         The assumed credibility of the monetary policymaker’s commitment to the

announced policy is obviously a key determinant of the adjustment paths traced by our

simulations, as is our assumption of rational expectations. The time path of the economy

after the initial policy surprise depends on the announcement being accepted at face value

and expectations being adjusted accordingly.53 The SOMC frequently stressed that the

impact of a disinflationary policy depends crucially on the transparency and credibility of

the change in policy. For example, Brunner and Meltzer (1993, p. 75) note

         In our analysis, if the policy of monetary control is credible, control errors
         are perceived as transitory deviations, so they are absorbed by changes in
         interest rates at the shortest end of the yield curve. … The consequences
         differ, of course, if monetary control policies lack sufficient credibility.
         Control errors, particularly those exhibiting serial correlation, are
         interpreted partly as permanent changes.

Clearly the Fed did not have much credibility when it announced a disinflationary policy

in late 1979, and the trajectory of the economy in the early 1980s was significantly

different from that simulated here. As Brunner and Meltzer (1993, p. 75) argue,
53
   Ball (1994) analyzes a model with staggered price setting and a credible disinflation. He finds that a
gradual disinflation can produce a “boom,” defined as “an output path that rises above the natural rate
temporarily and never falls below the natural rate” (p. 286). Ball’s model differs from the one used here in
that his demand for real balances is not interest sensitive (his equation (2)) and the path of the money stock
is perfectly perceived at all points in time (he assumes that the announcement of the disinflation is made at
t=0 and that “the expectations operator can be dropped for all t  0 , because firms have perfect foresight
after the Fed’s announcement.” (p.286)
                                                                                                       29

“Experience in the United States from 1979 to 1982 is an example of the increase in

uncertainty that can result from inappropriate control procedures and operations that lack

credibility.”54

        Figure 6 shows the reaction of the model economy to the alternative policy of an

immediate reduction in money growth from 10 percent to 4 percent with a credible

announcement that it will be maintained at that rate henceforth. Again, inflation falls little

at first in response to the surprise reduction in money growth as the economy moves

along a flat short-run Phillips curve. The reduction in real balances is much larger,

however, because the instantaneous reduction in nominal money growth is much larger

than in the gradualist case (6 percent vs. 1 percent). The increase in the long-term

nominal interest rate is also much larger. In the subsequent period, assuming that the

pledge to maintain nominal money growth at the lower rate is fully credible, inflation

adjusts and overshoots the new steady-state rate, real balances increase, long-term and

short-term nominal interest rates fall, and output begins a gradual increase back to the

new steady-state equilibrium. During this adjustment period the inflation rate approaches

the steady-state rate from below, real balances continue to rise, and the long-term

nominal interest rate gradually declines to the equilibrium level.

        In sum, the transition to the steady state implied by a large, one-time reduction in

money stock growth involves a larger decline in output growth, and more variability in

inflation and output growth, than the implied by a gradual reduction in money stock



54
  Taylor (1993, p. 207) argues similarly: “In the period after a new policy rule has been put in place,
people are unlikely either to know about or understand the new policy or to believe that policymakers are
serious about maintaining it … Because expectations only gradually converge during this transition period,
the impact of the policy rule on the economy may be quite different than projected by an analysis that
assumes rational expectations.”

growth. Although our model is highly stylized, our simulations favor the gradualist

approach advocated by the SOMC over more abrupt changes in policy.55

Analysis of Sensitivity to Linearization

        The above results were derived by linearization of the money demand function at

a long-term nominal interest rate of 14 percent. It is clear from Figures 2a, 3a and 4a that

the coefficients on future expected money growth vary somewhat with the assumed value

of the interest rate (particularly the coefficients in the price equation). The values of the

autoregression coefficient in Table 2 (r(1)) also are somewhat larger, the lower the value

of the nominal rate assumed for linearization. The responses of real output growth, the

long-term nominal interest rate, and inflation are shown in Figure 7 for two experiments:

the “cold turkey” immediate reduction of money growth by 6 percent and the monetarist

gradual reduction of 1 percent per year for linearization of the model at 14 and 11 percent

nominal rates. Qualitatively the results are the same regardless which interest rate value

we use (no surprise given the coefficient values in Figures 2a, 3a, and 4a) and

quantitatively the results in each experiment are quite robust to the change in the slope

coefficient in the money demand function. With a lower assumed value of the nominal

interest rate, the peak output response in each experiment is somewhat smaller in both

experiments, but the timing of the peak and the speed of return to equilibrium are

virtually the same. The price level responses are somewhat larger when the lower interest

rate is used, but again the timing of the peak response is the same. The return to

equilibrium is somewhat faster when we use the lower interest rate value for

linearization, particularly in the gradualist experiment.

55
  Taylor (1993) notes that the presence of natural rigidities, such as long-term wage commitments, can
prevent the public from changing behavior instantly in response to a change in monetary policy, which
suggests further that transitions to a new policy rule should be gradual and announced publicly.
                                                                                            31


Shocks to a Money Growth Path: Base Drift or No Base Drift

       Our final experiment considers the impact of an unexpected deviation from the

target money growth path that i) is perfectly foreseen to return to the target path in future

periods (the no-base-drift case) or ii) is perfectly foreseen to remain for all future periods

(the base-drift case). As noted previously, the SOMC criticized the Fed’s practice of

engaging in base drift, which it considered one tactic the Fed used to evade Congress’

desire for better control of the monetary aggregates.

       The response to the no-base-drift rule is shown in Figure 8. The money growth

rate decreases to 4 percent in the period of the unexpected shock and then jumps to 16

percent in the following period to return the money stock to the target path. Real output

falls by a small amount in response to the unexpected shortfall from the target money

path and quickly reverts to equilibrium with a small overshoot. That pattern is reflected in

the deviation of the long-term rate from its equilibrium value. The inflation rate is

virtually unaffected by this shock (again the short-run Phillips curve in the model is flat),

and so the transitory deviation of money from the target path is almost perfectly reflected

in the deviation of real balances from an unchanged equilibrium value.

       In the base-drift experiment (Figure 9), money growth is reduced by 6 percent for

one period but then returns to its assumed equilibrium value of 10 percent, although the

money stock remains at 1 percent below the original target growth path. The initial

response of inflation to the unexpected shortfall in money is very small, but once the

future shortfall in money is foreseen, the inflation rate falls and only gradually returns to

the equilibrium value of 10 percent. The persistence of inflation below the equilibrium

value and below the maintained growth rate of the nominal money stock is required to
                                                                                               32

restore the value of real balances to the unchanged equilibrium value. Again, the initial

impact of the unexpected shortfall in the money stock is to reduce real output below its

equilibrium value and increase the long-term nominal rate above its equilibrium value.

Both of these variables return to their equilibrium values only gradually, given the slow

autoregressive process inherent in the structure of the model.

        A final experiment (Figure 10), allows a persistent but not permanent deviation of

the level of the money stock from the 10 percent growth path (the shock to the money

stock is assumed to decay at a rate of 50 percent per period). The growth rate of the

money stock decreases in the period of the shock, then increases to 13 percent in the

following period (deviates from 10 percent by one-half of the deviation in the no-base-

drift case), and then declines gradually to 10 percent. The deviations of real output and

the long-term nominal interest rate from their equilibrium values are quite similar to the

deviations in the no-base-drift case and do not show the persistence noted in the base-

drift experiment. Initially inflation is barely affected, although it falls below the

equilibrium 10 percent rate once the persistence of the shortfall of the money stock is

anticipated. Thus, our simulations indicate that base drift is relatively costly in terms of

increased variability of output, at least in the context of the present model.

Conclusion

        From its creation in 1973, the Shadow Open Market Committee was highly

critical of Federal Reserve policy. Throughout the Great Inflation period, the SOMC

consistently pushed for a gradual reduction in money stock growth to control inflation,

and then a policy of fixing monetary growth at a level consistent with price stability. The

views expressed by SOMC members reflected their acceptance of the natural rate
                                                                                            33

hypothesis; the value of transparent, credible, rules-based policies; and the notion that, in

the long run, inflation is determined solely by monetary policy. Such views were not

widely held within the Federal Reserve System at the time and were just beginning to

gain wide acceptance among academic economists.

       Our evaluation of the SOMC policy rule in the context of the New Keynesian

model of Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999) suggests that the gradual reduction in money

growth advocated by the SOMC would have lowered inflation with less impact on output

growth and less inflation and output variability than a large one-time reduction in money

growth. However, our simulations are based on the extreme assumption that the adoption

of a disinflation path for monetary growth is fully credible, as well as the assumption that

expectations are forward looking. As the SOMC stressed, the impact of a disinflationary

monetary policy on the real economy depends crucially on the transparency and

credibility of the change in policy. After some 15 years of “stop-go” policy, the Fed had

little credibility remaining. With that history, the public may have interpreted a large,

one-shot cut in monetary growth (similar to what the Fed actually did in October 1979) as

just another “stop” before the next “go.” By contrast, the implementation of a gradual

reduction in monetary growth (with no base drift) may have been perceived increasingly

over time as reflecting a change to a stable price regime, and thus less costly in terms of

foregone output than a “cold turkey” disinflation. Of course, without additional research,

this is simply conjecture.

       Regardless whether a gradual reduction in monetary growth would have resulted

in a smaller reduction in output than a large one-time reduction, we are convinced that the

policy rule advocated by the SOMC would have generated lower inflation, with less
                                                                                        34

foregone output, than the policies actually implemented by the Federal Reserve during

the Great Inflation. The SOMC articulated a policy based on a modern, well-thought-out

economic model. We conclude that the Shadow did, in fact, know better than the Fed.
