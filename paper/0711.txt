               Discontinuous Distributions and Missing Persons:
                     The Minimum Wage and Unemployed Youth

                                   ABSTRACT


     The effects of minimum wage legislation on the employment and wage rates

of youth are estimated using a new statistical approach. We find that with-

out the minimum, not only would the percent of out-of-school youth who are

employed be 4 to 6 percent higher than it is, but also that these youth would

earn more.   In particular, the expected hourly earnings of youth with market

wage rates below the 1978 minimum are 10 percent lower with the minimum than

they would be without it. Thus, an effect of the minimum is to increase the

concentration of non-employment among low-wage workers and to reduce their

earnings relative to higher wage workers as well. The minimum wage accounts

for possibly a third of the difference between the employment rates of black

and white youth, according to our results.

     Our methodology is based on parameterization of the effect of the minimum

on the distribution of "market" employment outcomes and market wage rates that

would exist in the absence of the minimum. A concomitant of the estimation

procedure is joint estimation of market wage and employment functions that

would pertain if there were no minimum.

         DISCONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTIONS AND MISSING PERSONS:

               THE MINIMUM WAGE AND UNEMPLOYED YOUTH

                Robert H. Meyer and David A. Wise*


     Most econometric analysis rests on the assumption that random

variables have continuous distributions. But government programs and

legislation often impose constraints on individual choice so that empiri-

cally observed distributions are discontinuous. The minimum wage has

such an effect on the distribution of observed wage rates. Most arialyss

of the effect of the minimum, however, is based on inferences from aggre-

gate data and disregards these effects. Our analysis not only accounts

explicitly for the effects of the minimum on observed distributions of

employment and wage rates, but makes these effects an integral part of

the process by which the employment and wage impacts of the minimum are

estimated.

     We have proposed a procedure that estimates the employment and wage

effects of the minimum by explicitly parameterizing the relationship be-

tween the level of the minimum wage relative to the "market" wage rates

that individuals would receive in the absence of the minimum. Indeed our

approach parameterizes both observed wage and observed employment outcomes

in terms of underlying "market" wage and "market" employment relationships.

The procedure thus estimates market wage and employment functions for

youth, neither of which may be estimated directly from observed data be-

cause whether particular data are observed empirically is determined in

part by the minimum itself. Parameter estimates are obtained by maximum

likelihood.

     A concomitant of our procedure is estimation of a market wage func-

tion that allows us to compare average market wage rates with the wage

rates of persons employed in the presence of a minimum wage, and to com-

pare market wage rates with the expected wage in the presence of the mini-

mum of all youth who would have been employed in its absence. The trun-

cation and concentration effects of the minimum on the observed distri-

bution of wages are explicitly incorporated in our statistical model.     In

addition, we are able because of the estimation of market wage and

employment functions, to compare the distribution of employment versus

non-employment by market wage rate when there is no minimum with the

distribution when a minimum exists.

     To evaluate the results of the minimum wage it is necessary to take

account of its effect on employment and its effect on wage rates. Our

procedure   provides estimates of both of these effects as a direct product
of our   estimation   procedure.
     The effect of the minimum is commonly presumed to be greater the high-

er it is relative to the distribution of wages that would be paid in

absence of a minimum. Indeed most time series and cross-section analysis

of the effects of the minimum are based on relationships between employ-

ment and the ratio of the mtnimum wage to an average or median wage, often
                                —3-




an average adult wage but sometimes the average wage paid to employed

youth. Previous studies have been based on aggregate time series data

(e.g., Gramlich [1976], Mincer [1976], and Hamermesh [1980]) or aggregate

cross-section data (e.g., Welch and Cunningham [1978], Ehrenberg and

Marcus [1979], and Cunningham [1980]).

     Our analysis differs from these approaches in at least two respects.

First, itis based on individual wage and employment data--collected in

the May 1978 Current Population Survey. Second, the estimation technique

emphasizes explicitly the relationship between the level of the minimum

wage relative to the distribution of market" wage rates that individuals

would receive in the absence of a minimum. Some persons who in the absence

of the minimum would be paid a wage below it are presumed to receive the

legal minimum, while others are presumed to go without work. Still others

because of non-coverage or non-compliance may continue to be paid below the

minimum. Our goal is to estimate the effect of the minimum wage by ex-

plicitly paranieterizing and estimating the likelihood that each of these

outcomes occurs.

     We find that persons who have market wage rates below the minimum,

in the presence of the minimum, are paid the minimum with probability

approximately .5 and lose their jobs with probability .25. Simulations

based on our estimates indicate that employment of out-of-school young

men would be 4 to 6 percent higher if the minimum were eliminated. On

average, the expected wage of youth is lower with the minimum than with-

out it. In particular, the expected wage of youth whose market wage rates

are below the minimum is approximately 10 percent lower with than without

the minimum. In addition, the concentration of non-employment among low-
                                -4-




wage workers is much more pronounced with the minimum than without it.

More succinctly, those who are paid the least without the minimum, are

hurt the most by it.

     Our model allows estimation of the primary effects of the minimum

wage as described by most researchers. In particular, we have presumed

that the effect is concentrated on persons who would otherwise be paid

below the minimum. The model as set forth in this paper does not allow,

for example, for an upward shift in the whole wage distribution because

of the minimum. Although we do not believe this to be a first-order

effect of the minimum, it is likely to occur to some extent. Under rather

plausible assumptions, however, our primary results would not be affected

by such shifts. Nonetheless, we will in future research address this

possibility directly.
     Graphs of wage distributions that serve to motivate our analysis are

presented in section I. Our procedure rests on joint estimation of mar-

ket wage and employment equations. If the disturbance terms in these

two equations are uncorrelated, however, the basic parameters of the model

may be estimated from a likelihood function based on the conditional dis-

tribution of observed wage rates only.1 For expository purposes, we shall

first present in section II this simple model and parameter estimates based

on it, without explicitly deriving it as a special case of the two-equa-

tion model. This allows the reader to understand the approach in a

relatively uncomplicated context that is directly motivated by the graphs




      1. As it   turns out, this single-equation conditional wage distribution
model is similar to the specification used by Hausman and Wise [1981] to
correct for endogenous sampling with a continuous outcome variable.
                                —5—




in Section I.

     Then the more complete model based on joint estimation of a market

wage function together with a market employment function is presented in

section III, together with empirical results based on it. This estimation

procedure uses all available information on employment status and wage

rates and is not restricted to observations with observed wage rates,

unlike the simple model. And in this section, the single equation model

is derived as a special case of the more general model. For expository

purposes, some of the shortcomings of the simple model are explained for

the first time in this section. Indeed for this reason some readers

may wish to read the first part of this section before section II. The

basic results of the empirical analysis are presented in section IV in the

form of simulations. Concluding remarks and discussions are included in

section V.

I.   Empirical Wage Distributions

     To motivate our analysis, we have graphed the empirically observed

wage distributions for selected groups of youth.

     The graphs are in the form of histograms with breaks at 25 cent inter-

vals. For convenience, one break is at the 1978 minimum wage of $2.65.

For most groups, there is a substantial discontinuity in the distribution

at this point and it can be easily identified. To facilitate comparison

among groups, the histogram includes in the wage interval .9O to 1.15 all

persons with wage rates below 1.15 and in the interval 5.90 to 6.15 all

persons with wage rates above 5.90. Thus apparent concentration in these

intervals must be interpreted accordingly. If the entire distribution

were graphed, the graph would approach zero gradually at both tails.

      One of the presumptions underlying our analytic approach is that

the minimum wage should have a greater impact in low-wage than in high—

wage areas. This idea seems intuitively confirmed by comparison of Figures

1 and 2 in the text. The first shows the distribution for non-students 16

to 24 in the states with the lowest quintile of average adult wage rates;

the second shows the distribution in states where the average adult wage

rate is in the highest quintile. The distributions in both areas show a

substantial discontinuity at the minimum, but it is clear that the impact

of the minimum on the observed distribution of wage rates is much greater

in the low wage areas.

      We also presume that the minimum wage should impinge more on youth

whose personal attributes are associated with lower earnings than on

youth whose personal attributes are associated with higher earnings. For
                                —7-




example, older youth with more schooling we assume would be most likely to

have wage rates (possibly marginal products) above the minimum wage and

thus not be affected substantially by it. This proposition is consistent

with the distribution presented in Figure 3.   Figure 3 shows the wage

distribution for non-student youth 20 to 24 in high—wage areas with 14

years or more schooling. The effect of the minimum is barely apparent

in this distribution.

     Comparison of the distributions in Figures 4 and 5 for youth 16 to

17 versus 20 to 24 respectively provides further evidence that is also

consistent with plausible intuition. Our intuition suggests that persons

with attributes associated with low wages should be most affected by the

minimum. The graphs strongly support this expectation.

     Although these distributions help to motivate our subsequent analysis

and in general are consistent with intuition, it is not clear from the

graphs what the employment effect of the minimum is.   It seems clear that

one result is a concentration of wage rates at the minimum, but whether

the apparent increase to the minimum of the wage rates of some youth is

offset by non-employment of others cannot be inferred from the graphs;

thus the motivation for our estimation technique.

     There is also another consideration that may be obscured in the graphs,

but to which our analysis is directed. For example, the distributions

for whites 16 to 24 and for blacks 16 to 24 (neither of which is shown)

appear quite similar. But the distributions pertain to employed youth in

both groups. Differences between the attributes of employed black and

white youth may not be as great as between the attributes of all youth in

II.   A Simple Approach

      Although we shall ultimately obtain estimates based on the joint

distribution of observed wage rates and employment status of youth, for

expository purposes we shall begin with a model that is based on observed

wage rates only. This allows a development that may be intuitively

motivated by the empirical wage distributions shown in section I. And it

allows us to set forth in a simple context the rationale behind our

approach. Then we shall detail a model that treats employment and wage

outcomes jointly, a special case of which is the model set forth here.


A. The Model

      Consider a group of youth characterized by a vector of measured

attributes X. The elements of X include individual measures such as

education and age, and also area specific indicators of labor market

conditions. Suppose that in the absence of a minimum wage, the distri-

bution in the population of wages paid to employed persons with attributes

X would be described by the density function f(X); we shall refer to it as

the 'underlying" or market distribution of wages. Graphically, think of

it as the solid line in Figure 6.

                              M                                  w,W


                                    Figure 5
                                     -1 5-




     Now suppose that the minimum wage is set at level M. Some persons

will continue to be paid a wage below the minimum because they work in

non-covered sectors of the economy or on jobs that are not subject to

the minimum. And indeed there may be some shifting of employment from

covered to non-covered sectors and jobs. Others may be paid below the

minimum because of non-compliance. For whatever reason, the net result

is that some persons with an underlying wage below the minimum will

continue to be hired at a wage below M. To allow for this possibility,

we suppose that there is a probability P1 that persons with an under-

lying wage below M will receive a wage below this level. (We have not

allowed P1 to depend on the precise value of the underlying wage.)

     We also suppose that some persons with an underlying wage below the

minimum would after its introduction be paid at the minimum.' Although

a simple application of marginal productivity theory would imply that

persons with an underlying wage below M, would not receive M, there are

several possible explanations for such a possibility. One is that employers

may pay the minimum to persons they would otherwise pay less than the mini-

mum, but hire fewer or hire them for fewer hours. Whereas without the

minimum, a young person may be hired on a permanent basis for eight hours

each Saturday, if the youth must be paid the minimum, he may be hired for

fewer hours to do only those tasks at which he is most productive. Employers

may, for example be less prepared to pay for "slack time."2



     1. Welch and Cunningham (1978) impose an extreme form of this
assumption, that is, that all persons with market wage rates below
the minimum are paid the minimum when it is in effect.

     2. Hall (1979) develops this point within a framework based
on the theory of employment contracts.
                                    —16—



    Another possibility is that since the minimum wage applies only to

compensation paid directly to an employee, employers can vary the level of

non-wage compensation (e.g., on-the-job training or fringe benefits) to

offset changes in direct compensation. Individuals with market wages below

the minimum may be raised to the minimum in exchange for a comparable

reduction in on-the-job training expenditures and fringe benefits. Individ-

uals with market wages above the minimum will be unaffected.1

    Another explanation is that employers hire at the minimum persons

who would otherwise be hired at wage rates below the minimum, but offset

this overpayment with slower wage increases--say, with age for example--

than would be observed without the minimum.2

     In addition, employers may find it difficult to identify differences

in the quality of young workers, particularly in view of the high turnover

in youth employment and the absence of an extensive employment history.

If only because of this lack of precision, employers to comply with the

legislation may raise to the minimum the wage rates of some employees who

would otherwise receive an underlying wage below M. Whatever the reason

we suppose that with probability P2, a person with an underlying wage

below the minimum will be employed and paid the minimum.

     Those with an underlying market wage below the minimum who are not

hired at a wage below M or who are not hired at M are assumed to be without

work after the introduction of the minimum. The probability that these



     1. See Mincer and Leighton [1980] for an analysis of the effects
of the minimum wage on investment in on-the-job training. Wessels [1980]
examines the theoretical aspect of the minimum wage in a model that
includes fringe benefits.

     2. Lazear [1980] has investigated this possibility, but did not
find much empirical support for it.
                                —17-



persons would be without work because of the minimum is 1 —        -
                                                              P1       P2.

We assume that the minimum wage does not affect the wages received by

youth whose underlying wage is above the minimum. Although it is some-

times argued that the minimum wage tends to shift upward the whole

distribution of wage rates, we believe that our model captures the primary

postulated effects of the minimum.1

       These ideas can be described more formally as follows. Suppose that

the expected underlying wage of individuals with measured personal and

regional attributes X is given by X and that the variance of wage rates

among persons with characteristics X is a2. This gives rise to a wage

distribution f(W) like that shown in Figure 6. That is,


 (1)
                                 W =   X   +


where c is a disturbance term with variance a2

       With a minimum wage M, wage rates may be distributed as represented

graphically by the dotted function in Figure 6. The form of this

function depends on the values of P1 and P2. For example, if P2 were

zero, there would be no pile-up of wages at M, only a jump in the density

function at M. If both P1 and P2 were zero, the density function would

be truncated at M.



     1.  In addition, we have not allowed P1 or P2 to depend--for persons
with market wage rates below M--on the difference between the market wage
and the minimum, although in principle we think that they would. We
believe, however, that our estimates of P1 and P2 are good estimates of
the average values that would be obtained if som@what more realistic
assumptions were incorporated in our statistical analysis. Indeed, this
conclusion is supported by estimates obtained by dividing the market
distribution below the minimum into two intervals and estimating P1 and
   values for each interval.

show below its derivation from a model treating wage rates and employment

jointly--may be arrived at by assuming that a random sample is drawn from

the underlying distribution of market wage rates. Then, of the values

below M, some are set to M (with probability P2), while others are discarded

served wage rates in terms of the underlying distribution f. The denomin-

ator D may be thought of as a normalizing factor assuring that the density

function integrates to 1. One can also think of h(w) as the conditional

distribution of wages, given that a wage is observed.1 The other elements

of the function may be explained in the following way. A value of W <                           M


will be observed with likelihood P1 times the likelihood of an underlying

wage W = w.         The likelihood of an observed wage at the minimum (1 cent

served wage rate in the absence of the minimum will also have one after
the introduction of the minimum. Or it is the probability that a person
who is employed without the minimum will also be employed with, the minimum.

interval) is equal to the likelihood of an underlying wage at the minimum,

plus the probability that the underlying wage is below the minimum but is

raised to the minimum. Observed wage rates above the minimum follow the

distribution of the underlying wage, except that a larger proportion of

observed than of underlying wages may be above the minimum, as indicated

by the denominator D.

       For convenience, we shall consider the minimum wage to be an inter-

val (it may be arbitrarily small, say 1 cent), going from M1 to M2. We

shall also assume that W, or a transformation of W(e.g., in W) is dis-

tributed normally. Then if            is taken to be a standardized normal distri-

bution function, h(w) is given by

specification because it allows us conveniently to test the sensitivity

      Suppose that among N persons with observed wage rates, N1 are below

M, N2 are "at M and, N3 are above M. For these N persons indexed by

i, the log-likelihood of the realized observations would be

with the specification of h(w) for each group taken from equation (3).

This function is maximized with respect to ,               a,    P1 and P2.




     1.  Following standard practice, the log of wages is used as the
dependent variable in our wage model. Since our results are likely to
be sensitive to this distributional assumption, we have also experimented
with other transformations of wages, in particular the Box-Cox transfor-
mation:


                                        wAl
                                  =


                                        log w     if X =    U


We find that the predicted nonemployment resulting from the minimum
wage is least when wages are assumed to be log normal (i.e.,X    0)
and greatest when nominal wages are assumed to be normally distributed
(i.e., x = 1).  Estimates of the empirical distribution of wage rates
compared with the predicted distribution based on the log normal
density are presented below.

1. Comparison with Least Squares Results

       Estimates of the parameters in equation (3) for a sample of all out-

of-school young men and women aged 16 to 24 are shown in Table 1. To serve

as an informal check for general consistency of our results with the assump-

tions motivating our model, we have also compared our wage function parameter

estimates with least squares estimates. We shall not emphasize the empirical

significance of the estimates in this section; they are treated as illustra-

tive. Following the discussion of these results, we will compare estimates

based on our model for selected subgroups of youth.           Simulated effects of

the minimum on the employment of these subgroups are presented in section IV.

       Recall that a concomitant of our procedure is to estimate the "market"

wage of an individual given his attributes. We suppose that the youth whose

wage rates we measure are only a portion of those who would have measured

wage rates in the absence of the minimum. In particular, some persons who

would otherwise be employed and thus have an observed market wage below the

minimum do not have an observed wage rate. We proceeded as though our

sample were drawn from a group that, in the absence of the minimum, would

have measured wages, but if an individual had a market wage less than M,

the observation was retained, assigned the value M, or thrown out with
                                    -        respectively.1
probabilities P1, P2, and 1 - P1        P2

       Consider first the wage function parameter estimates, the s's. To

motivate the relationship between our estimates and the least squares re-

sults, we have graphed in Figure 7 the hypothesized market relationship



      1. We did not constrain by functional form P1 + P2 to be less than 1.

                                              Average Area Wage

                                 Figure 7

between average area wage rates and youth wages.

       With the establishment of the minimum wage at M, some persons who

would be employed and have observed market wage rates below M are not

employed and thus not in the sample, while others have wage rates equal

to M; some remain employed with wage rates below M. Thus as shown by the

dashed line in Figure 7, if the minimum had the hypothesized effect on

employment, least squares estimates would underestimate the relationship

between average area wage rates and the underlying market wage.'

       We see from Table 1, that this is indeed the case. Our estimates

of the coefficient on area wage is 22 percent higher than the least squares

estimate. Similar expectations and estimated results apply to other variables.



     1. This truncated distribution result is similar to the case dis-
cussed by Hausman and Wise [1977], in which the truncation was complete and
at the upper end of the distribution.
                                  -24-



For example, our schooling coefficient is 28 percent    higer    than the least

squares estimate; our coefficient on age is 28 percent higher.         Apparent-

ly persons from low wage areas and with personal attributes that are assoc-

iated with lower market wages tend either to be excluded from the sample or

to have wage distributions with concentrations at the minimum.'

     And our estimatedvalues of P1 and P2 are consistent with the relation-

ship between our estimated slope parameters and least squares estimates.

Our estimated value of P1 (.231) indicates the 23 percent of persons with

market wages below the minimum continue to be employed at wages below M,

while the estimate of P2 (.338) indicates that 34 percent of this group re-
                                                                 -         of those
ceive wages equal to the minimum. Thus 43 percent (1 -      P1       P2)
who have market wages below the minimum and would otherwise be employed are

not employed, according to these estimates.

     We would   also expect--based on   Figure 7 for example-- that given

characteristics X, the variance of observed wage rates would be lower than

the variance of market wage rates, and our estimates are consistent with

this intuition. Our estimate of the standard error of wage rates (a) is

.335 while the least squares estimate is .296.

     Because our methodology emphasizes the interaction between an individ-

ual's market wage and the impact of the minimum--in particular that the effect

will be greater on workers with lower market wages--we also emphasize the

substantial estimated effects of race and sex on market wage rates. Hold-

ing the other variables constant, women earn 22 percent less than men and



      1.  Estimates for subgroups (not shown) are also consistent with this
 expectation. For youth 16 to 17, who have relatively low market wages, our
 estimated area wage coefficient of .065 is 1.6 times as large as the least
 squares estimate of .040. For women 16 to 24 our estimate is 2.7 times as
 large as the least squares estimate (.049 versus .018 respectively).

blacks 7 percent less than whites. These estimates suggest that we should

predict a greater impact of the minimum on women and blacks than on white men.

     Union members in this age group according to our estimates have a

"market' wage 37 percent higher than non—union youth, holding other attri-

butes constant. The wage rates of most union members are well above the

minimum. Youth working part-time earn 19 percent less than those working

full-time.

     In the subsequent analysis we have eliminated the union and part-time

variables because they are essentially endogenous. Both union and member-

ship and part-time work are likely to depend in part on education and age,

for example, and part-time at least may indeed be affected by the minimum

wage. These variables also are available only for persons who are employ-

ed and would thus have to be inferred in the two-equation model described

below. To limit the number of variables in the model, we also have elimin-

ated the three regional dummies. In general, we found that regional effects--

other than for the West--were not significantly different from zero after

inclusion of the area wage and unemployment variables.


2. Estimates for Selected Groups of Men

     Parameter estimates for selected groups of out-of-school male youth

are shown in Table 2. The estimates for each group are based on all the

observations in the survey that are in that group. Of most interest are

the values for P1 and P2. For all male youth between 16 and 24, the

estimates indicate that approximately 32 percent of persons who would have

jobs with market wages below the minimum are excluded from employment by

the minimum. Black youth are somewhat more likely than whites to be

excluded--38   percent versus 29 percent.1 According to these estimates,

differential effects of the minimum on these groups arise both from

differences among the groups in market wage rates, dependent on the

personal characteristics X, and differences in the probability of being

hired given a market wage rate below the minimum.

      The estimates for 16 to 24 year old black and white youth together

imply that on average blacks earn 11 percent less than whites with the

same measured characteristics (the coefficient on the black variable is

-.107), For the younger group, however, the estimated black versus white

effect is zero.

      The estimates of P1 and P2 also differ by age group. Teenagers with

market wages below the minimum are more likely than youth 20 to 24 to be

hired at these wage rates. Differences in the jobs held by the two

groups relative to the minimum wage legislation coverage we believe to

be a likely explanation for this finding. We cannot rule out differences

in compliance rates, however.

      On the other hand, teenagers who would otherwise be hired at market

rates less than the minimum are slightly more likely than 20 to 24 year

olds to be hired at the minimum. One explanation is that according to

our estimates the variance of underlying market rates is smaller for

 teenagers than for older young persons.   Thus among out-of-school teen-

 agers, market rates below the minimum are bunched closer to the minimum



      1.  It is possible that the black youth are less likely than whites
 to be hired at the minimum--if their market wage rates are below the
 minimum--because the expected value of market wage rates below the
 minimum is lower for blacks than for whites, and for this reason their
 wage rates less likely to be raised to the minimum.

than are the sub-minimum market rates of older youth. It also seems

probable to us that given measured characteristics X, sub-minimum market

wage rates are more likely among older workers than among teenagers to

be associated with poor employee attributes. If this were true, pre-

sumably employers would be less willing to "take a chance" with older work-

ers and hire them at the minimum.

     In sum, these estimates indicate that approximately 32 percent of men

16 to 24 with market wage rates below the minimum are without work because

of it. Contrary to our expectation at least, our estimates imply that

less than 20 percent of 16 to 17 year olds with market wage rates below the

minimum are displaced by it.


3. An Empirical versus a Predicted Distribution

     Unlike most more traditional methods of analysis, the distributional

assumptions play a key role in our work. It has become standard practice

to assume that wage functions are log-normal, and the results reported

above are based on a log-normal distribution as well. However, to check

the sensitivity of our results to this assumption and to determine a "best"

fit, we also experimented with other distributions, using a Box-Cox trans-

formation of wage rates.1

     A comparison of the empirical distribution of wage rates by interval for

all male youth 16 to 24 versus the predicted distribution based on the log-

normal wage distribution is shown in Figure 8.   It appears from the graph

that the fit is quite close, especially at the tails where alternative



     1. See footnote 1, page 15.
                                         -30-




distributions are likely to give different results. Thus if we can fit

the tails in particular, we have added confidence in our results. The

actual percentages below the minimum, at the minimum (interval), and

above $5.90 are 4.9, 15.6, and 21.1 respectively; the predicted percent-

ages are 5.0, 16.1, and 18.8. No continuous distribution, of course, can

capture precisely the pile-up of wage rates at "magnet" values like $3.00,

$4.00, or $5.00.

     A somewhat some formal way to measure the fit is to calculate a chi-

square statistic based on the differences between the empirical and predicted

frequencies within the intervals. The statistic:


                      =
                           J
                                (n
                                     -
                                          )2
                          j=l


(where n is the number of observations in the th interval, and J is the

number of intervals) has a chi-square distribution with N-(J -   1   + K) degrees

of freedom, where K is the number of parameters estimated in our model.

Among a wide range of distributions that we tried, the log-normal gives

the smallest chi—square value. It is very much smaller than the chi-square

value based on the assumption of normality for example (286.1 versus

548. 7).

 III. A More Complete Model: Employment and Wages

      The results of the simple model are based only on the distribution

 of wage rates among youth who reported an hourly wage rate (plus a small

 number of youth for whom we could calculate a wage from reported weekly

earnings and hours). Among the 24,305 youth 16 to 24 included in the

May 1978 Current Population Survey, the distribution by employment and

hourly versus salaried workers is as follows:



                        Category                       Percent

                Total                          100.0

                Not Employed                   41.3

                Employed-Salaried               19.6         100.0
                  Salary Reported                            57.6
                  Salary Not Reported                        42.4

                Employed-Hourly                39.1          100.0

                  Wage Reported                                  90.7
                  Wage Not Reported                               9.3


The estimates in Section II were based on the distribution of wages among

sub—groups of out-of-school youth with reported waç'e rates.'

     The data, however, contain much more information than wage rates. In

particular, they contain information on employment status. Although it is

plausible under our assumptions to base estimates only on the wage data and

from them to infer employment effects, it is clear that more robust estimates

could be obtained by combining the wage data with the information on employ-

ment status. Intuitively, it appears that the addition of employment data

                                  -33-



should make the estimates less dependent on distributional assumtions.

In using both employment and wage data, we must also account for those

youth who are employed, but for whom we do not have a reported wage.

      We will show that the single equation model is a special case of

this more general model and is a correct model if the disturbance terms

in the wage and employment equations are uncorrelated. But in this model,

a zero correlation does not mean that employment and wage equations can

be estimated separately with no loss of information. Indeed a market

employment equation cannot be estimated without considering a wage function

as well. And estimating the two equations jointly provides additional

information on wage rates, even with a zero correlation. As usual, the

use of more information constrains the parameter estimates to reflect more

empirical fact and to this extent provides better estimates, but in this

case the information does not "separate" as might be expected on the basis

of experience with more standard models.


A. A Two-Equation Model

      In addition to an underlying wage distribution that would exist in

the absence of the minimum wage, we shall incorporate explicitly an

lying employment relationship. Again, it is useful to think of a group of

individuals with measured attributes X. Suppose that in the absence of a

minimum wage, the employment and wage relationships would be of the form



                      E = Xc +

(5)                   w=x+
                      R   probability of a reported

      For expository purposes we shall pause for a moment and consider a

diagram that relates the values of E, W, and R to the possible outcomes

in the presence of a minimum wage, as shown in Figure 9. The entries with-

in the diagram pertain to outcomes with a minimum wage. The notation on

the top and bottom outside margins of the diagram pertain to underlying

 values of the employment and wage variables.          On the right outside margin

 schematically included in the shaded area.           (This was the group used in

 the procedure described in Section II. From this group we estimated P1

 and P2.) The remaining group we observe to be employed but we don't ob-

 serve their wage rates. Our goal then is to describe the probability of

 the possible outcomes.

     To do this we assume that E and W (a transformation of the wage rate)

are distributed bivariate normal. To facilitate computation--and we be-

lieve without appreciably altering the results--we suppose, as noted above,

that the unmeasured determinants of the underlying employment and wage

equations on the one hand and the unmeasured determinants of whether a

wage is reported on the other, are not correlated. This allows us to pro-

ceed with a bivariate instead of a trivariate distribution) For the ease

of exposition we have only specified two relationships in equation (5). We

might more formally have added a third, say S = XS +                             where an employed

worker has an observed wage if S > 0.                       If    is uncorrelated with           and

s2, however, expressions like Pr(E >                   0,    W   w, S >     0) can be written as
Pr(E >   0,   W =   w)Pr(S        >   0).      Our assumptions lead to expressions like these

and rather than carry the third equation throughout the analysis, we have

suppressed it, simply lettinq R indicate the probability of a reported

hourly wage. (Extension of this reasoning demonstrates also that if

  and E2      are   uncorrelated, then consistent estimates of P1 and P2 and

the parameters of the market wage function are obtained by the procedure

used in Section II. We shall return to this.)

is given by the probability of not being employed without the minimum,

Pr[E <   0];   plus the probability that without the minimum he would be

employed at a wage below M, times the probability that he is not employed

below the minimum or at the minimum (1 -                                         -

 where 0 is as defined in equation (2). The distribution of observed wage

 rates, conditional on observing a wage, can be derived by dividing equations

(9,ii), (9,iii), and (9,iv), by (10). This gives the same result as equation (2)

 in Section II describing h(w), since the expression R.[Xa] multiplies

each term in the numerator and denominator of each of the three parts of

the conditional density function (and cancels out). Thus, given our

assumptions, consistent estimates can be obtained from the single equation

model if p =   0.
     There is no analagous employment equation that does not depend on the

wage function, however. Thus even though p =       0,   estimation of the two

equations jointly provides information that cannot be duplicated by

estimating each separately.

B. Estimates Based on the Two—Equation Model

     Parameter estimates for the two-equation model based on all out-of-

school young men 16 to 24 and for those 20 to 24 are presented in Table 3.

They may be compared with the single equation estimates in the first and

fourth columns of Table 2. The sample used in the single equation estima-

tion can be thought of as contained in but comprising only part of the data

used in the two-equation estimation. The sample of all men in the 16 to

24 age group, within which the 3005 with an hourly wage rate were included,

is distributed by employment category as follows:


          Category                      Percent       Number

          Total                   100.0                5997
          Not Employed             15.4                 926

          Employed                 84.6      100.0     5071
             Wage Rate Known                  59.3     3005
             Wage Rate Unknown               40.7      2066



For those 20 to 24 only, the distribution is:


                                        Percent       Number

          Total                   100.0                4278
          Not Employed             12.7                 542

          Employed                 87.3     100.0      3736
             Wage Rate Known                  57.0     2131

             Wage Rate Unknown               43.0      1605


     The estimates of p in Table 3 for both the 16 to 24 and the 20 to

24 age groups are essentially zero. This in itself would suggest, under

our assumptions, that the single-equation estimates should be approximately

of the correct order of magnitude, although the simulated results using

both salary and hourly workers may differ from those based on hourly wage

workers only. The two-equation estimates for P1 and P2 don't differ great-
                                                       .23 and .53 versus
ly from the single-equation counterparts--.27 versus

.45 respectively for the 16 to 24 age groups and .27 versus .23 and .46

versus .45 for those 20 to 24. Recall that the single equation estimates

are based only on hourly wage workers.   The two-equation model incorporates

both hourly and salaried workers--for whom we do not have a wage rate--

and we assume that the same wage function and P1 and P2 values apply to

both groups. The impact of the minimum on salaried workers may well differ

from the effect on wage workers; the information we have on the salaried

group is apparently too weak to verify this.1




      1. Because there is a large potential error in hourly wage rates
                                                 hours worked, much of the
 estimated by using reported salaries and normal
 precision of actual wage rates is lost. The wage distributions for salar-
 ied workers that we generated using the ratio of salaries to hours, how-
 ever, suggest that salaried workers with market wages below the minimum
                                                                        the
 may be more likely than comparable hourly workers to be employed below
 minimum, and less likely to be employed at the minimum.

 IV. Simulations
      We shall present first simulations based on the single-equation

 model and then additional ones based on the two-equation specification.

 The single—equation version is somewhat easier to work with and, because

 the relevant parameter estimates do not differ greatly from one to the

 other, we have presented some details that could be obtained based on the

 two-equation estimates but were not. Although the estimated employment im-

 pact of the minimum varies somewhat depending on the model, the general

 implications do not. Some results, however, are impossible to infer from

the single-equation estimates only. Such results are presented in the

second part of this section. In particular, we are able to infer the

distribution of non-employment by market wage rate, with and without the

minimum.


A. Simulations Based on the Single-Equation Model

     From the estimates in Table 1 we may by simulation obtain estimates

of the effects of the minimum wage on the employment and wage rates of

these youth. These estimates are summarized in the tabulation below.      The

simulations use all observations used in estimation and allow for weighting

of these observations depending on the likelihood that an individual with

attributes X who would have been employed with the minimum is not observed

with a wage because of the minimum. The numbers thus pertain to hourly

ge workers only. All of the estimates pertain to 1978 as well. Thus

the implication of lowering the minimum, for example, from $2.65 to $2.30

should be thought of in terms of 1978 dollars. The simulation methodology

is explained in detail in Appendix A.

     of all persons who
     would have been
     employed without
     minimum




          If there were no minimum wage, according to row 1, the number of

     male youth between 16 and 24 with jobs would be 6.8 percent higher than

     it is (1978) now.    It would be only 3.6 percent higher for those 20 to

     24 and 9.5 percent higher among those 16 to 17.

          Around the level of the minimum wage, the estimates of employment

     elasticities with respect to changes in the minimum are approximately

     20 percent, but are considerably lower for the older group. Our

     methodology allows the elasticity to vary depending upon the level of

     the minimum relative to the underlying distribution of wage rates. Thus
                                  -45-




 while standard estimates require that a single estimated elasticity

 be used to extrapolate employment effects for all levels of the minimum,

 our procedure allows the employment effect of an incremental change in

 the minimum to depend on its level. The closer the minimum is to the

 central tendency of the wage distribution, the greater the elasticity.

 A comparison of the elasticities for 20 to 24 and 16 to 17 year olds

 reveals this property. The minimum wage is much lower than the central

 tendency of the wage distribution of the older youth but above the

 central tendency of the wage rates of the younger group.

      Our estimates suggest that reductiorin the minimum would have

 relatively large effects down to about $2.00; but are close to zero

 below $1.50. For the group as a whole, the estimated marginal effects

 on employment of successive reducttons in the mtnimum are as follows:


                       -
                                         Percent Increase
                     Reduction           in Employment

                  $2.65 to 2.30                2.6

                   2.30 to 2.00                1.8

                   2.00 to 1.70                1.2

                   1.70 to 1.50                0.5




     At a minimum of $1.50, our simulations indicate that the expected

wage of youth ($4.07) is approximately equal to the estimated expected

market wage of $4.05. As shown above, at about $1.50 further reduction

in the minimum would have virtually no effect on employment.
                                 -46-



     The fourth row of the tabulation on page 44 shows the expected wage

of those employed, given the existinq minimum. By comparison of the fifth

and sixth rows, it can be seen that because some youth who would be employ-

ed in the absence of the minimum are not employed, the expected wage of the

total group that would have been employed without the minimum is lower with

it than without it. The expected market wage of the total group is shown

in row 6. The increase of wages of some youth from below the minimum up

to the minimum is more than offset by non-employment (zero wages) of others.

The average difference is 9 cents per hour.1

     The expected market wage of $2.49 for the 16 to 17 age group is well

below the minimum wage of $2.65. To the extent that this figure is accept-

ed, it is not surprising that the estimated employment effect is relative-

ly large for this group.

     According to our model, the wage effects are concentrated on

persons who would otherwise be paid below the minimum. Thus for these

sub-minimum workers, the loss in expected wages is greater than indicated

by the numbers above. For all youth with sub-minimum market wages,

the expected wage is 10 percent lower with than without the minimum

($2.06 versus $1.83). The loss is 9.1 percent for whites ($2.08 versus

$1.89) and 13.1 percent for blacks ($1.98 versus $1.72). It is 14.3 percent

for teenagers 16 and 17 ($2.17 versus $1.86). Only for older youth 20




     1. The estimates in rows 4, 5, and 6 were obtained by estimating
logarithm values first and then converting these to absolute values. Thus
there may be some error because of the non-linearities involved, but we
believe that the relative magnitudes are not affected substantially.
                                          -47-




     to 24 is there essentially no effect of the minimum wage on the expected

    wage of sub-minimum wage workers (an estimated gain of 2.4 percent).

          Finally, we have applied the parameter estimates based
                                                                     on hourly wage
    workers to all those employed, both hourly and salaried. This allows us to

    estimate the total number of out-of-school young men that would be employ-

    ed if the minimum were eliminated. For the total group, we can also compare

    observed employment ratios with simulated ratios without the minimum.

    These values are given, by selected subgroups, in the tabulation below.

         It is often argued that the minimum wage has a greater effect on black

    than on white youth employment,
                                        presumably because of the lower levels of
    education and other wage related attributes among black youth. Our results

    are consistent with this claim. That is, according to these
                                                                     estimates,
    if the minimum were eliminated, employment
                                                  among black youth would be in-
    creased by 12 percent, while employment of white youth would be increased

    by only 5 percent. Nonetheless, only 30 percent of the difference between

    the employment ratios of black and white youth is due to the minimum, accord-

    ing to our estimates.

B. Simulations based on the Two-Equation Model

     Simulations based on the two-equation model for young men 16 to 24 are

shown in the tabulation below. The tabulation shows the simulated distributions

of the 5997 persons in our sample, with and without the minimum. Of

persons with market wage rates below the minimum, who without the minimum

are employed, 20 percent (180) are without work with the minimum. Accord-

ing to these simulations, elimination of the minimum would increase total

employment among young men by 3.6 percent. (The percent employed would

increase from 84.6 percent to 87.5 percent.) The single-equation model

based on 3005 hourly wage employees only implied that their number would

be increased by 6.8 percent, if the minimum were eliminated. The single-

equation wage model when applied to all 5066 employed persons (i.e.,
                                  -49-




hourly and salaried workers) predicts an increase of 6.6 percent, as com-

pared with 3.6 percent based on the two-equation model. It is to be ex-

pected that because a smaller proportion of salaried than hourly workers

have market wages below the minimum, the percentage effect on both groups

would be smaller than on hourly workers only. The difference between the

two-equation and single—equation results, however, is apparently due only

in small part to this fact.

     There are other characteristics of the simulations that we find strik-

ing. Without a minimum, among youth with market wages below the minimum,

16 percent would not be employed, while of those with market wage rates a-

bove the minimum, 12 percent would not be employed. With the minimum, 32

percent of the sub-minimum wage group are not employed. Thus the results

suggest that low wage workers would be disproportionately without work in

either case, but the minimum wage magnifies substantially the difference

between the employment rates of the two groups. Without a minimum, only

23 percent of non-employment is accounted for by those with sub-minimum

market wages, while with the minimum this group accounts for 38 percent of

non-employment.

     It is of course impossible to infer these results without jointly

estimating the wage and employment equations together. We need both

market employment and market wage estimates, neither of which can be esti-

mated without taking account of the effect of the minimum itself on each

of them.

Employment among this age group, if the minimum were eliminated, would be

3.7 percent higher that it is--91.0 percent instead of 87.3 percent--

3ccording to these estimates. (For this age group, virtually the same

estimate is obtained by applying the single-equation parameter estimates

to all employed young men, both hourly and salaried.)   And again, we ob-

serve that the minimum tends to increase the concentration of non-employ-

ment among low-wage youth. Without the minimum, the estimated 12.4 percent

of those with below-minimum market wages who are not employed account for

only 15.4 percent of non-employment, while with the minimum the 40.3 per-

cent of the sub-minimum group who are not employed account for 37.1 per-

cent of those withoutwork.

V.   Discussion and Conclusions

      Our results imply that if there were no minimum wage, the number of

out-of-school young men who are employed would be 4 to 6 percent higher

than it is now. Among hourly workers, the effect is apparently the

largest. Possibly one-half of the potential increase in employment could

be gained by a 15 percent decrease in the minimum. Although the potential

percentage increase in employment is greater for younger than for older

youth, more older youth are employed. In 1978, for example, there were

601,000 employed males 16 and 17 who were not in school, and 6,735,000

male students 20 to 24. Thus a 9.5 percent increase for those 16 to 17

(from our single-equation results) would be 57,000, whereas a 3.6 percent

increase for 20 to 24 year olds would be 242,000. These data apply to

out-of-school youth, however, and most youth 16 to 17 are in school.

      Our estimates imply also that the likelihood that a male non-student

youth 16 or 17 with a market wage below the minimum is employed at or

below the minimum is greater than the likelihood for older workers--.85

versus .69. Thus for example, whether a youth minimum is desirable, as

opposed say to a reduction in the minimum, depends on the goals of the

reduction. The effect on individuals of different ages may not be the

same as the aggregate effects by age group.

      The average wage paid to youth according to our estimates is lower

with the minimum than it would be without it. Although those youth who

are employed earn more on average than they would without the minimum,

the increase for these youth is more than offset by the non-employment

of others. Thus those least well-off without the minimum bear a
                                  —52—




disproportionate share of the cost of the minimum wage legislation.

Because increases in wage rates come to a large extent with work

experience, reduced work experience when young results in substantially

reduced wage rates when older. Thus the total effect of the minimum

on these low-market-wage workers is likely to be greater than the effect

implied by the point-in-time estimates reported in the paper.

      There are, of course, several possible effects of the minimum wage

that our analysis does not address. We have set forth a model that we

believe captures the primary postulated effects of the minimum wage as

they are described by most researchers. In particular, we have assumed

that the effect would be concentrated on persons who would otherwise

 receive wages below the minimum. Although economic theory suggests that

 substitution of higher quality for lower quality workers, for example,

 may raise the wage rates of workers with market wages above the minimum,

 the first order effect is thought to be on low wage persons.   It may also

 be that increases in the minimum wage have an inflationary effect on the

 wage rates paid to all workers and thus shift upward the underlying dis-

 tribution of wage rates. Such effects could be estimated if both time

 series and cross-section data were used and we will do that in future

 research.

       It can be demonstrated that a purely inflationary shift in the

 underlying distribution would affect our estimated elasticities with

 respect to a change in the minimum, but not our estimated total employ-

 ment effects, were the minimum to be eliminated. (This is explained in

 more detail in Appendix A.)

      The minimum wage may also affect school attendance rates. Thus far

we have restricted our formal analysis to out-of-school youth. A possible

extension of our model would incorporate a school attendance equation or

would use the model as is to obtain separate estimated effects for youth

in school.

      It may also be that the minimum wage affects hours worked, even

 among employed youth. For example, youth may be more likely to work part-

 time with a minimum than without it. Explicit allowance for this possi-

 bility, as well as effects on school attendance, we believe would tend if

 anything to increase the employment effect of the minimum if employment

 were 'adjusted" to account for these possible effects.2




      1. Most part-time workers are students and are therefore excluded
in large part from our analysis.

      2. Sherwin Rosen in his discussion has also pointed out that our data
excludes military personnel and the minimum wage may interact with enlist-
ments, possibly for young men just out of high school in particular.

         An alternative method of simulating the job loss resulting from the

 minimum is based on a method analagous to the one used in the single equation

 simulations. It is based only on employed persons. (In practice this alter-

 native method and the one described above give almost identical results.)

     A Shift in the Wage Distribution: As mentioned in the text, it is

sometimes argued that the minimum wage has a purely inflationary effect on

all wages; that is, it shifts upward the wage rates paid to all workers.
                                    A-6



Within the context of our model, we could in this case think of the effect of

the minimum in two parts: first, it shifts all wages upward, and second,

persons remain employed or lose their jobs according to the mechanism

we have described, but with respect to this "shifted' distribution.

Using only cross-section data, we are unable to estimate the magnitude

of such shifts if they do occur, but we could do sousing both

cross section and time series data. We will do this in future research.

In the meantime, we note that such shifts would not affect our estimates

of lost employment resulting from the minimum, although they would affect

our employment elasticity estimates with respect to a change in the

minimum.

     That is, with a purely inflationary increase in the underlying

distribution, the total employment loss is the increase in employment that

would result, given the shifted distribution, if the minimum were eliminated.

     To test the sensitivity of our elasticity estimates to such shifts--

with changes in the minimum—-we have calculated them assuming selected

shifts in the underlying wage distribution, using the single equation

model. As in the text we begin by assuming that without a minimum the

logarithm of the wage rate is given by


(A-14)         ln W =   X   + e


But in this case, we assume in addition that with a minimum      all wages

are shifted upward by an amount S(M) so that without the discontinuities

caused by the minimum, wage rates would be given by


(A-15)         w(M) =   w.s(M)
                                               A- 7



and in W(M) by


(A-16)                 in W(M) =   X    +      + in
                                                      S(M)

In this case, the shift associated with the minimum M is simply embodied in

our estimated constant term.


           Relative to the underlying wage rates with the current minimum M, wage

rates with another minimum            would be given by


                                       S(M.)
(A—17)                 W(M) =         _____


wi t   h


                                                      S(M.)
(A-18)                 in W(M) =   X   +    c + in
                                                      S(M)


Our modei of course does not provide estimates of the last term, but the

sensitivity of our elasticity results can be checked by substituting for

X, in the lost employment calculations, X + K, where K is a selected

value for in [S(M)/S(M)]. For example, we could assume that a 15 percent

reduction in the minimum would shift the underlying distribution down by

5 percent so that S(M)/S(M) would be .95.


           We can demonstrate now that a shift as described above would not affect

the estimate of jobs lost as a result of the minimum. To see this, we

have rewritten equation (A-2), to allow for the shift parameter, as



                                M —          — ln(S(M.)/S(M)
                     L. =                    a                     I
                                                               (l—P,—P2)
   (A—19)
                      ' i=l
                                    A-8



The denominator depends only on the current minimum. At the current

minimum, M =   M   and the shift term is equal to zero. Thus our estimate

of the non-employment effect of the present minimum is not affected by

possible shifting of the underlying wage distribution. However, simulated

employment elasticities based on a comparison of L with some Lk will

depend on the shift term. They will be somewhat lower, depending on the

magnitude of the shift.
