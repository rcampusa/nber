Use

                                         ABSTRACT

One of the main purposes of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) is to enable
Americans to make more productive use of their time. This is apparent in the rationale given for
the ACA’s extension of dependent care coverage, which requires employer-sponsored insurance
plans that cover the children of insured workers to continue to cover these dependents until they
turn 26. While a number of studies have examined the effect of the ACA’s dependent coverage
provision on work, none that we are aware has examined other uses of time. If, as predicted, the
provision reduced the amount of time young adults work, the question arises, what have these
young adults done with this time? A related question is whether the change has made them better
off. We use the American Time Use Survey (2003-2013) to assess how the ACA’s dependent
coverage mandate has affected labor supply among young adults, and to provide some of the first
evidence on time use other than working, such as educational activities, obtaining medical care,
and pursuing leisure activities. Estimates suggest that the ACA’s dependent coverage provision
has reduced labor supply and job-lock, as well as the duration of the average doctor’s visit,
including time spent waiting for and receiving medical care, among persons ages 19-25. The
latter effect is consistent with a substitution from hospital ER utilization to greater routine
physician care. The extra time has gone into socializing, and to a lesser extent, into education
and job search. Availability of insurance and change in work time appear to have increased
young adults’ subjective well-being, enabling them to spend time on activities they view as more
meaningful than those they did before insurance became available.

I.      Introduction

        One of the main purposes of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA),

signed into law in March, 2010, is to enable Americans to make more productive use of their

time. This is apparent in the rationale given for the ACA’s extension of the dependent care

coverage mandate (DCM), which went into effect on September 23, 2010 and requires employer-

sponsored insurance plans that cover the children of insured workers to continue to cover these

dependents until they reach the age of 26. In the Federal Register, the Administration states that

providing health insurance for these dependents will permit “greater job mobility for this

population as their health coverage will no longer be tied to their own jobs or student status” (FR

Vol. 75, No. 92, 2010/05/13 p. 27130). The assumption is that improved job mobility will

enable young persons to find jobs they view as more rewarding and where they can apply their

skills more productively.

        The Federal Register further notes that the coverage mandate should “decrease the cost-

shifting of uncompensated care onto those with coverage, increase the receipt of preventive

health care and provide more timely access to high quality care” (italics added). Prevalence of

insurance coverage among young adults has been historically low. Prior to the ACA and the

Great Recession, for instance, about 30% of younger adults (ages 19-26) lacked health insurance

compared with 17% of older adults (ages 27-64).1 Good health, higher risk tolerance,

unaffordability (due to lower earnings, job turnover, and/or higher premiums), and reduced

access to employer-sponsored benefits are important factors in young adults’ decision to forgo

coverage. Although young adults are generally healthier, they also exhibit non-trivial rates of

certain risk factors such as being overweight or obese, HIV and other sexually transmitted

diseases, and chronic conditions such as asthma and hypertension for which access to timely care

is particularly important. Lack of insurance disrupts this access, with 60% of uninsured young

adults reporting that they had foregone medical care despite need (Collins et al. 2012).2 Thus,

the dependent coverage mandate aimed at reducing these barriers to healthcare by expanding

insurance coverage among young adults.

         A number of studies have examined the effect of the ACA’s dependent care coverage

provision on uninsurance rates, health, and health care utilization among persons ages 19 to 25

(Blumenthal and Collins 2014; Barbaresco, Courtemanche and Qi 2015; Saloner and Lê Cook

2014) and on labor supply (Antwi, Moriya, Simon 2013). None that we are aware of has directly

examined the effect of the dependent care provision on time use. If, as suggested by Antwi,

Moriya, and Simon (2013), the provision reduced the amount of time young adults work, the

question arises, what have these young adults done with the time they used to spend working? A

related question is whether the change has made them better off. The answer to this last question

is not obvious, to judge by views of the ACA revealed in public opinion polls. For instance,

according to a poll conducted by Gallup, 53% of Americans disapprove of the ACA and 46%

think that the law will make things worse; only 16% believe it has helped them.3

         We utilize the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) from 2003 through 2013 to answer

these two main questions, providing a number of contributions to the literature on the ACA.

First, we provide the most accurate estimates of the effect of the dependent care provision on

time spent working. The accuracy reflects two factors: 1) the greater precision of the ATUS in

  Specifically, these young adults reported that they either did not fill a prescription, skipped recommended tests,
treatment, or follow-up, had a medical problem and did not visit the doctor or clinic, or did not get needed specialist
care. In comparison, 29% of insured young adults reported at least one of these access problems.

measuring time use in comparison with surveys such as the Survey of Income and Program

Participation (SIPP) and the Current Population Survey (CPS);4 2) our data extend through 2013,

while prior work, such as Antwi, Moriya, and Simon (2013), use data only through 2011, before

the provision reached its full effect. Second, we are the first to examine the effects of the

provision on time use other than working, such as going to school, obtaining medical care, and

pursuing leisure activities. Third, we measure the effect of the provision on young adults’ self-

reported levels of stress, happiness, sadness, sense of accomplishment, and tiredness, factors that

are collectively referred to as “subjective well-being”, as reported in the 2010, 2012, and 2013

rounds of the ATUS. Studies, such as those mentioned above, of the effect of gaining insurance

on young adults’ objective well-being (as measured by their health and finances) are certainly

necessary, though an equally valid question and component into cost-benefit calculus relates to

whether the beneficiaries of the law themselves reveal it has improved their lives – and if it has

not, such a finding may undermine a rationale for the policy shift.

II.      Background

Prior Studies

         Studies of the dependent care provision have consistently found that rates of insurance

coverage have increased, though the magnitude of the increase varies. Using the CPS from 2004

to 2011, Lloyd, DeLia, Cantor, and Monheit (2014) find that uninsurance rates for non-students

19 to 25 years old declined by 4.5 percentage points when compared with 27- to 30-year-olds,


4
  Prior research finds that compared with data from time diaries as well as from employers, data from the CPS tend
to overstate work time. Three reasons have been noted to account for much of the overstatement. 1) The ATUS has
less recall bias. 2) The ATUS asks respondents to account for all of their time in the prior day, so that the total time
spent adds up to 24 hours; as this constraint is of course true, imposing it increases precision. 3) The CPS asks about
work time during the week containing the 12th of the month, called the CPS “reference week”. This week is not
randomly chosen, and also not representative of a typical week during the month; in particular, it excludes most
holidays. In contrast, the days surveyed in the ATUS are distributed randomly throughout the year. Hence, the
ATUS offers some distinct advantages which make it worthwhile to estimate effects on work hours, and add to the
limited weight of the evidence in the literature on this issue.

                                                                                                                       4
reflecting an increase of 7.2 percentage points in parental employer-sponsored insurance (ESI)

and a decline of 2.8 percentage points in own- or spousal-coverage.5 The change increases with

income and declines with health. Using the SIPP from 2008 through 2011, Antwi, Moriya, and

Simon (2013) find a net decline of 3 percentage points in comparison with 27- to 29-year-olds,

reflecting a similar increase of 7 percentage points in parental ESI and a decline of 3 percentage

points in own-ESI and another one percentage point in individually-purchased or government

coverage. Using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 2008 to 2012,

Barbaresco, Courtemanche, and Qi (2015) find a drop in uninsurance of 6.2 percentage points

among 23- to 25-year-olds, compared with 27- to 29-year-olds. The control groups are basically

the same in all three studies. Thus, the larger decline found in the latter study likely reflects the

combination of an additional year since the passage of the ACA and a stronger response among

their older treatment group of 23-25 year olds. Using the National Health Interview Survey for

2005 through 2011, Sommers, Buchmueller, Decker, Carey, and Kronick (2013) find a decrease

in uninsurance of 4.7 percentage points among 19- to 25-year-olds compared with 26- to 34-

year-olds. Thus, prior studies indicate a median decline of 4 to 5 percentage points in

uninsurance rates, using data mainly through 2011.

           In order to frame our estimates for labor supply and time use, we require some such

estimate of the impact of the DCM on insurance coverage. However, since our data extend two

years further, to 2013, during which time the dependent care provision may have reduced

uninsurance rates further, we also generate our own estimate of the effect of the provision with a

difference-in-differences specification using the American Community Survey (ACS) from 2003

through 2013 and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) through 2013. The



5
    This suggests a crowd-out (of own for parent-based coverage) rate of about 39%.

                                                                                                        5
ACS and SIPP analyses are in line with the prior studies and suggest a decline in uninsurance of

5.3 percentage points among young adults ages 23-25 (relative to older adults ages 27-29).

       A number of studies have also examined whether gaining insurance increases emergency

room visits. This is relevant to our study because we assess effects on the duration of medical

visits, and visits to the hospital emergency department tend to consume more time than visits to

doctors’ offices. Such studies show mixed results. Medicaid expansions and health insurance

lotteries, such as the Rand Health Insurance Experiment, appear to increase emergency room

visits (Newhouse 1993, Currie & Gruber 1996; Taubman et al. 2012). In contrast, the expansion

of health insurance to large non-poor populations, as in Massachusetts in 1996 (Miller 2011) and

among young adults in the ACA (Hernandez-Boussard 2014; Antwi et al. 2015), appears to

reduce emergency department (ED) visits. The ACA’s dependent coverage provision also

increased physician visits among young adults (Jhamb, Dave and Colman 2015), which together

with the above evidence is consistent with a substitution from ED-based care to physician office-

based care.

       Very few studies have specifically estimated the effect of the ACA on time spent at work.

Antwi, Moriya, and Simon (2013), find that persons 19 to 25 years of age reduced their work

hours by about 48 minutes per week, or 10 minutes per day, compared with persons 27 to 29

years old, and Slusky (2015) cautions that such effects may be overstated due to confounding

differential trends. Depew (2015) studies the effects of earlier state mandates that extended the

age that young adults could continue to be covered as dependents on their parents’ insurance

plans, and finds that these laws reduced young adults’ labor supply at the intensive margin

though not significantly at the extensive margin. Using tax records over 2008-2012, Heim,

Lurie, and Simon (2014) find no meaningful changes in labor market outcomes at any margin,



                                                                                                    6
though they note several limitations with the tax data, including having to use parental retirement

benefits as a proxy for health insurance coverage, access to only two years of pre-policy data,

and lack of information on hours worked or part-time vs. full-time status.

        In contrast, Bailey and Chorniy (2016) do not look at work time per se but rather at job

mobility in the Current Population Surveys, studying whether the respondent switched jobs, and

they find no evidence that the ACA’s DCM had any effect on this measure of job mobility.

Bailey (2013) looks at self-employment and also finds no robust evidence that the DCM raised

self-employment. These two studies conclude that job-lock may not be a major concern for

young adults, and lack of health insurance may not be an impediment to entrepreneurship among

this age group.

Contributions

        We add to this very limited, and conflicting, evidence base on how the DCM has affected

labor supply decisions among young adults, based on detailed data from the American Time Use

Surveys. We also re-estimate first-order effects on insurance coverage, based on longitudinal

data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), updating the estimates of

Antwi, Moriya, and Simon (2013) to reflect the same time periods used in our analysis.6

        No study we are aware of has examined the effect of gaining insurance on non-labor uses

of time. We provide the first estimates on how the DCM has affected these other uses of time,

and also provide some of the first evidence on time spent receiving and waiting for medical care,

which would capture shifts in the use of medical care inputs (for instance, from hospital

emergency room care to routine physician care) associated with a shift from being uninsured to

gaining insurance coverage. Finally, we provide some suggestive evidence on whether these


6
 Antwi, Moriya, and Simon (2013) provided insurance effects based on SIPP data up to 2011. We re-estimate the
effects based on the most recent SIPP waves (up to 2013).

                                                                                                                7
changes have made young adults better off in their own assessment, based on a novel module on

subjective well-being which measures adults’ self-reported levels of stress, happiness, sadness,

sense of accomplishment, and tiredness associated with the activities that they were performing.

III.   Data

       We use the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) from 2003 through 2013, the period

which enveloped the enactment of the DCM and which allows us to observe responses over three

years post-enactment. We do not incorporate ATUS data from 2014-2015 in the main analyses

since the effects in these years may be confounded by the impacts of the 2014 components of the

ACA, which had different effects across age groups. Instead, we incorporate these two recent

waves in auxiliary analyses for specification checks (described in the Results section).

       The ATUS is a subsample of the Current Population Survey (CPS), which interviews

about 60,000 households per year. Each household in the CPS is interviewed for four months,

left out for eight months, and then re-interviewed for four additional months. Thus each

household, if it does not dissolve or move, is interviewed eight times. Each month about one-

eighth of the sample is being interviewed for the first time, and one-eighth, for the final time.

Two months after households complete their eighth CPS interview, they become eligible for

selection into the ATUS sample. About half of the households invited to participate in the

ATUS choose to do so. African-Americans, Hispanics, and households with young children are

oversampled for the ATUS. About 10% of the sample is randomly assigned to report on each

weekday, and 25%, on each weekend day. The day on which they report is called the “diary

day”. Sampling weights are provided to account for the oversampling of the different

demographic groups and of weekends, as well as for non-response. Hence, as the CPS, the




                                                                                                    8
ATUS is nationally representative of the civilian, non-institutional population residing in

occupied households.

       Participants are interviewed the day after the diary day to minimize recall errors. The

time diary component of the interview contains a detailed account of the respondent’s activities,

starting at 4 a.m. the previous day and ending at 4 a.m. on the interview day. Each activity in the

time diary component is assigned a six-digit classification code. The first two digits represent

one of 17 major activity codes (ranging from personal care to household services to exercise and

sports); the next two digits represent the second-tier level of detail, and the final two digits

represent the third, most detailed level of activity. For example, the ATUS code for “Using

health and care services outside the home” is 080401, which is part of code 0804, “Medical care

and services”, which is part of code 08, “Professional & Personal Care Services”.

       From the reported measures of time use we construct outcomes capturing time spent in

various activities, at the extensive and intensive margins. These include activities related to the

labor market: minutes working, including time spent actually working, other work-related

activities, such as socializing, eating, and drinking related to work (for salespeople, etc.), and

other income-generating activities, such as hobbies, performances, and renting assets; a

dichotomous indicator for whether the respondent is employed; work minutes conditional on

being employed; and minutes spent searching and interviewing for jobs. We also capture

activities related to healthcare utilization: minutes receiving and waiting for medical care outside

the home; minutes receiving medical care outside the home; minutes receiving medical care

conditional on receiving any care (intensive margin); minutes waiting for medical care; and

minutes waiting for medical care conditional on receiving any care (intensive margin). The

remaining measures capture minutes spent on: recreational exercise, educational activities



                                                                                                      9
(including time spent in class, studying, researching, and homework, as well as dealing with the

school administration), sleeping, eating and drinking, purchasing goods and services, and

socializing and relaxing (excluding watching television).

        We also use the 2010, 2012, and 2013 Well-Being Supplement to the ATUS, in which all

respondents to the ATUS are included. Respondents are asked about three randomly selected

activities from the diary day, and for each activity, to report using scales of 0 to 6 their

happiness, sadness, pain, stress, and tiredness, as well as how meaningful the respondent

considers the activity. We create a measure of the average level of each effect over the

respondent’s three activities using the time spent in each activity. For example, the average

happiness of respondent i is


                                                                                               (1)


where     refers to the time person i spent in activity k, and     is the degree of happiness of

person i during activity k.

        All models include various controls for the respondent’s socio-demographic

characteristics, including education, marital status, race and ethnicity, and gender. We match

data on the unemployment rate, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), based on the

respondent’s state of residence, and month and year of interview. In addition, we construct and

control for a dummy variable for incomplete interviews, that equals 1 if the respondent did not

account for all of his or her activities during the day. About 88% of the sample have complete

reports (reporting for the full 24 hours), and 94% of the sample report on at least 23 of the past

24 hours. Excluding incomplete interviews from the analyses does not materially change the

results or conclusions.

IV.     Conceptual Framework

                                                                                                     10
         We discuss here how the ACA’s dependent coverage mandate may impact various

activities, basing our discussion informally on a partial equilibrium set-up and highlighting

potential mechanisms that suggest that many of the effects are theoretically ambiguous. We leave

it to future research to disentangle all of the potential pathways that may underlie these effects.

         Any first-order effects of the ACA’s dependent coverage mandate would necessarily be

on insurance and employment outcomes. Employment and health insurance coverage remain

intrinsically connected in the United States because of the tax deductibility of employer-provided

health insurance benefits and the absence of a universal, public health insurance system.

Availability of low-cost coverage options apart from one’s job would be expected to affect

employment outcomes, specifically reducing “job-lock” and increasing job mobility (Gruber

2000). Optimization of the labor-leisure tradeoff also predicts a decrease in labor supply

associated with the DCM. That is, obtaining dependent insurance coverage is akin to an increase

in non-labor income, leading to a pure income effect and an increase in leisure. We confirm this

prediction using detailed data on time use, following limited prior work on labor supply (Antwi,

Moriya, and Simon 2013; Heim, Lurie, and Simon 2014; Depew 2015).

         By delinking the availability of low-cost health insurance from work, the DCM would be

expected to affect the marginal valuation of time spent on non-work activities and thus affect the

tradeoff between labor and leisure.7 The predicted reduction in labor supply and the associated

decrease in earnings have potentially reinforcing income and substitution effects.8 These shifts

would have second-order effects on non-work related time use. (Since the mandate operates


7
  See Colman and Dave (2013) for a more formal model set-up, which frames the question of how employment
decisions can affect other activities within a modified static version of the human capital model for the demand for
health. Here we abstract from the formal set-up and discuss some of intuitive predictions as relevant to this study.
8
  The DCM may also be associated with a positive income effect as uninsured young adults gain coverage and
experience a reduction in out-of-pocket medical spending. While this may moderate the negative income effect
from the reduction in labor supply, the net income effect is still likely to be negative since we find that virtually all
of the reduction in the labor supply is occurring at the extensive margin (see results).

                                                                                                                        11
mainly through its labor market impact, a null labor market effect would imply small or no

effects on the other outcomes as well.) From the hypothesized reduction in labor supply and

easing of the discretionary time constraint, young adults are predicted to allocate more of their

freed-up non-work time towards activities that are relatively more time-intensive and less

intensive in market-based inputs. We therefore expect an increase in activities that require more

time inputs (such as job search, education, and socializing) and a decrease in the demand for

activities that are complementary to market inputs (such as time spent shopping and purchasing

goods and services). The negative income effect, however, may offset any positive effects on

time spent shopping.

       A priori, effects on time spent receiving medical care are ambiguous. On the one hand,

there may be a scale effect as expansion of coverage to uninsured individuals raises the demand

for medical care -- both ER visits as well as for a regular source of care. On the other hand, there

is also a substitution effect from unscheduled ER-based care to scheduled and routine physician

office-based care; thus, it is likely that visits to a regular source of care probably increased more

than visits to emergency rooms, which may reduce the average time spent receiving medical

care. This effect would also predict that there would be a decrease in the time spent waiting for

medical care.

       Since the ACA’s DCM is a mandate on employers and not on consumers, young adults

who opt to take up coverage under their parents’ health insurance are presumably doing so

because the benefits from this option outweigh those from others (such as taking up coverage

under their own jobs, accepting a job to obtain coverage, or remaining uninsured). Any shift in

activities and time use brought about by the ACA’s DCM must therefore necessarily make these




                                                                                                    12
young adults better off from the standpoint of utility maximization. Thus, we predict an increase

in subjective well-being from the dependent coverage mandate.

V.      Empirical Framework

        The objective of this study is to assess how the ACA’s dependent coverage mandate

affected labor supply and various other measures of time use in healthcare and non-healthcare

activities among young adults. We empirically frame this question and test the above predictions

within a difference-in-differences (DD) analysis, comparing conditional trends pre- and post-

DCM for groups affected and not affected by the policy. Specifically, we follow the literature

and define the “treatment” group as comprising young adults between the ages of 19-25, the age

group targeted by the DCM. Individuals, between the ages of 27-34 constitute the control group,

who because of being older than 26 years of age are not eligible to obtain health insurance under

the DCM.9

        Our primary specification takes the following form,



                                                                                                       (2)


where           references time-use outcomes (for individual i residing in state j and interviewed on

day d, month m, and year t), and              refers either to after 2010 or after 2011. The DCM went

into effect in September of 2010, and did not apply until the start of the next plan year. Thus,

2010 is always a pre-treatment period. We expect the effects to be larger when the treatment

period is further from the enactment date. The vector                   includes demographic controls and




9
 We follow the literature and exclude 26 year olds from either the treatment or control groups in order to minimize
any measurement error as this is a transition period and some 26 year olds may be shifting coverage in anticipation
of aging out.

                                                                                                                 13
the indicator for an incomplete diary. The variable         refers to the unemployment rate in the

respondent’s state of residence during the year and month of interview.

       All specifications further control for state fixed effects (μ), which account for any

unobserved time-invariant state-specific factors, as well as time fixed effects. Insurance status

had been trending downwards prior to the ACA both among 19- to 25-year-olds and among 27-

to 34-year-olds. Also, the Great Recession has caused fluctuations in work and other time use. It

is likely that only some of these trends are picked up by the state unemployment rate. The year

indicators (θ) would capture any such national trends in time use and in insurance status

independent of the changes caused by the ACA, most notably shocks to the labor and healthcare

markets from the recent economic downturn. We also include month dummies (τ) because many

activities, such as exercise, as well as mood, vary substantially by season, and we include day-of-

the-week dummies (φ) to control further for changes in time use and mood over the week. As an

obvious example, most work time occurs during the week, while most exercise and socializing

occur during the weekend. Also, subjective well-being varies noticeably over the week, with

respondents reporting being least happy, saddest, most tired, most stressed, but engaged in their

most meaningful activity, on Wednesday. In our primary specification, we do not control for

school enrollment or for health status, as these are two of the likely outcomes of the change in

the law we are analyzing.

       Some research suggests that the effects of the ACA on labor and health outcomes found

in the prior literature may be spurious, reflecting different trends in the control and treatment

groups prior to the ACA taking effect (Slusky 2015). The validity of difference-in-differences

analysis, of course, depends on common trends between the control group and the treatment

group had the treatment group not been treated. Figures 1-3 present these trends for our



                                                                                                    14
outcomes. Due to sample size limitations (a limitation not exclusive to our study, but also

pervasive in most of the ACA literature), the trends are noisy. The commonality of trends cannot

be tested after the new policy takes effect, since the policy will itself affect the trend of the

treated group. However, the parallel trends assumption can be tested prior to that time. We

therefore formally test for differential trends in two ways, which also serve as placebo checks.

           First, we estimate equation (2), adding the interaction of the treatment dummy and a

variable that equals the year if the year is prior to 2010, and equals zero afterwards. The p-value

on this variable indicates whether linear trends in the treatment and control groups differed in the

pre-treatment period. Our second test follows Slusky (2015), wherein we estimate our main

equation (2) above but define the treatment period from 2007 to 2009 or to 2008, and the control

period, from 2003 to 2007. Since the law only went into effect in 2010, we should find no effect

of the pseudo-treatment when the sample is limited to period prior to implementation of the

DCM. As a third check on our specification, we redefine the treatment group as only persons

between the ages of 23 and 25. This reduces our sample size by about half, but creates a

treatment group that is more attached to the labor market, less likely to be still enrolled in school,

and in general more similar to the control group of persons 27 to 34 (Table 1). Fourth, we also

estimate specifications that include state-specific linear trends to evaluate if our estimates are

driven by unobserved state level heterogeneity and systematic differential trends.

           Prior to the passage of the ACA in 2010, 37 states had laws protecting the insurance

coverage of dependent children,10 the great majority having been passed after 2005. Monheit et

al. (2011) find that the state laws had little net effect on the insurance coverage of young adults.

To gauge if state dependent coverage laws might affect our results, we estimate equation (2) only

on young adults who would not be eligible for coverage under these state regulations.

         Further, when presenting the results, we discuss additional checks which assess the

validity of the identifying variation, and robustness to alternate sample restrictions and

controls.11 All models are estimated with OLS, as the outcomes are in general continuous.12

Since we include state effects and the policy change is at the national level starting in September

of 2010 and affecting persons of a particular age, we assume that the error terms (denoted by ε in

equation 2) are correlated within single year of age and survey year. In fact, the variance of the

coefficient matrix hardly changes whether we assume merely heteroskedasticity, or

heteroskedasticity combined with the clustering described above. Since policy variation is at the

age by time level, we also alternately estimated standard errors clustered at the age level. These

results reinforce those presented in the tables, and our inferences and conclusions are not

materially altered.13

VI.      Results

Descriptive Statistics

         Table 1 reports the means of the variables used in the main analyses, across the two

treatment groups (ages 19-25 and ages 23-25) and the control group (ages 27-34). Time use

clearly differs between 19- to 25-year-olds and 27- to 34-year-olds. The older group spends more

time working, but less time in exercise, education, sleep, and socializing. The 23- to 25-year-old

group is closer to the older group in work-related activities, but closer to the younger group in

the other activities. With respect to time spent receiving medical care, this is somewhat larger

11
   We are grateful to the editor and two anonymous referees for suggesting these.
12
   The ATUS oversamples weekends and certain demographic groups and provides sampling weights to generate
population-based estimates. Because we include dummy variables for demographic characteristics as well as day of
the week of the survey, we do not use survey weights in our estimates (DuMouchel & Duncan 1983; Solon, Haider,
Wooldridge 2015). We also use OLS for dichotomous outcomes, and confirm that the results are not sensitive to
estimation via logit or probit regression.
13
   Clustering at the age level leads to a small number of clusters, which may bias standard errors, and hence
inferences were drawn based on degrees of freedom determined by the number of clusters. Alternately, we could
have clustered at the state level, though this is less logical in our case since the treatment is not at the state level.
Nevertheless, clustering by state actually makes our standard errors slightly smaller and strengthens our inferences.

                                                                                                                      16
among 27-34 year olds, particularly in relation to the 23-25 year olds, consistent with a larger

prevalence of insurance among the older group. However, among those who receive medical

care, time spent waiting to receive care is higher among the younger adults (12-14 minutes)

relative to the older adults (10 minutes), which is consistent with uninsured younger adults

receiving more of their healthcare through non-scheduled clinic or ED visits. All three groups

are quite similar in demographic characteristics and in levels of happiness, sadness, stress,

tiredness, and meaningfulness of their activities.

Main Analyses

        Table 2 reports estimates from our main DD models (equation 2) on the effects of the

DCM on labor supply. Specifications 1-4 utilize the full treatment group (ages 19-25), and

specifications 5-7 utilize the narrowly-defined treatment group (23-25) who are more likely to

have finished schooling and entered the labor force. As found by Antwi, Moriya, and Simon

(2013), the availability of insurance reduces time spent working, though our baseline estimate

(specification 1) —about 18 minutes per day or about 9% (relative to the treatment group mean)

— is about double that found in the prior study.14 This could be due to a longer time period

since the ACA took effect, as well as a different measure of work time, and a different

comparison group, as we use persons ages 27 to 34. In fact, the effect size increases in

magnitude (23 minutes decline) the further we get from implementation (specification 2, which

allows for a lag and defines the post-period as post-2011 compared with specification 1 which

defined the treatment period as post-2010). This suggests that the DCM may have gradually

changed behavior, which speaks to the value of using more post-policy data to assess its

cumulative and full effects.

14
  Our results mainly reflect a post-ACA decline in work among the treatment group, rather than an increase among
the control group, which adds a degree of confidence that it was the ACA and not a spurious trend in the control
group that accounts for our results.

                                                                                                              17
        Next, we decompose whether this decrease in labor supply is occurring at the extensive

and/or the intensive margin by separately assessing effects on employment and on work time

conditional on employment. Most of the decline appears to reflect declines at the extensive

rather than intensive margin, as we find insignificant and much smaller effects on labor supply

among those who are currently employed and a significant decline in employment status of 4-6

percentage points.

        The first-order effect of the mandate is necessarily on dependent coverage rates. In order

to gauge the credibility of these employment effects, we therefore compare them to changes in

dependent coverage rates, which must be bigger than the change in employment. To do so we

require estimates of the extent to which eligible young adults opted for coverage under their

parents’ plans because of the mandate. As the ATUS does not contain information on insurance

coverage, we instead employ the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), also used

by Antwi, Moriya, and Simon (2013) in their early study of the dependent coverage mandate.

Their study, however, only extends through 2011 and may not be informative about the effect of

the mandate during our study period. We therefore estimated models of dependent coverage as

well as of any coverage using the full 16 waves of the 2008 SIPP, spanning through 2013.15 The

effect of the mandate on dependent coverage was 10.2 percentage points (p-value ≤ 0.01), with a

little less than half of these individuals switching from employer-sponsored health insurance to

dependent coverage, and the rest newly gaining coverage. The net gain in insurance in the SIPP

(5.28 percentage points; p-value ≤ 0.01) is quite close to that estimated in other research and also

to our estimate using the American Community Survey. These effects in combination with the

employment effects are consistent with a subset of those gaining dependent coverage quitting


15
  We applied the Stata code associated with Antwi, Moriya, and Simon (2013) (posted on the American Economic
Journal website) and recreated their variables, extending their analyses to 16 waves of the 2008 SIPP.

                                                                                                           18
their work and/or those entering the labor market for the first time taking longer to look for a

better-matching job. Others are not, and yet others are remaining employed while just switching

their coverage. Thus, most importantly, it is validating that the gain in dependent coverage,

which is the relevant first-order margin, is much larger than the drop in employment.

         Furthermore, the magnitude of the observed decline in work minutes (18-23 minutes

daily) is also consistent with and can be fully explained by the observed decline in employment

(4-6 percentage points). If there are no major effects on labor supply at the intensive margin, as

there does not seem to be, then inflating the work minutes estimates by a factor of 17-25

(reciprocal of the estimates of employment) yields an average implied work day of about 7-7.5

hours among those who shifted status from employment to non-employment. This is virtually

identical to the Census estimate of 7.5 average hours worked daily by employed persons in 2010.

In this as in almost all the outcomes we examine, the effects are stronger when the treatment

period is limited to 2012 and 2013, suggesting stronger cumulative effects.16

         The final row of results suggests an increase in time spent looking for new jobs. While

the coefficient on time spent searching and interviewing for jobs is insignificant using the full

sample, it is significant at the 5 percent level when the outcome period is limited to post-2011,

after the law had more time to take effect. Among 23- to 25-year-olds, who would have a

stronger attachment to the labor force and more likely to have completed their schooling, the

effects were larger and more precisely estimated in both time periods.17




16
   We confirm these patterns by estimating an event study (Appendix Table 1), decomposing the timing of the
effects. Since our samples sizes are small, to gain some precision we grouped pre-policy years into two-year pairs,
and, in some models group three post-policy years together. The analysis reveals no significant effects before the
dependent care provision took effect, but afterwards, both working time and employment declined monotonically
and significantly.
17
   Though the absolute effect magnitudes appear small (in terms of minutes), they are substantial in relation to the
baseline mean. Even when imprecisely estimated, they suggest an increase of 30%.

                                                                                                                   19
        Table 2 also reports on some of our specification checks. First, the results are generally

robust to the inclusion of state-specific linear trends (model 4) and to limiting the sample to

young adults who would be ineligible for coverage under state laws (models 3 and 7). In fact, as

expected, the effect of the ACA is a bit stronger for these state-ineligible young adults, though

the loss in sample sizes also reduces the precision of our estimates.18 Table 2 also reports one of

our placebo checks, whether there are any systematic differences in the trends in each reported

outcome between the treatment and control groups prior to 2010. The p-value for this test is

reported in the square brackets. It is validating that none of the pre-policy trend differences are

significant at conventional levels. Overall the results for labor-market outcomes in Table 2

appear to confirm the benefits of non-work-related health insurance in reducing job-lock. We

also find suggestive evidence of an increase in job-searching, which is consistent with the

availability of insurance outside of employment allowing young adults to take longer to possibly

search for more suitable jobs. The employment effects in conjunction with this increase in job-

search activity is consistent with greater job mobility and a reduction in job-lock.

        Table 3 reports estimates for time spent receiving and waiting for medical services.

These results suggest a decline in these uses of time, though the point estimates are generally

statistically insignificant. However, in some cases they do represent a somewhat sizeable

decline. For instance, the estimates for total time receiving care suggest a decline of about 20-

25% relative to the baseline mean. Estimates for total time waiting for medical care are

statistically insignificant for the broad treatment groups (ages 19-25) but significant for young

adults ages 23-25, suggestive of a decline in waiting time of about 0.4 minutes daily on average.

18
  Monheit et al. (2011) find little effects of these pre-ACA state laws on the insurance coverage of young adults,
which we confirm with the ACS data as well. Thus, we would not expect a substantially larger effect of the ACA’s
DCM when omitting those individuals who would be eligible under the state laws since if these individuals had not
substantially expanded their insurance status prior to the ACA, they would be potentially impacted by the DCM and
would be a valid inclusion in the treatment group.

                                                                                                               20
We find more solid evidence that these effects are being realized at the intensive margin. That

is, conditional on receiving any medical care, the DCM is significantly associated with a drop in

the time spent both obtaining medical care (by about 25-30 minutes on average) and in the time

spent waiting for medical care (by about 10-20 minutes on average).

         These estimates are generally robust when we control for state-specific trends (model 4)

or omit individuals from the sample who may be eligible for dependent coverage under state

laws prior to the ACA’s DCM (models 3 and 7). As with our models for labor supply, we do not

find any statistically significant differences in pre-policy trends between the treatment and

control groups (p-values for this test reported in square brackets).

         Young adults between the ages of 19-25 have the highest prevalence of ER (emergency

room) use among adults; in 2008, 26% of young adults had obtained some care in the hospital

ER (National Health Interview Survey – NHIS). The findings in Table 3 lend support to the

view that making insurance more easily available to non-poor households19 with working parents

reduces the use of emergency-room care and increased office-based physician visits (Antwi et al.

2015; Jhamb et al. 2015; Hernandez-Boussard et al. 2014).20 According to the National

Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2011 and 2012 NAMCS, produced by the CDC), the median

time spent in visits to the ER was 120 minutes, while the median time for visits with general

practitioners was 17 minutes; and for specialties, the median time was higher than general

practitioners but varied considerably. Since, visits to doctors’ offices take less time than visits to

the ER, average time spent waiting for and seeing doctors must have declined, as we find using

the ATUS.
19
  Households wherein family income exceeds the poverty thresholds reported each year by the Census Bureau.
20
  Both Antwi et al. (2015) and Hernandez-Boussard et al. (2014) find a significant and direct decrease in ER visits –
on the order of 6-7 visits (per 1000 population). Non-adjusted estimates from the NHIS also suggest a decline in the
prevalence of care at the hospital ER by about 2-3 percentage points among the treatment group relative to the
control group (authors’ calculations). Jhamb, Colman, and Dave (2015) find that the dependent care provision
increased yearly doctor visits by about ¾ of a visit.

                                                                                                                  21
         The decrease in time spent receiving medical care may also reflect an improvement in the

quality of medical care, both from a substitution from ER-based healthcare to a more routine

source of physician care, and also since time spent with the physician is generally lower than

with more expensive specialist doctors. Similarly, time spent waiting to receive medical care

declined substantially among those who received care, consistent with a number of young

persons switching their regular source of care from the emergency room to the doctor’s office.

         The estimates in Tables 2 and 3 suggest that the ACA’s DCM likely reduced employment

among those eligible for dependent coverage, and also reduced the time spent obtaining and

receiving medical care services particularly at the intensive margin. To some extent, some of

this time was spent in looking for new jobs. The question remains how those no longer working

used the rest of their freed-up time. Table 4 reports estimates for the other uses of time. Young

adults (ages 19-25) spent more time in education, an additional 6 to 8 minutes daily on average,

which translates into a 15-20% increase relative to the baseline treatment group mean.21 As

expected, the effect on education is smaller for 23- to 25-year-olds since fewer individuals in this

group are enrolled in school; it is also insignificant. It is still, however, positive, and the lower

precision is to be expected with the much smaller sample size. We also find some decrease in the

time spent purchasing goods and services (3-5 minutes daily; 10-15%), which reflects the

negative income effect associated with the reduction in employment. Most of the freed-up time

from the reduction in labor supply (at least 50% or so) is reallocated into socializing and relaxing

– an additional 9-13 minutes daily (8-10% relative effect size). Significant coefficients on the

differential pre-policy time trends for all outcomes are generally rejected for all of these
21
   As noted in the Data section, educational activities include time spent in class, in extra-curricular activities, in
school-related research, and in school-related administrative activities. The estimate in the model is an average
effect across the treatment population, including those whose educational activities are affected (mostly those who
are current students) and those for whom there is no effect. As a reference, daily time in educational activities
averages 149.9 minutes (145.5 minutes) for youth ages 19-25 (ages 23-25) who are currently enrolled in school
either full-time or part-time. About 15.7% of youth ages 19-25 are full-time students.

                                                                                                                      22
outcomes among all subgroups within a Type 1 error. Our overall conclusion that the DCM was

associated with an increase in time spent on education and socializing is also robust to

controlling for state-specific trends and restricting the sample to those young adults who would

be ineligible for dependent coverage under pre-ACA laws.

       Table 5 shows the results of our placebo regressions. Almost all of the coefficients

become insignificant and often have different signs from our main results. In particular, the

effect on being employed among those in the treatment group drops to zero and is insignificant in

all but one subgroup, in which its sign is opposite to that of Table 2. The effect on total work

time also changes sign, but is significant in some subgroups. The magnitude and significance of

the coefficients, however, vary so much as to suggest that the results are largely due to chance.

Given the results of our specification tests, we conclude that the ACA likely reduced

employment among those eligible for dependent coverage

       As mentioned above, young persons spent much of the time they were no longer working

in socializing and relaxing. This may or may not necessarily represent a positive shift from the

point of view of the former worker. During the Great Recession it was also found that persons

who lost their jobs socialized more than before (Colman and Dave 2013), but their levels of

sadness and stress rose. Thus the question remains whether those obtaining insurance and

working less view the change as positive. For this we consider effects on the measures of

subjective well-being reported in Table 6. Consistent with the view that unlinking insurance

status with working full-time provides more flexibility, the significant change in well-being is an

increase in the sense that the respondent is doing something he or she finds meaningful. Further,

measures of happiness increase significantly, and of tiredness and stress decline, though the latter

changes were not significant (except among young adults ages 23-25 in the restricted sample in



                                                                                                    23
specification 7). The effect magnitudes suggest about a 3-5% increase in happiness and

meaningfulness, and overall these patterns are consistent with a general increase in subjective

well-being associated with the shift in activities due to the ACA’s DCM.22

        The Well-Being Supplement began in 2010, which we take to be our control year. But as

suggested by Antwi, Moriya, and Simon (2013), some insurance companies announced as soon

as the ACA was passed that they would allow dependent adults to remain on their parents’

insurance plan until 26. Thus, if anything, our estimates for subjective well-being would be

conservative and biased toward zero. The concern remains that we only have one pre-treatment

period for this part of the analysis. In order to assess the importance of this limitation, we also

re-estimated our main employment models using only data from 2010 onwards, and thus only

using 2010 as a pre-policy period. Expectedly, standard errors inflate and reduce precision,

rendering most of the estimates insignificant. However, the effect magnitudes remain very

similar (14.0 to 23.7 minute decline in daily work time, and 5-8 pct. points decline in

employment). The results on well-being should be viewed as suggestive in light of these

caveats.

Specification Checks

        In models not reported, we implement several checks to confirm that our estimates are

robust to alternate sample restrictions, extensions, and controls.23 First, we re-estimated our

main models allowing the trends to differ non-parametrically based on demographics, interacting

year effects by marital status, race, ethnicity, and education. Second, we also estimated models

(for treatment group ages 23-25) while excluding those enrolled in school and those who are

current students in order to produce treatment and control groups more similar in terms of work

   Sample sizes for these models are reduced due to the well-being modules being available only in the 2010, 2012,
and 2013 waves of the ATUS.

and non-work time. Both of these extensions aim to address baseline dissimilarities in some

non-work related activities across groups that may also be correlated with changes over time.

Our results are not materially affected either in terms of effect magnitudes or significance.

       Next, we assess whether the policy response differs across sub-populations. While we

are not able to stratify by each socio-demographic group due to sample size limitations, we

estimated our main model interacting our treatment variables with marital status. The joint F-

statistic on the interactions was 1.23, with a p-value of 0.23. Thus there appears to be little

difference in the law’s effect along this direction. We also tested for differential effects by race

and ethnicity, and by education. All of the interactions were singly and jointly insignificant at the

10 percent level.

       We also confirm our previous result that virtually all of the labor market effects we

identify are at the extensive margin, by separating out effects for full-time and part-time

employed workers. Limiting the sample to part-time or full-time workers does indeed remove

most of the law’s effect. Including only part-time workers, the sample size drops from 30,803 to

4,556, and the estimated effect on work time drops to an insignificant 2.8 (std. error = 14.5)

minutes. Including only full-time workers, the sample size drops to 8,835 and the effect on work

time to an insignificant 1.3 (std. error = 6) minutes.

       Since older cohorts on average work more hours relative to younger cohorts, one concern

may be that they are employed in different types of jobs, which may be correlated with trends in

labor supply. We consulted the American Community Surveys and find that the industry

composition between the two groups (ages 23-25; ages 27-34) is broadly similar, except for an

expectedly larger share of younger adults working in retail trade (25.5% vs. 16.9%). Level

differences (in hours worked) are problematic only if they imply differential trends as well. We



                                                                                                       25
explicitly test for differential trends overall, either in terms of employment or hours worked in

the pre-periods (reported as the p-value on the joint significance of the pre-trends in all tables in

the text), and do not find any strong evidence to this effect. We also estimated models that

control for industry (which can be matched to the ATUS based on the CPS records) – current

industry for those employed and previous industry of work for those non-employed, with no

significant changes to the estimates.

        Though the ACA DCM was implemented in late 2010, we employ all ATUS waves

going back to 2003 in order to maximize our sample size. This allows for longer pre-treatment

periods, adding more precision to the estimation of the pre-policy baseline effects and in turn

raising the precision of the post-policy estimates. We confirm that limiting the sample to 2007-

2013 does not meaningfully change the magnitude or the direction of the effects, though their

precision (for some of the non-work activities) is somewhat reduced.

        We also extend our sample size to incorporate two additional waves of the ATUS that

have become recently available. During the additional years—2014 and 2015—the treatment and

control groups were affected similarly by the ACA, since starting in 2014 everyone is required to

have health insurance. Thus 2014 and 2015 are essentially two additional non-treatment years.

Including them as additional non-treatment years leaves the main results unchanged, both in

magnitude and in significance. The placebo results, in contrast, all become smaller in absolute

value and statistically insignificant.

        Finally, in an attempt to make the treatment and control groups even more balanced,

specifications further restricted the sample to persons between 23- and 29-years-old. This

substantially reduces the sample sizes. Estimates may differ across age groups (comparing 23-25

vs. 27-29 year olds, or comparing 23-25 or 19-25 vs. 27-34 years olds) because narrower age



                                                                                                    26
groups may allow for more balanced trends or because different age groups may respond to the

policy differently. Hence, a key question is about the underlying populations. Does the average

treatment effect among the population between 23- and 29-years-old differ meaningfully from

the average treatment effect among the population between 19 and 34? If they are the same, the

estimates based on the latter are as valid as the former and more precise. To investigate this, we

used an outcome with enough observations with positive values in samples of both populations.

In our case, these are the work-related outcomes. The results based on a narrower control group

(comparing young adults ages 23-25 to a control group of young adults ages 27-29) are virtually

the same as when using the full sample.24

VII.     Discussion

         Two major rationales underlying the dependent care coverage mandate of the Affordable

Care Act were to provide more timely access to high quality care and to enable Americans to

make more productive uses of their time. Prior studies have assessed and confirmed that the

DCM led to a net increase in insurance coverage among eligible younger adults, and one study

has shown that it was also associated with a decrease in labor supply. We broaden the lens and

evaluate the effects of the ACA’s DCM on several outcomes, not studied heretofore, which

inform on how effective the DCM was in fulfilling its stated objectives. First, we add to the very

sparse evidence and provide a more precise analysis of labor supply outcomes based on the

American Time Use Surveys. The precision reflects the collection of work-time measures based

on time diaries and also the incorporation of data up to 2013, spanning three years post-policy

implementation (compared to data up to 2011 in most prior work). We find robust evidence that
24
  The restricted sample yields treatment effects on the order of 20-29 minutes decline in daily work time, and 6-7
percentage points decline in employment. All of the labor supply effects are statistically significant. We cannot
carry out the same comparison for other time-use outcomes because restricting the sample to those between 23 and
29 results in far too few observations with positive values to obtain any precision. Since there appears to be no
difference for outcomes with sufficient observations and no precision for other outcomes, restricting the sample to
persons between 23 and 29 imposes a high cost in precision for no benefit in identification.

                                                                                                                  27
the DCM reduced labor supply at the extensive margin by about 5 percentage points. It is

validating that this estimate is fully consistent with prior estimates of a net increase in insurance

coverage on the order of 4-6 percentage points. We also find a suggestive increase in time spent

searching for a job, which together with the labor supply estimates may reflect a reduction in job

lock and an increase in time spent potentially searching for more suitable work.

       Second, we provide the first estimates on how the DCM affected both time spent

receiving and waiting for medical care – which directly speak to both of the stated goals of the

DCM. These results suggest that, particularly at the intensive margin, the duration of both of

these activities declined significantly. This decrease may reflect an improvement in the quality of

medical care, both from a substitution from ER-based healthcare to a more routine source of

physician care. Furthermore, any decrease in time spent waiting for medical care would

represent a more productive shift. The decrease in labor supply and time spent waiting for and

receiving medical care has freed up time for young adults to allocate towards other activities.

       To the best of our knowledge, we also provide the first estimates on these other uses of

time. Specifically, we find that, in addition to job search, this extra time has flowed into

socializing, and to a lesser extent, into educational activities. We further contribute to the

literature by assessing whether these shifts in activities are welfare-improving from the

respondent’s own standpoint. Here, we find that the availability of insurance and change in work

time appears to have increased the subjective well-being of young adults, enabling them to spend

time on activities that they view as more meaningful than those they did before insurance

became available. It should be noted that the DCM was a mandate for insurers, but opting to

obtain coverage under their parents’ plans, now made possible by the DCM, was of course

voluntary. Thus, those taking advantage of the DCM would be the ones who would presumably



                                                                                                   28
benefit from it, and the reallocation of time is presumably optimal from the standpoint of utility

maximization. This is consistent with our results which are suggestive that the shift in activities

is associated with an increase in subjective well-being. Overall, the results from this study

suggest that the ACA’s dependent care coverage mandate has shifted labor supply outcomes and

uses of time, and raised the reported well-being of young adults in ways that are consisted with

its stated rationales.

Notes: Coefficients on the interaction between the treatment group and the post-indicator are reported. Each coefficient represents a separate regression model.
 Clustered standard errors are in parentheses (see text). Square brackets report the p-values on the pre-policy linear trend (interaction of a linear year trend and the
treatment group indicator for 2003 through 2010). All coefficients represent changes in minutes except for the indicator for employed, which shows the
percentage point change associated with the policy. N represents the number of observations. Asterisks denote statistical significance as follows: *** 0.01 ≥ p-
value; ** 0.05 ≥ p-value > 0.01; * 0.10 ≥ p-value > 0.05.

Notes: Coefficients on the interaction between the treatment group and the post-indicator are reported. Each coefficient represents a separate regression model.
 Clustered standard errors are in parentheses (see text). Square brackets report the p-values on the interaction of a linear year trend and the treatment group
indicator for 2003 through 2010. All coefficients represent changes in minutes. Sample sizes for the non-truncated outcomes are similar to those listed in Table 2
(ranging from 16,544 to 30,803). Asterisks denote statistical significance as follows: *** 0.01 ≥ p-value; ** 0.05 ≥ p-value > 0.01; * 0.10 ≥ p-value > 0.05.

Notes: Coefficients on the interaction between the treatment group and the post-indicator are reported. Each coefficient represents a separate regression model.
 Clustered standard errors are in parentheses (see text). All coefficients represent changes in the weighted measure of each affect, which ranges from 0 to 6. The
Well-being outcomes have only one row (and no pre-ACA interactions) because the Well-being Supplement was administered only in 2010, 2012, and 2013. N
represents the number of observations. Asterisks denote statistical significance as follows: *** 0.01 ≥ p-value; ** 0.05 ≥ p-value > 0.01; * 0.10 ≥ p-value > 0.05.
