           International Adjustment Under the Classical Gold Standard:
                   Evidence for the U.S. and Britain, 1879-1914



                                    ABSTRACT



      Links between disturbances in financial markets and those in real
 activity have long been the focus of studies of economic fluctuations during
 the period prior to World War I. We emphasize that domestic autonomy was
 substantially limited by internationally integrated markets for goods and
 capital. Such findings are important for studying business cycles during the
 period; for example, when prices are flexible, observed cyclical movements can
 be related to a credit—market transmission of
                                               deflationary shocks.

      Recent studies of the classical gold standard have revived interest in
 the process by which macroeconomic shocks were transmitted internationally
during this period. The principal competing approaches — the
                                                                "price—specie—
flow," mechanism and the more modern "internationalist" view —    differ
according to the means by which international equilibrium is reestablished
after a disturbance occurs in capital, money, or commodity markets. We
present and interpret separate pieces of evidence on gold flows, interest
rates, and selected commodity prices, all of which shed light on the
alternative assumptions employed in the price—specie—flow and modern
approaches. We employ a monthly data set for the U.S. and Britain for the
pre—World War I frameworks. Using the "structural VAR" approach of Bernanke
and Sims, we compare the actual historical importance of shocks and the
observed patterns of short—run adjustment to shocks with the prediction of
each of the two models. The evidence
                                       supports the "internationalist" view of
close international linkages over the "specie—flow" view of circuitous
linkages and domestic autonomy in money and capital markets.

 I. INTRODUCTION

      Links   between disturbances in financial markets and those in real

 activity have long been the focus of studies of economic fluctuations
                                                                            during
 the period prior to World War I. The standard "business cycle" analysis of

 the period emphasizes the importance of domestic monetary shocks in an

 environment of sticky prices and inelastic money supply. In this paper, we

 provide several consistent sets of evidence which show that those basic

assumptions are at odds with the data from the period. That is, we emphasize

that domestic autonomy was substantially limited by internationally integrated

goods and capital markets. Such findings are likely to be important for

studying business cycles during the period; we have shown elsewhere (see

Calomiris and Hubbard, 1986) that, when prices are flexible, observed cyclical

movements can be related to a credit—market transmission of deflationary
          1
shocks.

     The focus on international linkages has been common in the literature;

indeed, recent studies of the operation of the classical gold standard have

revived interest in the process by which macroeconomic shocks were transmitted

internationally during this period (see Bordo and Schwartz, 1985). The

principal competing approaches differ according to the means by which

international equilibrium is re—established after a disturbance occurs in

capital, money, or commodity markets. According to the "price—specie—flow"

mechanism, shocks which raise (lower) the gap between the domestic money

supply and its equilibrium level raise (lower) the domestic price level; this

in turn decreases (increases) the balance of trade, which leads to outflows

(inflows) of gold and eventually equilibration of the system at commodity

price levels consistent with foreign prices. More recent models of

international adjustment emphasize the roles of arbitrage and speculation in
                                     —2—



efficient markets for capital, currency, and commodities. This "modern"

approach argues that interest rates and prices will maintain levels consistent

with foreign interest rates and prices in the short run, while currency,

capital, and commodity flows adjust to achieve long—run changes necessary to

restore equilibrium in all markets. The intuition for this result is that

speculative demands or supplies for commodities, capital, and money place

bounds on predictable short—run deviations of prices.

     A representative view associated with the circuitous price—specie—flow

mechanism posits: sluggish international gold movements; sticky commodity

prices; the cyclical importance of money supply shocks (mainly shocks to the

money multiplier) and the consequent potential for central banks to influence

the aggregate money supply and (through it) interest rates and economic

activity. In order to argue that money multiplier shocks and central bank

interventions have more than fleeting influence on the real money supply, one

must assume both that commodity prices are rigid and that the supply of high—

powered money is inelastic. This general view is consistent with the price—

specie—f low sequence of events: International adjustment to monetary shocks

follows gradual domestic price adjustment which, through changes in the terms

of trade, brings about trade deficits (surpluses) and hence balance of

payments surpluses (deficits).

     On the other hand, advocacy of the modern approach implies far less

domestic autonomy in the short run for interest rates, the money supply, and

commodity prices. According to the modern (or "internationalist") view, gold

supply is highly elastic, capital markets for some securities (internationally

traded commercial paper and bonds) are closely integrated internationally, and

domestic commodity gold prices are flexible and internationally determined

within "narrow" bandwidths of transaction cost (which includes transport and
                                        —3—



  insurance fees, tariffs, and a fair rate of return to international commodity

  market speculators).2 These assumptions, in turn, imply demand determination

  of the real (and nominal) money stock, an internationally determined

  commercial paper rate (in gold units), and a minor role for any central bank

 with respect to its ability to influence the aggregate money supply or the

 rates of return on internationally traded securities.3
                                                           Even in the absence of

 highly responsive domestic prices, these results still hold, but the lagging

 adjustment of domestic prices to international price shocks entails real

 effects on the time path of the balance of trade.

      Essentially what is at issue in distinguishing these two views

 empirically is whether the deviations allowed by transaction and information

 costs in gold, capital, and commodity markets were sufficiently small to

 support the "close" short—run connections in prices and rates of return across

 the Atlantic which the modern approach posits. Were gold flows "sufficiently"

elastic? Were interest rates "closely" linked?

     Our paper approaches these questions in two ways: First, we measure the

responsiveness of gold flows and the bandwidths of capital and commodity

relative price variation directly. While these direct measures provide some

evidence in favor of close international
                                           links, we argue that price bandwidths
or correlations alone are insufficient evidence to conclude that the modern

approach is superior to the price—specie—flow view.    The narrowness of
bandwidths must be measured relative to the macroeconomic ii.portance of

relative price deviations. That is, even if all relative prices were bounded

by bandwidths of one percent, if autonomous domestic interest rate movements

of, say, a half percent have large macroeconomic
                                                   effects (if, for example, the
IS curve is very flat) then the price—specie—flow view may
                                                             provide   a superior
description of the macroeconomic transmission of shocks.   Thus we argue that
                                      —4—



macroeconomic simulation models are the best way to establish which of the two

views is a more useful historical model for explaining events of the period.

      In sections II and III below we test various assumptions and conclusions

associated with the two competing views of international adjustment. We begin

in section II by presenting and interpreting separate pieces of evidence on

gold flows, interest rates, and selected commodity prices, as well as

summarizing related results from the literature, all of which shed light on

the alternative assumptions employed in the price—specie—flow and the modern

approaches. In section III we employ a monthly data set for the United States

and Britain f or the pre—World War I period in order to evaluate the overall

explanatory power of the respective frameworks. We compare the actual

historical importance of shocks and the observed patterns of short—run

adjustment to shocks with the predictions of each of the two models. Here we

employ the "structural VAR" approach for simultaneous—equations modeling

recently developed by Bernanke (1986) and Sims (1986). Section IV concludes

the paper.



II.   EVIDENCE ON MONEY SUPPLY ELASTICITY AND INTERNATIONAL INTEGRATION OF

      COMMODITY MID CAPITAL MARKETS



Gold—Flow Responsiveness

      Even an unsophisticated analysis of monthly   gold flows leads one to

question the so—called "stylized fact" of gold supply inelasticity; a formal

treatment of the relationships among gold flows and other variables is

relegated to section LII. Figure 1 shows that transitory net flows of gold in

the United States were often very large. The mean and standard deviation of

the monthly net outflow over the period 1885 to 1914 are $45,000 and $11
                                       —5--




 million, respectively. Positive net outflows have a mean of $8 million and a

 standard deviation of $7.6 million, while net inf lows have a mean of $6.2

 million and a standard deviation of $8.7 million. The ratio of the potential

 monthly flow of gold to the existing stock of gold is high, as well — in

 December 1907 and January 1908, total net gold inf lows amounted to $106

 million, compared to a stock of currency in circulation outside the Treasury

 of $3.07 billion — composed of $1.86 billion held by the public and $1.21

held by banks — and a total money supply (M,) of approximately $11.6

billion.

     Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions for monthly U.S.

gold flows are presented in Table 1. These patterns suggest an MA(2) process,

or possibly an AR(1). Under either specification, gold flows adjust fully to

disturbances within three months, with most of the adjustment occurring in the

first rinth. Coefficients, autocorrelation functions and partial

autocorrelation functions for residuals are presented in Table 2 for both

specifications.

     These results are not surprising given the existence of the transatlantic

telegraph, the market for gold, and the available technology for transporting

gold by steamship across the Atlantic in a matter of days. Officer (1986)

carefully estimates the costs of international gold transport and finds that

the observed gold price differentials virtually never violate his constructed

cost bandwidths which average roughly half of one percent.5



Cold Flows and Capital-Market Integration

     The evidence presented above suggests that any incipient rise in the

expected riskless rate of return (in gold terms) in the U.S. relative to

Britain of greater than 2 percent (annualized) would have been prevented by a
                                       —6—



short—term (six—month) capital inflow. The   capital   inflow could have been

profitably accomplished through a transitory gold export (and re—import) to

(and from) America.

     More specifically, a British investor observing a 2—percent interest

differential on six—month high—grade commercial paper could wire funds to New

York though a correspondent in London. The commercial paper purchase in New

York would be offset either by a temporary increase in American bankers'

balances in London (until the paper came due), or by a gold flow to the United

States. If the incipient interest rate gap had been the result of a money

multiplier shock, the latter likely would be the case.

     Such a calculation, unfortunately, is quite sensitive to the assumed

holding period of capital inflows. If one assumed a three-month holding

period instead of six months, the interest differential tolerance rises to 4

per cent. Investors certainly had access to commercial paper of six—month

maturity, hut they may have been reluctant to tie up their gold in the U.S.

for six months due to the consequent loss in liquidity. Knowledge of a

shadow—price—of—liquidity schedule for international investors would be

necessary in order to establish a relevant range of tolerable interest

differentials using this approach.



Interest Rate Arbitrage and   Capital—Market Integration
     The existence of currency spot and forward contracting provides a method

for constructing another set of bandwidths on the gold interest rate

differential. Forward contracting became increasingly prevalent beginning in

the 1870s (see Perkins, 1974), but implicit forward contracting had been

available   for centuries in the form of bills of exchange. A bill of exchange

is a promise to deliver some amount of one currency at a certain time in the
                                                   —7—



 future in exchange for some amount of another currency today. Thus a bill—of—

 exchange price can be derived from the interest rate on the currency paid

 today, the forward rate of exchange, the brokerage fee, and the date of

 delivery.

      The existence of international markets in commercial paper and bills of

 exchange, together with the transatlantic telegraph, places limits on the

 variation of interest rates across countries. These limits can be described

 in terms of the exclusion of arbitrage profit.

     Consider   the three markets portrayed in Figure 2: the "sight" market in
New York for immediate delivery of pounds in London,                       the sixty—day bill of
exchange   market in New York for delivery in London, and the London high—grade

commercial paper market.6 We define
                                                  i, t, and r3 as proportional brokerage
fees for dealing in these respective markets.

     A British arbitrageur could sell British commercial paper for pounds,

then sell those pounds for dollars through his agent in New York on the sight

market, and then instruct his agent to purchase sixty—day pounds with those

dollars. If the future pounds received, after considering transaction costs,

were in excess of the present value of the amount of pounds placed in the

initial transaction, arbitrage profits will be possible. Thus exclusion of

arbitrage profit implies:

would be virtually identical in New York and London.
                                       —9—



      Previous studies have rejected capital—market integration (in the form of

 interest rate parity) between New York and London on the basis of a nearly

 constant spot exchange rate series and a potentially large (typically

 positive) interest differential between short—term high—grade commercial paper

 offered in the two cities (see for example Officer, 1986, p. 1072). As Figure

 3 shows, this spread is potentially very high for the period before 1897.

     Friedman and Schwartz (1983, p. 515) recognize the potential role of

 "silver risk" in causing spikes in the observed commercial paper interest

differential. The possibility that the U.S. might have switched, de facto,

from a gold to a silver standard implies that dollar interest rates were a

probability—weighted, risk—discounted combination of gold and silver interest

rates. Thus large observed differentials between dollar and pound commercial

paper rates need not imply large differentials between U.S. and British rates

in gold terms. Garber (1986) argues that silver risk associated with the

Bland—Allison and Sherman Acts and the election of 1896 explains much of the

interest differential between long—term U.S. and foreign securities in the

late nineteenth century. Indeed, the role of silver risk in causing higher

interest rates in, and capital flight from, the U.S. is a common theme in the

popular literature of the day.7

     The lack of reliable data on forward rates has discouraged further tests

of this hypothesis. Fortunately, one does not need explicit forward rate data

in order to test interest rate parity and establish the role of silver risk in

the observed commercial paper interest differential. Bandwidths for condition

(3) may be calculated given data on the dollar price of sixty—day bills of

exchange and sight exchange rates in New York, and the relevant British

interest rate, all of which are available.8

from Statistics for the United States, 1867—1909, published by the National

Monetary Commission. These two series are plotted in Figure 4. The close

relationship between these series is clearly visible.

       In order to measure transaction cost bandwidths we calculate the middle

term in condition (3), which we call ARB. For the sample 1889:1 to 1909:12

ARB reached a maximum of 1.00001 and a minimum of 0.99646. For the subperiod

1897:1 to 1909:12 the range was essentially the same: 0.99657 to 0.99994.

Under the assumption of identical i's, (3) implies maximum r values equal to

one minus the cube root of 0.99646, or 0.00118. Combining (3) and (4) and

assuming a proportional gold transport cost of 0.005, the allowable positive

gold—denominated interest differential between New York and London is given

by:




       (5)        (1÷1L) = (1 —   0.005)(0.99646)(1 +


             NY
where g is the gold—denominated U.S. rate. This, and its complementary

condition, imply that:

       (6)   0.9915 (         1.0085.
                          g

 The actual range of values for the middle term of condition (6) for the period

 for which U.S. interest rates are clearly gold—denominated (after 1897) is

 from 0.995 to 1.00057.

        These calculations imply that the sixty—day U.S. interest rate implicit

 in the bill—of—exchange market is the same as the high—grade sixty—day U.S.

 commercial paper rate, adjusting for transaction costs. Thus gold interest

 parity is satisfied among the British open—market rate, the U.S. rate, and the

 implicit U.S. rate in the bill—of—exchange market, adjusting for transaction

cost.9

       Our results imply that the observed range of interest rate differentials

between the U.S. and Britain for the period after the silver crisis is a good

approximation of the range of gold interest differentials before the crisis,

given the stability of arbitrage bandwidths. In other words, annual gold

interest rate differentials on high—grade commercial paper in the U.S. and

Britain were essentially within 2 percent of one another for the thirty years

prior to World War I.

       These calculations by themselves tell us little about the effective

domestic autonomy of regions within the U.S., or the nation as a whole, for

two reasons. First, we lack a standard against which to measure the

importance of a 2 percent potential international interest rate spread.

Second, the existence of imperfect capital markets implies that shocks to

local "information capital" — described in Calomiris and Hubbard (1986) ——

will   not be solved by capital inflows. That is, not all economic activity can

be financed by the commercial paper market.
                                          —12--




    At the same time,   the   interest rate parity calculations are useful for

two reasons. First, they demonstrate that the apparent relative weakness of

capital market links prior to 1896 is an artifact of the mismeasurement of the

numeraire, rather than a substantive difference. Second, the 2—percent

bandwidths place limits on the potential for explaining macroeconomic

fluctuations in a perfect—capital—markets, closed—economy, IS—LM framework.

     In particular, the latitude for domestic money—multiplier shocks to be

transmitted to output through the domestic money market's effect on the

interest rates of traded securities is substantially circumscribed. The exact

limitations on the causal role of money supply shocks, per se, depend on —

inter   alia — the responsiveness of investment and consumption to interest

rate shocks. If one found that investment were unresponsive to interest rate

movements of 2 percent —      i.e.,   if business cycles are hard to explain as

movements along an IS curve within 2 percent bandwidths — then an emphasis on

IS shocks, or on credit-market disturbances under imperfect capital markets,

would be warranted. These issues will be taken up again in our discussion of

changing interest rate seasonality, and in section III.



Defining the Scope of the Financial Market: Tests of Integration

    McCloskey and Zecher (1985) point out that what is primarily at issue in

the debate over the international transmission of disturbances is the

geographical boundaries of the basic unit of macroeconomic analysis. Defining

a national monetary aggregate, the domestic balance of trade and national GNP

and organizing one's discussion around these definitions implicitly presumes

that market integration within the United States is substantially greater

than, say, the integration between New York and London markets. MeCloskey and

Zecher argue cogently that the proper way to test our aggregation boundaries
                                       —13—



 and models of the international transmission of shocks is to compare arbitrage

 limits within a country with those between countries. They call this the

 "Genberg—Zecher criterion." McCloskey and Zecher (1976) find that commodity

price co—movements within the United States are no stronger than those between

New York and London. They conclude that national boundaries are an arbitrary

means of defining economic units for commodity trade under the classical gold
standard. 10


     One may apply the Cenberg—Zecher criterion to the gold market by

comparing international gold points with exchange rate premia and discounts

across different cities within the United States. International gold points

derived from Officer (1986) for the period October 1900 to March 1907 are

always less than 0.5 per cent. Data for this period for exchange rates on New

York from Chicago, St. Louis, New Orleans, and San Francisco show that

deviations from New York gold prices in Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans are

contained within bandwidths of 0.1 percent (with the exception of the

suspension of 1907). For San Francisco, inter—city bandwidths are often

slightly higher.

     These results illustrate the difficulty of employing the Genberg—Zecher

criterion as a test of market integration. While this criterion offers

sufficient grounds for rejecting the extreme view of nationally integrated,

domestically autonomous economies, it does not by itself tell us which

direction to go in placing boundaries on the basic macroeconomic unit. Is a

large international scope or a narrow regional scope more appropriate? What

is lacking is an independent measure of how "small" a gold point of 0.1 or 0.5

percent is in economic terms.

     The speed of adjustment and reversal of gold flows following transient

r!loney—multiplier disturbances sheds some light on the question of whether
                                       —14—



regional or international scope is best for understanding macroeconomic

phenomena at, say, an annual time horizon. The regional pattern of gold flows

during crisis supports the view of New York as an active entrepot between the

domestic interior and London, with elastic gold flows in both directions. For

example, from October 18 to December 27, 1907 net shipments of gold from banks

in New York to the U.S. interior total $129 million. From January 3 to
                                                                              12
January 31 fully $69 million in net shipments had returned to New York.

International accounts also show this rapid inf low and outflow of gold. From

June through September 1907 net gold exports total $29 million; from October

1907 to April 1908 net gold imports total $122 million; from May to September

1908 net gold exports total $45 million. The upshot of these findings is that

in annual —   or   a fortiori "business—cycle" —   time,   the market for gold

operates well enough that gold sluggishness per se cannot be faulted for

persistent macroeconomic fluctuations.

     In analyzing these international gold flows it is important to note that

the elasticity of gold flows does not imply that real shocks ——      in   particular,

shocks to credit markets which affect borrowers' wealth and banks' credit-

worthiness —   will   be alleviated by gold flows. Gold flows are endogenous to

aggregate real economic activity and generally will respond procyclically, as

well as in response to shifts in the domestic demand for gold relative to

other commodities.



Capital—Market Integration and the Changing Seasonality of Interest Rates

     Miron (1986) reports a significant reduction in the seasonality of call

loan rates after the founding of the Federal Reserve System. By itself, this

result seems to argue in favor of viewing the U.S. money supply as

significantly (if not importantly) domestically determined. Miron explains
                                      —15--




 this finding by an appeal to "sluggish" gold flows, and hence, at least short—

 run domestic autonomy. In particular, Miron argues that gold supply

 sluggishness made the economy vulnerable to large seasonal swings in interest

 rates due to money—multiplier disturbances.

      Clark (1986) disputes Miron's interpretion that the establishment of the

 Fed was responsible for the reduction in interest rate seasonality. Clark

 demonstrates that the reduction in interest rate seasonality was an

 international phenomenon, and that the timing of the seasonality shift occurs

 prior to the seasonality shift in currency and high—powered money. Moreover,

 the changes in seasonal patterns Miron observes are not evenly spread —    that
 is, the overall reduction in seasonality is mainly due to reductions in the

largest seasonals which represent average interest rate fluctuations of

between 3 and 5 percent. Our interest rate parity calculations imply that

such large fluctuations could not have occurred in the United States in the

absence of similar movements in international interest rates. Thus Clark's

findings — together with the 2—percent bandwidths of interest rate
                                                                   parity we
report — argue against the view that large swings in interest rates in the

U.S. before 1914 were caused by inelastic gold and capital flows. Of course,

as we pointed out before, the Fed could have had important macroeconomic

influence as a creditor to banks, regardless of its influence over the

aggregate supply of money, per Se. This would be consistent with Miron's

finding of increased loan seasonality after the founding of the Fed.



Why Construct Bandwiths of Autonomous Relative Conmodity Price Variation?

    Short—run commodity price linkages across countries are not a necessary

condition for money supply elasticity. Bandwidths of relative international

commodity price variation, however, place restrictions on the variations in
                                       —16—



the short—run terms of trade, and hence on short—run movements in the current

account, which may have important macroeconomic consequences.

    Much of the previous work on international commodity price linkages
                                                                            —
summarized in McCloskey and Zecher (1985) — has focused on comparisons of

price co—movements as measured by regression coefficients of one price or

price level on another, or by simple correlation.    This is not an appropriate

method for answering the question, "how closely linked are prices?," in an

environment where transaction and information costs create bandwidths of

autonomous domestic price variation. To see this, suppose that most important

incipient macroeconomic disturbances — say, to the domestic money multiplier

— would   imply (ceteris paribus) nominal price changes of at least, say,

5—percent. Furthermore, suppose that estimated relative price bandwidths are

1—percent. This is an environment in which autonomous domestic shocks are not

important, one in which the "law of one price" is the most useful assumption

for understanding price movements over the business cycle.

     Will the economy — under the conditions we have assumed —     necessarily
show a high correlation between national commodity prices or price levels?

The answer is no. If substantial shocks occur infrequently and if most of the

time prices move independently within the 1—percent bandwidths, correlation

between the two may be weak. This example illustrates the importance of

measuring bandwidths and evaluating the economic importance of their size,

rather than calculating correlations or regression coefficients to determine

the validity of the assumption of close short—run international price
            13
linkages.

     From the outset it is important to separate two potential motivations for

constructing     relative price bandwidths. One is to determine whether observed

deviations of relative commodity prices from unity can be explained in a
                                          —17—



 manner consistent with zero economic profit; the second is to determine

 whether the bandwidths are narrow enough to preclude iportant potential

 relative price changes important for macroeconomic fluctuations.

     With respect to the first motivation one can adjust price differentials

 for tariffs, insurance costs, the cost of transportation, and a "fair" rate of

 return, and then test to see if observed relative prices violate the

constructed bounds. Assuming we can thus explain relative price deviations as

the drift between speculative bandwidths, we must then ask whether these

speculative bandwidths are "narrow" or "wide" from the standpoint of

macroeconomic importance. For example, how much of the variation in the

balance of trade can be attributed to domestic price disturbances within the

relative price bandwidths? Section III provides the best framework for

quantifying —   inter   alia — the importance of autonomous domestic price

movements for the balance of trade.'4

     Testing the zero—economic—profits assumption is interesting in itself,

because of the connection between zero economic profits and domestic price

flexibility. Domestic price flexibility —        i.e.,   the responsiveness of prices

to aggregate demand shocks —    is   separable from the question of narrow

international price bandwidths. Domestic prices may be responsive, but

insulated by transaction costs from international price movements. Therefore,

price flexibility is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for short—

run international price parity. Thus evidence of responsive domestic prices

for this period — as described in Calomiris and Hubbard (1986), DeLong and

Summers (1986), Rush (1985), and Sachs (1980), —         is   encouraging but not

conclusive for the proponents of price arbitrage, while the demonstration of

international price linkages across many commodities provides direct support

for the assumption of price flexibility, even if price bandwidths are very

large. In other words, deionstrating that prices can change quickly when
                                       —18—



there exists an incentive to change them —    i.e.,   that long—run bandwidths are

the same as short—run bandwidths — provides evidence in favor of flexible

prices regardless of the size of the bandwidths. Thus the important issue of

domestic price flexibility is logically related to the question of whether

arbitrageurs earn zero economic profits, rather than to the question of how

much the terms of trade may vary with aggregate demand shocks.



Testing the Zero—Econoide—Profit Hypothesis: Cotton, Wheat, and    Sugar
     In   principle, one could construct bandwidths for all traded goods and

describe the restrictions they impose on the price level in a disaggregated

macroeconomic model with many individual supply and demand equations.

Alternatively, one could argue for a particular weighting scheme across

commodities and derive representative price bounds for traded goods as a

whole. This would be different, of course, from inferring price bounds from

the wholesale price index and assuming such bounds are representative.

    We undertake neither of these procedures for the following reasons.

First, even if one had a plausible set of weights to establish representative

bandwidths, the issue of a standard against which to judge whether such bounds

are wide or narrow naturally arises. As we have argued at length above,

simulation models are the proper way to evaluate the economic importance of

drift within speculative bandwidths. Second, in practice we have found it

difficult to construct comparable price series for Britain and the United

States for many commodities. Some data reported in, or summarized from, trade

journals fail to quote prices at clearly specified points in time. Often the

precise grade of the commodity is left vague, as. well. Many times even the

unit of measure is unclear. For example, there are many     meanings to the word
"bushel," some of which may vary in use geographically within England. Many

sources fail to distinguish explicitly among "shipping," "railroad freight,"
                                      —1 9-•




 "dry," "liquid," and "avoirdupois" measures, which can be very different.

 Often units can be inferred from long—run price ratios, but obviously such an

 inference precludes tests of price linkages.

      For these reasons we only report results for three commodities —     Cotton,
 wheat, and raw sugar. Calculations for these commodities will serve to test

 the zero—profit condition and thereby establish the degree of price

 flexibility for internationally traded goods.

      First, we consider cotton, defined in pounds of middling—grade raw

 fiber.15 Each country's end—of--month price series, and the ratio of the two

 price series, are given in Figure 5. There was no tariff applied to raw

 Cotton in either Britain or the U.S. The relative price of U.S. cotton is

almost always in the neighborhood of 0.9. The lower U.S. price is explained

by the fact that cotton is indigenous to the United States and not to

Britain. There are virtually no persistent deviations beyond the bounds 0.88

and 0.95. Any penetration of these bounds may be viewed as unforseeable and

transitory. These bounds are narrow relative to the short—run v-ariation in

prices within each country — Cotton prices frequently fall or rise by 50—100

percent within a matter of months.

     Is a l2—percent sustainable price differential consistent with a "fair"

rate of return? It would seem so. The shipping costs for cotton quoted in

Fairplay for 1880 through 1913 are in the range of 5 percent, including

primage. We abstract from reductions over time in transport costs, which were

gradual and small relative to total speculative costs. Table 3 shows the

reduction in the nominal and real transport cost index from 1880 to 1910.     If

one adds to transport cost a standard insurance fee of between 1 and 2 percent

and considers "shoe—leather" costs, cotton price risk, and a two—month

financing cost of 1 percent (assuming a two—month response lag due to the time
                                     —20—



it takes to purchase, deliver, and receive payment for a shipment), a

persistent deviation in relative price of 10 to 12 percent seems reasonable.

    When performing similar calculations for wheat and sugar one must adjust

for the tariffs placed on these commodities by the United States. Tariffs do

not affect the incentives of speculators contemplating a shipment from the

United States, but do affect the incentives to ship from Britain to the United

States. To be explicit, efficient speculation implies:



    (7)   Ps(1—d) — c > GB' and



    (8)       < P —

       w and GB
where "US
              w are the American and British prices of wheat, respectively,

d is the ad valorem duty on wheat in the United States, and c is speculative

cost — inclusive of finance, transport, insurance, and shoe—leather costs,

and price risk. If (7) were violated, shipments of goods from Britain to the

U.S. would imply excess profit; if (8) were violated, shipments from the U.S.

to Britain would imply excess profit.

     This provides two independent means of testing bounds on c. Persistent

deviations below unity in the unadjusted relative price (uS'GB should be

greater than (1—c); persistent deviations above unity in the tariff—adjusted

relative price should be bounded by (1+c). End—of—month wheat prices and

price ratios — simple and tariff—adjusted — appear in Figure 5. The

unadjusted price ratio is almost always above 0.9, while the adjusted ratio

almost never is above 1.1. These results thus imply similar price bounds to

those derived for cotton.
                                       —21—



     The same exercise may   be performed for sugar prices, plotted in Figure
7. As in the case of wheat and cotton, price variations within each country

are potentially great, while price bounds imply that persistent relative—price

deviations are contained by bounds on speculative profit. That is, the sugar

price ratio adjusted for tariffs is generally below 1.1, while the simple

ratio never falls below unity because tariffs rendered unprofitable the export

of sugar from the U.S.

     This last observation illustrates the difficulty in drawing inferences

about domestic autonomy from tests of economic profit. No profits were

possible for exporting sugar from the U.S. because tariffs insulated the U.S.

price of sugar from the prices in other markets.

     In summary, wholesale prices for traded goods appear to have been

flexible. Speculators responded quickly to profit incentives and thereby

preserved price parity, adjusted for cost. Given the homogeneity of most

goods and the relative absence of long—term contracting during our period, we

view wholesale price data as representative of prices more generally. This

period contrasts with the current economic setting in which long—term

contracting and product differentiation make the assumption of wholesale price

representativenegs dubious (see Hicks, 1974). Mills (1932, pp. 78-86) finds

that the variation in manufactured goods prices on an annual basis for the

pre—Worid War I years matches that of raw materials, but that raw materials

prices are more volatile from month to month. Mills also finds that overall

monthly consumer price variability matches that of producer prices, with the

same distinction between the volatility of raw and processed goods prices.

Suary     ofFindings on International Integration in Capital Markets and
          Coiodity Markets
     We have established several propositions relevant for understanding

international adjustment under the gold standard. Gold flows were elastic, in

the sense that innovations in the desired distribution of gold led to rapid

adjustment (i.e., full adjustment occurs in under three months). Commodity

flows were similarly responsive, though the bandwidths of autonomous relative

price movement are greater (10 to 12 percent as opposed to 0.5 percent). The

tolerance for the gold—denominated interest differential between the U.S. and

Britain is essentially constant throughout the period (if one adjusts properly

for currency risk) at roughly 2 percent. Changes in interest rate seasonality

are explained mainly by events which have international scope.

     As we have noted frequently in our discussion, these results alone do not

provide a conclusive test of short—run domestic autonomy because they cannot

tell us how iiiiportant, from a macroeconomic perspective, were autonomous

domestic deviations in interest rates and prices. To this end, section III

develops a simulation model of macroeconomic disturbances.



III. SIMULATION OF THE MACROECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF DOMESTIC
                 AND INTERNATIONAL SHOCKS

     Our goal here is to measure the relative importance of domestic and

international shocks in financial and commodity markets for influencing

output, interest rates, prices, gold flows, and the balance of trade. For

example, were domestic money supply shocks, per Se, an important source of

macroeconomic disturbance? How do money—supply shocks compare in importance

to disturbances   in   money—demand, or other macroeconomic disturbances? How

important are changes in the terms—of—trade for short—run movements in the
balance   of trade? In order to answer these questions we construct a model of

the U.S. economy and its international linkages.
                                      —23—




 Data and Econometric Approach

      Our results from section II imply potentially rapid adjustment of

 interest rates, prices, and commodity and gold flows. In order to capture

 important features of shocks and responses, we construct a monthly dataset

 which includes U.S. and British interest rates and wholesale price indices,

 and U.S. data on exports, imports, gold flows, and output (using pigiron

 production as a proxy).16 We begin our sample in January 1897 —   after   the

 "silver crisis" years — and end it in June 1914, before the outbreak of war.

      In order to analyse dynamic adjustment to disturbances we adopt an

approach recently developed by Bernanke (1986) and Sims (1986) as an

alternative to "reduced—form" recursive identification of disturbances. The

alternative "structural VAR" approach permits one to solve a simultaneous—

equations model in innovations in which orthogonalized shocks and their

interrelations are associated with functions, not with variables. The first

stage of a structural VAR model is identical to a standard VAR — lagged

values of all variables are included to estimate reduced—form predictions, and

to derive series of unpredicted innovations (which are correlated across

variables). In the next stage, one posits a matrix of contemporaneous

functional relationships which can be tested and which imply time series of

orthogonalized shocks to the hypothesized functions.

     One then calculates impulse responses of each variable in the system to

shocks which originate in particular functions, and decompositions of each

variable's forecast variance, which attribute one's uncertainty regarding the

future of any particular variable to each of the functional shocks.    Impulse

responses and variance decompositions together permit one to infer the time—

path of a given shock's influence on all variables, as well as its economic

importance.

A Siiltaneoue-Equat1ons           Model for the U.S.
     We posit seven functional relationships for our seven—variable model: an

equilibrium—output equation for the U.S., an exogenously determined

international (British) riskiess interest rate, U.S. money—supply and money—

demand equations, demand functions for U.S. imports and exports, and a desired

short—run capital—flow equation, which we set equal to the balance of trade net of

gold flows. These functions are described in equations (9) through (15) below.

 disturbance to desired net foreign savings, Y is the equilibrium—output

 disturbance (which includes IS shocks and supply—side credit shocks, as

 discussed in the Appendix). M* is the shock to the demand for imports. P is

 the export—demand disturbance. G is the innovation in U.S. demand for money

 (gold).

      The U.S. money—supply equation assumes that net gold imports respond

positively to U.S., and negatively to British, interest—rate innovations.

     Equation (11) posits that U.S. desired short—run net savings responds

positively to foreign, and negatively to own, interest—rate changes.

     Our specification of the equililbrium output equation (12) assumes

negative interest elasticity in aggregate demand, as well as a positive

relative domestic price response in aggregate supply. In addition, we posit a

negative interest elasticity in aggregate supply and a positive price—response

in aggregate demand and supply which arise in the presence of imperfect

capital markets and nominal contracting (seethe Appendix and Calomiris and

Hubbard, 1986, and 1987).

     The U.S. demand for imports is assumed to depend positively on P and Y,

and negatively on i. We write export demand as a negative function of P,

and an indeterminate function of i-. The sign of L in equation (14) depends

on whether foreign interest—rate innovations are associated mainly with

expansion or contraction abroad.

     The money demand equation assumes a standard formulation in which shocks

to desired money balances, and hence net gold inflows, are related to

disturbances in price, income, and the interest rate.

    There are two criteria against w'hich to measure the reasonableness of

this identification of functional disturbances. One is the estimated

coefficients (and standard errors) of the matrix of contemporaneous

disturbances —     i.e.,   how many coefficients are of the right sign? The other

involves the time paths of the impulse response functions to each functional

disturbance. If, for example, negative shocks to the supposed money-supply

innovation equation (positive i shocks) imply positive output and negative

interest rate responses, it would be difficult to believe that one properly

had identified a money—supply disturbance.



Estimation Results

    We regress each of the original seven variables in our model on six

lagged values of all variables, monthly dummies, a time trend, and the tariff

on pigiron. We include the tariff in order to abstract from relative supply

shifts, given our use of pigiron as the output proxy. We save these reduced

form equations for use in simulation and define their residuals as the

innovations y, 1NY, 1L, x, M, P, and G, modeled in system (9) through (15).

     The results for the simultaneous—equations model in innovations are given

below (standard errors appear in parentheses):

     Only one of the coefficients in this system of equations contradicts our

model — the sign on Y in the money—demand equation is negative. All thirteen

other estimated coefficients are of the right sign and some are measured

precisely. As Sims (1986, p. 12) notes, however, the method we use for

constructing standard errors need not be very             accurate    since it is based on an

approximate second—derivative matrix.

     As we noted before, the coefficients in the contemporaneous—association

matrix are not conclusive by themselves. The best way to verify our

functional identification of disturbances is to determine the "reasonableness"

of the simulated responses to the hypothesized shocks.

     At the same time, not all impulse responses merit equal weight in

determining the reasonableness of our identification. Rather, one wishes to

ascertain whether the iaportant sources of disturbances in the model are

consistent with our identification matrix. The importance of disturbances for

influencing any variable's future may be measured by the forecast variance
                                                        —28--




decomposition              of that variable. For example, functional disturbances in

export demand are important for gold inflows if they play a large role in

explaining future uncertainty about gold inflows.



S1ilation               Results
          Forecast—variance decompositions which describe the percent contribution

from each functional disturbance to each variable in the system at time

horizons of 3, 12, and 20 months are given in Table 4. Beside these figures,

we indicate whether the sign of the impulse response at that time horizon is

positive (+),               negative   (—),   or   essentially zero (N). Table 4 allows us to

test our identifying assumptions by making sure that important sources of

disturbances have effects consistent with our model.

          At the same time, Table 4 allows us to assign relative importance to

domestic and international factors in the determination of output, prices,

interest rates, gold flows, and foreign trade. In particular, one can

ascertain: whether — as the modern approach predicts — exports and imports

are responsive in the short run to relative price changes; whether prices or

income respond importantly to money—supply shocks; and whether shocks to net

savings,            and export and import demand, contribute greatly to price and
interest—rate variation (as the modern approach predicts), relative to
domestic shocks which are independent of international developments

              ,   Y , and G ).
           The         signs of impulse responses are quite supportive of the model's
identifying assumptions. U.S. money—supply contractions not explained by gold
flows — i.e., money—multiplier shocks — are captured in        Such shocks
produce unimportant contractions in output and have a less persistent effect
on                than do changes in international interest rates         (1L)• Money   supply
                                         —29—



shocks have a persistent, positive effect on gold flows, though this accounts

only for roughly 4 percent of gold—flow forecast variance. U.S. money—supply

shocks have virtually no effect on relative international prices in the short,

or long, run. This provides strong evidence against the causal role of

autonomous money supply shocks for U.S. business cycles.

     British interest rate innovations seem to be associated with

international expansion, reflected in lagging, but important, positive effects

on U.S. exports. A direct link to the U.S. economy comes from the negative

impact of higher foreign interest rates on output through interest—rate

parity.

     Innovations in desired net savings (X*) play an important role in the

determination of the U.S. interest rate, short—run commodity price movements

(which dampen quickly), imports, and exports. All of these effects are of the

predicted signs — a desire to save more leads to a period of high exports,

low commodity and gold imports, low relative domestic prices, and a lower U.S.

interest rate. The response of output to the savings shock is harder to

explain. The initial positive, and subsequent negative, response of output

may reflect a very short—run "Keynesian" contraction followed by a longer—run

"equilibrium" expansion in response to a reduction in the propensity to

consume.

     Shocks coming from domestic aggregate supply and demand (y*) which are

unrelated to monetary disturbances, saving preferences, international

interest—rate disturbances and the demands for imports and exports play an

important role in short—run domestic interest rate determination. Imports

respond positively to income innovations, as do interest rates. The positive

response of both interest rates and income to equilibrium output shocks

reflects ——   in   the context of the model described in the Appendix — a
                                                   —30—



positive correlation between aggregate supply and demand disturbances. In

Calomiris and Hubbard (1986) we argue that disturbances to credit markets will

be a source of positive correlation between aggregate supply and demand shocks

 (see also Blinder, 1985, and Bernanke, 1981, and 1983).

     The negative response of gold flows to output innovations — which

mirrors the negative estimataed coefficient on Y in equation (15) appears

puzzling and is a relatively important contributor to future gold flows.

     One way to explain this finding is to appeal to the relationship between

current output innovations and predictable future changes in the money

multiplier. If current positive innovations in output lead to increased

overall money demand and predict an increase in the money multipliei, then

output innovations may               be negatively associated with current gold flows
through anticipatory gold demand. Evidence for co—movements between output

growth and the money—multiplier appears in Cagan (1965, p. 25). Cagan finds

that at peaks and troughs money—multiplier changes are more closely associated

with income than variations in high—powered money, and that the money—

multiplier is pro—cyclical. Our use of monthly data precludes a direct test

of this hypothesis since we lack data on the currency—to—deposit and reserve—

to—deposit ratios at that frequency.

     Another explanation — which also relies on a supposed negative

correlation between output shocks and the money multiplier — emphasizes the

role of credit, as opposed to money shocks. In an environment of imperfect

capital markets, the effects of money—multiplier shocks may not be fully

captured by money—supply shocks (i). In this case, output movements (y*)

will contain marginal information regarding current money—multiplier shocks,

over and above i            •   In   this case gold flows are not anticipatory; rather it

is current money—multiplier shocks which account for the correlation between

 Y and G. It is important to note that this does t                   *
                                                         imply that Y should be
 interpreted as a money—supply disturbance in disguise. Money—supply shocks,

 per Se, will be fully reflected in the shadow price of liquidity (iNY3.       *
                                                                              Y may

 contain additional information, however, related to credit shocks which follow

 from reductions in the money multiplier. For an extended discussion of this

 point, see Bernanke (1983) and Calomiris and Hubbard (1986).

      These potential connections between output movements and money—multiplier

shocks raises the possibility that —   contrary   to our model's restriction —
G* and Y should be correlated, because of the omission of the
                                                              money—

multiplier from the model. In this case, equation (15) will properly measure

gold demand, but not money demand defined more    broadly.   G* shocks have

effects on U.S. prices and interest rates consistent with viewing equation

(15) as a gold—demand function.

     Innovations in export and import demands — which may reflect, inter

alia, changes in preferences, tariff changes not captured by price indices, or

measurement errors due to price aggregation —     provide strong support for our
model. Impulse responses to a positive shift in import demand imply the

predicted negative U.S. relative—price response, a lesser response in exports

and a rise in the interest differential between U.S. and British securities,

which implies a consistent movement along the net foreign savings function.

     Response patterns to shocks from export demand provide further support

for the model. Export demand shocks raise relative U.S. prices, and produce a

positive repsonse in commodity imports and gold inflows.

     On the whole, our results provide evidence in favor of elastic responses

to relative commodity prices. Moreover, shocks to desired savings and export

and import demands, explain between 70 and 75 percent of the forecast variance
                                     —32—



of relative price at all time horizons. Export and import demands by

themselves account for roughly 50 percent. This contrasts sharply with the

relatively small contributions to relative prices from      or money—supply

shocks.



IV. CONCLUSION

      To summarize, in section II we find evidence which supports close direct

asset and commodity price linkages across countries in the short run. Gold

flows respond rapidly to the demand for gold. Interest rate parity, adjusted

for "silver risk" and transaction costs, held with the same force throughout

our sample. Commodity prices were flexible in the sense that short—run

wholesale price adjustment across countries was not sluggish relative to long

run   movements.
      Our results from section III Indicate that the bandwidths of transaction

costs in markets f or internationally traded securities were narrow in the

sense that domestic money—supply shocks, per se, were not an important source

of output variation. Domestic money—supply shocks did influence exports and

gold flows by affecting incentives for capital and money accumulation. The

short—run price elasticities of import and export demand functions are a

significant and important channel of influence from international disturbances

to relative international prices, while autonomous domestic disturbances are

unimportant for the ratio of international price indices.

      Though a more thorough treatment of the sources of unexplained

disturbances in output is beyond the scope of this paper, we argue elsewhere

(Calomiris and Hubbard, 1986) that capital market disturbances — which affect

both aggregate supply and demand in an environment of imperfect information —

account for the (equilibrium) fluctuations in output which characterize
                                      —33--




pre—tiorid War I business cycles. This approach proves fruitful for explaining

the priority of price to output shocks noted by DeLong and Summers (1986), and

their long—run co—movements (i.e., the Phillips curve). It also provides a

rationale for the predictive role of money for nominal income —   i.e.,   the

money stock is linked to real changes in bank loan supply which respond,

inter alia, to deflationary shocks.

Notes

1Specifically,   we show that price flexibility can have adverse effects on
      macroeconomic performance through constraints on the availability of
      credit in the presence of nominal contracting in financial markets. We
      examine links between price flexibility and credit rationing within the
      framework of models of imperfect information in loan markets.
2
    We discuss below the difficulty of defining "narrow" in a way which permits
      a useful test of domestic price autonomy.

    It is important to note that these assumptions do not imply the irrelevance
      of central bank lending to domestic banks; merely that the influence such
      loans may have does not come from an effect on the money supply per Se.
      tn Calomiris and Hubbard (1986) we argue that capital—market
      imperfections, and hence the well—being of banks and borrowers, played an
      important role in propagating pre—World War I business cycles. In this
      context, government assistance to beleaguered banks could have had
      important macroeconomic consequences. In that paper, we show that the
      observed correspondences between money and nominal income growth, and
      between inflation and real income growth (the Phillips Curve), are
      consistent with a regime of elastic gold supply, flexible prices, and
      capital market imperfections. This contrasts with the standard approach
      to explaining these correspondences which abstracts from capital market
      imperfections, and assumes an inelastic money supply and rigid prices.

    Gold flows are defined as the difference between gold imports and exports
      (See Data Appendix). Currency holdings of banks and individuals, and
      total money supply, are taken from Friedman and Schwartz, Monetary
      Statistics of the United States, p. 402 and p. 65, respectively.

    Officer reports costs which vary over time and depending on country of
      origin. Because the British had lower interest rates, which enter into
      the cost of shipping, gold export costs are typically higher than half a
      percent with an average of 0.65 percent over the period 1890 to 1904.
      Officer's calculations overstate the gold cost of U.S. exports, however,
      because he interprets U.S. interest rates to be gold interest rates. As
      we show below, U.S. interest rates in gold terms were much closer to
      British levels than previously recognized, once one adjusts for silver
      devaluation risk.
6
    Figure 2 is inspired by Deardorff (1979).

    That currency risk was a significant potential problem was certainly on the
      minds of contemporary chroniclers of international business conditions.
      The large outflows of gold associated with the fulfillment of the Sherman
      Act precipitated a lack of .confidence in the ability of the U.S. Treasury
      to maintain its commitment to the gold standard. Consider for example
      these representative accounts from foreign correspondents of the Economist
      magazine.

      "The first bomb which was dropped this week was that by the President in
      his decision not to issue or sell bonds, in order to maintain the
      $100,000,000 of gold reserve in the Treasury ... The first effect of this
                                        —35—



      unexpected news was to intensify the feeling of depression which had gone
      before, and prices of the more active securities promptly declined.
      Europe was not slow to observe the drift here and joined the ranks of
      sellers." (March 4, 1893, p. 265).

      "While President Cleveland's inaugural address shows that he holds sound
      views on the currency question, it remains to be seen to what extent he
      will be able to make those views prevail." (March 11, 1893, p. 289).

      "...it would appear, therefore, that for some time longer doubts as to the
      ability of the Treasury to maintain the parity of silver and gold will
      continue to act as a drag upon business in the States, to depreciate the
      value of American securities, and to cause a certain uneasiness and want
      of stability in the European money markets." (March 11. 1893, p. 290).

      "With the renewal of gold exports from the United States, the fear that
      the Treasury will not be able to maintain gold payments, and that the
      country will, by force of circumstance, be compelled to content itself
      with the single silver standard, has revived ... Now it is quite evident
      that the Treasury cannot go on losing gold, and at the same time piling up
      liabilities payable in gold on demand in the way it has been doing,
      without imperilling the convertibility of its notes." (April 15, 1893, p.
      442).

      "In 1890, prior to the passing of the Sherman Act, the reserve
      exceeded £38,000,000 while the outstanding government notes redeemable in
      gold amounted to a little under £67,000,000. Since then, however a two-
      fold process has been in operation. The Treasury has been steadily losing
      gold, while it has been continuously issuing notes to the amount of
      £11,000,000 a year in payment of its compulsory purchases of silver.
      the reserve continues to dwindle, and the volume of paper money to
      increase, with the result that the apprehensions that have long been felt
      lest the Treasury should be unable to maintain gold payments have at least
      reached the acute stage. ... it  is this that is at the bottom of all the
      trade and financial disturbance to which our New York correspondent today
      calls attention. ...the ability of the Treasury to maintain the gold
      value of all this money has come to be seriously questioned; there is a
      sharp contraction of credit, and a consequent collapse of many over—
      inflated concerns." (June 3, 1893, p. 656).

    New York prices for sixty—day and sight bills are from Statistics for the
      United States, 1867—1909, published by the National Monetary Commission in
      1910. The monthly average of the London open—market rate is NBER series
      13016, based on weekly data from The Economist.

    Another approach to establishing this three—way parity relationship, which
      abstracts from the existence of transaction costs, is to compare the
      results of the following two regressions:



              NY          L
      (a) i =a0          i +c, and
                                       —36—




(b) i o          + 8i(FSR)'      +



If the New York conimerical paper rate is equal to the London rate plus a
time—varying error term which captures silver risk, a1 and    should be
unity; a0 should be zero and          negative one; the R—squared for the two
regressions should be the same; and the correlation between c and
should be perfect. Our results are as follows (standard errors are in
parentheses):



 (a) ti 0.0056 + 0.486 i +
         (0.0003) (0.056)
             R—squared =   0.23;

 (b) ti = — 0.4925 + 0.497            (FSR)1 + r t
               (0.0508)     (0.051)

             R—squared = 0.28;


 (c)n    =    0.956    c
                             t
             (0.009)

             R—squared = 0.98.


 In the presence of transaction costs, these estimated coefficients will
 be biased, since cost bandwidths imply a tolerance for the independent
 movement of asset prices. The regression coefficients will represent an
 averaging of episodes when interest rates move large distances together
 and small distances independently. This explains why —— even though
 interest rates are closely linked — the exact predictions of the model
 which abstracts from transaction costs do not hold in regressions
 (7) through (9). This also explains why the         coefficient is slightly
larger than a1, and why the R—squared for (8) is larger than that
for (7): the nominal U.S. rate is more closely linked to the U.S. gold
rate (FSR) than to the London gold rate (1)• As we will point out
again in our discussion of commodity bandwidths, this is an argument
against using regression coefficients, and in favor of calculating
bandwidths, if one is interested in evaluating the economic importance of
autonomous domestic price movements.

'°We discuss the McCloskey and Zecher approach to measuring price co—movements
    in more detail below. We argue that the price bandwidths we report
    provide a better measure of market integration than correlation or
    regression statistics like those reported in McCloskey and Zecher (1976,

14McCloskey and Zecher (1985) regress the balance of trade on ratios or
    relative price indices and find insignificant and unimportant coefficients
    on the relative price terms in their regressions. Evidence we report
    below indicates that these results may be a misleading indicator of the
    effect of relative price differences on the balance of trade.

15For sources of commodity price data see the Data Appendix.

16The well—known Persons (1931) index of industrial production relies mainly
    on bank clearings and other variables of questionable relevance for
    output. Another alternative, the level of imports, is unattractive for
    our purposes because price effects on imports are contaminated by the
    terms—of—trade effect. Pig iron is highly correlated (with a correlation
    coefficient of 0.84 in growth rates) with total non—agricultural commodity
    output, on an annual basis. Hull (1911) argues that iron is the
    "barometer of trade" because of its ubiquitous presence as an output.

                             DERIVING THE EQUILIBRIUM OUTPUT EQUATION

       We begin by considering the aggregate supply function:

            Y      s1P +                       +   a
                              s2L(i)
where 81 and           are positive coefficients, L is the supply—determined level of
bank loans; Y, i, and P are innovations in output, the interest rate, and the
price level; and a is a positive unexplained aggregate—supply shock. We let
                                          *
            L(i)      = — ai +        L    ,   a > 0.

     Loan supply enters the aggregate supply equation as a proxy for the
availability of "information capital" in the economy (Blinder, 1985; Calomiris
and Hubbard, 1987) and as a measure of the "cost of credit intermediation"
(Bernanke, 1981, 1983). In Calomiris and Hubbard (1986), we find evidence for
the importance of bank loan supply in generating business cycles during the
period considered here. We also find that loan supply is a gative function
of the low—risk commercial paper rate, which is consistent with the multiple—
markets approach to credit allocation described in Calomiris and Hubbard
(1987).

       Suppose that aggregate demand can be written as

           Y = — d1i +
                       d2Y
                           +
                             d3P
                                 +                      n;   d1,d2,d3 > 0.

Equilibrium in the goods market requires that

           —           +          +            +   r   = — s1a i + s L* +          +a
                d11         d2Y       d3P
so that
                       —1                                *
           Y =              [(d1—s1a) i +                    +             P + (a—r)J.
                  d2                                   s1L       (s2—d3)
If   s2 > d3, price shocks will be expansionary. As long as d1 > s1a, then
                              *
shocks to 1,0, and L will be reflected in negative co—movements between
output and the interest rate.

     The approach outlined above suggests that, even in an environment of
flexible prices, shocks to aggregate supply and demand — which during this
period certainly include deflationary shocks and other shocks to "information
capital" —      will
                  lead to co—movements in the interest rate and income. This
provides an alternative to the sticky—price, IS—shock interpretation of
negative co—movements between the interest rate and income posited in equation
(12) in the text.
