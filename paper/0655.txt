             The Effects of Government Regulation on Teenage Smoking



                                     ABSTRACT



     We examine the impact of three sets of government regulations on

the demand for cigarettes by teenagers in the United States. These are:
(1) the excise tax on cigarettes, (2) the Fairness Doctrine of the Federal
Communications Commission, which resulted in the airing of anti—smoking
messages on radio and television from July 1, 1967 to January 1, 1971,
and (3) the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1970, which banned pro—
smoking cigarette advertising on radio and television after January 1, 1971.
     Teenage price elasticities of demand for cigarettes are substantial
and much larger than the corresponding adult price elasticities. The
teenage smoking participation elasticity equals —1.2, and the quantity
smoked elasticity equals —1.4. It follows that, if future reductions
in youth smoking are desired, an increase in the Federal excise tax is
a potent policy to accomplish this goal.
     The contention of the proponents of the advertising ban that the
Fairness Doctrine failed in the case of teenagers is incorrect. According
to our results, the doctrine had a substantial negative impact on teenage
smoking participation rates. Extrapolations suggest that the advertising
ban was no better or worse a policy than the Fairness Doctrine.

            THE EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENT REGULATION ON TEENAGE SMOKING

            Eugene H. Lewit, Douglas Coate, and Michael Grossman*



        Since the issuance of the first Surgeon General's
                                                            Report on Smoking and
Health in 1964,1 the Federal government has been involved in a sporadic cam—

paign to discourage cigarette smoking. This campaign has consisted
                                                                         primarily
of policies designed to increase public knowledge of the harmful effects of

cigarette smoking and to restrict advertising by cigarette manufacturers.

The major elements of this campaign have been the Fairness Doctrine of the

Federal Communications Commission, which resulted in the airing of anti—

smoking messages on radio and television from July 1, 1967
                                                                to January 1, 1971,
and the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1970, which banned pro—smoking

cigarette advertising on radio and television after January 1, 1971.2

        In 1968, the first full calendar
                                           year of anti—smoking messages, 1,300

anti—smoking messages were aired by the three major networks. In 1970,

1,560 messages were aired with a market value of $75

million,    about one—third of the value of the pro—smoking commercials (Rimer

1972; Doran 1979). The ban on broadcast cigarette advertising in 1971, how-

ever,    greatly reduced the airing of anti—smoking messages, relegating them
to the same status as other public service advertising. This has caused a
number of observers to question the substitution of the
                                                        broadcast advertising
ban   for the active anti—smoking campaign mounted under the Fairness Doctrine
(for example, Hamilton 1972; Doran 1979; Warner 1979).
        In this paper we present the first set of estimates of the impact of
the Fairness Doctrine and advertising ban policies on the demand for cigar-
ettes by teenagers in the United States. In addition, we examine the extent
                                     —2—

 to which an increase in the Federal excise tax on cigarettes would reduce
 teenage smoking.3 Excise tax changes are reflected in cigarette prices
 and comprise an additional public policy that influences cigarette demand.4
     Previous evaluations of the effects of government policies to discourage
 smoking have examined the impact of these policies on per capita cigarette
consumption (Hamilton 1972; Warner 1977; Doran 1979; Ippolito, Murphy, and
Sant 1979). Fluctuations in per capita cigarette
                                                     consumption reflect pri-

marily changes in adult smoking participation rates and in the average

amount of cigarettes consumed by each adult smoker.       Accordingly, these
studies shed little light on the impact of these policies on teenage smoking.

Yet, cigarette smoking is, in part, an habitual behavior that begins early in

life. Therefore, changes in teenage smoking behavior in response to govern-

ment regulatory actions can have a substantial and sustained impact on aggre-

gate smoking in the long run.5 Moreover, age at onset of smoking is negatively

correlated with the amount smoked and the incidence of negative health effects

(for example, Hammond 1966; Ippolito, Murphy, and Sant 1979).

        Recent trends in smoking participation rates of   teenagers are presented
in    Table 1. Comparable trends for the adult cohorts that comprise the parents

of    these teenagers are presented in Table 2. Note that the percentage of
teenagers who smoke increased between 1968 and    1970, and the percentage of
girls who smoke rose    between 1970 and 1974. On the other hand, the percentage
of    adults who smoke declined between 1966 and 1970 and between 1970 and 1975.6

These  trends underscore another reason for studying teenagers in the context
of the anti.-smóking campaign. Supporters of the advertising ban have pointed
to the increase in teenage smoking rates between 1968 and 1970 as evidence
that, whatever the impact of the Fairness Doctrine on aggregate cigarette
consumption,   the doctrine was not effective in the case of teenagers (foi

  example, Evans 1976; Gritz 1977). Ignored in this argument is the important

  point that the Fairness Doctrine went into
                                                 effect on July 1, 1967. There-
  fore, smoking rates in 1968 pertain to rates in the second half of the first

  year and   first   half of the second year of the doctrine.    Thus, the data in
 Table 1 do not allow one to compare teenage smoking in the period before
 the Fairness Doctrine to smoking       the doctrine.
       Our empirical research in this
                                         paper is based on Cycle III of the U.S.
 Health Examination Survey (HES III). This is a national
                                                         sample of 6,768
 noninstitutionaized youths ages 12 to 17 conducted in the period 1966—l97Q.

 Since one—third of the sample
                                    was interviewed before the period of the
 Fairness Doctrine (March 1, 1966—June
                                           30, 1967) while two—thirds of the sample
were interviewed duringthe period of the doctrine (July 1, l967—March 31,        1970)
                                                                                             8

 we are able to present the first multivariate evaluation of the Fairness
                                                                                Doc-
 trine on teenage smoking. In addition, since some of our estimated
                                                                    equations
 include the number of pro— and
                                    anti—smoking messages seen by each youth, we
are able to make predictions     about the potential impacts of the advertising
ban.

     In previous studies, Hamilton (1972); Warner (1977); Doran (1979);
                                                                        and
Ippolito, Murphy, and Sant (1979) have examined the effects of the Fairness
Doctrine and the advertising ban on per capita cigarette
                                                                consumption in the
context   of time—series cigarette demand functions. Hamilton, Warner, and
Doran conclude that the Fairness Doctrine had a significant negative
                                                                       effect
on per capita consumption. Hamilton and Doran also find that the
                                                                  advertising
ban may actually have encouraged consumption because the airing of
                                                                   anti—smoking
messages fell dramatically after 1970. On the other hand, Ippolito, Murphy,
and Sant conclude that the effects
                                   reported in the other studies can be attri-
buted solely to a lagged
                             response to the Surgeon General's Report of 1964.

         Not   only do these four time—series studies present conflicting con-
 clusions regarding the effects of the Fairness Doctrine and the advertising
 ban but their conclusions are     somewhat suspect -because.iu all the studies
 the Fairness     Doctrine is modeled as a dichotomous variable.
                                                                    In addition,
Warner and Ippolito, Murphy, and Sant exclude pro—cigarette advertising in

 their   empirical work. In this paper, we develop and include in our estimated
demand functions      a time series on the number of anti—smoking messages aired
on television between the last half of 1967 and first
                                                      quarter of 1970.10
We also incorporate measures of pro—cigarette advertising in our pooled

time—series cross—section demand functions.         Moreover, we focus on a group,

teenagers, who might be most susceptible to both types of mass persuasion.

      We also present the first estimates of the responsiveness of smoking

by teenagers to variations in the price of cigarettes. This is possible

because of cross—sectional differences in the price of cigarettes, primarily

due to differences in state excise tax rates.         Interstate variations in
cigarette prices are substantial ——      retail   cigarette prices-are approxi—
                                                                                   -




mately 50 percent higher in the high tax states than in low tax states
(Tobacco Tax Council various years).

      As summarized by Lewit and Coate (1980), estimates of the price elasticity

of demand for cigarettes by adults range, from —.1 to l.5, with the best esti-

mate being approximately - .4.     We investigate the price elasticity of demand

for cigarettes by teenagers, in part, because these previous estimates pri-
marily reflect adult smoking behavior. Given the habitual nature of smoking,
adult users, who almost always will have been users for longer periods of
time than youths, might be much less sensitive to price than youths. In addi-

tion bandwagon or peer effects (discussed in more detail below) are believed

to be much more important in the case of youth smoking than in the case of
                                      —7—

 adult smoking. As shown by Leibenstein (1950), the presence of these

 effects increases the price elasticity of demand in absolute value."


                                 I. Methodology

        To examine the effects of the price of cigarettes and the Fairness Doc-

 trine on teenage smoking, we use     Cycle III of the Health Examination Survey
 (HES III) to estimate demand functions for
                                                   cigarette smoking by teenagers.
 lIES III is   a random sample of 6,768   youths   between the ages of 12   and   17 that
was conducted between March 1966 and March 1970 by the National Center for
Health Statistics. HES [II contains complete medical and health behavior
histories of the youths provided by the youths and their parents, informa-
tion on family socioeconomic characteristics, birth certificate
                                                                information,
a school report with data on school performance and classroom behavior pro-
vided by teachers and other school officials, scores on psychological (in-
cluding IQ and achievement) tests, and objective measures of health from
physical.examinatjon physical..exawjuatj0 and the psychological
tests  were administered by the Public Health Service. Information on ciga-
rette smoking was obtained directly from the youths as part of the health
behavior questionnaire. Parents were not present during the interviews with
the youths and were not informed about the smoking responses of their children.
                on the date of the examination enables us to divide the
       Information

sample into youths interviewed before the Fairness Doctrine and youths inter-
viewed during the Fairness Doctrine. Information on the city and state of
residence of each youth and on the date of the examination enables us to add
a measure of the price of cigarettes to the data set. The resulting series
incorporates variations in price due to variations in state and municipal
excise and retail sales tax rates. It also         incorporaçes variations in price
due   to trends   over time between 1966 and 1970.

            the context of the lIES sample, the most general way to specify a
         Within

 demand function for smoking by teenagers is

                        =        +                 ÷
                                           + a2d              +

                            + a5Y + a6f + a7t +


 The    dependent variable in equation (1) can be either the amount smoked by the
 ith youth in the th locality in period t          or   the probability that the youth
 smokes.     The independent variables include two measures of the price of

 cigarettes: the actual retail price of cigarettes (pu) and the difference

 between the "own   price't   of cigarettes and    the "low price"
                                                                        (dj) which is
 described   below. Additional independent variables are a vector of family
 and youthcharacteristics (xi) such as family income, family size, mother's
labor force status, absence of father from the household, parents'
                                                                               schooling,
age of youth, sex of youth, and race of youth; parents' smoking (sfl); the
mean smoking participation rate or the mean
                                            quantity smoked by all youths
in the 5th locality
                       (y); a vector of variables pertaining to the Fairness
Doctrine (f); time (t); and a random disturbance term

        The definition and measurement of the
                                                   variables in equation (1) are dis-
cussed in the next section. Here we make a few general comments on the

roles of certain variables. Lewit and Coate (1980) have pointed out that
difficulties arise in defining the relevant measure of the price of cigarettes
in   a cross section because smokers in a high price
                                                              area might purchase ciga-
rettes in border areas with lower prices. This phenomenon arises because

cross—sectional   variations in cigarette prices reflect primarily variations
in   state and municipal excise and sales taxes. To deal with this problem,

we have added two   price   series to the lIES: own price (price in city and

state of residence) and low price.12 If a youth lives within twenty miles
                                       —9—

 of a lower price area, low price equals the price in that area. If a
                                                                      youth
 does not reside within twenty miles of such
                                                  a border area, low price is set
 equal to own price.

          incentive to travel to lower price border areas to buy cigarettes
        The

 is greater the greater is the difference between own price and low price.
 Therefore, the most flexible method to control for the border phenomenon
 (out—of—area purchases) is to enter own price and the difference between
 own and low price as separate independent variables in the demand functions.
 With the own    area   price held constant, an increase in the price differential
 reflects     a reduction in the border area price and should cause cigarette

 smoking to increase. Note that the twenty—mile distance is selected to com-

pute the low price of cigarettes because the purchase of cigarettes within

 twenty miles of residence is likely to be incidental to the purpose of travel.

Although the incentive to make purchases or to have friends or fellow employ-

ees make purchases is positively related to the difference between own price

and low price, the lack of direct data on travel costs presents no problem

if   purchases of cigarettes are incidental to the main purpose of the trip.
       Although Lewit and Coate (1980) find that    the border phenomenon is an
importantconsideration in estimating the price elasticity of demand for
adult smokers,13 there is less reason to believe that it presents a problem
in the case of teenagers. This is because the quantity of cigarettes smoked
by teenagers generally is very small, so that the incentive to search for
low priced cigarettes is reduced. Moreover, the amount of incidental travel
by   teenagers in the HES sample is likely to be small because most of them

are below minimum legal driving ages. In our estimated equations, however,

we enter both own price and the difference between own and low price to

minimize measurement error problems and determine empirically the importance

of border crossing by teenagers.

        Both time Ct) and
                          specific variables pertaining to the Fairness Doctrine
 such as the number of anti—smoking
                                      messages aired on television in a given
 year (f) enter the demand function. This is because
                                                          there may be underlying
 trends in teenage smoking that are unrelated to the Fairness Doctrine.
                                                                             In
 practice, since the lIES spans a short
                                          period of time, these underlying
 trends cannot be estimated and t must be omitted from the equation. This

 means that the impact of the Fairness Doctrine
                                                  variables may reflect in
 part developments not related to the doctrine. Given
                                                         the plausible assump-
 tion of an underlying upward trend, the omission of time biases the coeffi-

cients of the Fairness Doctrine variables toward zero.14

        The main empirical regularities in youth smoking research by sociologists

and psychologists is that youths are more likely to smoke if their
                                                                   parents,
siblings, and peers also smoke (for example, Matarazzo and Matarazzo 1968;

Lanese, Banks, and Keller 1972; Green 1979).     Hence, the demand curve for
youth   smoking is subject to "bandwagon effects" to use the term coined by
Leibenstein (1950). An alternative explanation of these effects is that
youths obtain cigarettes "free of charge" or at reduced rates from their
parents, older siblings, and peers.
     In the demand function specified by equation (1), the mean smoking rate
in the locality (i) is a proxy for sibling and peer smoking. We refer to
it as the "smoking environment' of a particular youth and treat its impact
in the context of a well—known model of externalities in consumption
(Leibenstej. 1950; Becker 1971). To be specific, aggregation of equation
(1) over the nj youths in the th locality yields

where bars over variables denote means.

       Equation (1) is a structural demand function, while equation (2) Is a

reduced form. Since a5 is assumed to be positive and smaller than one, the

absolute value of a given reduced form coefficient exceeds the absolute value

of the corresponding structural..coeffjcjent!5           Clearly, the reduced form

coefficients are more relevant than the structural coefficients in
                                                                            assessing
the impact on youth smoking of price and the Fairness Doctrine.           Since we

have no independent measure of              we estimate equation (1) with this

variable omitted. We interpret the resulting coefficients as reduced form
            16
effects.

       In   addition to omitting       from equation (1), we omit parents' smoking
because there is no information on this variable in the data. If parents'
smoking has no trend, its exclusion presents no problems. As in the case
of   peer smoking, the coefficients of the price and Fairness Doctrine

variables in the teenage demand function can be interpreted as reduced form

effects. Put differently, a policy to curb youth smoking by raising the

Federal excise tax rate on cigarettes would raise the price of cigarettes

paid by youths and their parents, which would discourage          smoking by both
groups.     Therefore, in evaluating the impact of such a policy, parents'

smok&ng should not be held constant (included in the regression).
                                             — 12 —


        The   situation is somewhat different if there is a trend in parents'
 smoking.      To see this, write the parentst demand function as


                             b + b1 + bd + b3zij + b4f ÷                                   (3)
                                                                        b5t   ,




where           is a vector of parentst characteristics and the disturbance term

is suppressed. Substitute equation (3) into equation (1) and ignore variables

other than           f, and t:


                         =
                             a0   + (a1 + b1   a4)       + (a6 + b4 a4) t

                                  + (a7 + b5 a4)


If equation (4) is fitted with t omitted, the parameter estimate of t is

biased.       But the direction of the bias is indeterminant if a7          is positive
while b5 is negative. Given these signs, estimation problems may not be

serious because biases due to the omission of time are mitigated by biases

due to the omission of parents' smoking.


                         II. Empirical Implementation

     Equation (1) with               t,and          omitted is estimated using Cycle III
data for white or black youths who           live    with either both of their parents

or with their mothers only. Youths of other races and from other kinds of

families are eliminated in order to produce a more homogeneous sample.

The omitted observations account for a small percentage of the total sample.

Observations are also deleted if there are missing data. The final
                                                                                  sample
size is 5,308. Table 3 contains means of the dependent and selected indepen-

dent variables for the whole sample, for the sample interviewed before the

Fairness Doctrine went into effect, and for the sample interviewed during

the period of the Fairness Doctrine.

     Two measures    of   smoking behavior are examined: whether or not the

youth is a current smoker (SMOKEP) and the number of packs of cigarettes

smoked per day (QSMOKE). Of these two measures, we believe that smoking

participation is the most important. As indicated previously, most youth—

ful smokers will remain smokers as adults, and age at onst of smoking is

negatively   correlated with the amount smoked in adulthood and the incidence
of negative health effects. Smoking participation is a dichotomous variable
that assumes the value of 1 for current smokers. The number of packs of
cigarettes   smoked per day    assumes 1 of 5    possible values: 0, .25, .75,
1.50, or 2.50. In spite       of this, the method of estimation is ordinary

least squares. Previous research with the HES sample by Edwards and

Grossman (forthcoming) revealed almost no differences        between ordinary
least squares estimates and logit estimates obtained by the method of
maximum likelihood.
     Our smoking variables are obtained directly from youths. Because youths
may underreport   their cigarette use    (for    example, Evans, Hansen, and Mittlemark
1977),   our smoking measures may be inaccurate. If any such response error is

uncorrelated with the independent      variables in the demand function for ciga-
rettes, coefficients      will be unbiased, although their standard errors will

be inflated. If all youths underreport sticking by a constant factor of pro-

portionality, slope coefficients and their standard errors are biased down-

wards by this factor, leaving statistical tests of significance and elasti-

cities unaffected.

     In the two models outlined above, the existence of response error

essentially presents no problems for the statistical analysis. Response

error only becomes a problem if it is systematic or correlated with some

or all of the independent variables in the demand function. To be specific,

Warner (1978) argues that underreporting has increased,over time "due to
                                   — ii —


increases in the perceived personal threat or social stigma associated

with smoking (p. 313)." Given this argument, one would expect reported

teenage   smoking rates to have fallen continuously during the period of the
Fairness Doctrine. In fact, the trends in Table 1 and our own empirical
results presented in Section III indicate that this was riot the case.
       The Tax Burden on Tabacco, published by the Tobacco Tax Council, is
the source for annual state—specific price series on cigarettes. Price is
measured in cents per pack adjusted for municipal excise and retail sales
taxes. The own price of cigarettes is deflated by a state— and time—specific
cost—of—living index to obtain the own relative price of cigarettes (PRICE).
Similarly, the difference between the own price and the low price is divided
by the cost—of—living index to obtain the relative price difference (PDIF).
The interstate price index was developed for the year 1967 by Fuchs, Michael,
and Scott (1979). Cross—sectional price indexes for years covered by the

HES other than 1967 are developed by assuming that year—to—year percentage

changes for each state equal the year—to—year percentage change in the
Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for the U.S. as a whole.17
      Family badcground characteristics included in the demand functions are
real family income (money family income divided by the cost—of—living index),
the number of persons in the household 20 years of age or less (a proxy for
the   number of children in the family), mother's schooling, father's schooling,

absence of father from the household,18 whether or not the mother works full—

time, and whether or not the mother works part—time. Youth characteristics

included in the demand functions are age, race, sex, student status, whether

the youth works for pay during the school year, the number of hours worked

per week during the sbhool year, whether or not the youth works part—tine

during school vacations, whether or not the youth works full—time during
                                          — 16   —




 school vacations, whether or not the youth receives an allowance, region

of residence, and size of place of residence.

         Some of the above variables indicate the youth's command over real

resources, others are determinants of parents' smoking, and others have

been shown to be important determinants of youth smoking mnstudies by
psychologists and sociologists (for example, Matarazzo and Matarazzo 1968;
Lanese, Banks, and Keller 1972; Green 1979). It is important to control
for region and size of place of residence because the liES is a nationally
representative sample for the period 1966—1970 but not for each year of
this period. In addition, the inclusion of size of place of residence
controls for cross—sectional differences in the cost of living that are
not reflected in the state price index. We do not present or discuss the
effects of parental and youth characteristics on youth smoking in Section
III.     But it should be realized that all estimated price and Fairness

Doctrine effects control for (hold constant) the effects of these variables!9

       A number of   alternative specifications and     variables are used to esti-

mate the impacts of the Fairness Doctrine. The simplest specification is

one with a dichotomous variable that identifies youths who were interviewed

during    the period of the doctrine (FAIR). A second specification distin-
guishes among four groups of youths: those interviewed during the first year
of the Fairness Doctrine (Tl = 1), those interviewed during the second year
of the doctrine      (T2 =   1),   those interviewed during the third year of the

doctrine (T3 =     1), and those interviewed before the doctrine went into effect
(the   omitted category).2°

       Our   other specifications capitalize in various ways on information on
the number of hours per day that the youth reports he spends watching tele-
vision (TV). Advertising on television was the main source of exposure of
youths    to cigarette advertising prior to the banning of such advertisements
                                   — 17   —



 on January 1, 1971. Most other cigarette advertising
                                                      occurs in the adult

 print media and via sample cigarettes. Youths have only limited exposure

 to these sources.

      Based on time—series analysis, Hamilton (1972), Schmalensee
                                                                  (1972),
 Doran (1979) have shown pro—cigarette advertising to have'    at best a weak
 positiveimpact on per capita consumption of cigarettes in the aggregate.
These findings do not conflict with the contention of the cigarette industry
 that most advertising is directed toward interbrand competition and little
at stimulating total consumption per se. It is reasonable to suppose,
however, that pro—cigarette advertising may have a different and perhaps
larger effect on a youth who does not currently smoke or who has been experi—
nenting with this behavior than it does on an adult. In particular, even if
advertisements are directed toward interbrand competition, they may give
youths the impression that smoking is an "attractive adult behavior." Pre-

sumably, the anti—smoking messages aired on television during the Fairness
Doctrine, which stressed the health hazards posed by smoking, should work
against the impact of pro—cigarette advertising on teenage smoking.
     To test the above notions, we estimate a multiple regression in which
two of the independent variables are the amount of time spent watching tele-
vision per day (TV) and the product of this variable and the Fairness
Doctrine dummy (TVxFAIR).   According   to our hypotheses, the coeffièient
of TV should be positive, and the coefficient of TVXFAIR     should   be negative.21
In a modification of this specification, TVXFAIR   is   replaced   by interactions
between TV and each of the three years of the Fairness Doctrine (TVXT1,
                                                                             TVXT2,
TVXT3).
                                      —18—


       Our final specifications of the Fairness Doctrine combine the individual
 data on TV—watthing reported by each youth with aggregate time series on the
 number of pro—smoking and anti—smokingmessages aired on television for the
 years 1965 through 1970. To be specific, let PRO be the number of pro—
 smoking messages aired on television in the twelve month& preceding the
date on which a given youth was interviewed.         Similarly, let ANTI be the

number of anti—smoking messages aired on television in the same twelve—

month period.22 Then we compute the product of PRO and TV (PROTV) and

the   product of ANTI and TV (ANTITV). These variables are proxies for the
number of pro— or anti—smoking messages that a youth saw as opposed to the
number aired. The rationale is that the ratio of messages seen to messages
aired is positively related to the amount of time spent watching television.
We estimate cigarette demand functions with PROTV and ANTITV as two of the
independent variables. Nonlinear specifications are explored in which the
square    of ANTITV (ANTITVS) and   the   product of PROTV   and the Fairness Doctrine
dummy (PRTVFAIR) are included. These are discussed in more detail when the
results   are presented.

      The time series on anti—smoking messages is taken from Rimer (1972).

These are based on reports made by the three networks (NBC, ABC, and CBS)

to the producers'of the anti—smoking messages: the American Heart Association,

the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, and the U.S.

Public Health Service. Undeflated outlays on TV advertising by cigarette

companies are taken from Doran (1979).23 This series is deflated by the

median price (cost) of a 20 second spot announcement on network owned and

operated TV stations, which was obtained from Standard Rate and Data,

Incorporated.

 appropriateness     of our specification of the border phenomenon (the purchase
of cigarettes at a price lower than the own locality price), which relies
on the use    of   the difference between the own   price   and the low price (if

it is positive) as an independent variable. Three alternative price effects

from smoking participation regressions are presented in Panel A of Table 4.

The   corresponding price effects from quantity smoked regressions are pre-
sented    in Panel B. Each regression includes all family and youth charac-

teristics mentioned in Section II but excludes variables related to the

Fairness Doctrine. Regression (1) includes the price difference (PDIF),

while regression (2) omits it. Regression (3) is estimated using a subsample

of youths in which the price difference is zero (the border price is either

equal to or larger than the own price).

      In all three specifications price elasticities at the mean are substan-

tial; in most cases they exceed 1 in absolute value.          Moreover, the elastici-
ties in the table are the appropriate ones to use in evaluating the impacts
of an increase in the Federal excise tax on cigarettes or an increase in
price due to an increase in input prices. In these situations the own price
and the low price rise by the same amount, and the difference between them
remains the same.24
      One explanation of the large price elasticities in Table 4 is that
                                                                         they
may incorporate income effects as well as substitution effects. We do hold

constant real family income and proxies for the amount of discretionary
income that a youth can spend on his own consumption, such as whether or

                                                       of a perfect measure of a youth's

                                                           something other than a pure

smoked by youths who smoke is relatively small. Let Q bIthe quantity smoked

by youths who smoke, and interpret smoking participation as the probability

that a given youth smokes. Hence


                                QSMOKE = (SMOIcP) (q)         ,                            (5)

The  estimates of the elasticity on the left—hand side of the last equation
are —.01 in regression (1), —.25 in regression (2), and —.45 in regression
(3).
      In   all   regressions   the own   relative     price of cigarettes (PRICE) has a
negative and      statistically significant regression coefficient. The regres-

sion coefficient of the price difference has the anticipated positive sign,
but it is not significant. The own price effects are stable across alterna-
tive specifications. They are identical in Panel B and range from —.004 to
—.006 in Panel A. A principal message of Table 4 is clear: the border pheno-
menon is not an important issue in the estimation of youth cigarette demand
functions. This finding is consistent with the notions that youths are less
mobile than adults and have less incentive to search for lower priced ciga-

rettes because youths typically smoke much less than adults.

      Seven alternative regressions for assessing the impacts of the Fairness

Doctrine on smoking participation are          shown in Table 5. The       corresponding
regressions      for assessing the impacts of the doctrine on the quantity smoked
are shown in Table 6. The regression coefficients associated with the price

 the regressions in Tables 5 and 6 include all family and youth characteris-

that the conclusions reached with respect to these effects are not altered

when the Fairness Doctrine variables are added to the rejressions. In par-

the price difference coefficients are positive and not significant. In addi-

tion, elasticities at the mean always exceed one. The smoking participation

elasticity of approximately —1.20 is nearly five times larger than the im-

plied elasticity of quantity smoked by those who smoke of —.25.

       An overview of the impacts of the Fairness Doctrine in the seven alter-

native specifications indicates that, whatever the impacts of the doctrine

on smoking participation, it has little or no impact on the quantity smoked.

For this reason and because of the importance of smoking participation as a

behavioral variable, we focus on the results in Table 5 in the remainder

of this section.

       In regression (1), the coefficient of the dichotomous variable that

identifies youths who were interviewed during the period of the Fairness

Doctrine (FAIR) is negative and significant. It indicates that during the

period of the doctrine the teenage smoking rate was 3.0 percentage points

smaller than in the 16 month period prior to the doctrine (March 1966—

June 1967). Time trends in smoking participation during the Fairness

Doctrine   period itself are explored in regression (2). As shown by the
coefficient of Tl, the smoking rate fell by 5.2 percentage points during
the first year of the doctrine. The rate rose by 3.1 percentage points in
the second year (given by the difference between the coefficient of T2 and
that of Ti) and declined by .5 percentage    points in the third year relative

to   the second (the coefficient of T3 minus that of T2).

        Clearly, the above findings suggest that the Fairness Doctrine had its

 largest impact in the first year of its existence. Put differently, the

 introduction   of the doctrine represented a "shock" to the underlying upward
 trend in teenage smoking in the mid—l9GOs and early 1970s. But by the
                                                            9
second year of the doctrine, the trend factor began to dominate the shock.

This scenario mirrors the shocks to aggregate time trends in smoking due

to anti—smoking developments that are modeled and estimated by Ippolito,

Murphy,and Sant (1979) and by Lewit, Coate, and Grossman (in progress).

The    decline in smoking participation in the first year of the Fairness
Doctrine is dramatic evidence that smoking behavior can change drastically
when the rate of change in anti—smoking information is extremely large.
The coefficients of T2 and T3 indicate that the impact of anti—smoking
messages is subject to diminishing returns. For teenagers, the effects
of the doctrine in its second and third years are dominated by the trend.25
        Our findings also are consistent with trends in teenage smoking in the
surveys conducted by the National Clearinghouse for Smoking and Health (NCSH)
that    are shown in Table 1. According to the NCSH surveys, the teenage smoking

rate rose by 3.7 percentage points between 1968 and 1970.       According to regres-
sion (2), the teenage smoking rate rose by 2.6 percentage points between the

firstand the third years of the Fairness Doctrine (the coefficient of T3
minus that of Ti). The two estimates differ because the NCSH survey include
18   year olds, because our estimate controls for variables that may have
changed between 1968 and 1970, and because the two time periods (1968 and
1970 versus the first and third years of the Fairness Doctrine) are not exactly
the same. It is important to note that the increase in teenage smoking between
1968   and 1970 or between the first and third years of the Fairness Doctrine
does not indicate that the anti—smoking messages failed to discourage smoking
                                   —28 —


by   teenagers, as claimed by the proponents of the advertising ban (for
example, Evans 1976; Critz 1977). Based on our first regression, teenage
smoking was 3.0 percentage points smaller during the Fairness Doctrine
than it was in the 16 months prior to the doctrine. Based on the second
regression, the doctrine was associated with a 3.4 perceniage point reduc—
tion in smoking. 26
     The five additional regressions in Table 5 try to identify mechanisms
via which the Fairness Doctrine reduced teenage smoking. In regression (3)
the number of hours per week spent watching television (TV) has a positive
and significant impact on the probability of smoking. On the other hand,
the interaction between TV—watching and the Fairness Doctrine dummy variable
has a negative and significant impact on this probability. Although TV—
watching   has a positive impact on the probability of smoking during the

Fairness Doctrine period (given by the sum of the coefficients of TV and

TVXFAIR), the effect is much weaker than in the pre—doctrine period. To be

specific, a one—hour per week increase in TV—watching raises the smoking

probability by 1.1 percentage points   in the pre—doctrine period. The corn—
parable increase in the during period is .3 percentage     points. The weaker
     in the latter period reflects the presence of anti—smoking messages
effect

on TV. The effect is positive rather than negative, in part, because the
nunter of pro—smoking messages exceeded the number of anti—smoking messages
throughout the period of the Fairness Doctrine.
     In regression (4), we model the initial shock   and   diminishing   effect

process by interacting TV with each of the   three years of the Fairness
Doctrine   (TVxT1, TVXT2, TVXT3). The coefficients of all these interactions

are negative and, for the first two periods, significant.. Moreover, an
                                        — 29   —




    increase    in TV—watching has a slight negative effect on the jrobability of
    smoking in the first year of the Fairness Doctrine.
         In regressions (5), (6), and (7), the proxies for the number of pro—
    and anti—smoking messages seen are entered (PROTV and MTITV).27 In regression

    (5) the coefficient of PROW has the anticipated positive sign,      and   the coeffi-

    cient of M4TITV has the anticipated negative sign. Neither coefficient, how-

    ever, is statistically significant. In the sixth regression we include the

    square of ANTITV (ANTITVS) as an additional independent variable. This is

    an attempt to capture elements of a model with an initial shock followed by

    a diminishing effect. It is particularly important to allow the number of

    anti—smoking messages aired to have a nonlinear- effect because both TV—

    watching and the number of messages aired rose throughout the period of the

    Fairness    Doctrine. The finding that the coefficient of ANTITV is negative
    and significant, while the coefficient of ANTITVS is positive and significant
    is consistent with the hypothesized diminishing effect of anti—smoking
    messages.     The model is refined further in regression (7) by allowing pro—

    cigarette advertising to have a different effect in the Fairness Doctrine

    period than in the pre—doctrine period.28 Consistent with a priori notions,

-   the coefficient of PROTV is positive and significant, while that of the

• interaction betweenPROTV and       the   Fairness Doctrine dummy (PRTVFAIR) is

    negative    and significant. The coefficients of AETITV and MJTITVS have the
    appropriate signs but are not significant.
         Clearly, the four measures of pro— and anti—smoking messages seen in
    regression    (7) are highly correlated. One cannot expect all four variables

    to achieve statistical significance. The finding that all three have the

    appropriate signs in regression (6) and all four have the appropriate signs

    in regression (7) is consistent with our expectations.

       Panel   A of Table 7 summarizes the implied impacts of the Fairness
Doctrine on     teenage   smoking participation rates from each of the seven
regressions    in Table 5. The procedure simply is, to predict smoking parti-

cipation in the periods before and during the doctrine based on the regres-

sion   coefficients and on the mean values        in each period of the   Fairness
Doctrine variables.29 The computations reveal that we have specified a
plausible mechanism by which the Fairness Doctrine reduced teenage smoking.
In particular regressions (3), (4), and (7) account for between 2.1
                                                                    percentage
points and 2.7 percentage points of the 3.0 to 3.4 percentage point reduction

predicted by the simple trend equations [regressions (1) and (2)]. Mote

that equation (4) does a better job of explaining the trend than those that

enter the proxy    for    anti—smoking messages seen and allow it to have a     -




diminishing effect. We believe that this is because even the nonlinear speci-
fication does    not fully capture the initial shock caused by the messages.

       Panel B of Table 7 contains the predicted impact of the advertising ban

on further changes in teenage smoking from regressions (3), (4), (5), (6),

and (7). In the first two predictions, it is assumed that the effects on

TV—watching disappear after the end of the Fairness Doctrine. In the last

three predictions, it is assumed that the:number of anti—smoking messages

aired fall to zero after the end of the doctrine. Although the anti—smoking

messages did not disappear entirely after 1970, the number aired declined

by almost 80 percent relative to the number aired in 1969. Moreover, in

the post—doctrine period many of the messages were aired at times when

youths are extremely unlikely to be viewing television.30 The figures in

parentheses show how the last three estimates are altered when the number

of anti—smoking messages aired during the ban equals 20 percent of the 1969

value.31 The predicted declines in teenage smoking after the end of the

 Fairness Doctrine are modest. They suggest that the ban was not a parti-
 cularly effective policy instrument to curtail teenage smoking in a post—
Fairness Doctrine environment. Of course, since small declines in smoking
rather than increases are shown in Panel B, one can argue that the adver-
tising ban was no worse a policy than the Fairness Doctrfne. In particular,
our extrapolations suggest that the ban should have discouraged teenage
smoking. This is in contrast to the findings by Hamilton (1972) and Doran
(1979) that the ban should have increased per capita cigarette consumption
in the aggregate. Our results differ from those of Hamilton and Doran in
part because we include an explicit measure of exposure to
                                                             anti—smoking
messages in our regressions. Moreover, we focus on teenagers, whose re-

sponses to pro— and anti—smoking messages are likely to differ from adults'

responses.

     A full—cost—benefit analysis of the Fairness Doctrine, the advertising

ban, or an increase in the Federal excise tax on cigarettes vis—a—vis
                                                                        teenage
smoking is beyond the scope of this paper. Similarly, we cannot provide a

definitive statement with regard to the relative merits of an active anti—

smoking policy versus a policy of laissez faire. But based on our results,

we can highlight a number of policy—relevant facts and insights:

     (1)   Teenage price elasticities of demand for cigarettes are large.
The smoking participation elasticity equals —1.2, and the quantity smoked

elasticity equals —1.4. This result is consistent with Lewit and Coate's

(1980) finding that smoking by young adults ages 20 through 24 is much more

responsive to price than smoking by older adults. It follows that, if

future reductions in youth smoking are desired, an increase in the Federal

excise tax is a potent policy to accomplish this goal. Such a policy may

also be an effective way to curb the deterimental health effects of
                                                                      smoking
                                       — 33 —


 in   the long run without substantially harming the cigarette industry in the

 short run. Since youth and young adult price elasticities are much larger.

 than adult price elasticities while adult smokers account for the bulk of

 cigarette sales, a substantial excise tax increase would
                                                                 substantially
 reduce smoking participation by young new      smokers   but ledve industry sales

 largely unchanged. Given the evidence that individuals are considerably

 less likely to initiate smoking after age 25, it is quite possible that the

 cohort of young smokers who never begin to smoke as a result of the tax in-

 crease would never become regular smokers. As a consequence, over a period

of several decades, aggregate smoking and its associated detrimental health

effects would decline substantially.

        (2) The contention of the proponents of the advertising ban     that   the

Fairness Doctrine failed in the case of teenagers is incorrect. According

to our results, the doctrine had a substantial negative impact on teenage

smoking participation rates. We also have evidence that the mechanism at

work    was the responsiveness of teenagers to anti—smoking messages that stress
the health hazards posed by smoking. This calls into question Evans's (1976)
argument that teenagers are not sensitive to such messages.
        (3)   Between 1970 and 1974, smoking participation by teenagers rose by
0.4 percentage points (seeTable 1). Based on the computations in Panel B
of Table 7 we predict a reduction of approximately 0.6 percentage points
over this period due to the advertising ban. 32 Why did the percentage of
teenagers     who smoke rise rather than fall? The obvious answer is that our

forecast assumes no changes in the determinants of teenage smoking except

for variables related to the Fairness Doctrine. Smoking rates may have

risen because an underlying upward trend in this behavior dominated develop-

ments   related to the advertising ban. But there is a more obvious explanation.
                                   — 34 —


Between 1970 and 1974, the relative price of cigarettes declined
                                                                 by roughly
6 percent due to a rapid increase in the Consumer Price Index accompanied

by no change in the Federal excise tax rate. Our regression results suggest

that this should have caused the smoking rate to rise by 1.0 percentage
                                                          P
points. The net extrapolation, based on these two competIng    factors, is
an increase of .4 percentage points, which coincides with the observed in—
          33
crease.

       (4) &s shown in Table 1, the teenage smoking rate peaked in 1974; it

declined from 15.6 percent in that year to 11.7 percent in 1979. It is

still too early to explain the apparent reversal in trend or the differen-

tial trends for boys and girls.34 It is plausible to hypothesize, however,

that the trend reversal represents in part a lagged response to the downward
trend in adult smoking participation rates reported in Table 2.

Health Service.


       2other   Federal government policies designed to discourage smoking in-
cluded the     requirement, beginning in July 1966, of a health warning in all

cigarette advertising and on every package and the strengthening of this

warning at the time of the imposition of the advertising ban in 1971. In

addition, the Federal Trade Commission began monitoring the tar and nicotine

content of various brands of cigarettes in 1967. Subsequently, the cigarette

industry voluntarily agreed to include the     FTC measurements in all advertising.
Finally,   Federal agencies have required the separation of smokers and nonsmok-

ers   on vehicles in interstate passenger transportation, and many state and
local governments have required the provision of no smoking areas in public
places.

        3Arguments for government intervention in the cigarette market are
derived   from the assumptions of externalities in consumption (the health

of some persons enters the utility function of others); externalities in

production (smoking by some may harm the health of others); lack of corn—

plete   information about the health effects of smoking, particularly among
youth; and moral hazard     in the markets for life and health insurance (pre-

miums paid by smokers do not fully reflect their higher probabilities of

illness and    death).    In this paper we do not evaluate these assumptions.

     4Although the Federal excise tax on cigarettes has remained at 8 cents

per pack for the last 25 years, there have been several attempts to increase

it in recent years because of the concern over the health effects of ciga-

rette smoking. Moreover, there is evidence that some states increased their

cigarette taxes as a result of the anti—smoking publicity that followed the

issuance of the Surgeon General's Report in 1964. In 1965 there were 23

state and   local   cigarette tax   increases   compared with no more than a dozen

in any of the preceding 14 years (Kellner 1973).

     5Among adults who smoke, 95 percent began to smoke between the ages of

12 and 21 (Center far Disease Control and        National   Cancer Institute 1976).

     6The 1979 figures in Table 1 reveal dramatic reductions in teenage

smoking between 1974 and 1979. When the data are examined by age and sex,

smoking participation rates for boys declined by almost 25 percent for 12—16

year olds and by 38 percent for 17—18 year olds. For girls, participation

rates between 1974 and 1979 increased slightly for those 17—18 yearsr old and

declined slightly for those 12—14 years old. Smoking by girls ages 15—16

fell, however, by almost 42 percent after rising by almost 110 percent be-

tween 1968 and 1974. The extent to which these dramatic trend reversals and

inconsistencies are clue   to   sampling variability, an increase in underreporting

over time, or other factors is not known. Teenage smoking rates from the

U.S.    National Surveys on   Drug Abuse conducted by the National Institute on

Drug Abuse (NIDA) in 1974, 1976, and 1977 suggest that smoking rates have

not fallen as rapidly as the figures in Table 1 suggest. The NIDA surveys
                                                                 I.


also show that the rates tend to fluctuate somewhat from year to year

(Abeleson,    Fishburne, and Cisin 1977; Cisin, Miller, and Harrell 1978).

        7A full description of the sample, the sampling technique, and the

data collection is presented in National Center for Health Statistics (1974).

        8HES III ended after the first quarter of 1970. Hence it has no data

on   teenage smoking in the last three quarters of the last year of the Fairness
Doctrine.         -                                                          -


        9Warner   does not consider explicitly the effect of the advertising ban.
       101n research in progress, we are estimating time—series cigarette demand
functions that include the number of anti—smoking messages aired on television
between the last half of 1967 and 1979.

       11Note that price effects are not unrelated to the anti—smoking campaign
because price may be interpreted broadly to incorporate both the nominal
price of cigarettes and the indirect cost of consuming them. The latter
pertains to the perceived cost of the health hazards associated with smoking.
Developments such as the anti—smoking campaign presumably raise the perceived
cost. The interaction between the money price of a package of cigarettes (p)
and the perceived cost of the health risks of smoking (z) in the demand func-
tion   for cigarettes is highlighted by specifying the quantity smoked (y) as
a function of the "full" price of cigarettes (it    =p ÷   z):
                         yg(Tr)=g(p+z).

                                                        F- 4
    Note that an increase in the perceived cost of smoking alters the elasticity
    of smoking with respect to money price, although the direction of the effect
    is    ambiguous. For example, suppose that the elasticity of smoking with

    respect to full price is constant. Then


                          in   y    a—    C in    it,

                          (De/3z) =      —p(p +                 0.

    On the other hand, if the demand function has a constant slope, rather than

    a constant elasticity, e rises in absolute value as z                            rises;

                          y = B —           B —
                                                        B.1p—TS1z,

    If neither the slope nor the elasticity is constant, the impact of an

    increase in z on the money price elasticity is indeterminant.

            '2The   low price border area may lie within the state of residence because
    cigarettes      are subject to municipal excise taxes and to municipal retail
    sales    at different rates (some zero) within the same state. All                        of   these

    are   included in the own and          low price variables.

    Smith (1976).

        14Smoking participation by adult males increased dramatically during

World War II. The diffusion of the smoking habit among females has lagged

behind that of males. Between 1955 and 1966, smoking rates of males who

were eligible for military service in World War II declined. On the other

hand,    smoking rates by females in the same age cohorts as   these males in-

creased (Harris      1979).

        151f   a5 exceeds one, cigarette smoking is a bandwagon good with an
upward sloping market demand curve. This is inconsistent with a stable
equilibrium because the supply function is assumed to be infinitely elastic
in the estimation procedure.

site in the HES. This procedure was not adopted because the       means would be
based on a small number of observations in a significant percentage of the
sites. Essentially, with           omitted, the coefficients of (1) can differ
from those of (2) only in the sense that the solved— and estimated—reduced
form differ due to sampling variability.

over time but not among states (not shown) do not differ significantly from

schooling      is coded at the race—specific mean of the sample for which father's
schooling is reported. Alternative coding schemes would alter the regression
coefficient of absence of father but would not alter the coefficients of the
other independent variables.

     191n general, our findings with respect to the impacts of family and

youth characteristics are consistent with those of other studies. In par-

ticular, smoking is negatively related to mother's and father's schooling

and positively related to the number of persons in the family 20 years of

age or less. Moreover, a youth is more likely to smoke and to smoke larger

amounts if he is not a student, if he works during the school year, if he

works during school vacations, if his mother works full—time, and if his

father is absent from the household. Boys smoke more than girls; whites

smoke more than blacks; and older youths smoke more than younger youths.

These results strengthen our confidence in the validity and reliability

of the liEs smoking measures.


     20The first year of the Fairness Doctrine is July 1, 1967—June 30, 1968.

The second year is July 1, 1968—June 30, 1969. The third year is July 1,

1969—March 31, 1970. Since the lIES ended in March 1970, we have no data for

the last quarter of the third year.


            should   be noted that the relationship between TV—watching and
smoking may reflect causality in both directions. In part, it also may
reflect the role of omitted "third variables."
              series for PRO and ANTI are available on an annual rather than
on a monthly basis. Therefore, if a youth was interviewed, for example,
on April 1, 1966, PRO for that youth equals three—fourths of its 1965 value
plus one—fourth of its     1966 value. A similar weighting scheme is used to

compute   ANTI. Clearly, ANTI equals zero for all youths who were interviewed
before the Fairness Doctrine went into effect.

       23Doran gives    total outlays on TV and radio advertising by cigarette

companies. We multiplied his series by the ratio of TV expenditures by

all advertisers to the sum      of   TV and radio expenditures (Bureau of Census

1980).    As    indicated by the data, the same ratio for each year between 1965
and 1970 is appropriate.

     24These are not the appropriate elasticities to use in evaluating the
effect on teenage smoking of an increase in state or local excise taxes.
In these cases, even      a small increase in the local tax rate can result in

a substantial increase in the price difference if border area taxes are not
also increased. As a result, some of the deterent effects of a state or
local tax      increase may be mitigated. Of course, to predict the percentage
reduction in cigarette consumption caused by a 1 percent increase in any
excise tax, one has to know the share of the tax in total price as well as
the price elasticity of demand.

      25The above findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis of a continuous
downward trend in teenage smoking during the Fairness Doctrine period due
to an upward trend in underreporting.
                                                         -




                is a weighted average of the coefficients of Ti, T2, and T3.
The weights are the number of youths interviewed in each year of the Fairness

Doctrine relative to all youths interviewed during the period of the doctrine.


      27Regression (5), (6), and (7) do not allow for cumulative or lagged

anti—smoking     effects, except to the extent that   current TV—watching probably

is   positively related to prior TV—watching. We do not try "to tease out"
lagged effects, in part, because we have a very short time series and because
we do not believe then to be important in the case of teenage smokers. In
                                       F-S

Lewit, Coate, and Grossman (in progress), we do allow for lagged responses

to anti—smoking messages in the aggregate population of smokers.


              regressions   not shown, we   allowed for a diminishing pro—advertising

effect   by   including the square of PROTV as an independent variable. There

was no evidence of a nonlinear effect.


        29Consider regression (3):


                     SMOKEP =               + a2   (TVXFAIR)
                                a0 + a1TV

Then

                SMOKEPD — SMOKEPB = (a1     + a2) D —     a1TVB


where   the subscripts D and B denote the periods during and before the doc-

trine and bars over variables denote means.


        30For reasons of confidentiality, we do not reveal the source of this

information.


        31These figures also incorporate an upward trend in TV—watching due
to an increase in the percentage of families with television sets.
        32This figure is an average of 6 of the S estimates in Panel B of
Table 7. The smallest and largest figures are omitted from the average.-

        33Smoking rates     also may have risen because of changes in family back-
ground characteristics.        For instance, the percentage of mothers who work

full—time and     the percentage of youths who live with their mothers only
rose. Rough computations suggest, however, that, given the sizes of the
observed changes, their impacts on smoking were minimal. Moreover, there
are factors that go in the other direction: family size fell and parents'
schooling rose. Note also that the reduction in teenage smoking from 1970
to 1972 (see Table 1) occurred in a petiod in which the relative price of
cigarettes rose.
                                 F— 9


     341n preliminary research, we find that the Fairness Doctrine variables
have larger effects on smoking participation rates of boys than on smoking
participation rates of girls.
