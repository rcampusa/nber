                                           ABSTRACT

East Asian countries have become much more active in utilizing the WTO dispute settlement system

to assert their legal rights. The dispute settlement experience so far for these countries has shown

strong tendency of domestic governments to defend economic interest of major industries. Their

primary counterparts in trade disputes are still major developed countries such as the United States

and the European Communities. Thailand is in some sense peculiar in that it brought

disproportionately many complaints to the WTO dispute settlement system while it was hardly

challenged by other Members. In contrast to the GATT era, Korea has become legally very

aggressive under the WTO system. It is also noted that Japan has been rarely challenged since

October 1998. Except for China, most East Asian countries lack the national procedure to link

private economic interests to the WTO dispute settlement procedures.

I.       Introduction


         On January 13, 1995 when few experts could fully understand the newly established
dispute settlement mechanism under the WTO, Singapore submitted the consultation request for
dispute settlement against Malaysia concerning import prohibitions on polyethylene and
polypropylene.1 It was the very beginning of the WTO dispute settlement system that is the
essence of the current world trading system. 2 This case was subsequently resolved with
mutually agreed solution and so notified on July 19, 1995.
         This birth history of the WTO dispute settlement showed an interesting fact that it was
East Asian Members that opened the Pandora’s box for the new era in the world trading system.
Since then, East Asian Members have actively participated in utilizing and augmenting the
WTO dispute settlement system. These experiences and lessons thereof are briefly discussed
below.



II.      GATT Dispute Settlements in East Asia


GATT/WTO Accession


         Among East Asian Members, China was in fact one of the drafting Members of the
GATT and joined the GATT in 1948. Then, Indonesia joined the GATT not by accepting the
Protocol of Provisional Application, but instead by succeeding contracting party status under
Article XXVI:5(c) in 1950.3
         Japan acceded to GATT on September 1955 and, at the time of accession, 14
contracting parties invoked Article XXXV. Subsequently, 33 contracting parties invoked Article
XXXV by succession in respect of Japan when they became liberated from Belgium, France and
United Kingdom. Three other contracting parties also invoked Article XXXV when they later
joined the GATT. All these Article XXXV invocations were later gradually disinvoked to

          The Korean government first sought to join the GATT in 1950, when it eagerly tried to
be recognized as an independent state in the international community after liberation from Japan.
At that time, the Korean government delegation sent to Torquay, England finished the GATT
accession negotiation and signed the relevant documents.5 This first attempt, however, failed
when the Korean government could not complete the requisite domestic ratification procedures
due to the Korean War during 1950-1953.6 The Korean government resumed its effort to accede
to the GATT in 1965 when it vigorously pursued export promotion as the primary element of
economic development policies. After extensive internal discussion on potential economic
benefits and costs, the Korean government finally submitted its accession application to the
GATT Secretariat on May 20, 1966, and conducted the tariff negotiations with 12 contracting
parties from September to December 2, 1966.7 Korea officially acceded to the GATT in 1967,
in accordance with Article XXXIII of the GATT.8 On the other hand, Korea invoked Article

on 27 December 1979.

September 1971.13
         Korea began its formal participation as a contracting party at the Tokyo Round of the
multilateral trade negotiation, although it was merely as a minor player.14 Subsequently, Korea
joined the four so-called ‘Side Codes’: Subsidies Code15, Standards Code16, Customs Valuation
Code17 and Anti-Dumping Code18. Korea had never joined the sectoral agreements on bovine
meat, dairy products and civil aircraft, nor the Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures as a
plurilateral agreement. Korea joined the Agreement on Government Procurement during the
Uruguay Round and implemented it only from January 1, 1997, while all other signatories
except for Hong Kong applied it from January 1, 1996.19
         China was one of 23 original GATT contracting parties and signed the Protocol of
Provisional Application on April 21, 1947. Subsequently, China participated in the first two
rounds of multilateral trade negotiation, Geneva and Annecy Rounds. After the People’s
Republic of China (PRC) was founded on October 1, 1949, the Taiwan authorities withdrew
from the GATT in the name of the Republic of China. This withdrawal came into effect on May
5, 1950. China tried to resume its GATT relations after it secured a seat at the UN in October
1971. In January 1984, the PRC became a Member of the GATT Committee on Textiles and in
November 1984, an observer to the GATT Council and other subsidiary meetings.
         On July 10, 1986, the PRC officially applied to resume China’s status as a contracting

party and the Working Party on China’s accession was established on March 4, 1987.20 The
Working Party included 68 Members to be the biggest working party for GATT/WTO accession.
Since then, China sent a delegation to the Uruguay Round negotiations and finally the head of
the Chinese delegation signed the final documents of the Uruguay Round along with the other
125 Member countries.21 Therefore, the Uruguay Round agreements are supposed to apply to
China once it becomes a formal Member to the WTO. For bilateral negotiations concerning the
China’s accession, 37 Members requested negotiations with China.22 China finally finished its
accession negotiations with all those Members and signed the Membership agreement on
November 11, 2001.23 Having completed the domestic ratification procedure for its WTO
accession on August 25, 2000, China becomes a formal Member on December 11, 2001, 30
days after the accession approval.
         China committed, upon accession, to comply with the TRIMs Agreement, without
recourse to the provisions of Article 5 of the TRIMs Agreement and to eliminate all subsidy
programs falling within the scope of Article 3 of the SCM Agreement. In addition, China shall
not maintain or introduce any export subsidies on agricultural products. Therefore, China did
not get any special waiver period as a developing country. Moreover, the importing WTO
Member may use a methodology that is not based on a strict comparison with domestic prices or
costs in China if the producers under investigation cannot clearly show that market economy
conditions prevail in the industry producing the like product with regard to manufacture,
production and sale of that product. Once China has established, under the national law of the
importing WTO Member, that it is a market economy, the above provision shall be terminated
provided that the importing Member's national law contains market economy criteria as of the
date of accession. In any event, the provisions of non-market economy shall expire 15 years
after the date of accession.
         In addition, China agreed to accept so-called “Transitional Product-Specific Safeguard
Mechanism” against its products in cases where products of Chinese origin are being imported
into the territory of any WTO Member in such increased quantities or under such conditions as
to cause or threaten to cause market disruption to the domestic producers of like or directly

   More technically, the China’s application for accession was not to re-enter the GATT, but to resume a
contracting party status of the GATT. The Chairman of the Working Party was Mr. P-L. Girard from

whenever imports of an article, like or directly competitive with an article produced by the
domestic industry, are increasing rapidly, either absolutely or relatively, so as to be a significant
cause of material injury, or threat of material injury to the domestic industry”.24 In other words,
this special safeguard mechanism effectively lowers the threshold for invoking safeguard
actions from serious injury to material injury that is normally required for unfair trade cases
such as antidumping or countervailing measures. This special safeguard mechanism shall be
terminated 12 years after the date of accession.

          During the GATT period, formal trade dispute settlements were not frequently utilized
by East Asian countries except for Japan. Thailand had disputes concerning tobacco with the
United States as both a complainant and a respondent. Korea was challenged twice at the GATT
dispute settlement system and brought a complaint against the EC. Other East Asian countries
were not visible at least in terms of the GATT dispute settlement system. It is partly because
those countries acceded to the GATT relatively late and partly because their trade volumes were
not significant during the GATT period.

         Japan was, however, one of the most frequent targets for complaints in the GATT
dispute settlement system.25 While it brought 12 complaints on 11 distinct matters mostly
against the US and the EC, Japan was challenged in 28 cases on 23 distinct matters. Among 28
cases challenged, 13 cases went to a panel and only 6 cases ended with substantive panel reports.
12 complaints by Japan resulted in only 2 panel decisions. Under the GATT system, the EC and
the US were the major disputing parties. It is noted that whereas Japan stood against the EC in 5
cases as both complainant and respondent, the US challenged Japan in 12 cases and was
challenged by Japan in 4 cases. In terms of a subject matter, anti-dumping measures by trading
partners were the primary target of Japan’s complaints. To the contrary, import restrictive
measures by Japan concerning agricultural, textile and leather products were major issues
disputed by other GATT contracting parties.

Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Japan, The
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.

its trade diplomacy while Japan was frequently targeted at dispute settlement cases.28 During
the GATT regime, Japan was considered one of those countries that leaned toward pragmatism
as opposed to other countries, among which was notably the United States, that favored
legalism29. Japan tried to resolve a dispute with mutual agreement, rather than actually litigate
merits of cases through the dispute settlement system. Whereas a sizable number of cases were
filed against Japan under the GATT dispute settlement system, Japan seldom brought a dispute
to the GATT until the late 1980s. Moreover, Japan continued its efforts to settle the dispute
amicably by agreement between the parties even after a case was referred to a panel. Thus,
among 28 cases brought against Japan in the GATT, only six cases ended with a substantive
report by the panel. Only two out of 12 cases Japan brought to the GATT dispute settlement
system concluded with panel decisions.
            Japan was not very eager to bring a dispute to the GATT so as to assert its rights under
the GATT. Japan generally tried to avoid having recourse to more confrontational panel
procedures. It was not until 1988 that Japan requested the establishment of a panel for the first
time, 33 years after its accession to the GATT. But, after the EC – Regulation on Import of Parts
and Components case ended with favorable decisions to Japan, the Japanese government
changed its attitude and has pursued more rule-oriented trade policies since.30

dispute settlement system suffered particularly from forum shopping problems. See generally John H.

concurred, the WTO dispute settlement system has been working very effectively in resolution
of trade disputes and become the core part of the WTO system. As of June 26, 2003, 295 cases
have been brought to the WTO dispute settlement body. Among them, 71 panel and Appellate
Body reports were adopted, while 44 cases were resolved with mutually agreed solutions and 24
cases were settled or inactive.33 One provisional empirical observation is that trade tends to
increase with more trade disputes.34 This fact deserves a more rigorous empirical analysis,

   Professor Andrew Rose found this result using standard bilateral gravity models of trade. His
provisional finding includes that this result does not depend on which country files against which country.
I am very grateful to his sharing of this interesting empirical result. More rigorous econometric studies on
this point will be presented by us.

especially in respect of simultaneity problem.
                            The yearly trend of WTO dispute cases filed up to July 2003 is shown in Figure 1. As
illustrated in Figure 1, WTO dispute cases were rapidly increased during the first three years
and then averaged around 30 cases per year. Dispute cases concerning East Asian countries,
however, show an interesting feature that the role of East Asian countries as complainants have
increased recently compared to that as respondents. It is also noted that WTO disputes among
East Asian countries are still rare. Instead, their complaints are predominantly focused on the
United States while the United States is also the most frequent complainant against the East
Asian countries.35 To the contrary, the European Communities has hardly been the target for
complaints by the East Asian countries, except for by Thailand, whereas it is the second most
frequent complainant against them.36

A. Japan as Complainant
         As a complainant, the primary disputing party for Japan has been the United States. Up
to date, seven out of ten complaints are against the United States. In terms of subject matters,
trade remedy measures, particularly antidumping measures by the United States, were the major
issue to be disputed. It is also noted that automotive industry in Japan has actively utilized the
WTO dispute settlement system to address WTO-inconsistent trade barriers in foreign markets.
In that regard, it is noteworthy that three complaints against Brazil, Indonesia and Canada are all
concerned with measures related to an automobile industry. Considering the fact that the very
first WTO complaint by Japan against the United States also dealt with automobile industry, the
WTO dispute settlement mechanism appears to play a crucial role for rectifying unfair
competitive conditions regarding Japanese automotive industries.

          The very first complaint by Japan to the WTO DSB, US – Imposition of Import Duties
on Automobiles from Japan under Sections 301 and 304 of the Trade Act of 1974 (DS6), indeed
provided the Japanese government with profound confidence in the new system. Right after the
WTO began its work in 1995, the United States threatened the unilateral retaliation on Japanese
automobiles under Section 301.37 Instead of undertaking “negotiations” as previously done, the
Japanese government resorted to the WTO dispute settlement system by challenging the Section
301 measures.38 The United States finally withdrew the Section 301 threat and both parties
notified the settlement of the dispute to the WTO on July 19, 1995.39 The outcome of this case
forcefully illustrated the effectiveness and usefulness of the WTO dispute settlement system as
opposed to unilateralism.


B. Japan as Respondent
          As a respondent, Japan has been challenged mostly by the European Communities and
the United States. It is noted that whereas Japan has been challenged most by the European
Communities, it has not raised so far any consultation request against the European
Communities. Unlike other WTO Members, especially the United States and the European
Communities that have frequently utilized trade remedy measures to protect domestic industries,
Japan rarely relied on those measures to constrain importation. Accordingly, Japan has never
been challenged concerning application of trade remedy measures that is in fact the most
frequently disputed issue under the WTO dispute settlement system. Instead, the challenged area
for Japan encompassed a range of issues from domestic tax system to distribution services and
SPS measures for agricultural products.
          Interestingly, complaints against Japan were concentrated during the early WTO years,
particularly 1995-1997. The last consultation request against Japan was submitted to the WTO
on October 8, 1998 by the European Communities concerning the management of the tariff
quotas for leather and the subsidies allegedly benefiting the leather industry and "Dowa" regions.
The consultation for this case is technically pending yet. Since then, Japan has not been
challenged by other WTO Members. This may be explained by the fact that complaints against
Japan under the WTO dispute settlement system have been concerning more systemic issues

rather than case-specific actions such as trade remedy measures that are hardly used by the
Japanese government. In other words, after somewhat intensive probing by other WTO
Members in the early WTO years, systemic or legal inconsistency of domestic policy measures
or legal systems were mostly addressed and modified to comply with the WTO disciplines.
There remain, therefore, few systemic problems to be addressed at least in terms of the current
WTO disciplines.
          Among 9 challenged cases, Japan – Measures Affecting Consumer Photographic Film
and Paper (DS44, ‘Japan – Film’) deserves more explanation. This case is so far the only case
in which the primary complaint is based on non-violation claims.40 Despite strenuous efforts by
the United states to vindicate its claims, the panel ruled that the United States failed to
demonstrate that, under GATT Article XXIII:1(b), the distribution "measures" nullify or impair
benefits accruing to the United States.41 This ultimate legal victory for Japan under the WTO
dispute settlement system, after initiated by positive determination under the Section 301
proceeding, substantially strengthened the Japanese government’s position concerning its
domestic trade policies.42 Typically, Japan has been vulnerable to blames for its convoluted
non-tariff barriers. But, after this case, the Japanese government has become much more
stubborn to accept its trading partners’ claims concerning unjustified or unreasonable non-tariff
barriers, at least administered by the government.
          Under the WTO system, Japan’s dispute settlement has predominantly dealt with the
United States. In terms of subject matters, anti-dumping measures, particularly by the United
States, have been a major area for dispute settlement. On the other hand, the European
Communities brought the most complaints regarding trade barriers in Japan. It is noted that
Japan has not raised any complaints against the European Communities under the WTO system,
although the European Communities was the most frequent target of Japan’s complaints under
the GATT system. It is also noteworthy that Japan is now one of the most active third parties for
the WTO dispute settlement. As a third party, Japan has showed a strong interest in disputes
concerning measures by the US government.

         Under the WTO system, the Korean government changed a dispute aversion attitude
and has become considerably more active in asserting its rights through the dispute settlement
mechanism. Incidentally, since the middle 1990s, the trade balances with those major trading
partners have been reversed and showed substantial deficits. For example, the trade deficit of
Korea with respect to the United States began to occur from 1994 and remained throughout
1997, reaching $8.5 billion in 1997. This trend was again reversed in 1998 primarily due to the
financial crisis which caused imports to plummet. Although there were some differences in the
magnitude of the trade imbalances, the overall trends of trade balance were very much the same
with respect to other major trading partners. The changes in such underlying economic
circumstances would partly explain more aggressive attitude of the Korean government toward
formal dispute resolution.

A. Korea as Respondent
         As of August 2003, Korea was challenged by 12 complaints on 9 distinct matters, as
summarized in Table 7. It is noted that complainants against Korea have so far been raised
mostly by the United States and the European Communities. The only two other complaints
were filed by Australia and Canada. Since the Korean government commenced the litigation of
WTO cases in Korea - Taxes on Alcoholic Beverages, it seems predetermined to exhaust the full
procedure of the dispute settlement system, at least if contested by other Members.


1. Settlement by Consultation: Not Yet Ready to Litigate
         Korea was a respondent in some of the very early cases in the WTO dispute settlement,
which concerned somewhat unfamiliar obligations under the SPS and TBT Agreements. The
United States made a consultation request against Korea on April 6, 1995 (DS3) and basically
on the same matter again on May 24, 1996 (DS41)44. Both cases were suspended because the
United States did not take additional steps. On May 5, 1995, the United States made a
consultation request regarding the regulation on the shelf-life of products (DS5). This case was
settled with a mutually acceptable solution.45 The Canadian request for consultation regarding
the Korean regulation on the shelf-life and disinfection treatment of bottled water was also
settled with a mutually satisfactory solution (DS20).46 These four complaints were based on the
SPS and TBT Agreements in addition to the GATT and could be settled promptly.
         On May 9, 1996, the European Communities requested for consultations, alleging that
the procurement practices for the Korean telecommunications sector were discriminatory
against foreign suppliers, and that the bilateral agreement with the United States was
preferential (DS40). The parties also agreed on a mutually satisfactory solution during the
consultation.47
         The Korean government basically tried to settle the first five complaints, rather than
actually litigate the cases. This is partly because the merits of the cases were relatively clear and

measures adopted by the Korean government after the first consultation request. WTO, WT/DS41/1, dated

Community’ on 29 October 1997 and the Agreement entered into force on 1 November 1997.
Subsequently, Korea entered into a similar bilateral agreement for telecommunications equipment
procurement with Canada. See also Han-young Lie & Dukgeun Ahn, ‘Legal Issues of Privatization in
Government Procurement Agreements: Experience of Korea from Bilateral and WTO Agreements’, 9 (2)
International Trade Law & Regulation 54 (2003).


                                                  16
partly because the economic stakes at issue were not substantial. In addition, the Korean
government was not sufficiently prepared to handle the newly instituted WTO dispute
settlement system in the procedural aspect and unfamiliar legal issues concerning the SPS and
TBT Agreements in the substantive aspect.


2. Full Litigation: Fight to the End
         The very first case in which Korea experienced the whole WTO dispute settlement
procedure was the Korea – Taxes on Alcoholic Beverages (‘Korea – Soju’) case (DS75 and
DS84). The European Communities and the United States contended that the Korean liquor
taxes of 100% on whisky and 35% on diluted soju were not consistent with the national
treatment obligation under Article III of the GATT. Basically, this case was considered as a
‘revisited’ Japan – Taxes on Alcoholic Beverages (‘Japan – Shochu’) case (DS8, DS10 and
DS11), in which the Japanese tax system to discriminate imported alcoholic beverages over
shochu was found to be in violation of Article III of the GATT. As a legal strategy to distinguish
this case from the Japan-Shochu case, the Korean government tried to inject more antitrust law
principles and experts in the panel proceeding because a large price gap between soju and
whiskey might be deemed to represent a non-competitive relationship of pertinent products in
the antitrust law context.48
         The panel and the Appellate Body held that the Korean taxes on soju and whisky were
discriminatory and the Dispute Settlement Body (hereinafter ‘DSB’) adopted this ruling on
February 17, 1999. The reasonable period for implementation was determined to be 11 months
and two weeks, that is, from February 17, 1999 to January 31, 2000.49 Subsequently, Korea
amended the Liquor Tax Law and the Education Tax Law to impose flat rates of 72% in liquor
tax and 30% in education tax, that entered into force on January 1, 2000. 50 The DSB
recommendation was successfully implemented a month earlier than the due date.
         This case awakened the Korean public about the role and influence of the WTO dispute
settlement system. The media and newspapers closely covered every step pertaining to this case,
from the consultation request to the panel proceeding and the Appellate Body ruling. It was not
just because this case was the first WTO dispute settlement proceeding for Korea, but also
because the popularity of the product concerned, soju, was probably incomparable to any other
product in Korea. Despite objections by the general public as well as by soju manufacturers, the

nationality as panelists, but failed due to the objection by the complainants. Hyun Chong Kim, ‘The WTO

Korean government amended the tax laws to substantially increase liquor taxes on soju, instead
of reducing the liquor tax on whisky to the original level on soju, in order to eliminate the
WTO-illegal tax gap while minimizing the potential adverse impact on public health and
consequent social costs.51 By experiencing the impact of the WTO dispute settlement decision
probably at the deepest and widest level of a daily life, this case played a crucial role to enhance
the WTO awareness in Korea.
         The first dispute settlement case under the Agreement on Safeguards also involved the
Korean safeguard measure concerning dairy products (DS98) 52. On August 12, 1997, the
European Communities requested consultations with Korea regarding the safeguard quotas that
went into effect on March 7, 1997 and was to remain in force until February 28, 2001.53 The
panel and the Appellate Body held that the Korean safeguard measures were inconsistent with
the obligations under the Agreement on Safeguards. The DSB adopted those rulings on January
12, 2000 and the reasonable implementation period was agreed to expire on May 20, 2000.
Korea, through its administrative procedures, effectively lifted the safeguard measure on
imports of the dairy products as of May 20, 2000.
         Since its inception in 1987 to 1994, the KTC had relied more on safeguard measures
than on antidumping measures to address injury to domestic industries incurred by
importation.54 During 1987-1994, the KTC engaged in 25 safeguard and 12 anti-dumping
investigations that resulted in 16 safeguard and 8 antidumping measures.55 After this case,
however, the KTC markedly abstained from using a safeguard measure whereas it substantially
increased anti-dumping actions. For example, from 1997 to 2002, there were only 4 safeguard
investigations but 46 anti-dumping cases.56 Accordingly, subsequent safeguard actions by the
KTC appeared seriously disciplined by the WTO dispute settlement system. The safeguard
mechanism in Korea was further elaborated with new laws and regulations on trade remedy
actions.57
         On the other hand, it was reported that the importation of dairy products at issue was

    The first complaint brought under the Agreement on Safeguards was US – Safeguard Measure against

reduced by about $70 million during the period in which the safeguard measure remained in
force. This result, along with the outcome from Argentina – Safeguard Measures on Imports of
Footwear (‘Argentina – Footwear’) 58 case whose proceedings were conducted almost
concomitantly, raised an important systemic issue for the WTO safeguard system. In the Korea -
Definitive Safeguard Measure on Imports of Certain Dairy Products case, the termination of
illegal safeguard measures pursuant to the DSB recommendation was undertaken only 9 months
prior to the original due date of the measures. In the Argentina – Footwear case, the
implementation of the DSB recommendation by repealing the safeguard measure coincided with
the original due date of the measure. Thus, the experience from these early safeguard cases
raised imminent need for considering expeditious or accelerated dispute settlement procedures.
          On February 1, 1999, the United States requested consultations with Korea in respect
of a dual retail system for beef (‘Korea – Beef II’; DS161). On April 13, 1999, Australia also
requested consultations on the same basis (DS169). On January 10, 2001, the DSB adopted the
panel and the Appellate Body reports that held the Korean measures to be inconsistent with the
WTO obligation. The parties to the dispute agreed that a reasonable implementation period
would be 8 months and thus expire on September 10, 2001. 59 The Korean government
subsequently revised the ‘Management Guideline for Imported Beef’ to abolish the beef import
system operated by the Livestock Products Marketing Organization. 60 In addition, on
September 10, 2001, the Korean government eliminated the dual retail system for beef by
entirely abolishing the ‘Management Guideline for Imported Beef’.61 Thus, Korea considered
that it had fully implemented the DSB's recommendation in this case.62
          The only dispute settlement case concerning the Agreement on Government
Procurement (‘GPA’) to date is Korea - Measures Affecting Government Procurement
(DS163).63 On February 16, 1999, the United States requested consultations regarding certain
procurement practices of the Korean Airport Construction Authority (‘KOACA’). The panel
ultimately ruled that the KOACA was not a covered entity under Korea’s Appendix I of the GPA,
even if the panel noted that the conduct of the Korean government with respect to the US

   This case is the fourth complaint concerning government procurement. The first complaint, Japan –
Procurement of a Navigation Satellite (DS73), was settled with a mutually satisfactory solution. The
second and third complaints, US – Measure Affecting Government Procurement (DS88, DS95), were in
respect of the same issue. The panel’s authority lapsed as of February 11, 2000, when it was not requested
to resume the proceeding after suspension of the works. WTO, WT/DS88, DS95/6 (dated Feb. 14, 2000).

inquiries in the course of pertinent negotiation “[could], at best, be described as inadequate”.64
The United States did not make an appeal and the panel report was adopted on June 19, 2000.65
One of the important lesson from this case for the Korean government was about the
discrepancy between its organizational mechanism for governmental offices that is based on
decision making structures and the WTO concession practice that is based on the institutional
‘entities’ in the context of the GPA. The Government Organization Act of the Republic of Korea
prescribes various government entities that actually constitute mere positions of certain level.
Moreover, the Korean government has often established a special ‘task force’, ‘group’, or
‘committee’ with specific mandates, whose legal foundations are obscure.66 This issue of how
to determine the scope of covered entities in relation to a newly established governmental organ
may require a more elaborate approach in the context of the GPA.
         On October 24, 2000, the Committee of European Union Shipbuilders Associations
filed a complaint under the trade barriers regulation (‘TBR’) procedure concerning divergent
financial arrangements for Korean shipbuilding industries. Although the Commission was
mindful of the extraordinary situation in Korea that was caused by the financial crisis in 1997, it
found that parts of corporate restructuring programs and assistance through taxation for
shipbuilding companies constituted prohibited subsidies within the meaning of the WTO
Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (‘SCM Agreement’).67 On October 21,
2002, the European Communities made a formal request for a consultation with Korea under the
WTO dispute settlement system on various corporate restructuring measures for the
shipbuilding industry, alleging that they constituted prohibited subsidies under the SCM
Agreement.68
         This case was merely the beginning of much more controversial trade conflicts as
regards corporate restructuring programs undertaken by the Korean government as parts of the
IMF program to overcome the financial crisis. On July 25, 2002, the European Commission
initiated a countervailing investigation on the Korean semiconductor producers, alleging that the
governmental intervention in terms of debt-for-equity swaps and debt forgiveness for pertinent
companies established illegal subsidies.69 They concluded the countervailing proceeding with
35% of final duties. Apart from the EC’s action against the Korean government, the US
authorities also initiated a countervailing investigation in November 2002 that ended up with a

final determination for countervailing duties up to 57.73%. 70 The final duty was slightly
reduced to 44.29% when the US authorities corrected calculation mistakes. 71 These
concomitant actions in the two major markets, if sustained in the final determinations, would
risk the whole fate of the third largest semiconductor producer in the world. Furthermore, the
legal validity of those actions would have significant implications for many other Korean
industries that experienced similar restructuring programs in the course of the IMF program
during the past few years. The Korean government brought complaints against both actions to
the WTO DSB to vindicate the legitimacy of its systemic and structural measures adopted
during the IMF program. The outcome of the WTO dispute settlement related to this dispute
would certainly be an interesting and important addition to the WTO jurisprudence.


3. Overall Comments
         Considering the experience so far as a respondent in the WTO dispute settlement, the
reaction by the Korean government appears to show a typical pattern of an average WTO
Member. For half of the complaints, Korea tried to settle the trade disputes without resorting to
legal procedures. But, as it obtained more experience and the WTO jurisprudence became more
sophisticated, Korea has become determined to take a more legalistic approach in dealing with
complaints by other Members.
         When engaged in a WTO legal proceeding, Korea has been in full compliance with
DSB recommendations. For all three cases in which Korea was found to be inconsistent with the
WTO Agreements, Korea fully implemented the DSB recommendations within the determined
or agreed reasonable periods of time, even in politically loaded areas such as taxes and
agriculture. It is also noted that Korea made appeals for all three cases in which the panels found
some violations for its own measures. Lastly, it should also be noted that the areas challenged by
other Member countries are fairly diverse, ranging from SPS and TBT measures to government
procurement, safeguard, domestic taxes and retailing distribution systems. This is starkly
contrasted with the cases in which Korea brought complaints, which concentrated mainly on
antidumping measures. Overall, the dispute settlement experience of Korea as a respondent in
such divergent areas under the auspice of the WTO has played a significant role to enhance the
public recognition of the importance of the multilateral trade norms in all aspects of economic
activities and policy making.

B. Korea as Complainant
         So far, the Korean complaints in the WTO dispute settlement system have focused
primarily on the US trade remedy measures, especially antidumping measures. Five out of the
total nine complaints concerned with antidumping matters and seven complaints were against
the United States. Only one case was against the Philippines and the other against the European
Communities. Two cases were concerning safeguard measures and the other two were
concerning countervailing duties. In other words, the Korean complaints to the WTO dispute
settlement system up to date can be simply summarized as exclusive concentration on trade
remedy issues, predominantly caused by US antidumping measures.
         While Korea had been challenged in the WTO dispute settlement system from the very
early period72, Korea appeared quite hesitant to bring complaints against other WTO Member
countries. It was not until July 1997 that Korea began to use the WTO dispute settlement system
as a complainant. The first WTO case Korea brought to the DSB was in respect of the US
antidumping duties on Samsung color television receivers. On July 10, 1997, Korea requested a
consultation, alleging that the United States had maintained an antidumping duty order for the
past 12 years despite the cessation of exports as well as the absence of dumping. Subsequently,
in response to the US preliminary determination of December 19, 1997 to revoke the anti-
dumping duty order, Korea withdrew its request for a panel. On August 27, 1998, the United
States made a final determination to revoke the anti-dumping duty order which had been
imposed on Samsung color television receivers since 1984. At the DSB meeting on September
22, 1998, Korea announced that it definitively withdrew the request for a panel because the
imposition of anti-dumping duties had been revoked.73
         For a similar case regarding antidumping duty orders on DRAMS, however, the United
States did not readily revoke the orders and, on November 6, 1997, Korea requested the
establishment of a panel. The DSB established a panel at its meeting on January 16, 1998. On
March 19, 1998, the Director-General completed the panel composition and thereby Korea began
its first panel proceeding as a complainant. The Panel found the measures at issue to be in
violation of Article 11.2 of the WTO Antidumping Agreement.74 The United States did not make
an appeal and the DSB adopted the panel report on March 19, 1999.
         Incidentally, this first ‘win’ as a complainant in US – DRAMS came just 11 days after

72
   In 1995, three consultation requests were brought against Korea. The first two requests for Korea –
Measures Concerning the Testing and Inspection of Agricultural Products (DS3) and Korea – Measures
Concerning the Shelf-Life of Products (DS5) were made on April 6 and May 5, 1995.

Korea lost its first WTO litigation as a respondent in Korea – Soju.75 This somewhat fortunate
timing of winning a WTO case contributed to alleviating the general concern and skepticism of the
Korean public about the fairness and objectivity of the WTO dispute settlement system.
         The two parties agreed on an implementation period of 8 months, expiring on November
19, 1999. At the DSB meeting on January 27, 2000, the United States stated that it had
implemented the DSB recommendations by amending the pertinent Department of Commerce
(‘DOC’) regulation, more specifically, by deleting the ‘not likely’ standard and incorporating the
‘necessary’ standard of the WTO Antidumping Agreement. The DOC, however, issued a revised
‘Final Results of Re-determination’ in the third administrative review on November 4, 1999,
concluding that, because a resumption of dumping was likely, it was necessary to leave the
antidumping order in place. On April 6, 2000, Korea requested the referral of this matter to the
original panel pursuant to Article 21.5 of the DSU and the European Communities reserved its
third-party right. On September 19, 2000, Korea requested the panel to suspend its work and, on
October 20, 2000, the parties notified the DSB of a mutually satisfactory solution to the matter,
involving the revocation of the antidumping order at issue as the result of a five-year ‘sunset’
review by the DOC.76
         This case was the first case ever in which Korea won a favorable panel decision
throughout the GATT/WTO system. Although it took one and half more years for the United
States to satisfactorily comply with the DSB recommendation after the adoption of the panel
report, the sheer fact of winning a WTO dispute concerning chronic trade barriers of the major
trading partners furnished the Korean government with confidence in the new WTO dispute
settlement system. Unfortunately, however, the dismal implementation by the United States after
the panel proceeding compromised confidence of a relatively new user concerning the
effectiveness and fairness of the WTO dispute settlement system.77 In any case, US – DRAMS
clearly led the Korean government to adopt a more legal approach by utilizing the WTO dispute
settlement system to address foreign trade barriers in subsequent cases. In other words, the
experience and confidence gained from this case clearly led the Korean government to move to
the direction of ‘aggressive legalism’ in handling subsequent trade disputes.78

Stainless Steel Sheet and Strip from Korea (‘Korea-Stainless Steel’) case dealt with two separate
antidumping actions by the US authorities concerning stainless steel plate in coils (‘plate’) and
stainless steel sheet and strip in coils (‘sheet’). For the antidumping case on plate, the DOC
selected January 1 to December 31, 1997 as the period of investigation and issued the final
dumping margin of 16.26%. The antidumping case for sheet covered April 1, 1997 through March
31, 1998 as the period of investigation and issued the final dumping margin of 58.79% for Taihan
and 12.12% for other Korean exporters including POSCO. In this case, the panel was established
on November 19, 1999 but actually composed on March 24, 2000.79

             The underlying economic situation for this case is remarkably aberrational.81 The
pertinent investigation periods included unprecedented fluctuation of exchange rates caused by
the financial crisis. As illustrated in Figure 1, the value of the Korean currency, Won,
precipitated to a half just in a time span of three months. The WTO panel found that the
methodology adopted by the DOC to deal with such abnormity, including double currency
conversion and the use of multiple averaging periods, were not consistent with the WTO
obligations. Without the US’ appeal, the DSB adopted the panel report on February 1, 2001.


79
   It took 126 days to compose the panel, which is so far the longest period of time required for the panel
appointment in cases involving Korea.

         This case showed how vulnerable exporters might be in terms of antidumping actions
as the exchange rates became abnormally fluctuating. Since dumping margin calculation permits
various price adjustment to find ‘ex-factory’ prices but no modification for volatile exchange
rates except for averaging, unstable exchange rates can cause serious distortion in calculating
dumping margins. This systemic problem may expose more exporters in developing countries
that suffer from vacillating exchange rates to additional risks of being targeted by antidumping
actions. Based on the Korean experience during the financial crisis, in which foreign exchange
rates fluctuated at more than a normal or reasonable level, Members may consider suspension of
antidumping actions at least for certain range of dumping margins that should reflect potential
methodological errors. In other words, Members may consider an increase of the current de
minimis level for a period with exchange rate aberration.
         On June 13, 2000, Korea made its fourth consultation request, again with the United
States, in respect of the definitive safeguard measure imposed on imports of circular welded
carbon quality line pipe. The definitive safeguard measure actually imposed by the President on
February 11, 2000 was much more restrictive than that recommended by the International Trade
Commission (‘ITC’), disproportionately injuring the largest suppliers, i.e., Korean exporters.82
The exemption of Mexican and Canadian suppliers from the safeguard measure led them to
become the largest and third largest suppliers.
         Korea considered that the US procedures and determinations to impose the safeguard
measure, as well as the measure itself, contravened various obligations under the Agreement on
Safeguards and the GATT 1994. The panel concluded that the US measure was imposed in a
manner inconsistent with the WTO obligations. In the Appellate Body proceeding83, the Korea’s
argument on the permissible extent of a safeguard measure was accepted, which seems one of
the key findings for the WTO jurisprudence on safeguard.84
         It is noted that this appellate proceeding was the first WTO dispute settlement litigation
handled entirely by Korean government officials. It was a substantial development for Korea in
terms of capacity building for utilizing the WTO dispute settlement system, particularly
considering the previous cases in which foreign legal counsels played primary roles in WTO
litigations. Moreover, when considering the fact that Korea is one of the WTO Members that did

   The imports above the first 9,000 short tons from each country would be subject to a 19%, 15% and
11% duty for the first, second and third year. See WTO Panel Report, United States – Definitive

reasons on 13 November (WT/DS202/8). The appeal was re-filed on 19 November 2001 (WT/DS202/9).

contribute to set the procedural practices to permit private counsel in a dispute settlement
proceeding, the outcome of the US – Line Pipe appellate proceeding substantially enhanced self-
confidence and capacity in terms of much needed legal expertise.
           When both parties agreed on the reasonable period of time for implementation with
expiration on September 1, 2002, the arbitration under DSU Article 21.3 was suspended.85 The
US government agreed to increase the in-quota volume of imports to 17,500 tons and lower the
safeguard tariff to 11%, with the termination due of March 1, 2003.86 But, considering the
original due date of the safeguard measure that was set at February 24, 2003, the practical
impact of the WTO dispute settlement system was to increase the in-quota volume from 9,000
to 17,500 tons only for the period of September 1, 2002 to February 24, 2003, while the latter
measure remained until the end of February 2003. Thus, this case again illustrated the systemic
problem in implementation of a safeguard dispute.
           On December 15, 2000, Korea requested consultations with the Philippines concerning
the dumping decision of the Tariff Commission of the Philippines on polypropylene resins. This
antidumping order was actually the first antidumping measure by the Philippines against Korean
exporters, since the first antidumping investigation against Korean electrolytic tinplates was
dismissed for lack of merit.87 The Tariff Commission of the Philippines imposed the provisional
antidumping duties on polypropylene resins ranging from 4.20% to 40.53% and subsequently
the final duties at slightly lowered levels.88 Following the consultation on January 19, 2001
under the purview of the WTO dispute settlement system, the Philippines withdrew the
antidumping order on November 8, 2001 and Korea did not pursue further action in the DSB.89
This case is so far the only trade dispute for Korea elevated to the formal dispute settlement
procedure as opposed to a developing country.
           The fifth WTO complaint by Korea against the United States was also related to
antidumping matters. On December 21, 2000, Korea, along with Australia, Brazil, Chile,
European Communities, India, Indonesia, Japan and Thailand, requested consultations with the
United States concerning the amendment to the Tariff Act of 1930, titled ‘Continued Dumping
and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000’ that is usually referred to as the ‘Byrd Amendment’. By
distributing the antidumping and countervailing duties to domestic petitioners, the Byrd
Amendment aimed to create more incentives to bring trade remedy actions. As the third frequent
target for antidumping and countervailing measures in the US market, Korean exporters were

very keen on the outcome of this case.90
          The panel established by the requests from 9 Members was later merged with the panel
requested by Canada and Mexico. The panel and the Appellate Body found that the Byrd
Amendment was inconsistent with the Antidumping and SCM Agreement. Furthermore, the
panel suggested that the United States bring the Byrd Amendment into conformity by repealing
it. On April 2, 2003, the arbitrator was appointed to determine a reasonable period of
implementation under DSU Article 21.3.
          Ironically, a subsidiary company of a Korean manufacturer received a substantial
‘offset’ disbursement under the Byrd Amendment. Zenith Electronics owned by LG Electronics
received the disbursement of $24.3 million in 2001 and $9 million in 2002 from antidumping
duties collected on Japanese television imports. The offset payment for Zenith Electronics in
2001 was indeed more than 10% of the total disbursement of $231.2 million in 2001.91 In 2002,
the total disbursement under the Byrd Amendment was increased to $329.8 million.92
          On March 20, 2002, Korea requested consultation with the United States regarding the
definitive safeguard measures on the imports of certain steel products and the related laws
including Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 311 of the NAFTA Implementation
Act. The DSB established a single panel to include complaints by other Members such as the
European Communities, Japan, China, Switzerland, Norway, New Zealand and Brazil.93 In
addition to most complainants that reserved third party rights, Taiwan, Cuba, Malaysia, Mexico,
Thailand, Turkey and Venezuela also participated as third parties in the proceeding. On July 25,
2002, the Director-General composed the panel. Taiwan later determined to become a more
active participant and made an independent consultation request with the United States on
November 1, 2002.94
          Concerning this US Section 201 action, the Korean government made the first trade

is noted that only two ball bearing companies, Torrington and MPB (The Timken Company), received
more offset payments in gross than Zenith Electronics in 2001. Their total disbursements amount to $62.8
million and $25 million, respectively. But, the disbursement for Zenith Electronics is the second largest
one in terms of individual claims, following $34.7 million offset payment for Torrington in relation to ball
bearings dumping from Japan.

government did not agree on satisfactory compensatory arrangements, several WTO Members,
such as the European Communities96, Japan97, Norway98, China99, and Switzerland100, notified to
the Council for Trade in Goods of proposed suspension of concessions. Instead of proposing
suspension of concessions, the Korean government notified the Council for Trade in Goods of
the agreement that the 90-day period set forth in Article 8.2 of the Agreement on Safeguards and
Article XIX:3(a) of the GATT shall be considered to expire on March 19, 2005.101 This
agreement to postpone potential retaliation for about three years, however, practically wipes out
all real impact on balancing trade interests, since the original safeguard measure is supposed to
end on March 20, 2005.102 In other words, the Korean government tried to avoid the possibility
to actually exercise the suspension of concession against one of its major trading partners
without the DSB authorization, while it still maintained a political gesture that it exercised a
legal authority specifically enunciated under the Agreement on Safeguards.
         As described above, Korea has had major problems regarding the US antidumping
practices. In some sense, its experience as a complainant in the WTO dispute settlement system
almost exclusively against US antidumping practices is puzzling because, during the period of
January 1, 1995 to June 20, 2002, it was the European Communities that initiated the most
antidumping investigations against exported products from Korea, and it was South Africa and
India that actually imposed the most antidumping measures.103 This fact seems to imply that the
US market still occupies an unbalanced economic importance for Korea.104 Currently, Korea is

         For three cases in which the entire dispute settlement procedure including
implementation ended, the major problem Korea faced was the failure to ensure prompt and
effective compliance by a respondent. The implementation for the US –DRAMS and US – Line
Pipe cases was in fact not much more than the mere expiration of the original trade remedy
measures. This result raises concern for effectiveness and fairness of the WTO dispute
settlement system, especially when dealing with the WTO litigation demands sizeable financial
and human resources. In particular, the lack of legal systems to represent private parties’ interest
in line with Section 301 and TBR procedures would inevitably result in a less enthusiastic
approach for resorting to the legal activism for many WTO Members including Korea, because
government officials in charge of WTO disputes may not have an incentive to initiate all those
costly procedures merely for ‘paper’ winning.

Thailand


         Thailand is in some sense unique in a manner that they uses the WTO dispute
settlement system. Thailand is currently the most active developing country complainant in the
WTO. Whereas Thailand was challenged only once so far by Poland concerning antidumping
measures, it made 10 consultation requests against other WTO Members. The EC has been the
most frequent target of Thailand’s complaints. Other than the EC, Thailand’s complaints were
raised against various countries, including Colombia, Egypt, Hungary, Turkey and the United
States. It is noted that Thailand’s complaints are often raised against other developing countries.
In terms of subject matters, Thailand’s dispute settlement experience also showed a typical
pattern of developing countries by focusing mostly on foreign trade barriers on agricultural and
textile products.

         No WTO Member has raised a formal complaint against China or Taiwan yet although
they joined the WTO more than a year and half ago. This does not mean that trade policy
measures of both Members are completely consistent with the WTO disciplines. In fact, as
many Members are concerned, these two Members with substantial trade volumes may still
maintain numerous potentially controversial measures or laws, especially considering the short
experience on multilateral trade disciplines. Although it is true that both Members have exerted
strenuous efforts to bring their system into conformity with the WTO system, more dispute
cases concerning both Members seem unavoidable for the future WTO dispute settlement
system. In particular, the Chinese government has been very active in using trade remedy
measures to protect domestic import markets.106 Some of these measures may not be free from
WTO challenges in the future.

         Another interesting question is whether and how China would deal with Taiwan in
terms of the WTO dispute settlement system. In case Taiwan raises a complaint against China
and seeks to proceed to panel and the Appellate Body proceedings, there is no mechanism to
block such procedures under the WTO dispute settlement system.107 It would bring about a

diplomatically sensitive situation in which China and Taiwan stand against each other with
equivalent status in an international forum, which may cause a very difficult political dilemma
for these Members. Since the WTO is the only international organization of which Taiwan is a
full Member, Taiwan may have strong incentives to use the WTO dispute settlement system to
promote the image as a political entity that is on par with China.108 It remains to be seen how
these Members agree to address this problem.



IV.      East Asia in the WTO DSU Negotiation


         The DSU review mandated by a 1994 Ministerial Decision started in the Dispute
Settlement Body in 1997. The deadline stipulated as January 1, 1999 was extended to July 31,
1999, but there was no agreement by then. In November 2001, at the Doha Ministerial
Conference, Member governments agreed to negotiate to improve and clarify the Dispute
Settlement Understanding and conclude the negotiation not later than May 2003.
         East Asian Members have actively participated in various areas of the Doha
negotiations, including reforming the dispute settlement system. In addition to Japan, Korea and
Thailand that have often resorted to the WTO dispute settlement system, China and Taiwan are
also making substantial contribution by submitting their own proposals to the DSU negotiation.
         Although they have shown different emphases on varying issues, their proposals
invariably try to enhance efficiency and transparency of the dispute settlement mechanism,
particularly with respect to the implementation phase of the current procedure. For example,
Japan and Korea submitted elaborated proposals concerning Articles 21 and 22. The proposal by
Japan includes a detailed provision for compliance panel procedures.109 Korea proposed that the
compliance panel proceed to determine the level of the nullification or impairment and to the
extent that the legal findings and conclusions of the compliance panel are modified or reversed
by the Appellate Body, thereby affecting the level of the nullification or impairment, the
Appellate Body determine the final level of the nullification or impairment.110
         China suggested augmentation of special and differential treatment in the DSU to
developing-country Members, including the least developed countries.111 Claiming that China

is a developing-country Member, China proposed that developed-country Members exercise due
restraint in cases against developing-country Members. In other words, developed-country
Members shall not bring more than two cases to the WTO Dispute Settlement Body against a
particular developing-country Member in one calendar year. Moreover, while time periods
applicable under the DSU for dealing with disputes involving safeguard and anti-dumping
measures shall be half of the normal timeframe, the shortened time-frame shall not apply to the
defending party that is a developing-country Member.
          Taiwan made extensive proposal to improve third party rights in the WTO dispute
settlement procedures.112 But, Taiwan opposed some of the proposals made by other Members
such as opening of meetings to the public, public access to submissions and developing
guideline procedures for the handling of amicus curiae submissions.113
          Malaysia made an interesting proposal concerning litigation costs.114 It proposed that
in a dispute involving a developing country Member and a developed country Member as a
complaining party and as a party complained against, respectively, and where that dispute does
not end with a panel or the Appellate Body finding against the former, the panel or the Appellate
Body award litigation costs to the developing-country Member to the tune of US $500,000 or
actual expenses, whichever is higher115. The litigation costs shall include lawyers’ fees, charges
and all other expenses for, preparation of necessary documents116 and participation in, the
consultations, panel and the Appellate Body proceedings. The litigation costs shall also include
travel, hotel, per diem and other expenses for a reasonable number of the Capital based officials.
In fact, litigation costs to deal with WTO disputes have become one of the most serious practical
obstacles to utilize the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. Since private attorneys were
permitted to panel and Appellate Body proceedings in early WTO years, their roles have quickly
become indispensable elements of WTO litigations, probably except for a handful of Members.
The legal expenses to procure such professional lawyers turned out, however, to be sometimes
way beyond the scope of budgetary constraints of developing countries. These problems led
some WTO Members to establish the “Advisory Centre on WTO Law” on October 5, 2001.

    The expenses shall be calculated for each stage of dispute settlement proceedings, which include
consultation, panel and the Appellate Body proceedings as well as the proceedings under Articles 21.3(c),
21.5, 22.6 and 25 of the DSU. The original panel and the panel established pursuant to Article 21.5 of the
DSU shall take into account the expenses relating to the consultations preceding those panel proceedings
for award of litigation costs. The award of litigation costs is binding on the parties and not subject to
appeal.
116
    The documents include request for consultations, oral or written submissions and all other documents
necessary for preparation and participation in the dispute settlement proceedings. They shall also include
oral or written advice rendered prior to, during or after consultations, panel or the Appellate Body
proceedings relating to the dispute.


                                                   33
Currently, Hong Kong, Philippines, and Thailand are signatories to the Centre. Thailand
suggested that the Appellate Body be composed of nine persons, three of whom serve on any
one case.117 Furthermore, it proposed a new panel composition process, including a "Roster of
Panel Chairs" comprised of individuals who may be appointed as Chair of a panel by lot.118
         At its meeting on July 24, 2003, the General Council of the WTO agreed to extend
negotiations in the Dispute Settlement Body Special Session which is reviewing DSU. The
timeframe was extended from May 31, 2003 to May 31, 2004. How much proposals to improve
the DSU can actually be agreed by Members by May 2004 remains to be seen.



V.       National Complaining Procedures for Private Parties


         The WTO dispute settlement system is primarily for Member governments. In other
words, private parties may not be able to bring complaints directly to the WTO dispute
settlement system even if it is indeed private parties that are aggrieved by WTO inconsistent
measures of other WTO Members. Those private parties have to persuade their own
governments to raise complaints on behalf of their economic interests. This mechanism does not,
however, function properly as the discretionary decision of Member governments on whether to
bring a WTO complaint often does not stand in line with private parties’ requests. Since the
WTO Agreement is not normally directly applicable, the lack of systemic nexus between the
WTO dispute settlement system and private parties causes fundamental problems in the WTO
system. This problem becomes more and more serious as the scope of the WTO system tends to
expand by encompassing intrinsically private legal issues such as investment and competition.
         Currently, the most notable examples of linking private parties to the WTO dispute
settlement system are Section 301 mechanism of the United States and the Trade Barriers
Regulation system of the European Communities. Even if the unilateral retaliation has been the
focal point of the Section 301, the most important aspect of the Section 301 mechanism in terms
of trade policy is the establishment of the systemic procedures under which private parties can
force the government to act on their petitions. The European Communities initially introduced
so-called “New Trade Policy Instrument” by Regulation 2641/84119, but substantially modified
it pursuant to the WTO Agreement and adopted “Trade Barriers Regulation (TBR)” system.120

                                                34
In both the United States and the European Communities, many WTO complaints have been
indeed initiated by petitions under those systems.
         Despite rather long history and experience under multilateral trade system, Japan and
Korea have not yet prepared such mechanisms in domestic legal or institutional systems. Most
other East Asian countries do not have such systems, either. Interestingly, China prepared a
TBR-like system that would allow private parties to raise complaints against foreign trade
barriers under systemic procedures and in turn lead to formal WTO complaints by the Chinese
government. The “Provisional Regulations for Investigation on Foreign Trade Barriers” enacted
from November 1, 2002 stipulates that natural or legal persons representing domestic industries
as well as domestic industries or companies can apply for investigations. The investigation
procedure under this regulation may not exceed 6 months and may be extended to 9 months in
exceptional circumstances. Article 29 provides that the Ministry of Commerce (previously,
MOFTEC) may take one of the following, if foreign trade barriers are found to be in violation
of international agreements: 1) bilateral consultation, 2) multilateral dispute settlement, or 3)
other necessary measures. Although the current provisions do not exclude unilateral retaliation
by taking “other necessary measures”, the overall structure of the system is much more focused
in connecting the WTO dispute settlement system and aggrieved domestic private parties. This
development should give important lessons for other WTO Members in general and East Asian
Members in particular.



VI.      Conclusion


         The WTO dispute settlement system has become the core of the world trading system.
Various trade disputes arising from divergent interpretation of the WTO agreements and de facto
discriminatory impact of the domestic trade policy measures have been rectified by the legal
rulings of the WTO panels and Appellate Body. Yet, there is huge discrepancy among the WTO
Members, especially in East Asia, in the degree of utilizing the WTO dispute settlement system.
Moreover, East Asian Members have shown strong tendency in settling the disputes rather than
litigating the cases. This fact should not be construed to indicate that the WTO dispute
settlement system has been malfunctioning to represent the legitimate WTO rights and interests
in East Asia. To the contrary, it is shown that major economic sectors – industrial or agricultural
– in East Asian Members have been able to use the WTO dispute settlement system for securing
level playing field. The next question for these Members may be how to establish the domestic
system to properly represent their private economic interests in a more balanced manner and
how to make the WTO dispute settlement system a benign instrument for the entire economy,
