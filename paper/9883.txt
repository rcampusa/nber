                                           ABSTRACT


This paper develops a spacial model of ATM networks to explore the implications for banks and
non-banks of interchange fees, foreign fees and surcharges applied to transactions by customers at

other than an own-bank ATM. Surcharging raises the price (foreign fee plus surcharge) paid by
customers above the joint profit-maximizing level achieved by setting the interchange fee at
marginal cost and not surcharging. Similar size banks would agree not to surcharge, but such an

agreement is typically not possible between a bank and a non-bank. A high cost of teller transactions
modifies the tendency towards high ATM fees.

                  Fees and surcharging in automatic teller machine networks:
                         Non-bank ATM providers versus large banks


1. Introduction

       The wide-spread introduction of surcharges on ATM (Automatic Teller Machine)

transactions in North America has become a high profile issue, creating concern among consumer

advocates and public policy makers about disclosure and fairness in ATM fees. Surcharges

proliferated after April 1996 when, in response to pressure from State governments and the courts,

both of the U.S. national ATM networks, Cirrus and Plus, lifted the prohibition they had maintained

on surcharging up to that point.1 At the same time the networks agreed to allow the entry of non-

banks. Non-banks provide only ATM services, whereas banks typically both own ATMs and issue

cards so that customers can access ATMs. As we will show, network membership by non-banks has

significant implications in raising the fees that customers have to pay for ATM transactions.

       ATM networks were initially developed as a means by which banks could save costs by

shifting customers from costly “teller” transactions using personnel at a branch to the use of

machines. In the early 1980s in North America, these initially proprietary systems evolved into

shared networks, which enhanced consumer convenience in accessing their account, without having

to go to their branch. A main fee set by the (shared) network is an “interchange fee” that banks must

pay to other member firms for each transaction made by one of their customers at another member’s




  1
   Surcharging was first allowed in1989 by Pulse Electronic Funds Transfer Association as a result of a
binding arbitration ruling. Plus and Cirrus subsequently faced the threat of a legal challenge to their
surcharging ban by ATM owners on anti-trust grounds. The networks were also under pressure from new
laws and regulations in 15 states that permitted surcharging. See Ruud and Webre (1998).
                                                                                                         2

ATM.2 In order to recover at least part of the cost, banks typically charge their own customers a

“foreign fee” for these transactions. In addition to the foreign fee, customers making ATM

transactions at other than their own bank may pay a “surcharge” directly to the owner of the ATM.

This fee structure has the interesting and unusual feature that all three fees apply to the same

transaction. Even apart from effects on consumer welfare, this raises the question as to the differing

incentives of network members that drive these three fees.

          This paper considers the profit implications of all three fees (interchange fees, foreign fees

and surcharges) in the context of a spatial model of ATM networks in which consumers move

around the “city” as represented by a circular network of ATMs. Consumers face a tradeoff between

the inconvenience of travelling to the closest ATM of their own bank and the total price, the sum of

the foreign fee and surcharge, that they must pay for a transaction at other ATMs. Consumers may

also choose to travel to the branch of their bank so as to use a teller. Banks charge an up-front fee

for a banking package that allows customers to make transactions at an own-bank ATM or an in-

branch teller at no additional cost.3 A feature of the analysis is our consideration of the effects of the

higher marginal cost of teller transactions.4

          Firms providing ATM services differ based on their number of customers with banking

relationships. At the extremes, the network members could be two banks with equal numbers of

customers or a large bank with all the customers together with a non-bank ATM provider. The paper

  According to McAndrews (1998), the interchange fee ranges from $0.30 to $0.60 per transaction in the
U.S.. We abstract from other fees, such as a “switch fee”, ranging from $0.02 to $0.15, which is paid by
network members to cover the cost of routing transactions through the network.
 3
  Hannan (2001) states that 72.3% of U.S. banks surveyed in 1999 charged foreign fees for withdrawals at
a non-own ATM, while only 6.4% charged their own customers fees for withdrawals from own ATMs. An
exception is the 1995, $3 charge set by First Chicago for some teller transactions (see Duclaux, 1995).
 4
     Transaction costs vary between $0.15 to $0.50 for an ATM and $1 to $2 for a teller (Fasig, 2001).
                                                                                                      3

contrasts these two polar cases so as to explain the conflict of interest in fee setting between a large

bank and a non-bank. Conflicts arise because asymmetry in the number of customers causes

asymmetry in the extent to which the ATMs of each member firm are shared. If two banks have

equal numbers of customers, then each bank has access to the revenues generated by the same

number of the other bank’s customers, whereas if one of the members is a non-bank, the non-bank

gains access to the bank’s customers, but there are no “other customers” from whom the bank can

collect fees. Such conflicts have relevance for whether large banks would want non-banks as network

members. For example, prior to the 1996 ruling by the Canadian Competition Tribunal, the Interac

network, which was controlled by large Canadian banks, specifically prohibited membership by non-

banks.5

          Foreign fees and surcharges are determined at a non-cooperative Nash equilibrium, whereas

the joint decision as to the level of the interchange fee is made a prior stage based on Nash

bargaining. The state of the law as to whether or not networks can ban surcharging affects the outside

option under Nash bargaining. We examine the implications of a move from a ban on surcharging

to the surcharging equilibrium and also the question as to the conditions under which members of

the network would make a voluntary agreement not to surcharge.

          In order to focus on the differing incentives of banks and non-banks towards the interchange

fee and surcharging as a network-wide decision, we simplify the analysis by assuming that firms

each deploy the same number of ATMs, which are positioned symmetrically around the circle and

interleaved so as to maximize customer convenience. Based on related but different models,

Massoud and Bernhardt (2002) and McAndrews (2001) both show that banks with a greater number

                                                                                                         4

of ATMs tend to set higher surcharges.6 We expect that if our model were extended to incorporate

differences in the number of ATMs across banks, similar results would apply. However, since non-

banks do not provide any customers from whom the banks can collect surcharges (or interchange

fees), customer base would continue to be the main driving force behind the differing preferences

of banks and non-banks towards interchange fees and surcharging at the network-wide level.

          We first develop the implications of joint profit maximization for the shared ATM networks.

Comparing with the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium in fee setting then yields a striking result. If

surcharging is banned and if the interchange fee equals the marginal cost of an ATM transaction,

then the foreign fees set non-cooperatively by network members serve to maximize joint network

profits. By contrast, surcharging raises the total price (foreign fee plus surcharge) paid by consumers

above the joint profit- maximizing level. Interestingly, high consumer prices for ATM services are

ameliorated by the higher marginal cost of teller transactions. Banks lower their foreign fee so as to

shift customers away from the branch, with the result that total price is reduced at both the

surcharging or no-surcharging equilibriums.

          Whether the member firms are both banks or a bank and a non-bank, we show that for a

given interchange fee, equilibrium levels of foreign fees and surcharges are unaffected. Thus the

conflict between banks and non-banks affects outcomes primarily through network-wide decisions

as to the interchange fee and surcharging. Not surprisingly, banks raise the foreign fee in response

to an increase in the interchange fee so as to offset some of the cost of the interchange fee payment.

However, if there is surcharging, then the foreign fee rises and the surcharge falls by an amount equal

to the increase in the interchange fee, with no net effect on the total price paid by consumers.



 6
     Empirically, banks with larger shares of ATMs are more likely to surcharge (see Hannan et al. ,2003).
                                                                                                       5

Supposing surcharging is not allowed, an initially surprising result in the light of common

complaints that large banks charge higher fees, is that competition between a bank and a non-bank

or a larger bank and a smaller bank as measured by numbers of customers would lead the larger bank

to prefer a lower interchange fee. This follows because a bank with more customers makes a net

payment of interchange fees to a smaller bank or a non-bank. Correspondingly, the introduction of

surcharging leads to a greater gain in revenue for a smaller bank or a non bank, making the larger

bank more eager to prevent surcharging. It is noteworthy that whenever a ban on surcharging would

reduce the total price of ATM services, then such a ban would also benefit the larger bank.

              This suggests that if the law supports a ban on surcharging, then large banks will want to

enforce this requirement. However, if network members have the option to surcharge, as is now the

case in most developed countries, an agreement between network members is required to prevent

surcharges. To achieve such an agreement, we find that banks must be sufficiently similar in size.

An example is the recent agreement by a group of large banks to exempt their customers from

surcharges while travelling abroad.7 However, if a small and large bank agree not to surcharge, this

is likely to involve a higher interchange fee and hence a higher foreign fee charged customers than

would occur if no-surcharging could simply be imposed. Under most conditions, a non-bank would

choose not to be a party to such an agreement. These results suggest that the option to surcharge and

the entry of non-banks would lead to widespread surcharging. Recent experience in both the U.S.

and Canada supports this prediction8.



     7
         These were Bank of America, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Scotiabank and Westpac (see Demers, 2001).
 8
 Since the 1996 Competition Tribunal ruling, which required Interac to accept non-banks as members, over
33% of the ATMs in Canada are “white-label” operated by non-banks with high surcharges (see Roseman,
2002). A similar story applies to the U.S.(see U.S. General Accounting Office, 1998).
                                                                                                          6

        The telecommunications industry has been a catalyst for the analysis of networks, from Katz

and Shapiro (1985) to more recent work by Laffont, Rey and Tirole (1998). Economides and Salop

(1992) explore the implications for market prices of the separate or joint sale of complementary

components of a good in a variety of settings, including ATM networks.9 Matutes and Padilla (1994)

develop a spatial model to examine the incentives for banks to make ATM networks compatible

when deposit interest rates are used to compete for customers. There are three banks located around

a circle, each with one ATM. With the introduction of interchange fees and surcharges (called

withdrawal fees), they show that the equilibrium always involves compatible networks. The model

of McAndrews (2001) is most similar to ours in that general numbers of ATMs are symmetrically

positioned around the circle and three fees (foreign fees, surcharges and interchange fees) are

considered. However, the detailed structure of the model differs and the paper addresses different

issues, namely the effects of asymmetric numbers of ATMs and competition for customers. In a

model in which banks located around a circle invest in ATMs, Donze and Dubec (2003) show that

a high interchange fee set jointly by banks can act as a collusive device in raising the fixed fee that

customers pay for an account, but there are no foreign fees or surcharges.

        Of more direct relevance with respect to the questions we address is Massoud and Bernhardt

(2002) who develop a model in which two banks, located on a circle, provide both ATM and in-

branch banking services so as to compete for customers. Profit maximization leads banks to provide

ATM services at marginal cost for own customers, whereas other consumers pay a surcharge. One

of their main results is to show that laws requiring banks not to discriminate between own customers



 9
  Our case in which the network sets the interchange fee at marginal cost and bans surcharging, but members
set foreign fees non-cooperatively is related to ‘one-sided joint price setting’ as termed by Economides and
Salop (1992). However, in their setting, joint network profits are not necessarily maximized.
                                                                                                  7

and customers of the other bank with respect to ATM fees would paradoxically raise ATM prices

above the surcharging level. This contrasts with our result that a ban on surcharging would reduce

ATM prices. This seeming difference in results can be explained by the fact that Massoud and

Bernhardt do not consider foreign fees or interchange fees. Prices fall in our model, because

consumers move from paying the sum of the foreign fee and surcharge to simply paying the foreign

fee. Prices rise in Massoud and Bernhardt (2002) because in order to gain revenues from the other

bank’s customers and not discriminate, banks increase the fee charged own customers for use of an

own bank ATM to equal the fee charged the other bank’s customers.

       The issue of self-regulation by ATM networks is also relevant. Self-regulation would give

networks the power to restrict members’ pricing policies, including the ability to ban surcharging.

A main argument for self-regulation, presented by Gilbert (1991) and supported by our analysis, is

that delegation of pricing to network members could lead to fees that exceed joint profit-maximizing

levels. An opposing argument in Salop (1990) is that self-regulation results in too few ATMs.

Indeed, the recent entry of non-banks in both the U.S. and Canada is in part due to the ability to

surcharge and has significantly increased the number of ATMs. This argument would suggest that

any loss of consumer welfare from surcharging is a short run effect, which would potentially be

offset by entry in the long run.

       The spatial model of ATM networks is developed in Section 2. Section 3 examines the

implications of joint profit maximization and the equilibrium in foreign fees and surcharges is

developed in Section 4. Section 5 explores the implications of the higher cost for in-branch teller

transactions. Section 6 then examines the conflict between network members in setting the

interchange fee and also develops the conditions under which the members of the network would

mutually agree not to surcharge. Section 7 contains concluding remarks.
                                                                                                    8

2. The model

2.1 The order of moves

       Two firms i for i = A, B offer ATM services. Firm A is a bank and firm B may be a non-

bank. Banks also offer in-branch banking services through a teller. The ATM transactions are

assumed to be withdrawals. In addition to withdrawals, teller transactions allow customers to

undertake other banking business such as verifying accounts, exchanging foreign currency or buying

certificates of deposit. Consumers hold an account at only one bank i for which they pay a fee,

denoted Fi, where i = A, B if firm B is a bank. The banking package allows customers to make both

own-bank ATM and teller transactions at no cost. However, customers must pay the foreign fees and

surcharges applying to transactions at other than an own-bank ATM.

       Investment in ATMs is assumed to take place prior to the setting of fees within the network.

To the extent that the installation of additional ATMs would raise profitability, a full model would

include this response in the long run.10 However, since we assume general numbers of ATMs

(equally distributed across network members), our analysis already encompasses the effects of

different overall levels of investment. Also, taking into account the endogenous response of

consumers in switching from in-branch tellers to ATMs, we show that greater numbers of ATMs can

lead to higher prices for ATM services. Consequently, an expansion in numbers of ATMs may not

always solve the problem of excessively high prices.

       The model involves two stages of decision. In stage 1, the interchange fee is determined

through Nash bargaining by member firms. If there is an agreement not to surcharge, it is made at



 10
   The high fixed cost of ATM installation, security and maintenance limits the numbers of ATMs. Based
on estimation of a structural model, Gowrisankaran and Krainer (2003) argue that the introduction of
surcharging results in only a moderate increase in numbers of ATMs and welfare falls.
                                                                                                         9

this stage. Also, each bank sets Fi and consumers simultaneously choose their bank. In stage 2,

foreign fees and surcharges (if allowed) are set simultaneously, leading to a non-cooperative Nash

equilibrium.

        The choice of the interchange fee in stage 1 reflects the idea that network agreements are

harder to change than the transaction fees determined in stage 2. Also, in choosing their bank in stage

1, consumers see through to the fees set in stage 2, but banks do not set fees strategically so as to

attract customers.11 The choice of bank prior to the setting of transaction fees can be justified on the

argument that it is costly to change banks (due, for example, to the use of pre-authorized deposits

and withdrawals) and that banks change foreign fees and surcharges more often than customers

change banks. Also, for the purpose of exploring the role of non-bank ATM providers, strategic

competition between banks for customers adds complication and is not the central issue.

        For our polar cases of two identical banks or a bank and a non-bank, the distribution of

customers is fully determined. Letting Ni for i = A, B, represent the number of customers of bank

i, if the network consists of two banks that set the same fees, then consumers choose each bank with

equal probability, which implies NA = NB. If firm B is a non-bank, then NB = 0 and bank A has all

the customers. Almost all our results would apply if the analysis were restricted to just these two

cases. Nevertheless, it is useful to allow the share of customers to vary exogenously between these

two cases so as to consider the possibility that network members are a large and a small bank. There

are a number of plausible reasons why numbers of customers could differ across otherwise identical

banks. For example, one could imagine that the bank with the smaller customer base is a recent

entrant and since it is costly for consumers to change banks, differences in customer base persist over


 11
   Whether banks actually set prices strategically is not obvious. For example, Prager (2001) suggests that
surcharges set by banks with large ATM networks are not effective in attracting customers from small banks.
                                                                                                    10

a long period.

2.2 Spatial networks of ATMs

       Each firm i for i = A, B maintains an ATM network, consisting of a general number M of

ATMs evenly spaced around the unit circle. As illustrated in Figure 1, the ATMs of A and B are

interleaved so that there are no segments in which two machines of the same firm are next to each

other. Since there is a total of 2M machines, the distance between adjacent A and B machines is R

/ 1/(2M). If each firm i has only one ATM, then R = ½. Each bank i issues ATM cards that allow

customers to make transactions at an ATM or at bank i’s branch, which is located at the centre of

the circle, equidistant from each point on the circle. For ease of notation, we assume that each

customer makes just one transaction per period and hence the number of customers serves as a proxy

for the number of transactions. Customers move around the circular market, but in such as way that

they are evenly distributed with the same probability of being at any particular location. This has the

useful implication that, although customer utility from ATM transactions varies based on location,

on average around the circle, customers can be treated as identical.




                 Figure 1. Circular Market for ATM Services.
                                                                                                                 11

           Customers of bank i have the option of travelling to the closest of bank i’s ATMs, which

involves a disutility, denoted di, equal to the distance travelled. They also have the option of

travelling the distance, R - di, to a “foreign” ATM of the other firm, but this convenience involves

paying the price, pi, which consists of the sum of the foreign fee and any surcharge. Letting x denote

the utility of an ATM transaction, each customer of bank i gains utility, uH(di) = x - di, from use of

an own-bank ATM (supercript H for home) and utility, uF(R-di) / x - (R- di) - pi from the use of the

other ATM (superscript F for foreign).12 Referring to Figure 1, a customer of B can travel dB to B’s

ATM and gain uH(dB) = x - dB, or travel R - dB to A’s ATM and gain uF(R-dB) / x - (R- dB) - pB.

           Letting di = d i 0 [0, R], satisfy uH( d i ) = uF(R - d i ), it follows that customers are indifferent

between their own and the closest ATM of the other firm at a distance di = d i from their own bank’s

ATM, where,

                                         d i = (R + pi)/2 for pi 0 [- R, R].                                   (1)

Consequently, A’s customers will prefer A’s ATM for dA # d A and will prefer B's ATM for dA

> d A .13 We assume pi 0[- R, R]. Since d i = R at pi = R, the price, pi = R is prohibitive in the sense that

customers only use the ATMs of their own bank, making the shared networks no different than two

separate unlinked ATM networks. At the other extreme, a subsidy of pi = - R would imply no use of

own-bank ATMs. Since in practice, moral hazard problems would make transaction subsidies

undesirable, the possibility pi < 0 is best interpreted as a price that is below (rather than above) the

zero price charged at an own-bank ATM.

           For the proportion, d i /R, of bank i’s customers located within d i of i’s machine, the ATMs



 12
      Units are set so that a one unit increase in pi has the same effect on utility as a one unit increase in di.
 13
      If the utility from A’s or B’s ATM is equal, we assume a customer will choose an own-bank ATM.
                                                                                                                      12

of the other bank offer no extra convenience. On average, these customers have to travel di = d i /2

and hence their average utility if they use an ATM is given by uH( d i /2 ) = x - d i /2 . The remaining

proportion, (R - d i )/R, of bank i’s customers prefer the other firms’s ATM, which implies an average

utility, uF((R- d i )/2) = x - (R - d i )/2 - pi. Combining these two groups to take account of the

movement of customers around the circle, each customer of bank i gains an average utility from

ATM use, given by Ui / ( d i /R)(x - d i /2 ) + ((R- d i )/R)(x - (R- d i )/2 - pi). Letting ((pi) / (R - pi)2/2R and

using (1) defines Ui = U(pi), where

                                     U(pi) = x - R/2 + ((pi)/2.                                                      (2)

At pi = R, there is no sharing of ATMs and average customer utility from the ATM network is U(R)

= x - R/2. We assume that U(R) = x - R/2 > 0, which implies that U(pi) > 0.

         The alternative to a withdrawal from an ATM around the circle is for customers to use a teller

at their branch (located at the centre of the circle). By using their branch for a withdrawal, customers

gain the benefit x, but they also gain utility or value, denoted v, from the ability to do other banking

business. We suppose that if a customer makes fewer visits to the branch, then this other banking

business accumulates so as to raise v. Letting DO represent the probability of use of the branch, this

idea is captured by assuming that v is decreasing in DO. A convenient functional form is

                           v = (1-DO)/$DO for $ $ 0.                                                                 (3)

It follows from (3) that v > 0 for all DO < 1 and dv/dDO < 0. For any given value of DO, a higher value

of $ reduces the value of other banking business at the branch.

         Letting dO represent the distance to the branch, each customer gains uO from the use of a
                                                                                                           13

teller, where uO / x - dO + v. Setting uO = U(pi) so as to define v = v(pi), we obtain14

                v(pi) = dO - R/2 + ((pi)/2,                                                               (4)

where ((pi) / (R - pi)2/2R. From (3), the probabilities of use of a branch or an ATM are respectively

                DO = DO(pi) = 1/(1 + $v(pi)) and 1 - DO(pi) = $v(pi)DO(pi).                               (5)

Thus, from (5), the proportion of transactions at an own bank ATM (rather than the branch) when

pi = R makes access to the other bank’s ATMs prohibitively expensive is $v(R) = (1- DO(R))/DO(R). For

example, if $v(R)$ 1/2, then at least one third of these transactions are at an own-bank ATM.

        To ensure that DO(R) < 1 so that there is some use of own-bank ATMs at pi = R, we require that

$v(R) > 0 which implies v(R) = dO - R/2 > 0. Thus if each bank has only one ATM (i.e. if R = 1/2), then

dO > 1/4. To obtain dO > 1/4, we suppose that dO is equal to twice the radius of the unit circle (i.e.

dO = 1/B = 0.3182 for B = 3.146) due to the need to travel both to the branch and back to the city.15

We actually assume a slightly stronger condition, namely that

                         v(R) - R = dO - 3R/2 $ 0,                                                        (6)

which is used to achieve concavity of profit. Since dO > 1/4, we obtain v(R) $ R if R # 1/6 due to the

bank having at least three ATM’s (i.e. M $ 3). The condition would hold for all M $ 1 if dO $ 3/4.

        Taking into account the probability of going to the branch, customers of bank i will use bank

i’s ATMs with probability DH = ( d i /R)(1-DO) and the other firms’s ATMs with probability DF = [(R-

d i )/R](1- DO). From (1), DH and DF can be expressed for pi 0 [- R, R] as

                DH(pi) = (R + pi)(1 - DO)/2R, DF(pi) = (R - pi)(1 - DO)/2R.                               (7)


 14
   For simplicity, we assume that DO is constant around the circle and hence depends on the average utility,
U(pi), of customers using ATMs. Relaxing this assumption does not change the basic incentives that drive
pricing policies, but it significantly complicates the notation and analysis.
 15
    The value of dO could also be raised by assuming that a withdrawal at the branch (but not at an ATM)
involves a cost of waiting in line that is included in dO. The branch may also be located in a distant suburb.
                                                                                                             14

Since DF(R) = 0, DH(R) = 1- DO(R) and DO(R) > 0, it follows that at pi = R, customers use only their bank’s

ATMs and the branch. Correspondingly, since DF(-R) = 1- DO(R) and DH(-R) = 0, a subsidy of pi = - R

leads customers to only use the other firms’s ATMs and the branch.

        From (5), an increase in the fee, pi, raises the probability of use of the branch: i.e.

                         DON(pi) = $(DO)2(R - pi)/2R > 0.                                                   (8)

Also, a higher fee reduces the use of the other bank’s ATM: i.e from (7) for pi # R,

                 DFN(pi) = - [1 - DO + (R - pi)DON(pi)]/2R < 0.                                             (9)

Customer use of their own bank ATMs is increased: i.e. DHN(pi) > 0.16



3. Joint profit maximization

        This section considers the implications for price of joint profit maximization in stage 2 taking

the account fees set in stage 1 as given. Letting cO denote the marginal cost of a teller transaction and

c the marginal cost of an ATM transaction, the cost advantage from an ATM transaction is

represented by * / cO - c $ 0. Using DH = 1 - DF - DO, the average cost of ATM and branch

transactions per customer is then c(DH + DF) + cODO = *DO + c. Each customer of bank i generates an

average revenue of r(pi) / piDF(pi) in foreign fees and surcharges, which, with account fees included,

implies a network profit (across both ATM providers) of g(pi) = r(pi) - *DO(pi) - c + Fi. Taking Fi set

in stage 1 as fixed, the change in overall network profit per customer from an increase in pi in stage

2 is given by

                         gN(pi) = rN(pi) - *DON(pi),                                                       (10)

where rN(pi) = DF + piDFN(pi) represents the effect on network revenue. The term, *DON(pi), captures


  16
    From (7), DHN(pi) = [1- DO - (R + pi)DON(pi)]/2R. Using (8) and (5), we obtain DHN(pi) = $DO[v(pi) - (R/2)DO
+ ((pi)2/2R)DO]/2R > 0 from v(pi) $ v(R) $ R (see (6)) and DO(pi) < 1
                                                                                                                   15

the increase in cost due to the switching of customers from ATMs to the branch. The interchange

fee does not play a role since it is simply a transfer between firms in the network.

            Since DF(R) = 0 and g(R) = - *DO(R) - c + Fi, the additional profit generated by each customer

of bank i from the sharing of ATMs is

                             g(pi) - g(R) = r(pi) + *(DO(R) - DO(pi)).                                           (11)

Letting pi = R satisfy g(R) - g(R) = 0, it follows from (11) that R = 0 if * = 0. If * > 0, then we obtain

R < 0, which implies that the sharing of ATMs can be profitable even if consumers are subsidized

to use other than an own-bank ATM. However, since * + R > 0, the subsidy must be must be less than

the cost advantage *.17 Assuming that R $ - R to ensure that pi 0 [R, R] is within the range pi 0 [-R, R],

* satisfies18

                             - R # * # (v(R) + R)/DO(R),                                                         (12)

where * = - 2Rv(R)/(R-R)DO(R). As can be seen from (12), the upper bound on * is less restrictive when

the proportion, DO(R), of customers using the branch at pi = R is small. Since v(R) $ R from (6), we

obtain * # 2v(R)/DO(R), which ensures that gO(pi) < 0 for pi 0 [R, R/2] (see (A7) in the Appendix).

            Adding over customers, B / NAg(pA)+ NBg(pB) represents the joint profit (superscript  for

joint) from the ATM networks. Since g(pi) does not depend on NA or NB, setting pi 0 [R, R] to

maximize B, it follows that the joint profit-maximizing price, denoted p, is the same across network

members. Proposition 1sets out some properties of p. All proofs of propositions are provided in

Appendix A.

PROPOSITION 1: (i)Joint network profits are maximized by charging a price, p 0 (R, R/2), for use of



  17
       From (11), we obtain g(pi) - g(R) = (* + pi)DF(pi) - *(DH(R) - DH(pi)) $ 0 only if * + pi > 0.
 18
      Using DO(R) - DO(pi) = $(v(pi) - v(R))DO(pi)DO(R) and v(pi) - v(R) = (/2 from (4) and (5) in (11), (12) follows.
                                                                                                                16

other than an own-bank ATM, where p $ 0 if and only if * # v(0)/DO(0). If * = 0, then p > R/3. (ii)

dp/d* < 0 and dp/d$ > 0. Also, dp/dR < 0 for p# 0.

          From Proposition 1(i), joint profit maximization involves p < R/2. The gain in profit from

a higher price is limited by the ability of customers to shift to the branch or an own-bank ATM. The

sign of p depends on the magnitude of *. More specifically, p $ 0 if and only if * # v(0)/DO. If there

were no cost advantage from ATM use (* = 0), then p > R/3. As set out in Proposition 1(ii), a higher

value of * reduces p . Conversely, a higher value of $ increases the use of ATMs, which raises p.

For example, if $v(R) = 1/2, which implies that at pi = R, one-third of transactions are carried out at

own-bank ATMs, then p $ 0 if and only if * # (v(R) + R/4)(3/2 + R/4).19 If we also take into account

consumer welfare, then since dUiL/dpi + gN(pi) = - (R - pi)DO(1 + $*DO)2R < 0, maximization of welfare

requires pi = R, which implies pi = 0 at * = 0 and pi < 0 if * > 0. Since M is taken as given, these

welfare results abstract from the costs of investing in ATMs.

          Proposition 1(ii) also shows that dp/dR < 0 for p # 0. This contrasts with the intuition that

an increase in the number, 2M, of ATMs, corresponding to a reduction in the distance, R = 1/2M,

between ATMs, should reduce the price of ATM services, which would imply that dp/dR > 0. For

pi > 0, a shorter distance increases pi/R, making price more important relative to the distance needed

to travel to an own-bank ATM. Thus the proportion, DF, of customers using other than their own

bank’s ATMs would be expected to fall, leading to a fall in price. This tendency is part of the story.

However, the greater convenience of ATMs as their numbers increase also causes customers to

switch away from in-branch tellers, which tends to increase DF and, at the same time make DF less




 19
      Since v(0) = v(R) + R/4 (from (4)), we obtain p $ 0 iff * # v(0)/DO(0) = (v(R) + R/4)(1+ $v(R) + R/4).
                                                                                                             17

responsive to an increase in price.20 These latter effects tend to dominate for pi/R small with the result

that greater numbers of ATMs have an ambiguous effect on price when pJ > 0, but pJ actually

increases if pJ # 0. Since the same opposing effects apply when foreign fees and surcharges are set

non-cooperatively, this suggests that an expansion in numbers of ATMs may not always solve the

problem of excessively high consumer prices for ATM services.



4. Foreign fees and surcharges

        We consider three types of fees applying to the use of other than an own-bank ATM, namely

foreign fees, surcharges and the interchange fee. This section focusses on the stage 2 non-cooperative

Nash equilibrium in foreign fees and surcharges (if allowed). The interchange fee is set in stage 1.

        The fees that an ATM provider can charge depend on whether it and the other ATM provider

are banks or non-banks. Since firm A is a bank, it can charge its own customers a foreign fee,

denoted fA, for each transaction made at B’s ATMs. If firm B is a bank and surcharging is allowed,

then bank A will also impose a surcharge, denoted FA, for each transaction by B’s customers at A’s

ATMs. Conversely, bank B will charge its own customers a foreign fee, fB, for the use of A’s ATMs

and a surcharge, FB, for transactions by A’s customers at B’s ATMs. If firm B is a non-bank, then

since bank A has all the banking customers, bank A can set a foreign fee (but not a surcharge) and

firm B can impose a surcharge (but not a foreign fee) on transactions made by A’s customers at B’s

ATMs. In total, customers of bank A pay a price pA = fA + FB and customers of firm B (if B is a bank)

pay pB = fB + FA respectively for a transaction at other than an own-bank ATM. Also, for the same



  20
    From (5) and (7), MDO/MR = ($(DO)2/4)(1+(pi/R)2) > 0 and MDF(pi)/MR = [- (R - pi)(MDO/MR) + (pi/R)(1-DO)]/2R
is ambiguous in sign. From (8), (9) and 1 - 2$(DO = 1 + $(v(R) - 3(/2), we obtain MDFN(pi)/MR = - DFN(pi)/R +
(1 + $(v(R) - 3(/2))(MDO/MR) > 0 for pi $ 0.
                                                                                                         18

transaction, the network requires that the customer’s bank pay an interchange fee, denoted J, to the

other ATM provider so as to compensate for the service.

          The net revenue gained by bank A from transactions by its own customers at B’s ATMs is

given by the difference between its foreign fee, fA, and J - c, which is the excess of the interchange

fee over and above the marginal cost of an ATM transaction. If NB > 0, transactions by B’s customers

at A’s ATMs, generate net revenue for bank A equal to J - c plus any surcharge, FA. Letting RA /

(FA + J - c)DF(pB) represent the average net revenue that bank A as an ATM owner earns from each

of B’s customers and using cDH + cODO = - cDF + *DO + c, bank A’s profits from the ATM network

including account fees, FA, are given by21

                  BA / NA[(fA - (J- c))DF(pA) - *DO(pA) - c + FA] + NBRA.                              (13)

The corresponding expression for firm B is obtained by replacing superscript A with superscript B

and recognizing that NB = 0, if B is a non-bank. Since g(pi) = r(pi) - *DO(pi) - c, it follows that for i

= A, B,

                          Bi = Ni(g(pi) - Rj) + NjRi.                                                  (14)

If firm i is a bank (i.e. if Ni > 0), the first term of (14) represents firm i’s profit due the contribution

of its own customers to overall network profit less the net revenue, Rj / (Fj + J - c)DF(pi), that these

customers generate for firm j from the use of firm j’s ATMs. If firm j is a bank (i.e. if Nj > 0), then

bank i also receives net revenue Rj from the use of its ATMs by j’s customers.

          Foreign fees and surcharges are determined at a non-cooperative Nash equilibrium where we

limit the magnitude of J - c by assuming that R # J - c # R and J $ 0. In setting its foreign fee, each

bank i chooses fi to maximize Bi as in (14), taking the price, pj = fj + Fi for j … i paid by customers



 21
      Fixed costs of ATMs, such as financing and security, are excluded to reduce notation.
                                                                                                      19

of the other bank as well as J and any surcharge, Fj, paid by own customers to the other bank as

given. Thus, letting fi = f(J, Fj) represent the foreign fee where Fj = 0 if there is no surcharging, it

follows that at an internal equilibrium, fi = f(J, Fj) satisfies the first order condition:

                              MBi/Mfi = Ni[gN(pi) - (Fj + J - c)DFN(pi)] = 0.                       (15)

From (15), the foreign fee, denoted f* / f(J,0) in the absence of surcharging, is independent of the

customer base and hence banks, whether large or small, charge the same fee for use of other than an

own-bank ATM.

        With respect to the choice of the surcharge, Fj for j … i, paid by bank i’s customers, firm j

(whether a bank or a non-bank) sets Fj to maximize own-profits taking the foreign fee, fi set by bank

i and the interchange fee as given. If firm j is a bank, the fees Fi and fj applying to its own banking

customers are also taken as given. From (14), the surcharge satisfies the first order condition:

                      MBj/MFj = Ni(MRj/MFj) = Ni[DF(pi) + (Fj + J - c)DFN(pi)] = 0.                 (16)

        Letting F / F(J,fF) denote the equilibrium surcharge and fF/ f(J,F) the foreign fee, customers

pay a total of pF / fF + F for use of other than an own-bank ATM. Foreign fees and surcharges are

the same across banks, but the implications for profit depend importantly on differences in customer

base. Letting R* / (J - c)DF(f*) and RF / (F + J - c)DF(pF) denote the respective values of the net

revenue, Ri, received by firm i as an ATM owner at the no-surcharging and surcharging equilibriums,

it follows from (14) that Bi = Nig(pi) - (Ni - Nj)Ri where Ri = R* at Fj = 0 and Ri = RF at Fj = F. If Ri

> 0 and NA - NB > 0, the greater number of bank A’s customers leads to more use of B’s ATMs than

vice versa and hence to a gain, (NA - NB)Ri, by firm B and a loss, - (NA - NB)Ri, by bank A.

        A useful expression is m(J, Fj) / f(J,Fj) - (J- c), which represents the additional profit to

bank i from an own-customer transaction at an ATM of the other firm rather than at an own-bank

ATM. If m = 0, then since fi - J = -c, the bank is indifferent as to whether its own customers use an
                                                                                                        20

own ATM at a cost c or an ATM of the other firm at net cost, fi - J, after receipt of the foreign fee

and payment of the interchange fee. If Fj = 0, then m* / m(J,0) = f* - (J-c). Using (10), (15) can be

rearranged into the form:

                             MBi/Mfi = Ni[DF(pi) + mDFN(pi) - *DON(pi)] = 0.                          (17)

As (17) shows, the foreign fee equates the increase in profit (i.e. M(mDF(pi))/Mfi ) that bank i gains due

to own-customer use of the other bank’s ATMs with the increase in cost from the shifting of

customers to the branch.

        Now considering the no-surcharging equilibrium, Proposition 2(i) concerns the properties

of f* and m* and Proposition 2(ii) develops the comparative static effects of changes in the

interchange fee.

PROPOSITION    2:(i) If J - c = R, then f* = R. If J - c < R, then f* 0 (R, (R+J-c)/2) and

                m* = f* - (J - c) = (R - (J-c))(v(f*) - *DO(f*))/H(f*),                               (18)

where H(f*) / 2v(f*) - (* - ()DO > 0. If J = c, then m* = f* = p. (ii) fJ (J,Fj) > 0. If J - c < R and *

# Q(pi)/DO where Q(pi)/ v(pi)+ ((1 + $v(pi)DO), then fJ < 1 and mJ (J,F j)= fJ - 1 < 0.

        As shown in Proposition 2(i), if J - c < R, then f* is at an internal equilibrium with f* < R and

the sharing of ATMs, but if J - c = R, then f* = R. The case J = c is particularly interesting. Despite

differences in numbers of customers, if the interchange fee just compensates the ATM owner for the

marginal cost of ATM use (i.e. if J = c), then the foreign fee, f*, obtained non-cooperatively at the

Nash equilibrium is equal to p and hence serves to implement the joint profit-maximizing outcome.

Since gN(p) = 0, it can be seen from (15) that f* < p for J - c < 0 and f* > p for J - c > 0. Also, from

(18), it follows that m* $ 0 and hence banks gain from their own customer use of the other firm’s

ATMs rather than own ATMs if and only if * # v(f*)/DO(f*). If f* = 0, this is the same as the
                                                                                                        21

condition for p $ 0 (see Proposition 1(i)).

        Proposition 2(ii) shows that fi(J,Fj) is increasing in J, making fiJ > 0 and hence f*J > 0 at Fj

= 0. Since banks pay the interchange fee when one of their customers uses another firm’s ATM, an

increase in J leads banks to increase the foreign fee charged own customers, so as to at least partially

offset the effect of this transfer on bank revenue. Since m* > 0 at * = 0, the possibility that the

foreign fee is too low to cover the net transfer, J - c, arises only if the additional cost, *, of a teller

transaction reduces f* sufficiently to make m* < 0. We are able to show that if * # Q(pi)/DO, which

is less restrictive than the condition * # v(pi)/DO required for m > 0, then fi(J,Fj) increases by less

than the increase in J, making f*J < 1 and m*J = f*J - 1 < 0. Since p = m* = f* = 0 for J - c = 0, these

conditions imply f* > 0 and m* < 0 for J- c > 0 and p = 0. Consequently, m* tends to be negative

if J - c > 0 and p and f* are small. If p > 0 then m* = p > 0 at J - c = 0 and remains positive for 0

< J - c < R, provided p is sufficiently large.

        Next, letting BiF = Bi and mF = m(J,F) = fF - (J - c) at Fj = F, Proposition 3 sets out properties

of the surcharging equilibrium.

PROPOSITION 3: (i) With surcharging, customers using other than an own-bank ATM pay the fees,

f F and F, resulting in a price, pF = f F + F 0 (0, 2R/3), which strictly exceeds p . If pF $ R/2, then mF

> 0, whereas mF < 0 if pF # R/3. If * = 0, then pF = 2mF > R/2. If * = 0 and J = c, then mF = f F = F.

(ii) B iF, RF and pF are independent of J: df F/dJ = 1, dF/dJ = -1 and dpF/dJ = dB iF/dJ = 0.

        As Proposition 3(i) shows, customers pay a surcharge, leading to an overall price that strictly

exceeds the joint profit-maximizing level. In raising its surcharge, each ATM provider ignores the

negative effect of a reduction in the sharing of ATMs on the profit of the card issuing bank leading

to a loss due to “double marginalization”. Since pF 0 (0, 2R/3), it follows that pF is positive even if
                                                                                                         22

* is sufficient large to make p < 0. If * = 0, then pF = 2mF > R/2, whereas p 0 (R/3, R/2). If J = c and

* = 0, then mF = fF = F and pF = 2fF. If pF $ R/2, then mF > 0, but we obtain mF < 0 if * is sufficiently

large to make pF # R/3.

        From Proposition 3(ii), an increase in the interchange fee that banks must pay when own

customers use another firms ATMs is fully offset by an equal increase in the foreign fee that

customers pay for the service and an equal decrease in the surcharge charged by the ATM owner

with the outcome that pF and profit, BiF, are unchanged. Fundamentally, since J is a pure transfer

within the network, it has no direct effect on customer demand for ATM services and the two

instruments, fF and F, fully offset the effect of this transfer on profits and the aggregate price, pF, paid

by customers.

        It is useful to recognize that F can be positive (a fee) or negative (a subsidy) depending on

the value of J. Letting J = JF satisfy (16) at F = 0, then

                        JF - c = - DF(pF)/DFN(pF) > 0.                                                 (19)

Since F is decreasing in J, it follows that F $ 0 if J # JF and F < 0 if J > JF. If F = 0, then f* = fF =

f(JF,0) = pF. Also, since f*J > 0 (from Proposition 2) and dpF/dJ = 0 (from Proposition 3), we obtain

                        f* # pF if and only if J# JF.                                                  (20)

At the surcharging equilibrium, mF = fF - (J - c) can be expressed as mF = pF - (F + J - c) and from

(16), we obtain rN(pF) = mFDFN(pF). Thus if mF > 0, a reduction in pi below pF would raise joint

network revenue (i.e. rN(pF) = DF(pF) + pFDFN(pF) < 0) and also reduce costs if * > 0. By contrast, since

rN(p) = *DON(p) $ 0 (see (10)), joint network revenue is maximized at p if * = 0, and is increasing

in p if * > 0.
                                                                                                        23

5. ATM fees and the cost of teller transactions

        This section further explores the effects of the additional cost * for in-branch teller

transactions, including the implications for the account fees, Fi, set in stage 1.

        The requirement that consumers must receive at least non-negative utility to set up a bank

account, implies Fi # U(pi), where from (2), UN(pi) = (N(pi)/2 < 0. Since consumers choose their

home bank simultaneously with the setting of Fi, each bank maximizes profit taking the number of

customers as given, with the outcome that Fi = U(pi) where pi = f* or pi = pF. Consequently, whether

bank A is a monopoly bank (NB = 0) or there are two banks, banks are able to extract all the

consumer surplus from the ATM network.

        We show in Proposition 4(i) below that in response to a higher value of *, banks reduce the

foreign fee charged own customers so as to put more emphasis on saving costs by shifting customers

away from the branch. Although ATM owners raise their surcharge in response to the decrease in

the foreign fee, the overall effect of an increase in * is to reduce the price, f* or pF, paid by customers

for use of other than an own-bank ATM. Consequently, holding Fi fixed, the higher cost of service

by in-branch tellers is good for consumers. However, if Fi is allowed to vary, consumers are

indifferent.

        Interestingly, the higher costs due to a higher value of * are not necessarily bad for profits.

Letting Bi* represent firm i’s profit from the ATM network at pi = f*, then Proposition 4(ii) shows

the expected result that for Fi fixed and J = c, an increase in * reduces Bi* for banks. However, if we

assume J - c > 0 making R* > 0, then the reduction in f* tends to reduce the distortion arising from

J > c and also redistributes profits towards smaller banks and non-banks by increasing the revenue

R* received by ATM owners from interchange fees. Consequently, if J > c, the profits of banks with

fewer customers are quite likely to rise and if firm B is a non-bank, its profits certainly rise. Similar
                                                                                                          24

results apply at the surcharging equilibrium, except that the fall in the foreign fee is partially offset

by a rise in F, which strengthens the gain of firm B at the expense of bank A. Moreover, taking into

account the increase in Fi due to the improvement in consumer utility as f* falls, we are not able to

rule out the possibility that banks are made better off even at J = c.

PROPOSITION 4: (i) df*/d* < 0; df F/d* < 0, dF/d* > 0 and dpF/d* < 0. (ii) If N i > 0 and F i fixed,

then dBi*/d* < 0 at J = c. If N B = 0, then dB B*/d* > 0 for J - c > 0 and dBBF/d* > 0.



6. The interchange fee and agreements not to surcharge

          The fact that joint network profit is reduced by J > c or by the introduction of surcharging

raises the question as to the incentives underlying the choice of J and the conditions under which the

ATM providers will agree not to surcharge. This section explores the implications of the differing

incentives facing large banks, small banks and stand alone ATM providers with respect to these stage

1 decisions.

          Since, Bi = Nig(R) at pi = R (see (14)), letting Ai(J, Fj) = Bi(J, Fj) - Nig(R) represent firm i’s

additional profit from the sharing of ATMs within the network, it follows that, with no-surcharging,

                          Ai* / Ai(J, 0) = Ni(g(f*) - g(R)) - (Ni - Nj)R*.                               (21)

For the sharing of ATMs, we require Ai* $ 0 for i = A,B. It can be shown that AA* > 0 for NA $ NB,

but if R* < 0 due to J < c and NA > NB, it is possible that AB* < 0.22 We define JB to satisfy AB(JB,

0) = 0. If firm B is a non-bank (NB = 0), then BB* = NAR* and JB = c.




 22
      We obtain AA* > 0 for J 0 (R, R) essentially because AA* = R* = 0 at f* = J = R and dAA*/dJ < 0.
                                                                                                          25

        From (21), and MBi/Mfi = 0 (see (15)), the effect of the interchange fee on profit at Fj = 0 is23

                         dBi*/dJ = dAi*/dJ = Ni(J - c)DFN(f*)fJ - (Ni - Nj)(dR*/dJ),                    (22)

where dR*/dJ = DF(f*) + (J - c)DFN(f*)fJ. If the banks are the same size (i.e. if NA = NB), then both

banks would prefer J = c, which implements the joint profit-maximizing price, f* = p. However,

since dR*/dJ > 0 at J = c, (22) shows that if NA = NB, bank A gains from a reduction in J below c

and firm B from an increase in J above c. Letting JA* and JB* represent the interchange fee preferred

by banks A and B respectively, this implies that JA* # c and JB* $ c. For a non-bank, JB* = JR*

where JR* maximize R*.




           Figure 2: Feasible interchange fees and relative firm size



        In Figure 2, the upper and lower limits on the value of J are shown by the dashed lines at J -



 23
   We assume d2BA*/(dJ)2 = (2NB - NA)DFN(f*)fJ + NB(J - c)(DFO(f*)(fJ*)2 + DFN(f*)fJJ) < 0 at NA = NB, which
holds if the first term dominates. It follows that d2BB*/(dJ)2 < 0 for NA $ NB and d2R*/(dJ)2 = Ni[2DFN(f*)fJ
+ (J - c)(DFO(f*)(fJ*)2 + DFN(f*)fJJ)] < 0.
                                                                                                              26

c = R and J - c = R respectively. The solid lines from points A to J and JR* to J respectively trace out

the value of these preferred fees as NB/NA is increased.24 As shown in the Figure, JA* is below c and

JB* is above c, but JA* rises and JB* falls as the size of the banks become more equal. If the two

banks have the same customer base, then JA* = JB* = c, as shown at point J. As illustrated by the

solid line from c to L, the minimum value of J that is compatible with firm B participating in the

network declines from JB = c at NB = 0 to R as the banks become similar in size.

        Suppose now that firms have the option of surcharging. From (14) and (21), we can express

the difference in profit for firm i from no-surcharging relative to surcharging as

                          Bi* - BiF = Ni(g(f*) - g(pF)) + (Ni - Nj)(RF - R*),                               (23)

where, from (11) and (20), g(f*) - g(pF) = r(f*) - r(pF) + *(DO(pF) - DO(f*)) > 0 if c # J # JF and g(f*) -

g(pF) < 0 for J $ JF. Evaluating (23) at J = JF, since f* = f(JF, 0) = pF and RF = R* at F = 0, it follows

that both A and B are indifferent between the no-surcharging and surcharging equilibriums.

Assuming * # Q(pF)/DO, which implies 1 - fJ(JF, 0) > 0, we can show that RF - R* > 0 if J < JF and

RF - R* < 0 if JF < J # JR*.25 It can then be seen from (23) that the larger bank will strictly prefer no-

surcharging for c # J < JF and surcharging for JF < J # JR*. By contrast, the smaller bank faces a

tradeoff between the higher joint profit (due to g(f*) - g(pF) > 0 for c # J < JF) under no-surcharging

and its gain from surcharging due to RF - R* > 0 for J < JF.

        Whether there is surcharging and the value of the interchange fee in the event of no-

surcharging depends importantly on the rights of the parties under the law. We consider two legal



 24
   If NB = 0 or small, then bank A may prefer J = - 4, but values of J - c < R are not relevant for the analysis.
If NB = 0, then since R* is maximized at some f* < R, we obtain JB* - c < R.
 25
    From DF(f*) + (JF - c)DFN(f*) = 0 (see (16)) and 1 - fJ(JF, 0) > 0, we obtain dR*/dJ = - (JF - c)DFN(f*)(1 -
f*J) > 0 at J = JF and hence JR* > JF. The result follows since RF - R* = 0 at J = JF and dRF/dJ = 0.
                                                                                                      27

frameworks. In the first, which was the historical reality in most states in the U.S. until 1996,

networks can prevent surcharging as a condition of membership. Within the context of our model,

enforcing such a requirement would be in the interests of the larger bank under the reasonable

assumption that it has sufficient bargaining power to make J < JF, which includes the possibility that

joint profits are maximized at J = c. In the second legal framework, representing the current situation

in the United States and Canada, member banks can mutually agree not to surcharge, but otherwise

surcharging cannot be prevented.

        Assuming that the interchange fee is determined by generalized Nash bargaining between

members of the network, suppose first that there is a law banning surcharging. Each firm then faces

the outside option of not sharing its ATMs within the network. Hence if bank A has bargaining

power " 0 (0,1) and firm B has bargaining power 1-", J is determined by maximizing (AA*)"(AB*)1-
"
. Now suppose that surcharging cannot be banned as a condition of membership. Since firms have

the outside option of surcharging, the value of J supposing that network members agree not to

surcharge is then determined by maximizing (BA* - BAF)"(BB* - BBF)1-". For the purposes of

Proposition 5 describing the results, we define J = JBb (b for borderline) to satisfy BB* - BBF = 0

where JB < JBb < JB* and JB* < JF. As Figure 2 illustrates, JBb (shown as the dotted line HL) is below

JB* (shown as the solid line HJ), which in turn is below the horizontal line representing JF.

PROPOSITION 5. (i) Whether or not surcharging is an option, if N A = N B, both banks agree not to

surcharge and set J = c. (ii) If surcharging is banned, then J 0 (max[J B, J A*], J B*). If N B = 0, then

J 0 (c,J B*). (iii) If surcharging is allowed and N B/N A > 1 - fJ (JF,0), then Nash bargaining would

give rise to a no-surcharging agreement in which J 0 (JBb,JB*) and J > J A*. If N B = 0 and 1 -

fJ(JF,0) > 0, then no agreement is possible and surcharging is the outcome.
                                                                                                     28

       It is easily understandable that identical banks would set J = c and agree not to surcharge (as

shown in Proposition 5(i)) since (from Proposition 2) such actions maximize joint profits. However,

this outcome is not guaranteed if banks differ in the size of their customer base or if a network

member is a non-bank. Recalling that for the larger bank, JA* < c and for the smaller bank, JB* >

c, we show in Proposition 5(ii) that when surcharging is banned, the interchange fee can take values

between J = JA* and J = JB*, provided the constraint that J > JB is met. In Figure 2 (assuming J $

0), the region of agreement is illustrated by the area BJDGc. Since for J < JA*, both banks are better

off at J = JA* and since for J > JB*, both banks are better off at J = JB*, Nash bargaining with " 0

(0, 1) implies J 0 (JA*, JB*). If firm B is a non-bank, the constraint J > JB ensures J - c > 0.

However, it remains true that if the banks are not too different in size or if the larger bank has more

bargaining power, then, in cases where J - c > 0, one would expect that the amount by which J

exceeds c is small. In such a situation, foreign fees would be low, favouring bank customers. Since

it is the large banks that have pioneered the development of ATM networks, this case has particular

relevance for the United States up until the early 1990's when no-surcharging rules had not been

legally challenged.

       Now suppose that ATM networks do not prevent surcharging as a condition of membership,

but member firms can form voluntary agreements not to surcharge. Exploring the conditions required

for an agreement, Proposition 5(iii) shows that NB/NA > 1- fJ(JF,0) (corresponding in Figure 2 to

values of NB/NA to the right of point E), provides the dividing line at which the banks are sufficiently

similar in size for an agreement to be possible. If NB/NA is to the left of point E (which includes non-

banks), then dBB*/dJ > 0 at J = JF (satisfying BB* - BBF = 0 and F = 0), which implies that firm B

prefers surcharging for J < JF and no surcharging for JF < J # JB*. Fundamentally, the higher

revenue from surcharging (RF - R* > 0) for J < JF dominates the advantage from higher joint profit
                                                                                                     29

for NB sufficiently small. Since bank A prefers no surcharging only if J < JF, no agreement is

possible.

        If NB/NA > 1- fJ(JF,0), then dBB*/dJ < 0 at J = JF which implies that B’s preferred interchange

fee, JB*, is below JF and BB* - BBF > 0 at J = JB*. Since BB* - BBF < 0 at J = JB, it follows that B is

indifferent between surcharging and not surcharging (i.e. Bi* - BiF = 0) at some J = JBb where JB <

JBb < JB*. Consequently, any no-surcharging agreement must involve J > JBb as well as the

requirement (from both A and B) that J < JF. The additional requirement from Nash bargaining that

J 0 (JA*, JB*) further refines the region of potential agreement to the (hatched) area HJS of Figure

2 in which J 0 (JBb,JB*) and J $ J A* as described in Proposition 5(iii). As can be seen from Figure

2, HJS is an area of relatively high fees within the larger region, BJDGc of feasible fees when bank

B does not have the option of surcharging.

        As a final case, it is interesting to consider the possibility that a network is restricted to

setting J - c = 0, leading to joint profit maximization (i.e. f* = p) under no-surcharging. An

agreement to give up surcharging is then even more difficult to achieve since a smaller bank is better

off by not surcharging at J = c only if JBb < c. As illustrated in Figure 2, we have JBb < c if NB/NA is

at or to the right of point F.



7. Concluding Remarks

        This paper focuses on three fees (interchange fee, foreign fee, and surcharge) that apply to

the use of ATMs within a spatial model of linked networks. Foreign fees and surcharges are set by

banks at a Nash non-cooperative equilibrium, whereas the interchange fee is determined at an earlier

stage, based on Nash bargaining. Banks also set a fee for an account at this earlier stage. An initial

but important result is to show that if surcharging is ruled out, then an interchange fee equal to the
                                                                                                   30

marginal cost of an ATM transaction will lead each bank individually to charge a foreign fee that

maximizes the joint profits of the shared networks. By contrast, surcharging always raises the total

price (the sum of the foreign fee and surcharge) of ATM services above the joint profit-maximizing

level. Whether or not there is surcharging, a higher marginal cost for an in-branch teller is shown to

reduce the total price charged consumers for transactions at other than own-bank ATMs.

       Large banks and non-banks (or small banks) face very different incentives towards both the

level of the interchange fee and the decision as to whether surcharging should be allowed in the

network. Since a bank with more customers makes net payments of interchange fees, it would prefer

a lower interchange fee than a small bank or a non-bank and also no surcharging. In competing with

non-banks, banks gain no customers from whom to collect surcharges or interchange fees.

       By changing the outside option available to the parties under Nash bargaining, the legal

framework with respect to surcharging can have a substantial impact on the level of fees. If no-

surcharging is established as a condition of network membership, then both firms face an outside

option of forgoing the gains from sharing their ATMs. However, if such a restriction is prohibited,

each firm can achieve at least their profit at the surcharging equilibrium. Since the option of

surcharging is more valuable to the smaller than the larger bank, consumers tend to lose from such

a shift in the law, both due to the increased prevalence of surcharging and the tendency for foreign

fees to rise if an agreement is reached not to surcharge. Generally, when surcharging is an option,

a greater similarity in size of customer base makes it more likely that the member banks will agree

not to surcharge and also keep fees low to the benefit of customers.

       Relating these results to the Canadian experience prior to the 1996 ruling by the Canadian

Competition Tribunal, the fact that full membership and voting rights were restricted within Interac

to the large Canadian banks supports the idea that establishing and maintaining a shared network is
                                                                                                     31

easier if the customer bases of the network members are comparable in size. Also Interac’s

prohibition of surcharging together with its refusal to accept non-bank members (prior to 1996) fits

with the idea that large banks did not want ATM fees to rise. As shown here, surcharging would raise

prices above the joint profit-maximizing level. Also, banks had a motive to keep prices low so as to

save costs by reducing the use of in-branch tellers. The Competition Tribunal found that Interac’s

interchange fees were established collusively. For most goods and services collusive behaviour

would be expected to result in excessive prices, with incentives or coercion used to prevent

participants from undercutting. The Interac actions seem directly opposite to this expectation.

Consistent with our findings, the large charter members maintained downward pressure on fees

because of the network benefits they enjoyed. In particular, the $.75 interchange fee remained

unchanged for over 10 years, despite rising charges in other areas.




                                            APPENDIX A



PROPOSITION 1: (i)Joint network profits are maximized by charging a price, p 0 (R, R/2), for use of

other than an own-bank ATM, where p $ 0 if and only if * # v(0)/DO(0). If * = 0, then p > R/3. (ii)

dp/d* < 0 and dp/d$ > 0. Also, dp/dR < 0 for p# 0.

Proof: (i) From (9), (8), ((pi) / (R - pi)2/2R and (5), we obtain

                DFN(pi) = - (1 - DO + $((DO)2)/2R = - $DO(v(pi) + (DO)/2R.                         (A1)

Letting > / R - 2pi and T / * + pi(R-pi)/2R, it follows from (10) using (7), (8) and (A1) that

                gN(pi) = $DO[>v(pi) - T(R - pi)DO]/2R.                                           (A2)
                                                                                                          32

From (A2), we have gN(R) $ $DO(R - R)(v(R) - *DO(R))/2R. Using * = - 2Rv(R)/(R-R)DO(R), we obtain v(R) -

*DO(R) = v(R)DO (R)[(R+R )(1+$v(R) + (R-R)(1 + $((R)/2]/(R-R) > 0, which implies p > R. We have pi(R-

pi)/2R $ R(R- R)/2R $ R . If * = 0, then R = 0 and T / * + pi(R-pi)/2R > 0 for pi > R. If * > 0, then (from

(12)), T > * + R > 0 for pi 0 [R , R]. It then follows from (A2), T > 0 and > = 0 at pi = R/2 that gN(R/2)

< 0 and hence p < R/2 and > > 0 at pi = p. Since that gO(pi) < 0 for pi 0 [R, R/2] (see (A7)), there is

a unique p 0 (R, R/2) satisfying gN(p) = 0. Since, from (A2), gN(0) = $DO[v(0) - *DO]/2, we obtain p

$ 0 if and only if * # v(0)/DO. Setting * = 0 in (A2), we obtain gN(p) = $DO [(R -3p)v(p) + p(v(p) -

(DO)] = 0, which implies p > R/3 if v(pi) - (DO > 0. From v(pi) = v(R) + (/2 (see (4)), we can show

                v(pi)(1+$v(pi)) = v(R)(1+$v(R)) + ((/2)(1 + 2$v(R)) + $(()2/4.                         (A3)

From (A3), v(R) - R > 0 (see (6)) and ((pi) # 2R for pi $ - R, it then follows that

        v(pi) - (DO = [(v(R) - R)(1+$v(R)) + R - (/2 + $v(R)(R+() + $(()2/4]DO > 0.                    (A4)

(ii) We first show gO(pi) < 0 for pi 0 [R, R/2]. From (8), (A1) and (/ (R-pi)2/2R, we obtain

        DOO(pi) = -$(DO)2(1 - 2$(DO)/2R, DFO(pi) = $(DO)2(R-pi)(3 - 2$(DO)/4(R)2.                      (A5)

Using * # 2v(R)/DO(R) (see (12) and (6)), v(pi) = v(R) + (/2 (see (4)) and DO(R) - DO(pi) =

($(/2)DO(pi)DO(R), a useful inequality is

                         2v(pi) - ( - *DO(pi) - ($(/2)DO(pi)DO(R) > 0.                                 (A6)

Since gO(pi) = 2DFN(pi) + piDFO(pi) - *DOO(pi) from (10), using (A1) and (A5), we obtain gO(pi) = -

$DO[2v(pi) + DO(2( - 3pi(R-pi))/2R - * + 2$(DOT]/2R. Letting P / 3(R-pi)>/2R + 2$(TDO, since P

> 0 for pi 0 [R, R/2), it follows using (A6), that

                gO(pi) = - $DO [2v(pi) + DO(P - ( - *)]/2R < 0                                        (A7)

for pi 0 [R, R/2). Now considering the comparative statics, since M2g/(Mpi)(M*) = - $(DO)2(R-pi)/2R < 0

and M2g/(Mpi)(M$) = $(DO)2>(v(pi))2 > 0 evaluated at gN(pi) = 0, it follows that dp/d* < 0 and dp/d$

> 0. From (A2) and gN(p) = 0, we obtain v(p) = T(R - p)DO/(R - 2p) and v(p) - TDO = TDOp/(R -
                                                                                                       33

2p). It then follows from (A2) using MT/MR = (pi/R)2/2 that MgN(p)/MR = $DO[TDOp/(R - 2p) - (R -

p)DO(pi/R)2/2 + (R - 2p)(Mv/MR) - T(R - p)(MDO/MR))]/2R. Since Mv/MR = -(1 + (pi/R)2)/4 < 0 and MDO/MR

= - $(DO)2(Mv/MR) > 0, we obtain MgN(p)/MR < 0 for p # 0.                                            G

PROPOSITION    2:(i) If J - c = R, then f* = R. If J - c < R, then f* 0 (R, (R+J-c)/2) and

                m* = f* - (J - c) = (R - (J-c))(v(f*) - *DO(f*))/H(f*),                              (18)

where H(f*) / 2v(f*) - (* - ()DO > 0. If J = c, then m* = f* = p. (ii) fJ (J,Fj) > 0. If J - c < R and *

# Q(pi)/DO where Q(pi)/ v(pi)+ ((1 + $v(pi)DO), then fJ < 1 and mJ (J,F j)= fJ - 1 < 0.

Proof: (i) Specifying the notation so as to also allow for surcharges, we let T / T - (Fj +J-c)(R-

pi)/2R, which implies T / * +(R-pi)m/2R, where m / fi - (J-c). We also let > / > + Fj + J - c, which

implies > / R - pi - m. From MBi/Mfi = Ni[gN(pi) - (Fj + J - c)DFN(pi)], (A1) and (A2), it follows that at

an internal equilibrium, fi = f(J,Fj) satisfies the first order condition

                        MBi/Mfi = Ni$DO[>v(pi) - T(R - pi)DO]/2R = 0.                               (A8)

We show below (see (A10)) that M2Bi/(Mfi)2 < 0 at MBi/Mfi = 0. Setting f* = fi(J,0) = R in (A8), we

obtain MBi/Mfi = Ni$DO(R - (J-c))v(R)/2R, which implies f* = R at J- c = R and that m* = f* - (J-c) = 0

at J - c = R. Rearranging (A8), we can show

                MBi/Mfi = Ni$DO[(R - pi)(v(pi) - *DO) - m(v(pi) + (DO)]/2R = 0.                     (A9)

If Fj / 0, then pi = f* and (18) follows from (A9). We have H(pi) > 0 from * # 2v(R)/DO(R). Since v(R)

- *DO(R) > 0 (see proof Proposition 1(i)), evaluating MBi/Mfi at fi = R , J - c = R and Fj = 0, we obtain

MBi/Mfi > 0 and hence f* > R. It also follows from T / * + m(R-pi)/2R and (A9) that T = v(pi)(( +

*)/(v(pi) + (DO) > 0. Hence, if J - c < R, we obtain > > 0 from (A8), which implies f* < (R + J - c)/2.

Since gN(p) = 0, it follows that f* = p at J = c from (15).

        Since M2Bi/(Mfi)2 = Ni[gO(pi) - (Fj +J - c)DFO(pi)]/2R from (15), using (A5) and (A7), we obtain
                                                                                                          34

                M2Bi/(Mfi)2 = -Ni$DO [2v(pi) + DO(P - ( - *)]/2R,                                     (A10)

where P / 3(R-pi)>/2R + 2$(TDO. From (A6), it follows that M2Bi/(Mfi)2 < 0 if P $ 0. Since P = 0 at pi

= R, we obtain M2Bi/(Mfi)2 < 0 at J - c = R and f* = R. If pi < R, then MBi/Mfi = 0 implies T > 0, > > 0 and

hence P > 0. Thus M2Bi/(Mfi)2 < 0 if MBi/Mfi = 0 or if pi = R.

(ii) Since M2Bi/(Mfi)(MJ) = - NiDFN(pi) > 0 (see (17)), we obtain fiJ(J,Fj) = NiDFN(pi)/(M2Bi/(Mfi)2) > 0 and

                mJ = 1 - fiJ = [M2Bi/(Mfi)2 - NiDFN(pi)]/(M2Bi/(Mfi)2).                               (A11)

Since M2Bi/(Mfi)2 - NiDFN(pi) = -Ni$DO [v(pi) + DO(P - 2( - *)]/2R from (A1) and (A10), it follows that

mJ = 1 - fiJ(J,Fj) > 0 iff T / v(pi) - *DO + DO(P - 2() > 0, where from P / 3(R-pi)>/2R + 2$(TDO and

(A8), we obtain P = (>(3 + 2$v(pi))/(R-pi). Using > = R - pi - m and substituting for m from (A9), we

obtain P - 2( = (>(1+2$v(pi))/(R-pi) - 2((v(pi) - *DO)/(v(pi) +(DO), which implies

        T = (v(pi) - *DO)(v(pi) - (DO)/(v(pi) + (DO) + (DO>(1+2$v(pi))/(R-pi).                        (A12)

From (A12), v(pi) - (DO > 0 (see (A4)), > > 0 and T > 0 at pi, we obtain T > 0 if * # v(pi)/*DO. From

(A9) and pi < R (from J - c < R), we obtain * # v(pi)/DO iff m $ 0.

        Suppose now that * $ v(pi)/DO. Using DO = 1/(1 + $v(pi)), we obtain DO(1+2$v(pi)) = 1 +

$v(pi)DO. Also, from > = R - pi - m and (A9), we obtain >/(R-pi) = 1 - (v - *DO)/(v+(DO). It then follows

from (A12) that T = [(v(pi)- *DO)(v(pi) - 2() + ((1 + $v(pi)DO)(v(pi) + (DO)]/(v + (DO). Letting Q(pi)

/ v(pi) + ((1 + $v(pi)DO) we then obtain T = [v(pi)(Q(pi) - *DO) - 2((v(pi) - *DO) + (()2DO(1 +

$v(pi)DO)]/(v + (DO) > 0 for v(pi)/DO # * # Q(pi)/DO. Since T > 0 for * # v(pi)/DO, this proves T > 0

and mJ = 1 - fiJ(J,Fj) > 0 for * # Q(pi)/DO.                                                              G

PROPOSITION 3: (i) With surcharging, customers using other than an own-bank ATM pay the fees,

f F and F, resulting in a price, pF = f F + F 0 (0, 2R/3), which strictly exceeds p . If pF $ R/2, then mF

> 0, whereas mF < 0 if pF # R/3. If * = 0, then pF = 2mF > R/2. If * = 0 and J = c, then mF = f F = F.
                                                                                                       35

(ii) B iF, RF and pF are independent of J: df F/dJ = 1, dF/dJ = -1 and dpF/dJ = dB iF/dJ = 0.

Proof: (i) Setting MBj/MFj = 0, it follows from (16), using (5), (7) and (A1), that Fj = F satisfies

                 F + J - c = - DF(pF)/DFN(pF) = v(pF)(R - pF)/(v(pF) + (DO) > 0.                 (A13)

Since MBj/MFj = 0 implies MBi/Mfi = Ni[gN(pF) + DF(pF)] = 0 (see (15) and (16)) and gN(p) = 0 , we

obtain pF > p and pF independent of J. Also, from (A9) and (A13), we obtain

                MBi/Mfi = Ni$DO[(R - pF)(2v - *DO) - pF(v + (DO)]/2R = 0,                        (A14)

which, using (A6), implies pF > 0. The second order and stability conditions for the choice of F and

fF are satisfied locally (see part (ii) below).

        Rearranging (A14) using T(R - pi) = *(R-pi) + pi (, we obtain MBi/Mfi = Ni$DO[(2R - 3pF)v -

T(R - pF)DO]/2R = 0 where T = * + pi(R-pi)/2R > 0 from the proof of Proposition 1 and hence pF <

2R/3. A further rearrangement of (A14), reveals MBi/Mfi = Ni$DO[(R - pF)(v - *DO) + v (R - 2pF) -

pF(DO]/2 = 0, which implies that if pF $ R/2, then v - *DO > 0 and hence mF > 0 from (A9). Now

adding and subtracting pF(2v - *DO), we obtain (R - 3pF)(2v - *DO) + pF(3v - ((+2*)DO) = 0, which

implies pF $ R/3 if and only if 3v - ((+2*)DO $ 0. Since 3v - ((+2*)DO = 2(v - *DO) + v - (DO and v -

(DO > 0 from (A4), it follows that pF # R/3 only if v - *DO < 0, which requires mF < 0 from (A9). If

* = 0, then comparing (A13), (A9) and (A14), we obtain F+J-c = mF = fF - (J - c) and pF = 2mF.

From (A14), we also obtain (R - 2pF)(2v - *DO) + pF(v - ((+*)DO) = 0, which, since v - (DO > 0 from

(A4), implies that pF > R/2 at * = 0.

(ii) For the effects of J, we first use (6), (A3) and R - 3(/2 > 0 (from pF > 0 and ((0) = R/2) to show

        v - 2(DO = [(v(R) - R)(1+$v(R)) + R - 3(/2 + $v(R)(R+()]DO > 0.                          (A15)

Since (from (16) and (A13)), M2Bj/(MFj)(Mfi) = NA[(DFN(pi))2 - DF(pi)DFO(pi)]/DFN(pi), it follows, using

(A1), (A5), (5) and (A15) that M2Bj/(MFj)(Mfi) = - Ni$DO[v - 2(DO + ((DO )2(3+2$v)/(v+(DO)]/2R < 0.
                                                                                                        36

Since M2Bj/(MFj)2 = M2Bj/(MFj)(Mfi) + NiDFN(pi) from (16), we obtain M2Bj/(MFj)2 < 0 and Ff(J,fF) = -

(M2Bj/(MFj)(Mfi))/(M2Bj/(MFj)2) < 0. Since FJ / FJ(J,fF) = - NiDFN(pi)/(M2Bj/(MFj)2) < 0 from (16), it also

follows that

                Ff(J,fF) / Ff = - (1 + FJ) < 0 and -1 < FJ < 0.                                     (A16)

Using M2Bi/(Mfi)2 = M2Bi/(Mfi)(MFj) + NiDFN(pi) from (15), (A11) and mJ = 1- fiJ > 0 for * # Q(pi)/DO,

we obtain

                fF(J,F) / fFF = fFJ - 1 < 0 if * # Q(pi)/DO.                                        (A17)

Since FJ < 0 and fFJ > 0, it follows from (A16) and (A17) that Ff > - 1 and fFF > -1 and hence

                1 - fFFFf > 0,                                                                      (A18)

which implies the stability condition, D / (M2Bi/(Mfi)2)(M2Bj/(MFj)2) - (M2Bi/(Mfi)(MFj))(M2Bj/(MFj)(Mfi))

> 0. Since dfF/dJ = fFJ + fFF(dF/dJ) and dF/dJ = FJ + FfdfF/dJ, we obtain dfF/dJ = (fFJ + fFFFJ)/(1-

fFFFf) and dF/dJ = (FJ + FffFJ)/(1- fFFFf). Using (A16) and (A17), this implies dfF/dJ = 1, dF/dJ = -1

and dpF/dJ = 0.                                                                                         G

PROPOSITION 4: (i) df*/d* < 0; df F/d* < 0, dF/d* > 0 and dpF/d* < 0. (ii) If N i > 0 and F i fixed,

then dBi*/d* < 0 at J = c. If N B = 0, then dB B*/d* > 0 for J - c > 0 and dBBF/d* > 0.

Proof: (i) Since M2Bi/(Mfi)(M*) = - NiDON(pi) from (17), we obtain Mfi(J, Fj)/M* = NiDON(pi)/(M2Bi/(Mfi)2)

< 0 and hence df*/d* < 0 and MfF/M* < 0. Since M2Bj/(MFj)(M*) = 0 (see (16)) implies dF(J,fF)/d* =

Ff(dfF/d*), it follows, using dfF/d* = MfF/M* + fF(dF/d*) and (A18), that dfF/d* = (MfF/M*)/(1 - FffFF)

< 0 and, from (A16), that dF/d* > 0. Also dpF/d* = (1 + Ff)(dfF/d*) < 0 from (A16). (ii) From (14),

MBi/M* = - NiDO(pi) (see (11)), MBi/Mfi = 0 (see (15)) and Fi fixed, we obtain dBi*/d* = - NiDO(f*) +

Nj(J - c)DFN(f*)(df*/d*) < 0 for Ni > 0 and J = c. If NB = 0, then dBB*/d* = NA(J - c)DFN(f*)(df*/d*)

                                                                                                      37

PROPOSITION 5. (i) Whether or not surcharging is an option, if N A = N B, both banks agree not to

surcharge and set J = c. (ii) If surcharging is banned, then J 0 (max[J B, J A*], J B*). If N B = 0, then

J 0 (c,J B*). (iii) If surcharging is allowed and N B/N A > 1 - fJ (JF,0), then Nash bargaining would

give rise to a no-surcharging agreement in which J 0 (JBb,JB*) and J > J A*. If N B = 0 and 1 -

fJ(JF,0) > 0, then no agreement is possible and surcharging is the outcome.

Proof: (i) If NA = NB, then Ai* = Ni(g(f*) - g(R)) and Bi* - BiF = Ni(g(f*) - g(pF)). Since setting J =

c implies f* = p (see Proposition 2) both Ai* and Bi* - BiF are maximized. Since pF > p, both banks

will agree not to surcharge at J = c. (ii) Maximizing ln Z / "ln(AA*) + (1- ")ln(AB*), it follows that,

at a Nash bargaining equilibrium, J satisfies

                        dlnZ/dJ = "(dAA*/dJ)/AA* + (1-")(dAB*/dJ)/AB* = 0,                        (A19)

where Ai* > 0 and hence J > JB. Since dAA*/dJ = - NADF + NB(dR*/dJ) < dAB*/dJ = - NBDF +

NA(dR*/dJ) for NA > NB and " < 1, we obtain dAA*/dJ < 0 and dAB*/dJ > 0 from (A19), which

implies JA* < J < JB* and hence J 0 (max[JB, JA*], JB*). If NB = 0, then JB = c and J 0 (c, JB*). (iii)

If the outside option is to surcharge, then setting J to maximize ZF/ (BA* - BAF)"(BB* - BBF)1-" for

" < 1, it follows from the first order condition, analogous to (A19), that dBA*/dJ < 0 and dBB*/dJ

> 0 and hence JA* < J < JB*. Also, an agreement not to surcharge requires Bi* - BiF > 0 for i = A, B.

We have shown in the text that bank A prefers no surcharging (i.e. BA* - BAF > 0) if JA* # J < JF and

prefers surcharging if J > JF. Since from (22), dBB*/dJ = NA[- (NB/NA)DF + dR*/dJ], it follows using

dR*/dJ = DF(1 - fJ(JF,0)) that dBB*/dJ $ 0 at J = JF if and only if NB/NA # 1- fJ(JF, 0). If 1- fJ(JF, 0)

> 0, we obtain dBB*/dJ > 0 at NB = 0. The results then follow as described in the text.               G
