        The Effect of Unionism on Worker Attachment to Firms



                               ABSTRACT



          This study uses several data sets on individual workers to analyse

the impact of unionism on the length of attachment between workers and firms.

It finds that unionism substantially raises tenure and reduces probabilities

of separation.   The increase in worker attachment to firms resulting from

unionism is not due largely to monopoly wage increases nor to reductions in

employer-initiated separations nor to unionization of more stable workers,

but rather to changes in worker behavior induced by unionised work settings.

Among the work place conditions that appear to raise tenure with a firm are

the presence of grievance systems and specific work rules like seniority.

          These findings provide some support for the 'exit-voice' model of

the union and for the traditional industrial relations view of unionism as a

complex institution which causes wide-ranging changes in the job market.     They

suggest that modern empirical research on trade unionism which currently

focuses almost exclusively on estimating monopoly wage effects, should be

extended to analyse the non-monopoly wage voice or industrial jurisprudence

impacts of unions.   Unions have monopoly wage effects, but they also have more

subtle, potentail1y socially beneficial economic effects that deserve attention.

     The nature and length of the attachment between workers and enter-

prises is one of the most important aspects of the work relation in

modern industrial economies.      Workers with long job tenure and relatively

permanent status in firms are treated differently and behave differently
                                                      l
than short term or temporary employees.      Tenure       in a firm is an important

determinant of wages, fringe benefits, promotions, layoffs, and quits.

It differentiates persons in the internal labor market from those in

the external markets and workers likely to have firm specific human

capital from those without such capital.      In the unionized sector,

work rules relating to seniority make length of attachment between workers

and firms a key factor in the economic well-being of employees.

     Despite widespread recognition of the importance of tenure in the

labor market and of the particular significance of seniority in unionized

settings, empirical work on the impact of unionism on the length of

attachment between workers and enterprises has been relatively sparse.

The labor turnover literature has concentrated on the effect of specific

human capital on turnover and has been limited to analysis of aggregate

manufacturing data, which provides only weak evidence on the behavior of

individuals and covers only one-fifth of the labor force.          While several

analysts have found an inverse relation between unionism and quit rates in

the aggregate data, others have not, leading to what some regard as
                        2
inconclusive results.       The bulk of the economic literature on unions deals

with union wage effects and not with the impact of the institution on

nonwage variables like tenure with a firm.

     What is the relation between unionism and tenure?          Does trade unionism

increase length of attachment between firms and employees and, if so, by

what routes or mechanisms?
                                                                    2

     This study examines these important questi:)ns using newly available

data files on individuals, which contain information on their job tenure

and union status, among other things.     Section one examines the theoretical

reasons for expecting unionism to increase job tenure.     Section two develops

the "waiting time" statistics and econometrics needed to analyze tenure

and its converse, separations.    Section three describes the data sets under

study and presents the basic econometric analysis of the effect of unionism

on tenure and separations.     Section four analyzes the routes by which

unionism influences the variables.     The paper concludes with a brief

discussion of the implications of the analysis for understanding the

economic effects of unionism.

     There are three basic findings:

     1.   Trade unionism is significantly positively related to the length

of attachment between workers and firms, making union wad: forces much more

likely to be relatively "permanent" than nonunion work forces.

     2.   Unionism influences the length of attachment by reducing the

quit rate of workers, not by reducing the layoff or discharge rate of

firms.

     3.   The impac t of unionism on worker quit behavior is not due primarily

to union wage gains nor to selectivity of more stable workers but to

actual changes in behavior induced by union work settings.     Some of

these changes may be attributed to the grievance/arbitration system and

some to inverse seniority layoff rules.

      Overall, by raising the length of attachment between workers and

firms, unionism appears to alter the operation of the labor    ~arket    in

an important way that is often neglected in standard studies of union

monopoly wage gains.



I.   Unionism and Job Tenure

      Because employment is a two-sided arrangement, dependent on the
                                                                         3


decisions of firms and workers, spells of job tenure result from the joint
behavior of employers, who decide whether or not to retain a worker, and

employees, who moose to stay or go.          The basic principal for maintaining

the employment relation is that neither side can do better in the outside

market or, given uncertainty, that neither expects to do better.             Let

W = compensation at the current enterprise, including nonpecuniary

components of pay; A = compensation at alternative jobs, also including

nonpecuniary rewards; and MP = marginal product at the enterprise.             Then

the employment relation will be maintained in period t when:

     (1) MP     > W > A
              t -    t -     t

If At > W , the worker can do better elsewhere and will break the relation
         t
by quitting.        If W > MP , the employer loses money by keeping the worker
                        t    t
and will lay him or her off.          If there are no costs involved in altering

the contract, so that the wage rises or falls within the bounds of At and

MP , the relation will continue as long as MP         ~   At' that is, as long as
  t                                           t
the social value of the arrangement exceeds the social cost.           If, as

seems reasonable,          decisions to leave are essentially irreversible,

the terms in (1) are best thought of as representing the present values

of the relevant variables.

     Trade unionism can be expected to influence the benefits and costs

of the length of spells of employment in three distinct ways.

     First, in the context of the standard monopoly model of unionism,

union-induced increases in wages and related pecuniary rewards are likely

to raise the benefits to employees of staying on the job and thus to

lower worker-initiated separationa          Since union wage gains have been

found to be sizeable (see Lewis) and high wages are likely to reduce

quits significantly, the "monopoly wage" route of union impact on job

tenure may be quite potent.          To the extent that union wage increases

reduce employment, the union work force is likely to be smaller but more
                                                                    4


stable than otherwise comparable nonunion work forces.

     Second, unionism creates distinctive "voice" mechanisms for resolving

industrial relations problems that can also be expected to lower worker-

initiated separations.   Perhaps the most important such institution is

the grievance/arbitration system, which offers dissatisfied workers who

might consider quitting an al.ternative means of expressing discontent and possibly

changing undesirQble work conditions.   Nearly all (9970) major u.S. collective

bargaining contracts provide for grievance and 95% provide for arbitration

(U.S. Department of Labor, 1977, p. 94).    The potential impact of grievance/

arbitration on length of attachment to an employer is clear:       workers who

believe they have been unfairly treated or who believe their supervisors

erred in interpreting work rules will seek a solution through the grievance

procedure before invoking the drastic remedy of quitting.    If the grievance

is successful, the incentive to quit will be removed.    Even if it is not

and the aggrieved ultimately leaves, the delay in the quit decision during
                                                               3
the grievance procedure will raise average spells of tenure.

     The regular process of collective negotiation of labor contracts

can also be expected to reduce exit behavior.    Workers wanting new conditions

who, in the absence of a bargaining alternative, might have quit will

instead seek first to obtain the particular changes through bargaining.

If some of the worker demands are met, quits are likely to be lower than

would otherwise be the case.   For work conditions and rules that are

"public" to the enterprise, where standard public goods arguments suggest

that enterprises have great difficulty in eliciting true worker preferences,

considerable mobility would be needed for these conditions and rules to

be provided.   Here the role of unionism in obtaining and aggregating

preferences might produce the desired arrangements more efficiently,

surely with lower mobility in the market.
                                                                 5



     Union "voice" may also reduce worker-initiated separations by

creating particular work rules and conditions of employment (which mayor

may not be costly to employers, once unionism is "in place") that are

desired by workers, particularly what industrial relations experts call

the industrial jurisprudence system.     Under this system many work

place decisions are made on the basis of negotiated rules, for instance

seniority, as opposed to supervisory judgment (or whim).     By straightforward

application of compensating differential arguments, if workers desire these

conditions and if they are provided largely by unions, then with pay and other

pecuniary benefits hel'l fixed, separation rates should be lower for union

workers.

     Third, unionism may affect employer-initiated separations, discharges

and layoffs.     Discharges are likely to be more expensive in union settings

due to explicit rules protecting job rights and the possibility of protesting

discharges through the grievance system.     The tendency of arbitrators to

view discharge of senior employees as an extreme penalty in discipline

cases to be used only as a last resort reduces the chance of dismissal in

an organized plant.

     The effect of unions on layoffs, however, is more complex.      On the

one hand, union-induced increases in wages may cause unionized establishments

to go out of business, reducing average spells of tenure among the organized.

On the other hand, unionized firms have inverse seniority layoff rules

and seniority recall rules which lead to extensive use of temporary

layoffs and recalls over the business cycle (Medoff), maintaining employment

relations.     Whether the net of union effects on discharges, permanent

layoffs and temporary layoffs is to increase or reduce employer-initiated

separations and thus job tenure is unclear.

     In addition to the behavioral impacts of unionism outlined above,
                                                               6



union workers may accrue more job tenure than other workers for very differ-

ent "selectivity" reasons.    If, as seems reasonable, unions organize workers

or firms that are innately more stable, unionised employees will have longer

spells of job tenure than nonunion employees in the absence of any changes

in behavior.   Such selectivity in organization is likely if workers view

unionisation" as a longterm investment, which pays off for those with rela-

tively permanent careers in an establishment but which is unlikely to be

worth the organizing effort for those with short-term employment expectations.

The selectivity effect differs fundamentally from the behavioral effects.

If it is the sole cause of differences between union and nonunion workers,

then unions have no real impact on behavior but merely sort out more and less

stable workers.   It is clearly important to control for the potential impact
                                                                                 . , .

of selectivity bias in any analysis of union effects on tenure.

     Empirical efforts to estimate the effect of unionism on job tenure

must control for other L~portant economic variables likely to influence

lengths of spells of employment:    investments in skills that are

specific to an enterprise; complementarities in production and the

"tendency for men with particular qualities to move    towards those

employers who can best make use of their qualities" (Hicks, p. 37),

particularly in team settings; costs of mobility on the workers

side and of recruitment and training on the employers side.

Considerable effort has gone into measuring some of these factors and into

estimating their effect on rates of separation, though not on job tenure

itself (see Parsons).     For purposes of the present study, these variables

are treated as:controls to isolate the impact of unionism.



II   Statistical Issues

     From the perspective of probability theory, job tenure is best
                                                                        7


viewed as a "waiting time" variable whose length depends on the probability

P that an employment relation ends in a given period and the probability

l-P that it is maintained in the period.        In this section I review briefly

some of the basic statistics of waiting time relations and consider their

relevance for econometric analysis of the effects of unionism.         There are

three technical issues:        the 'functional form of tenure equations: and of

their counterpart, separation equations; differences between completed and

incomplete spells of tenure; and the problem of differentiating behavioral

effects from selectivity.



Functional form

     The appropriate functional form for an equation explaining tenure

depends on the, specific probability model and "hazard func tion" governing

the probability that an employee separates from a job in a given period.

     The simplest and most manageable model assumes that each individual/

job has a constant probability of separation (p) in a given period,

dependent on the economic forces described earlier, but not on accrued

tenure.    With a constant probability P and a discrete time model, the

probability of accruing t years of tenure is:

     (2)    peT = t)    = P(l-P) t
a geometric distribution with mean (l-P)/P and standard deviation (l-P)/P.

The continuous equivalent of (2) is the exponential, with density function:

     (3)    f(t)   =P   exp(-Pt)

and a mean and standard deviation of lip, where P is the separation rate.

     The dependence of P on a set of economic variables (X.) can be
                                                                 ~


represented by a linear probability function or, more properly.because P

is bounded by 0 and l, by the logistic function:

     (4)    P   = 1/(1 +   exp EB.X.)
                               i   ~   ~

The logistic can be estimated by a maximum likelihood search procedure.
                                                                                         8


     Given (3) and (4) the expected value of tenure conditional on the

X's and on an error term in the equation for P is an exponential function:

     (5) E(T/X;,ll.) = exp -EB.X. + E(l.1.)
                    ...    ....            i   ~   ~     ~




     Equation (5) can be estimated by maximum ·likelihood.                         Since, however,

one cannot be sure that P is independent of past tenure nor logistic in form,

it may be J1lOre reasonable to evaluate the effect of variables on tenure in

regression analysis by taking a linear function:

     (6)    T   =   -EB.X. + 1.1.
                           ~      ~    ~


The linear equation can be viewed as a first order Tayler series approximation

to the exponential or to more complex forms.

     When P depends on the level of cumulated service, the geometric

or exponential forms are no longer appropriate.                     The functional form of

the tenure equation will depend on the link between past tenure and

the probability of                separatio~ which     can be quite complex.       The principal

tool for analyzing tenure in this case is the haz.ard function.                         The hazard

function h(x) is a conditional density measuring the probability or

frequency of separations conditional on past tenure:
      (7)   h(x)          = f(x)/     (l-F(x»




 exponential function.                The geometric and exponential distributions have,

as noted, constant hazard functions, which makes their mean levels of tenure

depend directly on fue probability of separation.                    Distributions with

increasing or decreasing hazard functions do not, unfortunately, generate
                                                                               4
simple equations linking tenure to explanatory variables.                           To evaluate
                                                               9


the impact of variables on tenure in such distributions, linear equations

(e.g. (6»   or logarithmic (log T   = -rB.X.)
                                         1 1
                                              equations can be estimated, on the

assumption that those forms are first-order Taylor's series approximations to

more complex functions.   To obtain insight into the shape of the hazard function

itself--the extent to which tenure affects the probability of separation--

it is best to estimate the separation equation (4)     with past tenure

included as an independent variable, rather than to infer shares from

the tenure equations.



Incomplete vs. Completed Spells

     Surveys of individuals typically ask persons the number of years of

job tenure at a point in time and thus contain information on incomplete

spells of tenure rather than on the completed spells that -are the

dependent variable of renewal theory.     In general, the mean of the distribution

of incomplete spells will not equal the mean of the completed spell distribution.

On the one hand, since spells are not complete, tenure will increase as

time proceeds, which implies that the mean incomplete spell will be

smaller than the mean completed spell.     On the other hand, at any point in time

longer spells are more likely to be represented in a sample than shorter spells,

raising the mean o£ incomplete spells.      Only in the case of a constant

(memory-less). separation propensity such as in the binomial or geometric

distributions do the two biases cancel out, making the mean of the incomplete

spell equal the mean of the completed spell.     When, as one would expect,

the separatiun rate drops as tenure rises (h' < 0), the mean of the

incomplete spell distribution will exceed that of the completed spell distribution,

leading to an overstatement of the average duration of spells of job tenure.
                                                                          10


     The fact that the distribution of incomplete spells does not generally

have the same mean as the distribution of completed spells does not, however,

imply that it is incorrect to analyze incomplete spells.           With a stationary

stochastic process generating separations, both the incomplete and completed

spell distributions embody the same information.         They are simply different

representations of the particular stochastic process and can be readily
                                     5
transformed from one to the other.       Whether one wishes to focus on the

incomplete spell distribution or the distribution of completed spells is

a matter of choice.

     In this study I examine lengths of incomplete tenure

among persons rather than       lengths of   co~pleted   spells.    Average

tenure refers to the average length of years an individual has been

with an employer at a point in time, not the length of an average completed

spell.   Inferences about completed spells can be made from estimates of

separation equations or, alternatively, from the analysis of incomplete

spells, given the appropriate transformation between them.



Selectivity vs. Behavioral Effects

     As pointed out in section I, relations between unionism and job tenure

obtained in cross-sectional data can be interpreted either as a result of

the influence of unions on behavior or as a result of the organization of

innately more stable employees.     The easiest way of differentiating between

these two effects and isolating the behavioral aspect of unionism of

concern is to examine longitudinal data on the behavior of the same

person over time.     With information on the same person over time one can
                                                                                  11



compare the person's behavior when he is unionized and when he is not.

By comparing the same person in the two situations, one eliminates the

unobserved personal propensity to be a stable worker and thus isolates

the behavioral impact of unionism.

     The use.of longitudinal data to control for unobserved personal factors can

be most readily demonstrated with a linear probability model of the worker's quit

deci~ion.     Let Q
                   it
                        = 0-1   dummy variable which measures whether the ith

person quits in period t; UNit = 0-1 dummy variable for whether or not the

person is a union member; h
                                  i
                                      = unobserved   personal characteristics which

raises the propensity to quit; and e              be a residual uncorrelated with
                                             it
unionism.     For simplicity, the effect of other variables will be ignored,

implying that the coefficients and error terms are partial with respect

to other variables.      Then     the linear probability representation of the

quit decision is:




When union workers are innately more stable, E(UN                    hi) < 0, which biases
                                                                it
the least squares regression estimate of             ~   toward a negative value, potentially

leading to the erroneous inference that unionism reduces quits when in                  fact~


may be   o.   With data on several time periods, the effect of h. can be
                                                                              1

-eliminated by including in the regressions individual constants which will pick up

the personal propensity to quit.           In the linear model this is equivalent

to taking deviations from means for all the variables.                  With data on two

periods, the analysis simplifies to a Simple difference equation:




Since the h. terms have been eliminated in (9), there is no prohlem in
              1
                                                            /

      A comparable procedure using the logistic form (4), which is more

appropriate for the analysis of probabilities, has been developed by Gary

Chamberlain.   His procedure essentially involves estimation of multinomial

logistic equations in which dependent variables relate to the pattern of

quits over time, and the independent variables are, as in the linear

case, deviations from means (or first differences in the two period case).

      In ensuing empirical work I estimate the effect of unionism on tenure

and quit probabilities with standard cross-section models and then use

Chamberlain's fixed effect conditional 10git model to evaluate the importance

of behavioral as opposed to selectivity factors in the observed relations.



III   Econometric Analysis

      This study uses data from three longitudinal surveys of individuals

to estimate the effect of unionism on lengths of attachment between

workers and firms:   the Michigna Panel Survey of Income Dynamics (PSID);

the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) of }!ature Men; and the National

Longitudinal Survey (NLS) of Younger Men. 6     The PSID covers the entire

population while the NLS surveys deal with men aged 45-59 in 1966 and

men aged 14-24 in 1966.      The longitudinal surveys have the advantage of

providing two types of information on attachment behavior:      retro-

spective information from questions on job tenure; and longitudinal

information on actual quits or separations over time.      Since the data relate

to individuals, it provides much better information about the attachment of wcrkers

to firms than the average tndustry turnover figures used in earlier stuoies.



The dependent variables

      Figure 1 graphs the distribution of tenure in the three data sets

over several years and gives the means and standard deviation of tenure.

In the PSID survey, the means and standard deviations are calculated from

grouped data with observations given the midpoint of the group. 7      In the NLS

survey, the means and standard deviations are cal:ulated from actual years

and the, data grouped for the purposes of displaying the distribution.

     The figure reveals considerable attachment of workers to firms in

the United States.    In the PSID Survey, mean tenure is on the order of

9 years, which implies that the probability of separation would be about

11% per annum.   About one-third of the population is employed with the

same employer for over 10 years and 14-15% employed with the same employer

for over 20 years.   In the older male NLS survey, mean levels of tenure are of

course higher, on the order of 15 to 16 years, with a marked concentration

of persons at the upper end of the distribution.    Over one third of the

older men had been with their current employer 20 or more years and over

half had attained 15+ years of tenure.   Among this group a rather large

number would appear to be more or less permanently attached to their

employers.    In the younger male NLS survey, the figures show, ns might be

expected, relatively low levels of tenure:    a mean in 1967 of

just 1.4 years and a mean in 1971 of 2.2 years.    In this case, however,

this is too little time to achieve tenure to provide much information

about the overall distribution.

     Attachment between workers and firms can be broken by employees

via quits, or by employers via discharges or permanent layoffs due

to plant closure or related economic factors which require reductions in

employment.    Table 1 examines the distribution of reasons for the termination of

employment relations in the PSID and NLS data sets.    In each data set quits are a

much more common cause of changes in jobs than are employer-initiated

separations.   In the older male NLS about 2/3rds of the changes from 1966 to

1971 are attributable to quits; in the younger male NLS sample, 72% of

the changes result from worker-initiated quits.      The figures on the PSID

are somewhat more difficult to read because of an ambiguous 'other'

category, which consists of breaks due to military service and other

unspecified causes.   \-lith "other" included under worker-initiated changes,

breaks due to employees leaving their employer are from 3 to 4 times as

important as employer-initiated changes.     With "other" excluded, the differ-

ences range from 1.5 to 3.5 to one.    All told, the data show that termination

of tenure depends primarily on 'tvorker-initi.atec   decisions.

     Establishmeilt turnover data for manufacturing tell a similar story,

once temporary layoffs are removed from the published layoff rates.      From

1967 to 1976 quits averaged 2.2% per month in the BLS turnover figures

while layoffs averaged 1.4%.    Given that about 68 percentof layoffs are

temporary (See Lilien), the permanent layoff rate is only 0.4% per month,

which makes quits five times as important.     Other separations, including

retirement, averaged 0.9 percent, so that quits constituted nearly 2/3rds of

permanent separations (=2.2/(2.2+.4+.9)).

     The tendency for a typical worker to cumulate considerable job tenure

and for quits to be the prime form of breaking employment relations are

 important facets of the job market, indicative of the nature of cTI~lo)~cnt

 contracts and remuneration schemes.




 Determinants of tenure

      Estimates of the effect of unionism and other (control) variables

 on job tenure were made using three functional forms, the linear, loglinear

and exponential.    The exponential was clearly dominated by the other forms

in terms of fit, presumably because the hazard function depends on past

tenure~ Accordingly, I focus on the other two forms.

linear and 10g1inear regressions of tenure on a measure of unionism, a

0-1 dummy variable for whether or not the work place is governed by a

collective bargaining agreement, log earnings, selected personal character-

istics and "other controls," notably dummy variables for occupation,

industry, region, and residence in an SMSA.    Inclusion of earnings in the

equations holds fixed the effect of unionism on tenure due to monopoly

wage gains, and thus limits the union variable to reflecting the nonwage

effects of the institution.    It also provides a potentially stronger control

for the "quality" of workers then is given by other variables.

     The personal, institutional and various control variables are

essentially exogenous to tenure, and thus are properly treated as right-hand

side variables.    Wages, which should increase the desire of workers to

remain with a firm but which can have the opposite effect on the desire of

employers to keep workers, cannot be so viewed.    Wages are surely also influenced

by tenure, creating simultaneity problems.    Since essentially the same

variables that affect wages can be expected a priori to affect tenure, there

is no obvious way to identify the line of causality.    The extent to which the

coefficients on wages and the coefficients on unionism in the tenure

equation are biased due to simultaneity can, however, be estimated by

considering the possible magnitudes of the impact of wages on tenure and

of tenure on wages.    Tenure is usually found to raise wages by 2% to 3% in

a cross-section, giving a coefficient of .02 or .03 in a log earnings

equation.   This implies coefficients on wages in a tenure equation due to the

reverse direction of causality ranging from 33(=1/.03) to 50(1/.02).       Since

Moreover, since unionism is positively related to tenure and positively

related   to wages, the inclusion of tenure without adjusting for simultaneity
                                                                    lO
will bias downward the coefficient on unionism in the equation.          Failure to
adjust for the simultaneity problem thus creates a more stringent test of the

influence of unionism on tenure.

     In the older male NLS data set an additional measure of compensation,

the presence of a retirement plan at the work place, is included in the

regressions.    Since unionism is likely to be positively associated with

the existence of   a   pension plan and pension plans should increase attachment

to the firm, it is important to control for such a factor if one is to

isolate the nonmonopoly wage impact of unionism on attachment.

     There are two basic results in Table 2.     First, even with log of

earnings in the equation unionism obtains sizeable and highly statistically

significant coefficients in all three samples in both the linear and loglinear

forms.    In the Michigan PSID sample the coefficient in the linear regression

is 1. 6, implying that unioniz ed workers have over 1 1/2 years more tenure than

otherwise comparable nonunion workers, while the coefficient in the loglinear

form sho"ivs ar. approximate one-third differential.   In the older male NLS

sample, where the average level of tenure is higher than in the PSID, the

linear regression coefficient on unionism is correspondingly higher, while

the loglinear regression coefficient is comparable to that obtained in the PSIn.

In the younger male NLS sample, on the other hand, the effect of unionism in
                                                                                      II
both linear and loglinear forms is markedly smaller, though still significant.

To the extent that earnings variables capture      the full union monopoly

wage, the results imply that unionism increases lengths of emplOyment
                                                                 20


spells between workers and firms in   ~ays   that go beyond raising wages.

Whether this involves the "voice" routes of impact, selectivity, or other

factors remains to be seen.

     The second important result pertains to the magnitude of the estimated

coefficients on unionism relative to the magnitude of the estimated

coefficient on earnings.    Despite the likely upward bias in the coefficient

on earnings and down,mrd bias in the coefficient on unionism due to simul-

taneity, the coefficients are of roughly comparable magnitudes, even in the

younger male NLS sample.    This implies that an increase in wages on the

order of 100+% is needed to increase tenure by as much as the move from

nonunion to union status,     The union impact on attachment is, according to

the estimates in Table 2, very large.

     With respect to other variables in the analysis, the most important

variable in all of the calculations is, of course, age, which raises tenure

substantially.    Not surprisingly, being male also raises tenure noticeably.

Being black reduces tenure in the younger male NLS sample but raises

tenure in the PSID and older male   1~S   samples.   The absence of a marked

black dLsadvantage in tenure is surprising in light of extensive contro-

versy regarding the conflict between seniority and affirmative action.         It

suggests   that   there is no great racial disparity in accrual of tenure

(and thus of seniority benefits) which would make formal seniority systems
                                                     ,"
a major deterrent to black economic advancement. ~~
     The coefficients on years of schooling in the regressions are small or

negative, which might appear to run counter to the common assumption that general

human capital (= education) is positively correlated with specific human capital

and thus is positively related to tenure.      Because the regressions control

for age rather than years in the job market,however, such an inference
                                                                           21


would be erroneous.         Indeed, holding years since leaving school fixed, the

calculations imply a positive effect of schooling on tenure, with a coefficient

roughly equal to         the coefficient on a ge.   As years since   leavi~g   school
equals age minus years of schooling minus a constant, the coefficient on

education can be obtained from:

     (10)     a"Age + B Years of Schoolin 5         a [Age - Years of Schoolingl

              +   (B   + a) Years of Schooling

The large coefficients on age (~) in table 2 imply that while more

educated persons have less tenure than less educated persons of the same

age, they have significantly more tenure than less educated persons with

the same years since leaving school.

     Finally, the industry and occupation "controls" listed at the bottom

of .Table 2       reveal very different patterns of attachment of workers to
employers in different job markets.           In terms of occupations, the regression

coefficients (not recorded in the table) show that managers and craftworkers

tend to accrue the most tenure while service workers, laborers, clerical

and sales employees have the least.           The strong occupational dimension of

tenure may reflect the importance of differences in specific training,

 conplcnentarity with        capital~   or institutional rules.   In terms of

 industries, the regressions show that workers accrus (all else the same)

 greater tenure in durable and nondurable manufacturing, while in all

 but the young male NLS, they also accrue mqre in transportation and less

 in construction, communication and utilities, services and trade.

 Since the analysis has controlled for the (observed) personal characteristics

 of workers, the patterns presumably result from the employer side of

 the market, for both institutional and technical reasons.

     The substantial coefficients obtained on the occupation and industry

 dummy variables raise the possibility that unionism and the other
                                                                      22

determinants of tenure may have different effects on different types of

workers and in different markets.     To see whether there are important

differences across markets and subgroups, separate loglinear tenure

regressions were estimated in the Hichigan PSID sample for persons divided

by sex, occupation and industry.    The results of the estimates, summarized

in table 3, reveal sizeable differences in the impact of      unio~ism   on

tenure in the different groups.     Taking the male/female comparisons first,

columns 1 and 2 show a much greater coefficient on unionism for men, which

could be taken to result from male dominance of    unio~s   that makes unions

more attuned to the desires of male workers.     Among the three occupations

considered--professionals, operatives and clericals--unionism raises the

tenure of operatives and clericals more than the tenure of professionals.

The industry calculations also reveal substantial differences in the impact

of unionism, with unionism having a markedly larger impact in manufacturing

than elsewhere.   The coefficients on wages also vary by occupation and industry,

being larger for operatives and clerical workers than for professionals

and being larger in trade and manufacturing than in services.
      The different coefficients obtained on the union variable across

 groups provides general support for the view that trade unionism is a

 complex institution, whose impacts vary depending on economic and other

 circumstances.   In section IVan attempt is made to use the 'different

 magnitudes of the union effect across industries to make inferences abcut

 the mechanisms by which unionism increases job tenure.




 Econometric problems
      To vThat extent might the results in tables 2 and 3 be distorted by

 measurement error of key variables or omission of important variables?

 Might the finding of a strong union effect on tenure be erroneous?

cause the estimated coefficients on unionism to be biased upward.                     First

is the lack of information on fringe benefits (with the exception of the

retirement plan variable in the older male NLS data set).                    Since fringes

are likely to be higher under unionism and should raise tenure, omission or

understatement of fringe behefits could result in a higher coefficient on

the union du~y variable, distorting interpretation of that coefficient.

The coefficient would reflect union monopoly wage effects on fringe8 ~s

well as the nonmonopoly wage effects of concern.                    To obtain some notion of

the magnitude of the bias, consider the least squares equation linking

the partial regression coefficient on unionism with fringes fixed to the

coefficients which do not partial for fringes:

     Available information about the likely magnitudes of the coefficients

unionism, of at most 5%.          For b        and r        ' estimates in Freeman (1978a,

estimate of b   would be the coefficient obtained on log wages in the
             TF
regressions:         since fringes constitute no more than one-third of the wage

bill, this implies that a dollar of fringes is three times as effective in

reducing quits as a dollar of wages.              With these estimates, the union

relative to unionism) is reduced to 1.50, while there is virtually no impact
                                             13
on the coefficients in other columns.             Unless the magnitudes of the fringe-union-

quit coefficients are markedly off, correction for the omission of fringes

still leaves a sizeable union effect that is not due to monopoly compensation

gains, including fringes.
     A second and more diffic'ult problem relates to the lack of adequate

data on the options facing an individual which might induce a break in
employment.    While we have information on wages in the current job, we

have only the crudest measures of         ~0tential   wages in alternative jobs.   If

union workers had worse opportunities in the market than other workers,

say because unions attracted less able persons, the coefficient on unionism

would be biased upward in the tenure regressions.            If, on the other hand,

union workers were more able than otherwise comparable nonunion workers

(due, presumably, to selectivity of more able workers by high-paying firms)

the coefficient on unionism would be biased downard in the tenure           reerp~~;nns.


     To obtain some notion of the direction and possible magnitude of the

bias, consider the equation linking the partial regression coefficient

of unionism on tenure, with alternative wage opportunities (W ) as well as
                                                             A

on alternative wages:

are unlikely to remain with a given employer and accrue      t~nure.   Hence the

sign of the bias on the coefficient on unionism depends solely on bq U
                                                                         \"A .W.

An estimate of b      . can be bbtained by regressing the In wages of persons
                   WAU W
who changed jobs in the Michigan sample on their previous wage and union

status and other aspects of the job for each year.     While by no means

perfect, the- relation between unionism and the wages obtained on the new

job provides at least a crude indication of whether or not unionized

workers who switch employers have better or worse opportunities than other

workers who switch employers.     If the regression coefficient on unionism is

positive, then the argument that union workers have longer attachments because

they are less able than nonunion workers would be difficult to maintain.           The

calculations yield the following estimate    for 1969-1970: b   . = .13(.05);

and comparable (somewhat lower) estimates for other years. 14 These figures

suggest that the estimates of the union effect in tables 2 and 3 are, if anything,

understated due to failure to control adequately for alternative opportunities.


separations

     The attachment between employees and firms can also be evaluated in '

terms of the job separations which break spells of tenure.       While separations

convey less information about the probability of attachment than job tenure,

(since separation relates to a single break in employment while tenure represents

decisions over extended time periods) analysis of separation in longitudinal

data has some advantages in evaluating the effect of unionism on attachment

of workers to firms.     The probability of separation can be related to the

characteristics of an initial job, including wages and tenure, which

breaks the wage-tenure simultaneity problem.     Second, it enables us to differ-

entiate between worker-initiated and    emplby~r-init~ated   breaks in the employ-

ment relation and thus to determine by which route unions influence tenure.

Third, with extended longitudinal files, we can isolate the behavioral effect

of unionism from the selectivity effect using the fixed effect model of section II.
                                                                  27
     Accordingly, the .effect of unionism and other variables on the probability

of separations was estimated using the three data sets under study.        In the

older male and younger male NLS data sets, the probability of separations from

1969 to 1971 was related to the relevant independent variables.       To focus on

persons quitting to take another job, the samples were limited to those

employed in -both   1969 and 1971.     In the Michigan PSID, information on separa-

tions for the years 1966 to 1973 was grouped into a single     ~ooled   sample, in

which each observation links changes from year t to t+l to the characteristics

of workers and jobs in t.     The pooled sample contains 21,173 observations,

with multiple observations on individuals (with differences in the number of

observations per person due to deletions of certain persons over time).

     The results of the calculations are given in table 4.       The odd-numbered

regressions exclude job tenure as an independent variable.       The even-numbered

regressions include tenure and thus provide estimates of the effect of unionism

on the separation behavior of workers with the same levels of tenure.          To the

extent that past tenure results from different individual propensities to

rGmain with an employer, inclusion of tenure in the regressions       C~" hn   viewed

as a means of controlling for individual differences and thus for effects

of union selectivity of more stable workers.

     The calculations confirm the significant effect of unionism on the

attachment of workers to firms found in tables 2 and 3.      In the
older male NLS, the coefficient for unionism is highly significant, -.81

with tenure   ~{cluded   and -.63 with it included.   By co?trast, the effect

of In wages on separations is insignificant and positive, contrary to

expectations.   In the Michigan PSID (columns 3 and 4) unionism is estimated

to reduce separations with a logistic coefficient of -.41 (tenure excluded)

and -.33 (tenure included).      This compares to comparable effects on tenure

of .31 from the loglinear calculations in table 2.       The wage variable is

also estimated to have a sizeable effect, also with a magnitude comparable to

that obtained in table 2.

Finally, in the younger male NLS computations unionism is also found to reduce

the probability of separating, while In wages and the demographic factors

have comparable effects to those given in table 2.

     All told the separation results appear roughly consistent with the

tenure results presented earlier.


Quits versus layoffs and discharges

      The analysis thus far has examined the effect of unions on overall

 separations, without differentiating between employer-initiated and worker-

 initiated breaks in employment.    Do unions reduce separations by lowering

 quits or by affecting discharges and permanent layoffs?

      Table 4 presents calculations designed to answer this important question.
 It records the resu1t~ of maximum likelihood estimates of the effect of

 unionism and other variables on quits and other separations         separately.

Columns 1-2 give the estimated coefficients on the two forms of -separation

 in the NLS.   Columns 3-4 present the results of similar calculations for

 the Michigan PSID for the period 1972-73.      Significant differences in the

union impact are apparent in both data sets.          Unionism reduces quits

 substantially but has essentially no effect or a modest positive effect

on other separations.    We conclude that the union impact on tenure operates

 through workers' decisions rather than through the decisions of employers.



 Selectivity vs. behavior

      The analysis thus far has shown that unionism raises tenure and reduces
 separations and that these effects are not due to union monopoly wage gains

 nor to lower employer-initiated separations but rather to reductions          in quit

 rates.   Is the reduction in quits, with     wage~   held fixed, due to selectivity

 of more stable persons by unions or is it due to actual changes in behavior

 caused by the institution?

      To analyze this question, I have estimated the         fixed effects1ogis-

a The mean of quits in the Old Hen NLS was smaller than the mean of other separations
  because many quitters did not have other jobs by 1971. While not reported as retiring
  they may in fact have left the labor force.

Since with individual constants in the equations, the behavior of persons

who remain in their job over the whole period or who quit in each period is

explained entirely by the constant, the sanp1e drops from that used in

table 2 to 1232 cases, consisting of 877 cases of a single quit, 276 cases

of 2 quits, 67 cases of 3 quits, and 12 cases of 4 quits.

      The results of the calculations, given below, yield coefficients on

unionism of comparable magnitude to those obtained earlier.       This implies that

essentia1J.y none of the estimated impact of unionism on quits is due to

selec tiv ity:

      The union impact appears to operate by changing the behavior of the

same person rather than by organization of innately more stable persons.

In an organized work place a given individual is less likely to quit than

in a nonorganized work place, wages held fixed.

      Note, moreover, that while the coefficient on unionism is essentially

unaffected by correcting for the omitted person factor, the coefficient

on wages is significantly affected by the   correctio~going      from significant

negative to insignificant positive.   The differential effect of the

individual constants on the union and wage coefficients may reflect the

fact that wages are more person related than unionism, which is      m~ch

more of a social phenomenon.



IV.   Routes of the Union Effect

      The preceding analysis has yielded two basic findings:      1) Unionized
                                                                    32


workers accrue greater tenure with employers than nonunion workers.       2) The

greater tenure is not primarily the result of union wage gains, reduced employer-

initiated layoffs or discharges nor of   unioni~ation   of innately more stable

workers.     While it is tempting to attribute the unexplained union effect to the

'voice' and industrial jurisprudence components of unionism, the analysis has

thus far proceeded by eliminating causal factors and has not provided any

positive evidence of their impact on tenure, making any such attribution

speculative.

     This section seeks to provide some evidence that tenure is, in fact,

positively influenced by the voice/industrial jurisprudence aspects of

unionism.     It examines the effect on job tenure of two union institutions,

grievance/arbitration and seniority rules.     Two types of evidence are

evaluated:     regressions linking differences in grievance/arbitration

systeTI!s and seniority across unionized markets to the tenure of union

workers; and information from personnel studies and industrial relations

experts.     While by no means definitive, the evidence suggests that grievance/

arbitration and inverse seniority layoff rules contribute significantly to

the union-tenure relation.



Grievance/arbitration and seniority

     Table 6 presents evidence on the prevalence and characteristics of the

 two components of unionism to be studied.    Lines land 2 record the

 percentage of major collective bargaining contracts and the percentage of

 workers covered by those contracts having various types of grievance or
arbitration clauses.     Lines 3-5 record similar information regarding

seniority rules.

     Line 1 shows that while nearly,all major contracts provide for

grievance of disputes regardine the terms and application of the contract
                                                                         33

there is significant variation in the breadth of grievance clauses, with some

grievance clauses aLlowing for unrestricted coverage of issues while others

have grievance clauses that limit the grievance process to disputes

arising under specific contract clauses.       A somewhat larger number of

contracts and workers fall into the category of restricted grievance clauses.

Information (not recorded in the table) on the distribution of the two

types of clauses by industry shows, further, considerable industry variation,

with   ~ome   industries having primarily unrestricted clauses (chemicals, paper)

and other industries having largely restricted clauses (petroleum, fabricated

metals) .17

       Line 2 of the   tabl~   shows that arbitration systems are also highly
prevalent among unionized firms, with 96.1 percent of contract containing

clauses providing for arbitration, 69.9% of which      COVEr   all grievable issues.

       Seniority rules, consisting of competitive seniority, which governs

the status of workers relative to others in layoffs, promotions, and related'

internal labor market decisions, and of benefit seniority, which relates

benefits to length of services, are also COlIU11on in the organized sector,

especially in manufacturing (line 3).       Competitive seniority is especailly

important in layoff decisions, with over 96% of major collective contracts

in manufacturing having provisions for layoff by seniority and 70% of

major contracts outside of manufacturing also having such provisions (line 4).

Most of the clauses make seniority the sole or primary factor in layoffs,

usually with plantwide or subdivision scope.

       Line 5 shows that seniority ·is a formal factor in promotion

decisionsin about 60% of major contracts, covering nearly 60% of workers,

largely in manufacturing.        Seniority provisions for promotion can be

roughly.divided into two types:

       (a)    "Strong" seniority clauses, which guarantee the senior worker the

promotion if he or she is capable of meeting minim~m or average standards for
                                                                                  34

the work.   As an example of this form of contract, consider the following

clause:

          Job vacancies shall be filled on the basis of seniority,
     providing the employee has the physical fitness, knowledge,
     skill, and efficiency to perform the job." (American Can Co.-
     Glass Bottle Blowers, contrac·t ending April 1968).

     (b)    "\\eak" seniority clauses, which give the job to the St,nior
worker only if other qualifying factors are relatively the same, as

exemplifiec in the following:

          When there is an opening to be filled by promotion,
     employees in that division shall be considered on the basis
     of their seniority and job qualifications. When job qualifi-
     cations are approximately equal, then the employees with the
     greatest seniority shall be given the opportunity. Only in
     the evettan employee with less seniority has superior job
     qualificaUons shall he be entitled to the promotion. (Cater-
     pillar Tractor Co.-lAM, contract ending Jan. 1968).

     According to data in line 5, the weaker seniority clauses

cover many more workers than the stronger clauses, though the actual differ-

ence between their application is by no means clear.     In many arbitration

cases, less    senior workers must often be "head and shoulder" above more

senior workers to obtain a promotion even under the weaker provision.

     Line 6 of the table presents some contract evidence on benefit

seniority •. It records the percentage of workers with different levels

of seniDrity eligible for a vacation period of 3 or more weeks.      The

fraction rises sharply, particularly between 5 and 10 years of seniority,

indicating the dependence of this benefit on job tenure.      Nonunion companies

also tend to relate benefits to seniority.

     The grievance and seniority clauses examined in table 6 differ across
less aggregate industries as well as between manufacturing and nonmanufacturing

as shown in the table.    These differences provide a means of examining the

effect of these factors on job tenure.     If unionism increases tenure by

providing grievance systems or seniority rules, organized workers in sectors

where grievance or seniority clauses are stronger should accrue

greater tenure than organized workers in other sectors.      To test. this
                                                                        36 .

proposition, I added the following measures of the prevalence of grievance

and seniority clacses in two-digit manufacturing and one-digit nonmanufacturing

industries to the older male NLS and to the Michigan PSID tapes:

     (1)   The percentage of contracts in an industry with unrestricted

coverage of issues in the grievance system

     (2)     The percentage of contracts in an industry with seniority clauses.

     (3)     The percentage of contracts which contain clauses governing

layoffs (presumably relating to the role of seniority in layoffs).

     These   variabl~s   were obtained for 2-digit manufacturing and I-digit

nonmanufacturing industries from the Collective Bargaining Agreements

Series of the B.L.S, as specified in the table notes.

     Linear tenure equations for union workers were then estimated, with the

new variables replacing the industry dummies used in previous calculations.

To make sure that the calculations were not unduly influenced by the

construction industry, which for technological reasons has high turnover

and only limited use of grievance or seniority provisions, construction

was deleted from the sample:      its inclusion greatly strengthens the estimated

impact of the contract variables.      Because there are numerous other clauses

that differ across industries, the regressions should not be interpreted to

mean that addition of a particular clause will, in fact, alter attachment

by the amount specified by the coefficient.      The variables are merely

indicators of practices.

     Table 7 presents the coefficients on the contract variables.         While

crude, the estimates suggest that the selected rules and operating procedures

influence the attachment between workers and firms.       The coefficients in

columns 1-3 for the older male NLS sample show     tha~   introduced

separately, each of the provisions is positively statistically significantly

associated with tenure.     The estimates in column 4 show that when entered

as a group, grievance and layoff provisions have very      siz~able    and significant

effects, while the coefficient on seniority drops to insignificance.           The

Michigan PSID results   ~n   columns 5-8 are roughly comparable, with one

exception:    the percentage of contracts with nonrestrictive grievance
clauses has, by itself, an insignificant impact on tenure..     In conjunction

with the other variables, however, it obtains a substantial positive

coefficient, indicating that the scope of the grievance system is related

to accumulation of tenure.      As far as these data go, the rules of

structured labor markets appear to be important detenminantsof the

    .
attachment
       ,
           between workers and firms.

     Limited information from other sources provides additional support

for the view that the grievance system is an important route by which

unionism increases years of tenure.      First, there is direct evidence of a

link between the existence of a grievance system and attachment of workers

to firms from a personnel study by Sargent and Clauson, who compared

turnover in hospitals with a written grievance system to turnover in

hospitals without such a system.      Their data show a year separation rate

of .50 for hospitals with a grievance system compared to .81 for those

without and a correlation between the 0-1 grievance variable and turnover

of -.72.     While absence of other control variables, notably wages, makes

these relations suggestive rather than definitive, the significant relation

between turnover and grievance procedure supports our interpretation of

the evidence on the tapes for individuals.

     The industrial     relations literature provides further support for the

argument that a grievance system reduces separations and raises job tenure.

In a leading book on grievances, one arbitrator noted that because "in most

nonorganized companies it is very difficult to appeal a supervisor's

decision [due to lack of grievance machinery] • • • dissatisfied employees

must either live with their frustrations or quit (Trotta, p. 105), !fIle latter

option reducing tenure in those firms.      Labor-management legal

consultants usually advise companies facing unionization drives to concentrate

on personnel policy issues relating to what would often be grievable issues

in a union setting, suggesting that resolution of such problems is viewed

as a major attraction of unions to workers.    Similarly, studies of why

workers join unions tend to find worker grievances with specific managerial

policies a major factor in organizat ion (Seidman, Landon, Karsh).
     We conclude that the available evidence, while sparse, supports the

notion that unionism increases job tenure through the "voice" and industrial

jurisprudence routes of impact.



v.   Conclusion

      This study has examined the effect of unionism on one of the most

important determinants of the labor market status of individuals, job

tenure, defined as the length of attachment between workers and firms.

The analysis has found that:

      (1)   The U.S. work force has accrued considerable job tenure, with

average incomplete spells across the whole work force of about 8 years

but with much higher levels for older men.    Upwards of 25% of the
work force and 60% of older male workers have accrued 10 or more years of

(incomplete) tenure with a firm.   The principal reason for breaks in tenure

are worker-initiated changes in the form of quits, which are 2-3 times as

important as layoffs and other employer-initiated changes.

      (2)   Trade unionism is associated with significantly greater job

tenure and conversely with significantly lower probabilities of separation.

      (3)   The increase in worker attachment to firms resulting from unionism

is not due largely to monopoly wage increases nor to reductions in emp1oyer-

initiated separations nor to unionization of more stable workers bur rather to

changes in worker behavior due to union work settings.

      (4)   While difficult to pin down, some of the union effect on tenure
                                                                  40


appears due to grievance systems and specific work rules like seniority,

which reflect in part the role. of unionism as an institution of "voice" in

the job market.    To some extent at least increased tenure due to the   voi~e   and

industrial jurisprudence mode. of operation should be vie\ved as socially

beneficial, reducing the costs of turnover and thus raising productivity.

     These findings have important implications for understanding the

economics of trade unions and for the direction of research on unions.

They suggest that unions have sizeable non-monopoly wage effects on the

job market which should be taken into account in any social evaluation of

the institution.   They provide some support for the traditional industrial

relations view of unionism as a complex institution which causes wide-

ranging changes in the job market.   They suggest that modern empirical

research on trade unionism, which currently focuses almost exclusively

on estimating monopoly wage effects, should also analyze the non-monopoly

wage voice or industrial jurisprudence impacts of unions.   Unions have

monopoly wage effects but they also have more subtle, potentially

socially beneficial economic effects on the job market that deserve attention.

lIn this study tenure relates to years of employment with a particular firm.

 It does not refer to academic tenure.

2pencavel and Browq-Medoff report significant coefficients on unionism in

 quit equatioris while Parsons and Burton and Parker do not.    Stoikov and

 Raimon find different union effects depending on the other tneure variables

 included in their calculations.     For a general assessment stressing the

 inconclusive nature of the results see Reynolds (p. 568). For an opposite

 one see Freeman (1979).

3For delays in quits to raise tenure there must be some nonzero probability of

 redressing the grievance, so that the worker is willing to try the option and

 the length of employment must be finite, for otherwise delays will not affect

 the steady state solution.   If, on average, the length of employment were

 initially, say 10 years, then a delay in quitting for, say 1/2 year,

would reduce the quit rate from 10% to about 9 1/2%, raising tenure to 10.5

 years in a steady state equilibrium.

4The complexity of some of the tenure equations can be seen in Mann, Shafer,

 and Singpurwaller.

5The equation linking the distribution of incomplete spells to the distribution

 of completed spells is given in Feller (p. 370).

 PSID data set.

     An alternative to the fixed effects model would be a random effects model in

     which the person effects would be treated as random variables rather than as

     constants.     Such a model would provide a weaker test of the selectivity argument.
