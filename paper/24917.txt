                                          ABSTRACT

Artificial intelligence (AI) is surpassing human performance in a growing number of domains.
However, there is limited evidence of its economic effects. Using data from a digital platform, we
study a key application of AI: machine translation. We find that the introduction of a machine
translation system has significantly increased international trade on this platform, increasing
exports by 17.5%. Furthermore, heterogeneous treatment effects are all consistent with a
substantial reduction in translation-related search costs. Our results provide causal evidence that
language barriers significantly hinder trade and that AI has already begun to improve economic
efficiency in at least one domain.

1     Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most important technological advances of our era.
Recent progress of AI and, in particular, machine learning (ML), has dramatically increased
predictive power in many areas such as speech recognition, image recognition, and credit
scoring (Agrawal et al. (2016), Brynjolfsson and Mitchell (2017), Mullainathan and Spiess
(2017)). Unlike the last generation of information technology that required humans to codify
tasks explicitly, ML is designed to learn the patterns automatically from examples (Bryn-
jolfsson and Mitchell (2017)). This has opened a broad new frontier of applications and
economic implications that are, as yet, largely undeveloped. AI has been called a general-
purpose technology, like the steam engine and electricity, whose capabilities span beyond
specific applications. If this is true, then AI should ultimately lead to fundamental changes
in work, trade and the economy.
    Nonetheless, empirical evidence documenting concrete economic effects of using AI is
largely lacking. In particular, contributions from AI have not been found in measures of
aggregate productivity. Brynjolfsson et al. (2017) argue that the most plausible reason for
the gap between expectations and statistics is due to lags in complementary innovations and
business procedure reorganization. If the gap is indeed due to lagged complementary inno-
vation, the best domains to empirically assess AI impacts are settings where AI applications
can be seamlessly embedded in an existing production function because complementary in-
novations are already in place. In particular, various digital platforms are at the forefront of
AI adoption, providing ideal opportunities for early assessments of AI’s economic effects.
    In this paper, we provide evidence of direct causal links between AI adoption and eco-
nomic activities by analyzing the effect of the introduction of eBay Machine Translation
(eMT) on eBay’s international trade. As a platform, eBay mediated more than 14 billion
dollars of global trade among more than 200 countries in 2014. The focal AI technology,
eMT (from here on also referred to as the policy), is an in-house machine learning system
that statistically learns how to translate among different languages. We exploit the discrete
introduction of the policy for several language pairs, most notably English-Spanish, as a
natural experiment, and study its consequences on U.S. exports on eBay via a difference-


                                               1
in-difference (DiD) estimation strategy. The identification compares the post-policy change
in U.S. exports for the treated countries with that of the control countries (i.e., all other
countries that U.S. sellers export to on eBay). For instance, we find that eMT increases U.S.
exports to Spanish-speaking Latin American countries by 17.5%-20.9% on eBay, depending
on the length of the pre- and post-policy time windows we evaluate. To mitigate potential
spillover effects, we also use a second control group: offline U.S. exports to the same set of
countries treated with eMT, for the DiD estimation. The results are similar, and the com-
parisons of the policy with either of the two control groups are statistically indistinguishable
from each other. In the online appendix, we use U.S. exports to Brazil as a third control
group, and also study the two rollouts of eMT in the EU. In each case, the results remain
qualitatively unchanged.
   Furthermore, we study heterogeneous treatment effects of the policy across different types
of products and consumers. We find that the effect of eMT is more pronounced for:
   (1) differentiated products,
   (2) products with more words in listing titles,
   (3) cheaper products, and
   (4) less experienced buyers.
   Each of these effects are consistent with a large reduction in translation-related consumer
search costs. Products and buyers with higher search costs experience a greater benefit from
eMT and therefore a larger increase in trade. In the online appendix, we provide a simple
model of the effects of eMT and show the robustness of these heterogeneous treatment
effects by (1) using the export value in dollars as the outcome variable, (2) using different
estimation windows, and (3) repeating all analyses for the cases of EU and Russia. The
results are qualitative very similar.
   Our DiD results and heterogeneous effects, as well as our knowledge of the technology
introduction and application itself, suggest a causal relationship between the introduction
of machine translation and an export increase on eBay. More generally, our results may be
a harbinger of more widespread effects of not only machine translation, but of related types
of AI and ML. As these technologies are adopted and diffuse, we may see comparably large
effects in other applications.

1.1     Related Literature and Contribution

1.1.1   Language Barriers in International Trade

Empirical studies using gravity models, as specified in Anderson and Van Wincoop (2003),
have established the existence of a robust positive correlation between bilateral trade and
reduced language barriers. Typically, researchers regress bilateral trade on a dummy variable
for whether the two countries share the same language, and find that this coefficient is
strongly positive (e.g., Melitz (2008), Egger and Lassmann (2012), and Melitz and Toubal
(2014)). However, these cross-sectional regressions are vulnerable to endogeneity biases. For
example, the fact that two countries share the same official or spoken language may be
correlated with other shared characteristics or relationships that also affect trade, even after
controlling for the usual set of variables in the gravity equation.
   A key contribution of our paper, therefore, is that it exploits a natural experiment on
eBay to identify the effect of changing language barriers on international trade. The online
marketplace provides us with a uniquely-powerful laboratory to study the consequences on
bilateral trade after an exogenous decrease in language barriers. Our finding that even a
moderate quality upgrade of machine translation could increase export by 17% to 20% is
consistent with Lohmann (2011) and Molnar (2013), who argue that language barriers may
be far more trade-hindering than suggested by previous literature.


1.1.2   AI, Productivity, and Economic Welfare

The current generation of AI represents a revolution of prediction capabilities (e.g., Agrawal
et al. (2016) and Mullainathan and Spiess (2017)). The recent exploding growth in predic-
tion has been enabled by enormously increased data, significantly improved algorithms, and
substantially more powerful computer hardware over the past few years (Brynjolfsson and
McAfee (2017)).
   There has a been a recent surge in interest in artificial intelligence, especially the sub-
field of machine learning, with significant increases in AI-related papers published, course
enrollments, start-ups, start-up funding, and job openings, according to data collected by




                                               3
                  1
the AI Index.         These are in large part driven by recent breakthroughs in ML, especially
supervised learning systems using deep neural networks, which have made possible substan-
tial improvements in many technical capabilities. For instance, when benchmarked against
a large data set of images (Imagenet), the best machine vision systems had an error rate of
28.5% in 2010 and now have an error rate of less than 2.5%, surpassing human error rates
that are about 5% on the same data set. Similarly, the best speech recognition systems im-
proved from over 15% error rates in 2011 to 5% error rates in 2017, and are now comparable
to human error rates. Recently, machines have also surpassed humans at tasks as diverse
as playing the game Go (Silver et al. (2016)) and recognizing cancer from medical images
(Esteva et al. (2017)). There is active work converting these breakthroughs into practical
applications such as self-driving cars, substitutes for human-powered call-centers, and new
roles for radiologists and pathologists, but the complementary innovations required are often
costly and time-consuming (Brynjolfsson et al. (2017)).
      Machine translation has also experienced significant improvement due to advances in
machine learning. For instance, the best score at the Workshop on Machine Translation
for translating English to German improved from 15.7 to 28.3 according to a widely-used
comparison metric (the BLEU score).2 Much of the recent progress in MT has been a
shift from symbolic approaches towards statistical and deep neural network approaches. For
our study, an important characteristic of eMT is that replacing human translators with
MT or upgrading MT is typically relatively seamless. For instance, for product listings
and descriptions on eBay, users simply consume the output of the translation system, but
otherwise need not change their buying or selling process. While they care about the quality
of the translation, it makes no difference whether the translation was produced by a human
or machine. Thus, adoption of MT can be very fast and its economic effects, especially on
digital platforms, can be seen quickly. While so far much of the work on the economic effects
of AI has been theoretical (Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018), Aghion et al. (2017), Korinek and
Stiglitz (2017), Sachs and Kotlikoff (2012)), and notably Goldfarb and Trefler (2018) in the
case of global trade, the introduction of improved MT on eBay gives us an early opportunity

to assess the economic effects of AI using a plausible natural experiment.


1.1.3    Peer-to-Peer Platforms and Matching Frictions

Einav et al. (2016) and Goldfarb and Tucker (2017) provide great surveys on how digital
technology has reduced matching frictions and improved market efficiency. Reduced match-
ing frictions affect price dispersion, as evidenced in Brynjolfsson and Smith (2000), Brown
and Goolsbee (2002), Overby and Forman (2014), Ghose and Yao (2011), and Cavallo (2017).
These reduced frictions also mitigate geographic inequality in economic activities in the case
of ride-sharing platforms (Lam and Liu (2017) and Liu et al. (2017)), short-term lodging plat-
forms (Farronato and Fradkin (2018)), crowd-funding platforms (Catalini and Hui (2017)),
and e-commerce platforms (Blum and Goldfarb (2006), Lendle et al. (2016), Fan et al. (2016),
and Hui (2018)). We contribute to this literature by documenting the significant matching
friction between consumers and sellers who speak different languages. Specifically, we find
that efforts to remove language barriers provide substantial increases to market efficiency as
well as platform profit.



2       eBay Machine Translation
The primary goal of eMT is to support international trade by making it easier for buyers
to search for and understand the features of items that are not listed in their language. In
a nutshell, eMT uses statistical models for phrase-to-phrase translations. These machine
learning models are trained on both eBay data and other data automatically scraped from
the Web to learn translation statistically. Some hand-crafted rules are applied, such as
preserving named entities (e.g. numbers and product brands), so that eMT is more suited for
the existing eBay environment. eBay also developed systems for post-editing of the outputs
by human language experts, also known as machine-assisted human translation (MAHT),
which further improved the translation quality. eMT is optimized to work in real-time,
yielding high-quality translations within milliseconds.
    In 2014, eBay rolled out eMT in three regions in different months: Russia (January),
Latin America (May), and the European Union (July). In our main analyses we focus on


                                              5
          Figure 1: Example of eBay Machine Translation in Search Results Page

the rollout in Latin America, because it is the first rollout of eMT that is not contaminated
by major political events.3 In the appendix, we also analyze the rollouts of eMT in the EU
and Russia as robustness checks.
   To shop on eBay, buyers in Latin America visit www.ebay.com, because there are no
local eBay sites in these countries. eBay recognizes their IP addresses as being from Latin
America, and the website is automatically localized by translating all its pages to buyers’
local language. Note that this part was not affected by eMT, as the translations of the
website pages, such as the translations of different product categories, buying formats, and
advertisements, are fixed and not translated by eMT. Instead, eMT translates buyers’ search
queries and item titles. In particular, when buyers type in keywords in Spanish in the search
box, eMT quickly translates that Spanish query into English and retrieves listings in the
   3
     The rollout in Russia was followed immediately by Russia’s annexation of Crimea, which prompted
international sanctions, and therefore changes in exports in that case could be confounded by political
factors.


                                                  6
search results page based on the matching relevance between the translated query and listing
titles in English. Given the set of listings in the search results page, the second task of eMT
is to translate into and show these titles in Spanish. As a result, buyers from Latin America
have a localized experience because it is as if they visited a website in Spanish, searched in
Spanish, and the engine returned search results with Spanish titles. Figure 1 provides an
example of eMT where an item title is translated from English into Spanish.4
        Prior to eMT, eBay used Bing Translator for query search translation and item title
translation. Therefore, the policy treatment here is an improvement in translation quality,
which is measured by the human acceptance rate (HAR). eBay selected the top 500 most
frequent queries, gave the translation results by eMT and by Bing to three experts in lin-
guistics, and asked for their binary judgment of whether a translation is correct.5 eBay then
computed HAR values using majority votes (share of query translations that received at least
two affirmative votes). Using this metric, the HAR for eMT was 91.4% while for Bing it was
84.4%. Thus, we consider eMT to be a moderate quality upgrade over Bing Translator.



3         Data and Empirical Strategy
This paper uses administrative data from eBay. The data include detailed listing attributes,
product characteristics, buyer history, seller history, and reputation and feedback. We re-
strict the reporting of summary statistics to comply with eBay’s data policy. The offline
data of monthly bilateral exports among countries come from the UN Comtrade Database.
        To estimate the effect of eMT, we adopt the difference-in-difference (DiD) estimation in
the following format:


                           log(Yct ) = βTc × P ostt + XRct + ηc + ξt + ct ,                        (1)


where Yct is the export to country c at time t; Tc is the dummy for whether importing country

     The screenshot is an example of eMT between English and Spanish in the EU, which we found in an old
internal document on eBay. Unfortunately, we could not find a screenshot for eMT in Latin America.
   5
     For example, for the query “ropa femenina”, eMT returned “women’s clothing” while Bing returned
“clothes female”. Similarly, for the query “celulares”, eMT returned “cell phones” while Bing returned
“cellular”. In both cases, eMT received unanimous affirmative votes and Bing received negative votes.



                                                   7
c is in the treatment group (i.e., Spanish-speaking Latin American countries); P ostt is the
dummy for the introduction of eMT; XRct is the average daily bilateral exchange rate in
month t; ηc are importing country fixed effects; and ξt are month fixed effects. The coefficient
β represents the average treatment effect of eMT across all treated countries. Note that we
only index importing countries c, because U.S. is the only exporter in our main analyses.
Throughout the analyses, the standard errors are clustered at the country level to account
for serial correlations of imports from the U.S. for each country.
       The identification of the policy effect comes from comparing the intertemporal change in
exports in the treatment group (countries that become eligible for eMT) against the baseline
intertemporal change in exports in the control group (countries that remain ineligible for
eMT). The DiD methodology allows us to control for two types of unobservables: (1) time-
invariant country-specific trade propensities (e.g., U.S. exports to Canada are differ from
exports to Peru) and (2) time-specific trade propensities that are the same across countries
(e.g., exports are different in holiday seasons than in non-holiday seasons).6
       Note that the DiD methodology does not control for serially-correlated unobservable
errors. For the unbiasedness of the DiD estimator, we assume that these errors do not
simultaneously correlate with both Yct and Tct . In other words, eBay does not roll out eMT
in countries with certain trade propensities. To indirectly test for this assumption, we plot
the average monthly exports to the treated and non-treated countries in the 12 months before
and after the introduction of eMT, and find that the parallel trend assumption is likely to
hold. We return to this point in more detail in Section 4.1 and provide additional robustness
checks when we assess a set of heterogeneous treatment effects. In addition, we follow Autor
(2003) and perform leads–lags analyses, where the test results further strengthen the parallel
trend assumption. Details of the test are provided in Appendix A.
       The second identification assumption that we make is that the control group remained
valid after the introduction of eMT. This assumption would be violated if U.S. exports have
limited capacity at the aggregate level or, equivalently, the spillover effect of exports across
   6
     Note that our results are also robust to the inclusion of country-specific monthly trends. However,
Borusyak and Jaravel (2016) recommend not to include unit-specific time trends in any difference-in-
difference specifications because this exacerbates the bias of OLS for short-run impact (see Section 5.1.2. in
their paper for details).



                                                      8
countries is large. Imagine a scenario where the increase in U.S. exports to Mexico comes
partially from a decrease in U.S. exports to China due to substitution. A comparison of
exports to these two countries will over-estimate the policy effect because U.S. exports to
China would have been higher had eMT not been introduced.
    To mitigate this concern, we also use a different control group, which is the overall U.S.
exports (online and offline) to the treated countries during the same period. Hui (2018) has
estimated that eBay accounts for 1.38% of total U.S. exports in categories of products that
are sold on eBay. Therefore, export on eBay is not large enough to alter the overall U.S.
export pattern, making the second control group less subject to spillover effects.



4     Results
We first estimate the effect of eMT on U.S. exports to the treated countries. Next, motivated
by a simple theoretical framework in Appendix A, we study how this effect differs along the
following dimensions: (1) homogeneous versus differentiated products, (2) expensive versus
inexpensive products, (3) listings with a different number of words in the title, and (4)
different levels of buyer experience on eBay.


4.1    Overall Policy Effect

Before we perform the DiD estimation, we plot average monthly U.S. exports on eBay for
the treated and non-treated countries. In Figure 2a, we plot the normalized U.S. exports,
measured in quantity, to Latin American countries and to other countries. The dashed and
dot-dashed vertical lines refer to the introduction of query translation in May 2014 and item
title translation in July 2014, respectively. Export quantities are normalized relative to the
level in April 2013 (one month before query translation was introduced). Figure 2a suggests
that the pre-trend assumption holds in the year before the policy change, and the policy
promotes U.S. exports to Latin America in the year after its introduction.
    To account for potential spillover effects, we plot a similar graph in Figure 2b but this
time using offline U.S. exports to Latin America as a separate control group. Exports are
measured only in U.S. dollars because data on offline export quantities are unavailable. We

translations, respectively.


adopt the same normalization rule as seen in Figure 2a. Figure 2b suggests that the validity
of the pre-trend assumption using this control group holds as well.
      We apply equation (1) to estimate the policy effect. In Table 1, we estimate the equation
using data from +/- 6 months and +/- 12 months around the policy change for both control
groups.7 When we use the control group on eBay, our results show that the introduction of
eMT increases U.S. exports on eBay to Latin America by 17.5%–20.9%.
      In columns (3) and (4), we use the logarithm of export values in dollars as the dependent
variable, and we see that the estimated effects are now 13.1% and 17%. While significantly
different from zero, the effect on value is smaller than the effect on quantity. This reflects
a small decrease in the average selling prices of U.S. exports (that we observe in the data),
possibly due to higher competition among U.S. exporters. Our results suggest that consumers
benefit from eMT more than sellers do, at least during the period we examine, because
consumers gain both from reduced language frictions and also from lower prices.
      Finally, in columns (5) and (6), we use the offline control group, and the estimated

      Since U.S. exports to different countries are never zero, the logarithms of exports are always defined.

size of the policy effect is 11.8%–13.3%. These two estimates are not significantly different
from those in columns (3) and (4), suggesting the control group of eBay U.S. exports to
non-treated countries is valid.
   One concern is that eBay may have advertised more to Latin American consumers after
the introduction of eMT. To mitigate this concern, we study how the number of new regis-
tered buyers changed in Latin America relative to that in non-Latin American countries and
Brazil. The results in the online appendix show no statically significant difference between
the treatment and control groups, suggesting that the increased sales do not simply come
from more intense advertising.
   In the analyses that follow, we report the results on export quantity based on control
group 1 and data from +/-6 months around the policy change. We focus on changes in
export quantity to purge away eMT’s effect on price, because we are mainly interested in its
effect on exporting activities. Additionally, using control group 1 allows us to exploit eBay’s
rich data to understand the heterogeneous effects of the policy. Lastly, using a narrower
window reduces other contemporaneous factors that potentially contaminate the estimates.
In the online appendix, we also report the estimation results based on export revenue and
different window lengths.

4.2    Different Products

Since eMT reduces translation-related search costs, Proposition 1 in Appendix A states that
the increase in exports should be proportionately larger for products that had larger search
costs before the policy change than for other products. We divide products into two cat-
egories: homogeneous products (e.g., cellphones and books, which are mass produced and
have standard identifiers) and differentiated products (e.g. antiques and clothing which have
more variation in product attributes). Translation-related search costs should be higher for
differentiated products because of higher language requirements (and hence higher transla-
tion costs) of translating the specifics of these products into local languages.
   We distinguish homogeneous products from differentiated products on eBay by identifying
whether a product is assigned a “Product ID” on eBay. These Product IDs are the most fine-
grained catalogs on eBay and are defined mainly for homogeneous products. For instance,
an “Apple iPhone 8–256 GB–Space Gray–AT&T-GSM” has a unique Product ID that is
different from that of an iPhone of a different generation, a different color, internal memory,
or carrier. For books or CDs, these Product IDs are ISBN codes. On the other hand,
Product IDs are rarely defined for products such as fashion products, clothing, art, and
jewelry, because these products have many variations and are often unique.

                           Figure 3: Export Increase by Categories
Notes: We use data from six months before and after the introduction of the eMT to estimate
the policy effect on exports for each meta-category on eBay according to specification (1). The
rectangles indicate estimated coefficients and the bars represent 95% confidence interval of these
estimates.


   In the left panel of Table 2, we repeat our DiD regression for the two types of products
using exports that are aggregated at the country–product type–month level. We control
for product type fixed effects in addition to the controls in specification (1). The results
show that, consistent with the theory prediction, the export increase for homogeneous prod-
ucts is smaller than that for differentiated products, and the 6.2% difference is statistically
significant.
   To further test this heterogeneity, we estimate the policy effect for each of the 36 meta-
categories, a mega-category being the highest-level catalog inclusive of all items listed on
eBay. The estimates are represented using horizontal bars in Figure 3, and the intervals
are the 95% confidence interval around the estimates. A visual inspection of the results is
consistent with our theory that the export increase is larger for categories that have more
variation in product attributes (e.g., Specialty Services, Coins & Paper Money, Dolls &

               Figure 4: Export Increase by Number of Words in Listing Titles
Notes: We use data from six months before and after the introduction of the eMT to estimate the
policy effect on exports for listings with different number of words in the titles (split regressions for
different word counts in the left graph and a pooled regression with interaction terms with dummies
for different word counts in the right graph. The rectangles indicate estimated coefficients and the
bars represent 95% confidence interval of these estimates. The x-axis is capped at ‘20+’ which
includes listings with 20 or more words in the titles.


Bears).
   To formalize these observations in regressions, we label meta-categories by their degree
of “catalogization”, which is measured as the share of listed items with Product IDs on
www.ebay.com in 2014. For example, suppose there are 100 listings in both Video Games
& Consoles and Coins & Paper Money categories; in Video Games & Consoles 50 of these
listings have been assigned Product IDs, while in Coins & Paper Money only 5 listings have
Product IDs. Therefore, the degree of catalogization is 50% and 5%, respectively. We then
divide all the meta-categories into four quartiles based on this measure, and interact these
dummies with the treatment dummies. The estimates in the right panel of Table 2 show
that export increase decreases with the degree of catalogization. In particular, the export
increase of the bottom quartile of catalogization (i.e., the most differentiated products) is
11.1% greater than that of the top quartile (i.e., the most homogeneous products).
   Next, we hypothesize that the export increase is larger for listings with more words in
their item titles, because translation-related search costs should generally increase with the
number of words. Figure 4 plots the policy effects for listings with a different number of

words in listing titles. On the right side, we compare the policy effect relative to that of
listings with at least 20 words in their titles. We see that items with fewer than 13 words
in their titles experienced 6%–10% smaller export growth, and that change is statistically
significant at the 5% level for most cases. To formalize the findings in this figure, we perform
the DiD regression using specification (1) and interact the treatment effect with 20 dummies
for a different number of words in titles. The left panel in Table 3 indicates that the export
increase is 1.3% larger for products with an additional word in the listing titles.
   Lastly, we explore how the policy effect differs by product value. Proposition 2 in Ap-
pendix A predicts a larger increase in export for cheaper items, because the search cost as a
fraction of item value is higher for these items. To test this hypothesis, we divide items into
four value bins: [0, $10), [$10, $50), [$50, $200), and $200 and above. Following Einav et al.
(2015) and Hui et al. (2017), product value is defined as the average Buy It Now price in the
6 months preceding the policy change. In the right panel of Table 3, we see that products
with $50 or less value have experienced a 19.3% increase in exports, and the increase is about
5.6% smaller for more expensive items than it is for less expensive items.

4.3       Different Buyer Experience

We have established that the increase in export is higher for products associated with rela-
tively higher translation-related search costs, whether proxied by degree of standardization,
word count or price. According to Proposition 1 in Appendix A, this result should also hold
for buyers with a higher search cost. We do not directly observe buyers’ search costs, but
according to Hui et al. (2016), buyers’ experience on eBay is a good proxy for search cost.
In particular, buyers with low search costs are generally deal-seekers and spend more time
and money on eBay relative to inexperienced buyers. Note that lower search costs, in the
context of language barriers, could mean that these buyers have better knowledge of English
or have used other translation tools and services.
       We define experienced buyers as those who have purchased at least $2,500 worth of items
in the previous year, which roughly corresponds to eBay’s definition. In column (1) of Table
4, we see that the increase in export is 6.1% larger for inexperienced buyers, consistent with
them having higher translation-related search costs than experienced buyers do.
       We can also look at the combined effects of buyer experience and product differentiation.
In columns (2) and (3), we find that the differential response of experienced buyers persists
for both homogeneous and differentiated products, measured by whether items are assigned
a Product ID.8 The persistence of this gap suggests that translation-related search costs vary
   8
    Note that the effect for inexperienced buyers for all products is not exactly a weighted average of
the effects for homogeneous and differentiated products, because the country and month fixed effects have


                                                   16
by buyer types, which is a new margin distinct from product types.



5     Conclusion
In this paper, we exploit a natural experiment on eBay to study the effect of an AI-based
machine translation tool on international trade. We show that a moderate quality upgrade
increases exports on eBay by 17.5%. The increase in exports is larger for differentiated
products, cheaper products, listings with more words in their title. Machine translation
also causes a greater increase in exports to less experienced buyers. These heterogeneous
treatment effects are consistent with a reduction in translation-related search costs, which
comes from two sources: (1) an increased matching relevance due to improved accuracy of
the search query translation and (2) better translation quality of the listing title in buyers’
language.
    Our results have two main implications.
    First, language barriers have greatly hindered trade. This is true even for digital platforms
where trade frictions are already smaller than they are offline. In our study, the quality
upgrade in machine translation is moderate–a 7% increase in human acceptance rate–yet
this upgrade generated an export increase of 17.5% in quantity and 13.1% in revenue. To
put our result in context, Hui (2018) has estimated that a removal of export administrative
and logistic costs increased export revenue on eBay by 12.3% in 2013, which is similar to
the effect of eMT. Additionally, Lendle et al. (2016) have estimated that a 10% reduction in
distance would increase trade revenue by 3.51% on eBay. This means that the introduction
of eMT is equivalent of the export increase from reducing distances between countries by
37.3%. These comparisons suggest that the trade-hindering effect of language barriers is of
first-order importance. Machine translation has made the world significantly smaller and
more connected.
    Second, AI is already affecting productivity and trade and has significant potential to
increase it further. Besides machine translation, AI applications are also emerging in other
different meanings across the three columns. In order to get an exact weighted average, one would control
for a “Homogeneous” dummy and its interaction with all existing variables in column (1).

                    A . A Simple Theoretical Framework

We provide a simple Nash bargaining framework to illustrate the role of eMT. For simplicity,
we model the international markets of a product to be independent of the domestic market of
the product. On the demand side, there is a unit-measure of buyers whose highest willingness
to pay for the product is w, where w > 0. Otherwise buyers differ in the translation-related
search cost s, which follows a continuous distribution F .
      On the supply side, there is a unit-measure of foreign sellers with zero marginal cost of
production, i.e., c = 0. Let buyers’ Nash bargaining power be α, where α ∈ (0, 1). Let the
market competition be such that buyers capture α of their highest willingness to pay and
the price sellers charge, p, is (1 − α)w. Then the number of foreign transactions equals the
share of buyers who choose to purchase from foreign sellers, or P r(w − p − s > 0). Given
             p                                                                αp
that w =    1−α
                ,   the number of foreign transactions can be written as F ( 1−α ).
      We assume eMT reduces translation-related search cost from s to 0 for simplicity. In this
case, all buyers buy from foreign sellers because w > p > 0. Then the increase in number
                                         αp
of international transaction is 1 − F ( 1−α ). Given this, categories with higher search costs
should expect a larger export response when search costs are removed. Conversely, categories
with low search costs should not expect as much of an effect of eMT, because international
trade in these categories were high even before the introduction of the eMT.9 Proposition 1
formalizes these arguments.
Proposition 1 Suppose there are two categories with search cost distributions F and G.
The increase in exports due to eMT is higher for the category with search cost distribution
F if F first-order stochastically dominates G.

Proof. If F first-order stochastically dominates G, then F (x) ≤ G(x) for all x. This implies
              αp             αp
that 1 − F ( 1−α ) ≥ 1 − G( 1−α ).

Next, based on the Nash bargaining framework, the consumer surplus is given by w − p − s =
 α
1−α
    p−s.    Fixing the distribution of search cost F , consumer surplus of the cheaper product is
lower, and therefore buyers were less likely to purchase cheaper product from foreign sellers
  9
   Note that these categories could represent different products, number of words in listing titles, and
buyers.

                                                  22
before the introduction of the eMT. Therefore, the effect of removing s on sales should be
greater for the cheaper product than for the more expensive product. The next proposition
illustrates how the eMT effect differs between cheap and expensive products:

Proposition 2 Suppose there are two products with price p1 and p2 , where p1 < p2 . The
increase in exports due to eMT is higher for the product category with p1 .

                                               αp1             αp2
Proof. Given p1 < p2 , it follows that 1 − F ( 1−α ) ≥ 1 − F ( 1−α ).

   This above theoretical framework leads to a set of testable implications:

   • The export increase due to eMT is larger for categories with higher translation-related
      search costs. In particular,

        – Export increase is larger for differentiated products, because translating the specifics
           of these products requires higher language skills and hence higher translation
           costs.

        – Export increase is larger for products with more words in the listing titles, because
           translation costs should increase in number of words.

        – Export increase is larger for inexperienced buyers on eBay, because these buyers
           spend less time on eBay and have higher search costs.

   • The export increase due to eMT is larger for cheaper products.

                                B . Leads–Lags Analyses

Similar to Autor (2003), we perform leads–lags analyses to test the parallel trend assumption:

                                11
                                X
                  log(Yct ) =           βl Tc × P ostt (t = k + l) + XRct + ηc + ξt + ct ,                   (2)
                                l=−12


where k is the policy introduction month, and βl is the coefficient on the l-th lead or lag.
One test is βl = 0 for l < 0, i.e., there should not be pre-treatment differences between the
treatment and control groups. Moreover, βl for l ≥ 0 might be different if there is temporal
variation in the treatment effect. The data used are the same as in Table 1. We see from
Table 5 that the parallel trend assumptions largely hold for the two control groups except
for the seventh and eighth lags for the offline control. Moreover, the policy effects on U.S.
export augment and become more significant after the third month from the introduction of
eMT.10




  10
     This is due to the supply side, namely that sellers did not increase their international listings, especially
on differentiated products, until after the first three months from the introduction of eMT.

We test for the robustness of our estimates on the impact of eBay Machine Translation
(eMT) on U.S. exports to Latin America on eBay. First, we use U.S. exports to Brazil,
where the main language is Portuguese, as our control group for U.S. exports to Spanish-
speaking Latin American countries. We could not use U.S. exports to Guyana, Suriname,
and French Guiana as our control group because U.S. exports to these countries on eBay
are too small. The estimates in Table A1 are consistent with the trade-promoting effect of
eMT and show a 20.3% increase in export quantity from the U.S. to Spanish-speaking Latin
American countries in the six months after the eMT rollout.
      One concern is that the increase in U.S. exports to Latin American countries could be
driven by eBay’s increased advertisement spending in those countries. To deal with this, we
use the same DiD specification to study how the number of new registered buyers changed in
Latin American countries relative to non-Latin American countries and Brazil. The results
in Table A2 show no statistically significant difference between the treatment and control
groups, suggesting that the larger effect is not merely coming from more intense advertising.
      In the main analyses, we use the logarithm of export quantity as the dependent variable,
and we use data from 6 months before and after the policy change for the DiD estimation. In

the first set of robustness checks, we replicate our results using the logarithm of export value
in dollars as the outcome variable, as well as extending the estimation window to 12 months
before and after the policy change. In Table A3, we see that our previous heterogeneous
treatments remain qualitatively the same: The export increase is larger for differentiated
goods, in categories with a larger share of products catalogued, and for cheaper products.
Even though a few specifications are no longer statistically significant, the sign and mag-
nitude of the estimates are consistent with lower search costs from eMT. In Figure A1, we
repeat our analyses based on the number of words in listing titles using the logarithm of
export value in dollars as the outcome variable, and the results remain qualitatively the
same. Lastly, in Table A4, we see again that the export increase is larger for inexperienced
buyers on the platform, consistent with the search cost story.
   Subsequently, we test the robustness of our results using the other two rollouts of eMT on
eBay. In July 2014, eBay rolled out eMT of item titles and search queries in the European
Union to promote intra-EU trade (i.e., items listed on the U.S. sites are not translated).
In particular, item titles in English were translated to French, Italian, and Spanish, to
facilitate British and Irish exports to France, Italy, and Spain (FRITES). Additionally, in
January 2014, eBay had a rollout of eMT that translated English into Russian to facilitate
exports from English-speaking countries to Russia. However, the effects of this rollout were
contaminated by Russia’s annexation of Crimea, which prompted international sanctions.
Although the estimates of total changes in exports in the case of Russia could be confounded
by political factors, the relative changes in exports for different types of products and buyer
experiences could still be informative of the mechanism of eMT if the political factors affected
exports in a similar way across the different groups.
   In the case of FRITES, we use UK and Irish exports to non-FRITES countries as the
control group for their exports to FRITES countries on eBay. We first plot the average
monthly British and Irish exports on eBay to the FRITES and non-FRITES countries. In
Figure A2a, exports on eBay are measured in quantity and are normalized relative to the level
in June 2014. The dashed vertical lines refer to the introduction of query translation and
item title translation in July 2014. The figure suggests that the pre-trend assumption holds
in the year before the policy change, and the policy promotes British and Irish exports to


                                               2
FRITES in the year after its introduction. Similarly, in Figure A2b we use offine British and
Irish exports to FRITES as a second control group. Exports are measured in U.S. dollars.
The figure suggests that the pre-trend assumption holds for the second control group, and
the policy seems effective in promoting trade.
   In the case of Russia, we use exports to Russia from non-English speaking countries
as the first control group for exports to Russia from English-speaking countries. For the
second control group, we use offline exports to Russia from English-speaking countries. We
plot the graphs using the two different control groups in Figure A2c and A2d. Figure A2c
suggests that the parallel trend assumption holds and that there is a positive effect of the
policy on exports to Russia from English-speaking countries on eBay, relative to the null
effect of exports to Russia from non-English-speaking countries on eBay. However, a visual
inspection of Figure A2d suggests that the second control group is not valid, because we see
a kink in exports to Russia on eBay around summer 2013, which is non-existent in offline
trade.
   In Table A5, we use specification (1) to estimate the policy effect on exports to FRITES
and Russia. In Panel A, we control for both fixed effects for seller countries (U.K. and
Ireland) and buyer countries. When we use the first control group, we estimate that the
introduction of eMT increased U.K. exports to FRITES on eBay by 13.9% and 13.6% in the
6 months and 12 months after the policy change, respectively. When we use offine exports
as the control group, we find the estimated policy effects are 18.7% and 11.9%, depending
on the time window. We have checked that the difference in the policy effect in dollar terms
on eBay and offline is not statistically significant. Therefore, the rollout of eMT in Europe
confirms the finding that machine translation increases exports on eBay.
   In the case of Russia, when we use the first control group (online exports to Russia
from non-English speaking countries on eBay), we see a 17.1% increase in exports to Russia
on eBay in the 6 months after the policy change (Panel B), and this number shrinks to
12% when we look at a 12-month window. However, the estimates become statistically
insignificant when we use the offline control group. We remain skeptical about our ability to
estimate the overall effect of the policy on exports to Russia, because of the inconsistency
between our estimates when we use the online and offline control groups.


                                             3
    In Table A6, we study the heterogeneous treatment effects of the impact of eMT in the
cases of FRITES and Russia. In the left section of both Panel A and Panel B, we see signif-
icant negative coefficient estimates of the triple interaction terms “T*Post*Homogeneous”,
indicating that the export change is more positive for differentiated products.1 In the middle
section of both panels, we see that markets (i.e., meta-categories on eBay) where the degree
of catalogization is in the bottom quartile (i.e., less homogeneous) experienced a positive
change in exports, whereas markets on the other end of the catalogization spectrum experi-
enced negative changes relative to the first group. Lastly, in terms of product values, we see
in the right section of both panels that export increases are positive for items that are sold
for less than $10, and that the increase is smaller or non-existent as the average sales price
of a product increases. All of these heterogeneities are consistent with lower search costs
and similar to our main analyses in the case of Latin America.
    Subsequently, we study how the effect of eMT varies with the number of words in listing
titles. In Figure A3, we see that the export change generally increases with the number of
words in listing titles. This is consistent with the fact that translation costs increase with
the number of words, and therefore the reduction in translation costs is larger for items with
longer titles.
    Lastly, we study the policy effect on buyers with different experience on eBay. The
definition of experienced buyers is the same as before. In Table A7, we see that the estimated
export increases are smaller for experienced buyers. This is similar to our finding in the
case of Latin America, and is consistent with the fact that, relative to experienced buyers,
inexperienced buyers have higher translation-related search costs. We find no statistically
significant difference of this gap for homogeneous and differentiated products, suggesting
that buyer experience is a different margin of heterogeneity than product types.
   1
     In the case of Russia, a negative change in exports for homogeneous products could be a result of political
factors, but the sign of this triple interaction term is the same as in the case of Latin American and FRITES.
