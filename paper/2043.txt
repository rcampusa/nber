                       International Capital Mobility in
                 Developing Countries vs. Industrial Countries:
                What do Saving—Investment Correlations Tell Us?




                                    ABSTRACT




          The finding of Feldstein and Horioka (1980) that countries'
investment rates are highly correlated with their national saving rates has
by now been confirmed by many subsequent studies, even though their
inference that international capital mobility must be low has not been as
widely accepted. This paper examines the statistical relationship between
national saving and investment in a sample that includes not Only 1 L
industrialized countries, but also 50 developing   countries. The paper
addresses some of the econometric critiques that have been aimed
                                                                 at the
Feldstein—Horioka work. Contrary to what one would expect from
consideration of capital mobility, the coefficient appears higher for
industrialized countries than for developing countries, and higher after
1973 than before.

           Our interpretation of the saving—investment evidence is that the
hypothesis of a high degree of substitutability for claims on physical
capital located in different countries is not supported by the data.
International substitutability for financial capital may be high, but this
is a separate condition (which is properly tested by looking directly at
rates of return). High international substitutability for bonds would
inply high international substitutability for physical capital if capital
were perfectly substitutable for bonds within each country, but there is no
reason for this to hold, any more than there is for all goods to be perfect
substitutes.

     Many subsequent studies have by now confirmed the finding of Feldstein

and Horioka (1980) that countries' investment rates are highly correlated

with their national saving rates. Nonetheless their inference that inter-

national capital mobility must be low has not been as widely accepted.

This paper examines the statistical relationship between national saving

and investment in a sample that includes not only 14 industrialized

countries, but also 50 developing countries. Contrary to what one would

expect from considerations of capital mobility, the coefficient appears

higher for industrialized countries than for developing countries, and

higher after 1973 than before. We find that these results survive

econometric techniques designed to deal with some of the critiques that

have been aimed at the Feldstein—Horjoka work.

     Our interpretation of the saving—investment evidence is that the

hypothesis of a high degree of substitutability for claims on physical

capital located in different countries is not supported. There is no

contradiction between this conclusion and the hypothesis that some finan-

cial assets are perfect substitutes in the portfolios of international

investors. This is a separate condition (which is properly tested by

looking directly at rates of return). It could hold, and yet real

interest parity fail, if goods are not perfect substitutes. 1/

    The puzzle of higher saving—investment correlations for industrialized

countries than for developing countries could then be explained by higher

real exchange rate variability among the former. Alternatively, if direct

international substitution between claims on physical capital--imperfect

as it is——is considered more relevant than the roundabout route through

financial capital and goods, then one could explain greater effects on

investment in industrialized countries than in developing countries, even

for the same degree of independent variability in rates of return, by

assuming that investment in physical capital is more responsive to the

domestic market rate of return in industrialized countries than in

developing countries.


       I. Econometric Critiques of Savings—Investment Correlations

     Most of the econometric criticisms of Feldstein and Horioka can

be subsumed in the general complaint that the righthand—side variable

is correlated with the error term, that is, that national saving is

endogenous. Though this problem is an ever—present danger in macroeco-

nomics, it is particularly likely when the lefthandside and righthand—

side variables, together with the current account, are linked by an

identity.

     Three conditions must hold before one could expect no relationship

between investment and saving rates. Each is strong.

     Condition 1: a country's investment rate depends only on a "repre-

sentative" national real rate of return r but not upon other variables

that are correlated with domestic savings. For convenience we assume

the relation to be linear:
                                      —3—

       (1) I/Y = a — hr + €.


  The statistical support for the relationship
                                               between investment and the
  real interest rate has in fact
                                   always been disappointingly weak. We know
  that, at a minimum, there must be a large error term c.    But if investment
  is to be uncorrelated with
                               saving, it is crucial that this error term be

 purely random, that it be uncorrelated not
                                              only with the national rate of
 return, but also with national saving.

      Condition 2: the domestic expected real rate of return relevant for

 investment and savings decisions
                                    must equal the foreign expected rate of
 return: r =   r*.   If we think of the capital account as a function of

 the differential in returns,


 (2) KA = k(r—r*)


 then the hypothesis is that k is infinite.    This is the only one of the
three conditions that could properly be associated with the phrase "inter-

national capital mobility" as traditionally understood. (The other two

Conditions are econometric ones.)     But, we will argue, financial capital
mobility may not be sufficient to produce
                                            even this condition, if the
condition is interpreted as the international equalization of expected

real yields on physical capital.

     Condition 3: the foreign expected rate of return relevant for

saving and investment is determined
                                      exogenously. In other words, the
domestic country is not large enough in world financial markets to affect

the world interest rate.
                                 — 4-..



     The statistic in question is Cov(I/Y, NS/Y), where NS/Y is the ratio

of national saving (private plus public) to income. 1/ Using equation (1),

we can decompose this covariance into three parts:


     (2) Cov(I/Y, NS/Y) = Cov(c, NS/Y) — h Cov(r_r*, NS/Y) — h Cov(r*, NS/Y)


Condition 1 says the first term is zero, condition 2 the second term, and

condition 3 the last term. If any of the three fails to hold, if any one

of the links is broken, then there is no reason to expect the investment

rate to be uncorrelated with the saving rate.

     Each of the three conditions in fact often fails to hold. In order

to gauge the empirical importance of these failures, this paper examines

the statistical relationship between national saving and investment in

a sample that includes not only 14 industrialized countries, but also

50 developing countries. 2/ The paper addresses some of the econometric

critiques that have been aimed at the Feldstein—Horioka work. Contrary

to what one would expect if physical capital was mobile across countries,

the coefficient relating investment and national saving appears to be higher

for industrialized countries than for developing countries, and higher

after 1973 than before. Moreover, among developing countries there is a

clear difference in the behavior of domestic saving and investment rates

between countries that obtained external resources primarily through

international capital markets and those that receive substantial official

transfers. The saving and investment correlations for developing

the variance of NS/Y, and the correlation coefficient is the covariance
divided by the standard deviation of each.

  countries that rely on international capital markets are difficult to

  distinguish from industrial countries.

      The remainder of this paper is divided into three sections.

  Section I first considers the econometric problems associated with

 examining the relationship between domestic saving and investment

 ratios. Section II considers empirical results for saving and invest-

 ment relationships for different groups of developed and developing

 countries. Section III provides a rationale for the observed integration

 of markets for some financial instruments and
                                                 the apparent isolation of
 national markets for real saving and investment.

            [I. Endogeneity of National Savings and Investment

      One obvious version of the endogeneity problem that arises in time

 series studies is the strongly procyclical nature of both saving and

 investment, even when expressed as shares of GNP. If an exogenous boom

 causes both to rise, we do not want to attribute the correlation to low

capital mobility. For this reason, Feldstein and Horioka restricted

their analysis to cross—section data, as did most who followed in their

footsteps. 1/ But even in time series studies, one can cyclically adjust

the saving and investment data. 2/

     An alternative version of the problem that is relevant even for

cross—section studies is the fact that the saving and investment rates

both depend on the rate of growth of national income, as determined for

example by population growth or productivity growth. This problem is


  1/ Other cross—section studies include Fieleke (1982), Feldstein (1983),
Penati and Dooley (1984), Murphy (1984), Caprio and Howard (1985), and
Summers (l985a).
  2/ Sachs (1981) included a GNP gap variable in his regressions. Frankel
(1985) tried two approaches: decade
                                     averages on a 10 year time sample of
U.S. data, and cyclically—adjusted annual saving and investment rates on
shorter postwar time samples. A third time—series study is Obstfeld (1985).
                                 —6—

particularly relevant if the sample includes both industrialized countries

and developing countries. One solution that has been applied is to add

the rate of growth as a second explanatory variable.   But the finding has

been that holding the growth rate constant, like holding the business

cycle constant, does not reduce the coefficient in the saving—investment

regressions. 1/

     The most popular version of the endogeneity critique is that govern-

ments react systematically to current account imbalances so as to offset

them. For example, if the government reacts to a trade deficit induced
                                                     expenditure or rais-
by an increase in investment by cutting government

ing taxes, then national saving and investment will be correlated for

reasons having nothing to do with capital mobility. 2/

     It is important to realize how general the endogeneity argument is.

Any economic variable, in addition to the cost of capital that influences

the investment rate, will probably be correlated with the national saving

rate. This is true not just of the level of income, population growth,

and productivity growth, but also energy shocks, real wages, strikes, and

 so forth. 3/ If factors, other than the cost of capital, that determine


   1/ Fry (1984) and Summers (l985a) both argue, in the context of
 developing countries in particular, that the influence of the growth
 rate on the other two variables explains the saving—investment correla-
 tion. Obstfeld (1985) makes the argument carefully, in the context of
 OECD countries. But Summers (l985a, p. 22) added the rates of population
 growth and GNP growth to his regressions and found no effect on the
 saving coefficient.
   2/ The "policy reaction" argument has been made by Fieleke (1982),
 Tobin (1983), Westphal (1983), Caprio and Howard (1984) and Summers
 (l985a, b). Summers calls it the "maintained external balance"
 hypothesis.
   3/ Many of these factors would probably bias the correlation upward.
 But some would go the opposite way, in the direction of a negative corre-
 lation. If a country discovers oil, investment should go up but saving
 should go down. Similarly, an investment tax credit should raise invest-
 ment but lower the budget surplus and therefore national saving.
                                    —7—

  investment happen to be uncorrelated with national saving, then there

  will be no econometric problem. (This is true even if government policy

  reacts systematically to current account imbalances.) But such a lack

  of correlation, with or without t,erfect capital mobility, is an absurdly

 strong condition. Since the difference between national
                                                           savings and
 investment is identically equal to the current account it would imply

 that the factor in question has the identical effect on the current

 account as on investment.

      If national saving depended on only the national rate of return and

 other factors thought to be random (uncorrelated not only with the rate

 of return but also with investment), we could invert the equation and

 regress national saving against investment. The hypothesis that foreign

 capital is in infinitely elastic supply at a given rate of return would

 imply a zero coefficient. This test would be equivalent (given the

 national saving identity) to regressing the current account against

investment. The null hypothesis would in that case be a unit coeffi-

cient, implying that any exogenous changes in investment are fully

financed by borrowing from abroad. This in fact is the equation run by

Sachs (1981, 1983). But the idea that the rate of return is the only

systematic determinant of both private and public saving has received

even less support than the analogous assumption for investment. Clearly

the right answer is that national saving, investment and the current

account are all endogenous, and that some covariance among these

variables is to be expected.

     The question remains, however, as to why there is so little independent

variation among these variables. Surely some of the factors that influence
                                 —8—

domestic savings do not have an equal and positive effect on investment.

Yet it is shown in the next section that a positive covariance "near" to

one is evident for very different country groups and over very different

time periods. Moreover, the country group with the lowest correlation is

also the group that relies the least on market—determined capital flows.

It follows that factors which generate high correlations between national

savings and investment in the presence of capital mobility must be

remarkably similar both across country groups and over long time periods.

     It seems important therefore to confront the "endogeneity" problem

directly through an instrumental variables approach.   Indeed, the original

Feldstein and Horioka paper used instrumental variables. 1/ Two candi-

dates for instruments for national savings are military expenditure and

the dependency ratio (the population less than 15 years or 65 years or

over in age, divided by the working age population in between). The

former is most immediately a determinant of the government budget deficit

(government dissavings) and the latter of private saving. It is possible

to think of ways that either could be endogenous; it is conceivable that

military expenditure could be cut back in response to trade deficits 2/

and that the age composition of the population could respond to the

growth rate. But these two variables seem to meet the criteria for


   1/ Their four instrumental variables were the ratio of retirees over the
 age of 65 to the population aged 20—65, the ratio of younger dependents to

  Regressions based on them are reported in the next Section.


             III. Results for the Relationship Between Investment
                              and National Saving

       In this section, we examine the relationship between national saving,

 defined to include both private and
                                       public sector saving, and investment
 for a sample composed of 14 industrial countries and 50 developing coun-

 tries. 1/ Our first objective is to consider whether the empirical

 results obtained for industrial
                                   countries (e.g., Feldsteln and Horioka
 (1980) and Penati. and Dooley (1984)) also extend to the developing coun-

 tries, and whether the developing countries
                                               can be treated as a homogenoug
 group or differ according to the nature of the resource transfer they

 receive from foreign sources.

      Table 1 summarizes some of the empirical results based on ordinary

least squares regressions that have been obtained in past studies for

the savings and investment relationships for the industrial countries.

Three preliminary conclusions are evident in these results. First,

industrial countries that had relatively high rates of gross fixed

investment also had relatively high
                                      gross domestic savings rates.
Second, examined over time, industrial
                                         countries that accumulated capital

more rapidly in the most recent periods also experienced

saving as a share of GNP. However, conflicting evidence was developed

with regard to the relationship between investment ratios and current

account ratios. For example, Sachs (1981, 1983) found a negative and

significant slope coefficient in cross section regressions for either

the levels or changes in. current account balances and investment ratios.

Such a relationship would be consistent with a high degree of capital

mobility. In contrast, Feldstein and Horioka (1980) and Penati and
                                                    coefficient; as a
Dooley (1984) did not find a significant negative

result, this evidence generally supports the view that changes in the

propensity to save or to invest of residents of an industrial country

were reflected in changes in that country's investment share or saving

share.

     To examine whether such relationships exist for developing as well

as developed countries, our analysis first examines saving and invest—

ment behavior in these two groups of countries in two periods: 1960—73

and 1974—84. The first of these time periods represents the Bretton

Woods era of fixed exchange rates. It might be expected that the degree

of integration of markets for real savings and investment would be much

 higher in the second period, as the largest industrialized countries

 removed their capital controls, the OPEC surpluses were recycled, and

 the EurocurrenCy markets experienced rapid growth.

 ratios (for both the levels and changes in the ratios) for the groups of

coefficients are highly significant statistically. Moreover,

cients are higher for the industrialized countries than for the developing

countries, although we find that the difference in these coefficients is

not statistically significant when the entire sample is pooled. This is

the same finding as Summers (1985a): there is no sign of the greater

ease that one would expect the more open industrialized countries to have

in financing saving shortfalls. Nor is there any sign of the expected

increase in capital mobility after 1973. The coefficient for all coun-

tries rises from 0.47 to 0.60. This failure of the coefficient to decline

over time is the same result found by Feldstein (1983) and Penati and

Dooley (1984, p. 9—10). 1/

     These results are also supported by examining the relationship between

the changes in the average saving and investment ratios over the periods

1960—73 and 1974—84. As indicatedin Table 1, the slope coefficient

relating the change in the average investment to income ratios to the

change in the average savings to income ratio is positive and significant

 (at the 99 percent level) for both industrial and developing countries

 although the coefficient for the industrial countries is considerably

higher.

  instrumental   variables regression. The two instrumental variables used
  in Table 3 are the ratio of
                                 military expenditure to GNP and the ratio of
  dependents to working—age population.
                                            (Two developing countries were
  dropped because data on their dependency ratio was unavailable; OLS

  regressions in the slightly reduced
                                        sample are reported in the top part
  of Table 2 for comparison.)

      The results are striking. In the case of the developing
                                                                  countries,
 the coefficients lose all
                              statistical significance. Indeed for the
 1960—73 period, the sign is not even positive. This would
                                                            appear to
 suggest that the high coefficients
                                    reported by many authors in OLS
 regressions are entirely attributable to econometric endogeneity
                                                                     problems,
 rather than to imperfect
                             capital mobility, and that these problems are
 easily solved by the use of instrumental
                                            variables. The case of the
 industrialized countries is quite different: the coefficient
                                                                 actually
increases somewhat. These results
                                      only heighten the puzzling conflict
between the regressions and the
                                   presumption of higher capital mobility
among the industrialized countries than
                                           among the developing countries.
     A somewhat similar result
                                  emerges when changes in the average
savings and investment ratios are employed. For the developing
                                                               coun-
tries, the coefficients associated with
                                           the change in the savings ratio
are approximately the same size and positive in both the OLS and ins-

trumental variables equations, but the coefficient is not
                                                            significantly
different from zero in the
                             instrumental variables case. However for the
                                   — 16 —




industrial   countries, the comparable savings coefficient rises quite

sharply in value but again becomes insignificant.

     One possible explanation for these different results for industrial

and developing countries is that the set of 50 developing countries is

too diverse to treat as all having the same degree of capital mobility.

In Tables 4 and 5, we focus on the distinction between a group of 21

market borrowers and 14 countries that depend primarily on official

financing. (Fifteen countries are not classified by the Fund as either

sort of borrower.) In the OLS regressions (Table 4) the positive and

significant coefficients for the market borrowers, the official borrowers,

and the combined set of market and official borrowers that was evident

in Table 1 are still evident. Moreover, the coefficients are higher

after 1973 than before, and they are also higher for the market borrowers

than the official borrower.
                                                       (Table 5) has a much

less important effect on the size and significance of the coefficients as

it did when all the developed countries were included together, especially

for the post—1973 period. For the market borrowers in particular, the

 point estimate of the coefficient now even exceeds unity, as it did with

 the industrialized countries in Table 2.

 why they are so high generally, and why they are even higher for the

 borrowers than for the official borrowers, and after 1973 than before.

         IV.   Country Size and the Saving—Investment Correlation

     We noted at the outset three conditions, all of which taken together

were sufficient if investment were to be uncorrelated with national

saving: (1) investment depends only on the national rate of return (and

purely random factors); (2) the domestic real rate of return equals the

world real rate of return; and (3) the world real rate of return is

exogenous. It was argued that, even if condition (2) holds, condition

(1) is very unlikely to hold since the gap between the domestic and world

rates of return may be affected by endogenous domestic factors. The

instrumental variable regressions are a way of attempting to deal with

the econometric problems created by such endogeneity.

     The failure of condition 3 is another possible econometric problem

that has been pointed out by a number of authors. For a country large

enough to affect world financial market conditions, a fall in national

savings might drive up interest rates and crowd out investment everywhere

in the world. It would be erroneous to conclude from the fact that

domestic investment fell when domestic savings fell that there was low

capital mobility, if the rise in interest rates and fall in investment

were as large abroad as in the domestic country. This argument is of

particular interest here because it might seem to explain our findings in

Section III, that the saving investment coefficients appear to be higher

for industrialized countries (which of course tend to be larger in world

financial markets) than for developing countries.
                                     — 23 —



     Of the Feldstein—Horioka critiques, Murphy (1984) focuses most

explicitly on the failure of the world interest rate to be exogenous,

cov(r*, NS/Y)     0 in our equation (2). 1/ As a way of addressing the

effect of country size, he divides his sample of 17 OECD countries in

two, and finds that the seven large countries have a higher coefficient

on saving (0.98) than the ten small countries (0.59). He interprets the

results as supporting the claim that the high Feldstein—Horioka coeff i—

cients could be due to country size rather than to imperfect capital

mobility.

     The argument is very relevant in the case of time series studies.

Obstfeld (1985), for example, attributes the high correlation coefficient

he gets for a U.S. time series to the size of the United States in world

narkets. As a fix—up, Tobin (1983) proposes including, in the equation

for any given country's investment, the saving rates for all the other

individual countries in the sample; he argues that under the hypothesis

of perfect capital mobility, a country's saving will have no more effect

on its own   investment   than on other countries' investment. 2/ This tech-

nique would use up too many degrees of freedom. But a natural solution is

to include the saving rates of the rest of the world aggregated. Frankel

(1985) converts the U.S. saving rate to deviations from the world saving

rate, converts the U.S. investment rate to deviations from the world


  1/ Harberger (1980), Tobin (1983), and Obstfeld (1985) also criticized
Feldstein and Horioka on the grounds of the "large country" problem.
  2/ Tobin acknowledges that the solution is relevant only for time
series studies, not cross—section, but he seems to believe that the
problem itself is relevant and serious even in cross—section studies.
                                 — 24 —



investment rate, and finds that the two variables remain highly corre-
lated. The argument is that if capital were perfectly mobile, and crowd-

ing out of investment were due only to the large size of the United States

in world capital markets, then there should be no effect of saving on the

U.S. investment rate beyond the effect on the rest of the world's invest-

ment rate. The rejection of this hypothesis suggests that the saving—

investment correlation cannot be attributed to the large country effect.

     In cross section studies, the endogenous foreign interest rate r*

is not a problem to begin with. The statement, "a country's saving rate

affects r*," is a statement about alternative states of the world, as in

time series. It is not possible that cross—section effects on the saving

rate can be attributed to r*, for the simple reason that all countries

share the same r*. In equation (2), cov(r*, NS/Y) is necessarily zero

when r* is the same for every observation.

     If one expressed national rates of saving and investment as devia-

tions from world levels as in the time series regression, it would only

change the constant term in the cross—section regression. To take the

concrete example of the fall in the U.S. national savings rate in the

1980s, the large—country effect alone could in theory explain high real

interest rates and a depressing effect on U.S. investment. But if real

interest rates were equalized, the large—country effect alone could not

explain a combination of low saving and investment rates in the United

States together with simultaneous high saving and investment rates in

Japan.

     Harberger (1983) offers an argument why the Feldstein results are
spurious that relies on the factor of country size, but in a way unrelated

to the endogeneity of the world interest rate. The argument is that

large countries tend to be more diverse than small countries (more like

U.S. states and less like city blocks, in Harberger's words). For this

reason, multiple saving and investment shocks tend to cancel out, and

there is proportionately less of a need for the country in the aggregate

to borrow or lend to the rest of the world. When there is a drought in

a small country, it affects the whole economy; the country has to borrow

from abroad. But when there is a drought in Kansas, there may be a good

harvest in California, or a high—tech boom in Massachusetts, or an oil

discovery in Alaska, so that there is proportionately less need for the

United States to borrow from abroad. The argument is analogous to the

optimum currency area literature of the early 1960s which relied on the

regularity that the larger and more economically diverse a region was,

the less need did it have (proportionately) for trade in labor or goods.

with other regions. 1/

     Harberger (1983) specifically addresses the issue of industrialized

versus developing countries:

          The point to be borne in mind here is that the evidence of the
     Feldstein—Horioka paper was assembled from the OECD countries only.
     Casting the net wider would have surely thrown up indications of
     much greater divergence between saving and investment rates (p. 334).

     Harberger's point is a convincing explanation of why current account!

GNP ratios such as calculated by him, Feldstein and Horioka (1980),


  1/ It followed that if two regions joined together, the aggregate unit
would be less open than either taken individually. Mundell (1962) put
the argument in terms of labor mobility and McKinnon (1963) in terms of
openness to trade.
                                            — 26 —



Feldstein       (1983), Sachs (1981, pp. 233—37), and Penati and Dooley (1984),

Caprio and Howard (1984), and Summers (1985), might be closer to zero

for large countries than for small countries. But it does not seem in

itself to explain why the investment—saving regression coefficient would

be higher for large countries than for small countries. If the variance

of the saving rate SlY (or of the investment rate disturbances) is smaller

for large countries because shocks cancel out, but changes in net capital

inflow          unit change in the current account are the same, then the

variance of the current account will also be smaller but the regression

coefficient need not be.

        Let


(4) I/Y =          ÷   (NS/Y) +


Here,         depends on parameters, such as the degree of capital mobility and

the sensitivity of investment to the interest rate, which we will assume

the same for different countries. Then,


(5) CA/Y = NS/Y —        I!?   =   — + (l—3)   NS/Y —


and Var (CA/Y) =       (l_)2    Var (NS/Y) +   Var(c)    + 2 (l—)Covar(NS/Y, c).

The last term is zero in large samples, in the event (extremely unlikely

without the use of instrumental variables, as we saw in Section III) that

the error term is well behaved. If Var(S/Y) and Var(s) are smaller

for large countries, then Var(CA/Y) will be smaller as well, as Harberger

claims. Nevertheless, a regression coefficient will be estimated as


    6     -   Cov(I/Y, SLY)        —   + Cov(S/Y,   c)
(
                 Var (S/Y)                 Var(S/Y)
                                  — 27   —



where again the last term is zero in large samples in the event that the

error term is well behaved. The important point is that we should expect

  to be no higher among large countries than among small countries. 1/

     Murphy (1984) pursues Harberger's suggestion that one should find

more apparent capital mobility for smaller units than for large. He

regresses the investment rate against the saving rate for a cross section

of 143 U.S. corporations and finds a significant coefficient. He argues

that since the corporate capital market is "by almost all standards, a

well integrated capital market with a high degree of capital mobility,"

(p. 335), the correlation test must not be correct. But there is an

element of circularity to this argument. On the one hand, the proposed

explanation for the spurious Feldstein—Horioka results, an endogenous

market—wide interest rate, is not relevant for the cross—section of cor-

porations. On the other hand, there are perfectly good theoretical and

empirical reasons for thinking that corporations' liabilities are not, in

fact, perfect substitutes for each other in investors' portfolios and that

corporations cannot borrow unlimited amounts at the going interest rate.

We are left doubting the perfect integration of the corporate capital

market more than the reliability of the test.


                V. Financial and Real Capital Mobility

     In our view the evidence that levels and changes in national savings

and investment ratios move together stands up to the empirical issues


  1/ The standard error of   in small samples could be affected one way
or the other.

raised   in the previous sections. In terms of the three conditions laid

out at the beginning of this paper, it is the failure of the second

condition, r =   r*,   that remains the most likely explanation for the

position covariance of national savings and investment. One reason

why many observers continue to resist the implications of this evidence

is that it seems so clearly at odds with the apparent integration of

financial capital markets, especially those of developed countries.

     If by capital mobility we mean the tendency for investors to equalize

expected rates of return on a subset of liquid, short—term, default—free,

financial assets denominated in different currencies or issued by residents

of different countries, then there can be little doubt that capital is

mobile among the major industrial countries. 1/ This definition of

capital mobility, however, is of limited value. It is analogous to

measuring the degree of integration of international goods markets by

noting that prices (measured in a common currency) are equalized for a

subset of goods. There certainly are a large number of agricultural and


  1/ However it should be noted that, even if capital is sufficiently
mobile to equalize internationally expected rates of return on two assets,
the equalization will take place in terms of any common currency or
other numeraire, not in terms of the countries' respective goods. Thus,
real Interest parity, which is the condition relevant for saving and
investment, need not hold unless we have not only uncovered interest
parity, but also purchasing power parity. See Frankel (1985) for an
elaboration of this point.
                                    — 29 —



 mineral   commodities for which this condition holds quite strictly. It

 is clear, however, that this condition tells us nothing about the tendency

 of prices of goods in general to be equalized across countries.     In

 fact, this more interesting purchasing power parity measure of "goods

 mobility" has failed to hold in recent years. The key to this more

 general condition is that within countries the relative prices of goods

 change by substantial amounts and with no apparent tendency to return to

 their original levels.

      An analogous argument can be made in the context of international

markets for securities. The fact that a subset of financial instruments

issued by residents of different countries appear to be perfect substi-

tutes does not mean that the financial markets are fully integrated. As

is also true for goods markets, a useful measure of "capital mobility"

would require that "traded" and "nontraded" financial assets be perfect

substitutes in residents' portfolios so that the relative yields on

these assets within countries are largely independent of international

influences.

     The existence of "nontraded" securities is, of course, not obvious.

It can be argued, however, that the possibility of ex post taxation of

some types of international positions acts as a barrier to trade in such

assets. Moreover, it is possible that the net indebtedness of a country

is an important determinant in its incentive to impose such taxes.

     The idea that net claims on a given country might be important to

wealth holders is difficult to model. There is no aggregate asset called

"net claims" that we can identify nor can we directly measure the yield
                                  — 30 —




necessary in order to induce wealth holders to hold this net position.
In most cases net claims on a given country are a small difference

between two large numbers, gross claims and gross liabilities. Thus

while it may be clear that a risk exists when a country's net debt to

the rest of the world grows it is not clear who holds that risk, that

is, how a loss would be allocated among holders of various financial

claims on the country.

     The government, for example, may perceive different costs in

damaging the reputation of various forms of investments. Its own securi-

ties might be an example of an asset unlikely to be taxed, particularly

if these are held by foreign governments. Equity claims, however, might

be relatively easy to identify as owned by nonresidents and, because

they impart control of domestic firms, constitute a relatively attractive

tax base for political reasons.

     If assets such as Treasury securities and equity claims are

imperfect substitutes within countries the structure of yields between

countries and within countries will reflect a complex set of expectations

concerning the likely incidence of an ex post tax on nonresident claims

as well as "arbitrage" conditions that will determine how and by whom

such risks are borne.

     It follows that arbitrage among a select set of internationally

traded "safe" financial assets need not imply that yields on more

vulnerable nontraded assets are also equalized. What is necessary is

that differentials that might arise within a country are not closely

arbitraged. That is, the yields on Treasury securities and other
                                      — 31   —



 tradable    securities would have to diverge from yields on equities and

 other nontradable assets. The analogy in goods markets would be that

 prices of traded goods are equalized across countries but the relative

 prices of traded and nontraded goods within countries will change in

 response to economic conditions.

       This framework might be made more clear by illustrating the financial

 and real linkages between and within two very simple economies. Financial

assets consist of claims on physical capital, E, interest—bearing claims

on the government, B, and fiat money, M. The yield on equity claims is

the marginal revenue product of the capital stock, r. Interest—bearing

government bonds yield a nominal rate of rp and fiat money, which

is also a liability of the governments, yields no nominal return.

       E =   E
              rg)

       In describing the linkages between the two countries' financial

systems it is assumed that government bonds are traded securities while

equity claims are nontraded securities. As with goods and services the

terms traded and nontraded securities are an analytical convenience that

represents a continuum of assets. For simplicity it is assumed that

government—issued securities are perfect substitutes across countries so

that



(4) rg=r+E()
                                       — 32 —




However, since equity claims are not traded, the linkages between rp and
rp* are only indirect. The two monies are tradable but are assumed to be

dominated by government securities in the portfolios of nonresidents. !/

These financial market assumptions are illustrated as follows:

                             ÷    (No Trade)    +        Money
             Money

         Physical Capital         (No Trade)     *   Physical    Capital


     Note that the arbitrage between the two capital stocks is limited

both across, due to country risk, and up and down, due in our assumptions

concerning substitution parameters between equities and government bonds.

     The linkages between the financial sector and real sector within

each country are as follows. Real investment is defined as transforming

current output into a capital good which has an "own" rate of return in

terms of future output. Investment will be positive when the present

value of the expected future output exceeds the cost of the capital.

As discussed above, the discount rate,          need not be equal to the

government security rate since domestic savers might require a variable

differential in order to hold willingly existing government debt and

claims on the capital stock.


  1/ In terms of the literature we are thus assuming "perfect capital
mobility" but no currency substitution. Note however, that the addi-
tion of nontraded securities to the model will alter the "standard"
interpretation of "capital mobility" as defined by (4).

(5)   I =
            I(r)
      Savings in each country is a function of two independent rates of

return, the two government bond yields (which are assumed equal because

of arbitrage across countries) and the yield on the domestic capital

stock.


(6) S =     S(r,   rg)


      The real sector linkages between countries are derived from the

above conditions and the balance of payments constraint. That is, a

net excess demand for the traded security must be identically equal

to the differences between output and absorption (or public plus private

savings and investment) in each country. The mechanism that insures this

equality is left in the background. It may or may not involve income,

prices and real exchange rate changes, which are assumed unchanged in

this discussion.

      The essential features of this framework are illustrated below

(Figure 1). Because these relations are drawn with respect to returns on

traded securities, the yield on nontraded securities, rp, is a parameter

in the savings and investment functions. Since government bonds are

perfect substitutes across countries, rg and rg* are always equal. In

the initial position, domestic savings for both countries are set equal to

domestic investment plus the domestic fiscal deficit at r by assumption.

      It is evident that shifts in the 1, 1* or S, S functions, or a

change in either countries' fiscal deficit, will result in some net trade

of government bonds and a current account imbalance in this framework.

But there is no presumption that this trade in tlsafe!I securities will be

sufficient to equalize r and r. In general the disturbance in this

model will be dissipated by both a change in the structure of yields,

savings and investment behavior within countries, and net trades of goods

and securities between countries. The relative importance of these

equilibrating mechanisms depends on the degree of segmentation of finan-

cial markets, the response of savings and investment to the two financial

yields, and the nature of the shock to the system.

     Suppose in this system the domestic fiscal deficit increases (due to

a bond financed increase in government expenditures), shifting the I + G

curve to the right to I + G' (Figure 1). In autarky rg would be bid

up, and if rp was bid up only slightly, so that shifts in I and S were

negligible, r would rise to r. If we now open the economy, and

assume that r is about unchanged, r will also be bid up and the new

equilibrium   will be at r =
                               r2.   At this point the traded security

yields will have risen sufficiently to increase S + S so that the

domestic fiscal deficit is covered. This will generate a current account

deficit in the home country, a b, equal to the difference between domestic

savings and I + G', and a current account surplus, c d, in the foreign

country. There is an equivalent net trade of government securities.

     If we assume that the financial markets are highly integrated within

each country, a rise in rg =
                               rg* will tend also to raise r and r. In
this case the S and S curves in Figure 1 would shift to the right and the

I + G' and 1* +     curves would shift to the left as private investment

is crowded out. If the two countries were identical, the rise in rg =
                                                                           rg*
would be less but we would observe the same current account deficit

following a fiscal deficit as described above.

     A shift in the investment schedule or the saving schedule would

differ in at least one important respect from the fiscal deficit shock

discussed above. Assume that the private investment function shifts to

the right by the same amount as the fiscal deficit discussed above so

that I ÷ G shifts to I' + G (Figure 2). The effects of such a shift

appear to be similar as described above in that r =
                                                       r0   would rise

until the level of savings in both countries covered the increase in

However, in this case the shift in the domestic investment function would

tend to raise rp directly and this would shift II +              G   to I" + C.   More-

over, the rise in rp would cause S S in Figure 2 to shift to the right

to S' S'. For these reasons an ex ante shift in the domestic investment

schedule would have a smaller effect on the traded securities market

shown as shown by the dashed curves in Figure 2. The initial disequi-

librium in the domestic traded securities market would be mitigated by a

rise in rp. It follows that the size of the shock transmitted to the

other country is smaller as compared to a fiscal deficit if the domestic

financial market is poorly integrated. For this reason the current

account imbalance would also be smaller.

      In general, it apears that a more complete description of the

linkages among financial markets within and between countries might

help to explain the correlations between domestic savings and domestic

investment.   The very simple model proposed above suggests that these

correlations should break down in cases where the dominant shocks to the

system are unusually large fiscal deficits that are uncorrelated across

countries. In the absence of such conditions, differences or changes in

domestic savings and investment functions might have limited impact on

current account imbalances.


                         VI. Concluding Remarks

     The evidence brought together in this paper suggests to the authors

that a close association between national savings and national investment

is a robust empirical regularity. This finding casts considerable doubt

on the widely held view that national markets for physical capital are

highly integrated. The positive correlations between levels and changes

in national saving rates and investment rates, which are apparent both

for industrial countries and developing countries and which are higher

in recent years as compared to earlier time periods, stand up to a

variety of econometric objections. The only data set for which the

empirical regularity is not apparent includes developing countries that

depend primarily on aid to finance current account imbalances.

     The fact that national markets for some types of financial capital

are integrated may be irrelevant in evaluating the degree of integration

of national markets for physical capital. The tendency for expected

returns on liquid, default free financial assets to be equalized does not

imply that expected returns on physical capital are also equalized.

     We   do not know why the apparent isolation of national markets for

physical capital has persisted in the face of substantial expansion of

trade in goods and services and financial capital. Further research into

these matters might focus on the impediments to net transfers of real

savings to "foreign" political jurisdictions. A better understanding of

such factors might suggest policy measures that would encourage more

productive use of world savings.
