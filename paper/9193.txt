                                             ABSTRACT

        We assess whether in utero exposure to legalized abortion in the early 1970's affected
individuals’ propensities to use controlled substances as adolescents. We exploit the fact that some
states legalized abortion before national legalization in 1973 to compare differences in substance
use for adolescents across birth cohorts in different states. We find that persons exposed to early
legalization were, on average, much less likely to use controlled substances. We also assess how
substance use varies with state level birth rates and abortion ratios. Overall, our results suggest that
legalization lowered substance use because of the selective use of abortion by relatively
disadvantaged women.

1.       Introduction

         This paper examines how the legalization of abortion in the early 1970s affected

the tendency of children born during those years to drink, smoke, and use illicit

substances as teenagers. Recent work on legalization's effects has focused on early life

outcomes (Gruber, Levine and Staiger (1999)) as well as one later life activity - the

propensity to commit serious crime (Donohue and Levitt (2001) and Joyce (2002)).1 Not

only has a single later life outcome been studied, the two papers on legalization and crime

reach dramatically different conclusions, making the impact of abortion reform on later

life outcomes an open question. Our study focuses on a different outcome, about which

there is likely independent interest and which, as we outline later, is ideal for assessing

abortion legalization’s later life effects.

         Two main theoretical reasons have been posited for why abortion legalization

could have affected later life outcomes like substance use and crime. One is the

mechanism of selection - specifically, whether relatively disadvantaged women were

more or less likely to have abortions after legalization. The early life circumstances of

the average child born after legalization should have risen if they were and should have

fallen otherwise.2         If a person’s early life environment affects later life outcomes,

selective use of abortion should have changed the incidence of bad teenage outcomes for

persons born after abortion reform.



1
  There has also been work by Angrist and Evans (1999) on how abortion legalization affected human
capital acquisition and labor market outcomes for potential mothers exposed to abortion reform.
2
  Selection of the first type could occur if adjusted their fertility to ensure that children are born when the
mother's (or family's) economic position is most favorable. The second type of selection could occur is
disadvantaged women lack the means to pay for abortions, or if they live relatively further from providers
than their better off counterparts.



                                                       1
        The second mechanism does not depend on selection. Even if the fraction of

children in a given cohort born into disadvantaged circumstances was unaffected by

abortion availability, more abortions after legalization would have lowered the number of

people at risk to engage in the relevant behavior. This reduction in the cohort size could

affect the rate of use within a cohort because of how the costs that drug dealers face may

change, how the distribution networks may operate, and how peer effects influence youth

behaviors.3

        Several authors have shown that legalization was indeed associated with dramatic

increases in the number of abortions (e.g., Bauman, Anderson, Freeman, and Koch

(1977), and Levine, Kane, Staiger, and Zimmerman (1996)).4                       With respect to the

selective use of abortion, Levine et al. (1996) find that relatively disadvantaged groups

such as teenagers, nonwhites, and unmarried women were more likely to have abortions

after legalization.       But they also find that older women, who tend not to be

disadvantaged, were also more likely to have abortions after legalization. Moreover,

even though groups like teenagers are more likely to be disadvantaged, there might have

been systematic selection in the types of teenagers who had abortions. Hence, the

conclusion that there was selective use of abortions by the disadvantaged may be tenuous.

        Gruber, Levine, and Staiger (1999) study how legalization affected the

circumstances into which a child was born. They show that children who would have

been born but for abortion legalization would have been more likely to be born into

poverty, to die in infancy, to receive welfare and to live in a single parent family. The

 Jacobson (2001) discusses these and other reasons why cohort size might affect the rate of use.

 The association between abortion availability and fertility has been found by many other authors. See
Blank, George and London (1994), and Levine, Trainor and Zimmerman (1996), and Kane and Staiger
(1996).

improvement in the average early life circumstance of children born after abortion

legalization supports the idea that there was positive selection (relatively more use by the

disadvantaged) of abortion.5

         Did the improvement in average childhood circumstances after legalization

translate into better later-life outcomes for these children? Donohue and Levitt (2001)

examine the relationship between legalization and the dramatic nationwide reduction in

serious crime such as homicide, violent crime and property crime, which began in the

early 1990s. There is a strong prima facie case that legalization had a causal effect on

crime reduction. Crime began to fall abruptly and sharply in 1992, just as first cohorts

born after legalization entered the prime crime-committing age range of 18-24. The

reduction began earlier than 1992 in the five states that liberalized abortion prior to the

Roe decision. 6 Finally, the nationwide reduction continued through the early nineties, as

the fraction of people aged 18 to 24 in any year who were born after legalization grew.

         In their formal analysis, Donohue and Levitt relate changes over time in a state's

abortion ratio (the proportion of abortions to live births) to crime within the state in the

1990s. They estimate a large effect: fully one-half of the reduction in crime can be

explained by changes in the abortion ratio. This effect is larger than policy initiatives

such as increased policing. Their evidence makes a compelling case for the notion that

abortion legalization, presumably by virtue of its impact on the number and fraction of




5
  Other research finds a similar association between abortion access and improvements in birth outcomes.
See for example, Grossman and Jacobowitz (1981), Grossman and Joyce (1990) and Currie, Nixon and
Cole (1993).

  In 1970, four states explicitly legalized abortion by repealing state abortion laws. These states were New
York, Washington, Alaska and Hawaii. A State Supreme Court ruling in late 1969 which held that
existing anti-abortion laws were unconstitutional meant that, as of 1970, California was a state with “de
facto” legalization.


                                                      3
children born into disadvantaged circumstances, had a causal effect on subsequent

criminal behavior.

         Joyce (2001) also examines the relationship between legalization and crime. He is

critical of Donohue and Levitt's analysis, and dubious of their conclusion that legalization

lowered subsequent criminal activity. Joyce’s main criticism centers on Donohue and

Levitt's use of changes in the abortion ratio over time as their main source of variation.

He argues that information on abortions may be unreliable, and that even if reliable, need

not correlate neatly with unintended fertility.7 In addition, Donohue and Levitt’s abortion

ratio summarizes the number of abortions that occur within a state, which might be quite

different from abortions had by women who live in the state.

         Joyce uses an empirical strategy, previously employed by Gruber, Levine and

Staiger (1999) and Angrist and Evans (1999), which exploits the fact that five states

effectively legalized abortion three years before national legalization. The staggered

nature of abortion legalization means that from 1970 to 1972, and only for those years,

women in the five “repeal” states were exposed to legalized abortion while women in

every other state were not. Joyce compares crime outcomes for people born in the 1970-

1972 interval, across repeal and non-repeal states. He finds no evidence of a difference

in crime between them, and concludes that relationship Donohue and Levitt find between

crime and abortion ratios is spurious.8



7
  One explanation for this is that there may have been a correlation between the availability of abortion in a
state and the use of contraceptives, or even the likelihood of engaging in sexual activity, for people in a
state.
8
  Though they do not emphasize these results, Donohue and Levitt also use the repeal state/non repeal state
comparison to study legalization and crime. Overall, their results from this exercise were mixed. Donohue
and Levitt argue that the comparison of early versus late legalizers is not a useful approach in their context
because the early legalizers have only a three year “head start”. Since they study crime among a broad
band of age cohorts, it is, in their view, difficult to identify any effect on overall crime.


                                                      4
          Because these studies of the subsequent criminal behavior of the cohorts exposed

to abortion legalization gives mixed results, understanding whether the impact of abortion

reform carries over to later life outcomes is an open, and important, topic to analyze.

Here, we focus on adolescent use of controlled substances.9 Like serious crime, use by

adolescents of controlled substances, particularly illicit narcotics, is likely a function of

the person’s childhood circumstances.               Thus, any effect of abortion on early life

environment should be manifested later in substance use.10 Also, particular features of

available data on substance use make it a very interesting subject for the study of this

effect.

          One of these features is that national substance abuse trends among adolescents

displayed a very different time series pattern to those for serious crime. Whereas crime

began a sharp decrease in the early nineteen nineties, Figure 1 shows that the fraction of

U.S. 12th graders who report using controlled substances such as tobacco, alcohol and

illegal substances like marijuana and cocaine started to trend upwards at around the same

time. The figure shows only use patterns for use within the past month, but the patterns

for having ever used the substances or for having used them within the past year are very

similar. The pattern in Figure 1 is exactly the opposite of the first order relationship one

might expect if legalization affected adolescent substance use. In light of these trends,

formal evidence consistent with an effect of abortion would be quite convincing.


9
  Though this paper is about substance use and not crime, it should be noted that strictly speaking, a minor
who uses any of the substances we study is engaged in criminal activity, albeit of a decidedly less serious
variety than the types studied by Joyce and Donohue and Levitt. Also, substance use may be a gateway
into serious criminal activity. For example see Markowitz (2000), Parker and Auerhahan (1998) and
Baumer et al (1998).
10
   The relationship between background and family conditions has been documented by numerous authors.
In Risky Behavior Among Youth: An Economic Analysis, Gruber ed., papers by Cook and Moore (alcohol),
Gruber and Zinman (Smoking) and Pacula et al (marijuana use) estimate an a significant relationship
between these factors and use.


                                                     5
           The most interesting aspect of studying substance use is that available data on this

behavior permit a much sharper test of the effect of legalization than is possible with

available crime data. Recall that the selection effect emphasized in the literature ought

to have affected the rate at which people, born after legalization, engage in or manifest

some negative outcome. Both Donohue and Levitt and Joyce, in their respective studies,

use the Unified Crime Report data, compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

These data measure all reported violent crime, property crime, and homicide.               But

because crime reports are not disaggregated by the age of the offender, they cannot be

used in a proper test of abortion legalization: examining the impact on criminal activity

by specific birth cohorts.

           The other measures used in the crime studies to help get around this problem have

equally serious limitations. One measure is the arrest rate, which is age-disaggregated.

But the fact that a given number or fraction of people of a certain age are arrested for a

particular type of crime in a year is, at best, a highly imperfect indicator of the number or

fraction of persons of a given age who commit the particular crime in the year – the

outcome of interest. Arrest rates depend on the actions of police, and are not conviction

rates. Indeed, even if every arrested person were an offender, arrest rates by age might

still systematically mis-measure criminal behavior by age if the capacity to escape arrest

varies with age. Donohue and Levitt and Joyce also look at age-disaggregated crime

victimization data. The limitations of these data for testing the prediction of the effect of

legalization on criminal behavior are obvious. Crime victims are not criminal offenders,

and even if they were, it is not clear how the ages of the two groups would line up. 11



11
     Joyce also examines data from the FBI’s Supplemental Homicide Reports.


                                                    6
         There are none of these problems with substance use data. As we discuss in detail

below, we are able to examine the proportion of persons, from specific birth cohorts, who

use controlled substances in a given year, at a particular age. In addition, because we use

data from multiple years, there is little risk that our estimates conflate aging and time

effects, as is possible with analyses similar to ours, but which use data from a single year.

Gruber, Levine, and Staiger (1999), for example, in their analysis of the effect of

legalization on early life outcomes, use data from the 1980 Census. The use of these data

means that children born at different years are of different ages when observed in the

data, making it difficult to separate aging and time effects.12

         Using several generations of 12th graders from the Monitoring the Future Survey,

we classify adolescents by whether they were born in one of the states that legalized

abortion before nationwide legalization in 1973.                 For 12th graders born in the same

cohort, we then compare substance use between those born in repeal and other states. For

cohorts born when abortion was legal in only the repeal states, we find that people born

in those states were significantly less likely to use controlled substances, particularly the

most serious like illegal narcotics, than persons from their birth cohorts born in other

states. In addition, we find no evidence of differences in substance use by whether the

person was born in a repeal state or not for cohorts born after national legalization.

         We also examine how the probability of substance use was associated with

changes in the birth rate to delineate between the impact on drug use due to selective use

of abortion and that due to reductions in cohort size. When we isolate variation in birth

rate due only to abortion legalization using an instrumental variables approach, we find


12
   Gruber, Kane and Staiger attempt to carefully deal with this potential problem by adding state-specific
trends.


                                                     7
that increases in birth rates are associated with increased probabilities of substance use.

Since all the variation in birth rates in these results are induced by the abortion reforms,

and since we find relatively sharp, cohort-specific changes in substance use as birth rates

change, the results suggest a role for a selection effect above and beyond an effect due

only to changes in cohort size.

       We briefly discuss evidence about the abortion ratio and substance use, as there

has been much controversy about the use of this ratio in the literature. We illustrate some

problems with the abortion ratio, and explain why we are apprehensive about using it to

identify the relationship of interest. It is noteworthy, however, that despite its problems

the results from the abortion ratio essentially support the paper’s main result: that in utero

exposure to abortion legalization was associated with a reduction in the tendency to use,

or to have ever used, controlled substances for 12th grade adolescents.

       In the next section we describe our empirical framework and the data in greater

detail. Section 3 presents results from the differential timing of abortion reforms in the

early legalizing states and national abortion legalization.    In Section 4 we present the

results using birth rates. Section 5 briefly discusses results when the abortion ratio is the

regressor of interest and Section 6 concludes.



2.     Data and Empirical Framework

       We use data from several waves of the Monitoring the Future (MTF) data set.

The MTF is a repeated cross-sectional national survey that, since 1975, has collected

information each spring from high school seniors about their behaviors and attitudes.

MTF also surveys 8th and 10th graders although data collection for these two student



                                              8
groups did not commence until 1991. Our analysis focuses on the annual 12th grade

surveys because the late date at which data collection began for 8th and 10th graders

makes it impossible to assess their substance prior to abortion legalization. The focus on

different generations of 12th graders means that we have a sample, drawn from different

birth cohorts, who are (approximately) the same age when observed. Each cross-section

of MTF 12th graders consists of about 16,000 students from 130 schools (Johnston,

O'Malley, and Bachman (2001)).13 All of our analyses are weighted using the sampling

weights provided with the study.

         Information about the use of five types of controlled substances is available in the

MTF. Information about three types comes directly from the 12th graders’ responses: use

of cigarettes, use of alcohol, and use of marijuana. Information on other types of illicit

substance use, such as cocaine, heroin, and amphetamines, is also collected in MTF. We

use two composite measures constructed by the MTF staff. One indicates the use of any

illicit drug; the other denotes use of any illicit drug excluding marijuana. For each of

these five substances, we study two indicators of use. One indicates whether the student

reports having ever used the substance at some point during his or her lifetime. The other

measure, which likely better captures more habitual use, indicates whether the student

used the substance within the past thirty days.

         There is limited demographic data available in the MTF. We know the student's

gender, whether the student is white, and the educational attainment of the student’s




13
  One limitation of the data is that MTF does not sample high school dropouts. However, to the extent
that dropouts are likely to be children born into relatively disadvantaged circumstances, their absence from
the data biases us against finding evidence for the predicted effect of legalization.


                                                     9
parents.14 Students who give missing responses for any of these demographic data are

dropped from our analysis.15

         Ideally, we would like to know each student’s place and date of birth. The public

use version of MTF does not include state identifiers, but we made a restricted analysis

data agreement with MTF that enabled us to merge the student's state of residence as of

the survey date onto the dataset.              These state of residence identifiers are the only

indication of student location available. Our analysis therefore assumes that the students'

state of residence is the same as their state of birth – an assumption that is likely correct

for the vast majority of the sample.

         Students’ birthdays are reported in the survey. We use this information to create a

“year-of-birth” variable for each student which measures whether the student was

exposed to legalized abortion in utero. Persons born in the early part of any year were in

utero during the previous calendar year. Persons born in the latter half of any year were

in utero during the calendar year of their birth.               To line up children by their in utero

exposure, we code each MTF student’s “year-of-birth” as year t ∗ if the student was born

between July 1 of year t ∗ and June 30th of year t ∗ + 1. 16

         Our analyses control for time-varying state-level factors that likely affect

substance use. We use state cigarette and beer taxes, the fraction of the state’s population

that resides in a dry county, state per capita income, and state unemployment rate.

Information on state cigarette taxes, including the federal cigarette tax, is from the


14
   Roughly 75% of our sample is white, 12% are African-American, 6% are Latin-American, and 2% are
Asian-American.
15
   These exclusions result in a loss of nearly 10% of the observations. Additional results not shown here
indicate that the results are not affected by deleting these observations.
16
   Constructing the year-of-birth variables this way also helps us align the students’ years of birth with state
abortion ratios, which we discuss in detail later.

Tobacco Institute's The Tax Burden on Tobacco.17 The state tax on a case of twenty-four

twelve-ounce beers was obtained from the Beer Institute's Brewer's Almanac. An

estimate of the number of a state's residents residing in dry counties was also obtained

from the Brewer's Almanac. Dividing these estimates by inter-censal estimates of the

total population in a state taken from the Census Bureau, we create the fraction of the

state population residing in dry counties for each year. Information on each state's annual

per capita income was obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and state adult

unemployment rates were obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. All dollar figures

are converted to 1999 dollars using the CPI-U.



3.       The Impact of Early vs. Late Legalization of Abortion

Setup

         Our first set of results exploits the fact that the “repeal” states legalized abortion

three years prior to nationwide legalization in 1973. We estimate the model:

        Useijt = β1 ( Repeal j ∗ D7072 ) + β 2 ( Repeal j ∗ D7476 ) +
                                                                                                                  (1)
                             β 3 D7072 + β 4 D7476 + β 5 X it + β 6 Γ jt + β 7δ j + β 8τ t + β 9Coh i + ε ijt .

where Useijt is an indicator variable which equals 1 if student i in state j in year t uses

the particular substance. The variables X it and Γ jt are, respectively, the vectors of

individual and time-varying state-level controls described above. The terms δ j and τ t

are, respectively, state and survey year fixed effects whose inclusion in the model

accounts for unobserved differences over time or across states which may be correlated



17
  Phil DeCicca graciously provided us these data. See DeCicca et al (2001) for the details of data
construction.


                                                        11
with the variables of interest.             The binary variables D7072 and D7476 are year-of-birth

dummies which indicate whether the person was born in the years 1970-1972 (as we have

defined year of birth above) or was born in the years 1974-1976, respectively. We also

include Coh i terms for each birth cohort to capture any additional differences across

these cohorts. The variable Repeal j in (1) denotes whether the person’s state is one in

which abortion was effectively legalized in 1970.18

           The interactions between the two year-of-birth dummies and the repeal variable

are the variables of interest in (1). The first interaction asks: Among persons born in

1970-1972, was adolescent substance use higher when they were high school seniors for

those whose mothers were exposed to legalized abortion? The second interaction term

asks: Among persons born in 1974-1976, whose mothers were all exposed to legalized

abortion, was there a difference in adolescent use for those who happened to be born in

states which had legalized abortion early? The fact that the data allows us to focus on

substance use for people born in very specific birth cohorts, all at the same stage of life is

a major strength of our analysis.

           If abortion access affected substance use through either of the mechanisms

described above, we would expect that among people who were born in 1970-1972, those

from repeal states should have been less likely to use controlled substances as adolescents

since only they were exposed to legalized abortion. The coefficient β1 should thus be

negative. By contrast, all individuals born in 1974-1976 were exposed to legalized




18
     The use of state fixed effects in equation (1) precludes the use of a main effect for the Repealj variable.

abortion because of national legalization in 1973. We would thus expect that β 2 should

be zero.

           To estimate (1) we analyze cohorts of 12th graders born over the interval 1966 to

1976. We exclude two birth cohorts: people who are born in years 1969 and 1973. For

these two cohorts it is not possible to say precisely what abortion regime prevailed during

the time the person was in utero. With this modification, people in the sample were

either exposed to legalized abortion in utero or not, and their exposure either arose

because they were from a repeal state or not. Limiting our sample to these birth cohorts

leads us to use individuals in the MTF spanning the survey years 1983-1999.19



Basic Results

           Table 1 presents the results for whether students, as of their senior year in high

school, report ever having used each of the five controlled substances. Means of the

dependent variable as well as sample sizes are reported at the bottom of Table 1 for each

dependent variable.20 Due to concerns about drawing correct inferences in models such

as these, the reported standard errors allow for arbitrary correlation for individuals within

the same state over time (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan 2002). The table shows that

the demographic controls are all statistically significant determinants of substance use.

Boys are more likely to have ever used all controlled substances, except tobacco.

Controlling for family background, whites are more likely to have ever used. Increased

parental education, both mother’s and father’s, reduces the likelihood of having ever used

  Nearly 99% of our sample is taken from the 1984-1995 surveys. Notice that these survey years
correspond to the years when the birth cohorts are roughly 18 years of age.

     Sample sizes vary across dependent variables since students do not answer all substance use questions.

the substance by 12th grade across all categories of use, except for ever having drank

alcohol.

       Evidence about the effect of the time-varying state controls on ever having used

any of the substances is mixed. The beer tax significantly lowers use of marijuana, any

illicit drug and any illicit drug except marijuana, but has no significant effect on cigarette

use and drinking. The cigarette tax does not affect whether 12th graders have ever used

any of the substances.    The fraction of a state’s population residing in a dry county as

well as the state’s per capita income both lower use for all of the substances although

these estimates are not statistically significant in any regression.       Finally, the state

unemployment rate only significantly affects the most serious substance category – illicit

drugs except marijuana.

       The results show that for all of the more serious substances – marijuana, all illicit

substances, and illicit substances excluding marijuana – 12th graders who were exposed to

legalized abortion in utero because their states were early legalizers were significantly

less likely to have ever used.    Not only are the effects strongly statistically significant,

but they are economically meaningful as well. For example, 32% of students overall

report ever having used an illicit drug other than marijuana. The estimated coefficient of

–0.045 therefore implies a fifteen percent reduction in the likelihood of ever having used

associated with in utero exposure to legal abortion. For the less serious categories –

cigarette smoking and drinking alcohol – the estimated effect on the interaction the same

sign as for other substances, but are not significant.

       The estimated effect for being born in a repeal state in 1974-1976 is not

statistically different from zero in any of these “ever used” regressions.         For these




                                              14
students who were all born after abortion was nationally legalized, there is no difference

in the behavior of adolescents from repeal and non-repeal states. This result is precisely

what one would expect given that students from both sets of states from these birth

cohorts were exposed to legal abortions when in utero.

       Table 2 presents the results for whether the student used substance within the last

thirty days - the dimension of use that probably better captures habitual use. For all of

the variables, the signs of the coefficients as well as their significance levels are virtually

identical to the ever used results. The point estimates indicate a lower likelihood of

recent substance use for the cohorts born in repeal states when only these states allowed

abortion, with the strongest results occurring for the two most serious substance

categories.   Again, these results seem sensible; any effect of abortion exposure should

affect most seriously the use of illegal drugs, and less dramatically substances like

tobacco and alcohol which a large number of teens are likely to have recently used,

irrespective of their backgrounds. In addition, as with the ever used results, we find no

difference in the likelihood of recent use for persons born after 1973 between the two

groups of states.

       Overall, the results in Tables 1 and 2 are very consistent with the argument that

early legalization, which exposed a subset of individuals to legalized abortion in utero,

impacted the substance use of these individuals when they become adolescents. People

born in repeal states in the three years of the “treatment” are less likely to use controlled

substances as adolescents than are others in the same birth cohort who were born in states

where abortion was illegal. There are no differences in outcomes for people born in the

two types of states after national legalization, suggesting the differences in outcomes for




                                              15
people born in the “treatment” years is attributable to the different abortion regimes

which existed in the two types of states in only these three years.



Robustness Tests

         How sensitive are the results in Table 1 and Table 2 to alternative model

specifications? The framework in (1) is a difference-in-difference estimator, with three

distinct periods: the “before” period, when no person in utero in any state was exposed to

legal abortion; the “during” period, when only persons in the repeal state were exposed to

abortion; and the “after” period, when both the repeal and non-repeal states had legal

abortion due to the national law change. The operating hypothesis within this framework

is that, while there may be differences in factors that affect substance use between repeal

and non-repeal states, these differences remain fixed across the three periods. The

possibility that this hypothesis might not hold is why we control for time-varying state-

level factors. We assess the sensitivity of the results to the inclusion of these state-level

controls, as well as the state, survey year, and cohort fixed effects.

         Table 3 presents the estimated interaction effects from different versions of the

model (1). The results in Panel A of the Table drop the survey year and cohort fixed

effects from the model.21 The results in the Panel show that not accounting for secular

trends in substance use, which equally affect all 12th graders in a given year, does not

change the estimated coefficients from those previously shown for the baseline

regressions in Tables 1 and 2.


21
  While there is not an exact one-to-one correspondence between the survey year and cohort fixed effects,
these coefficients exhibit a similar pattern when only one of these sets of effects is included in the model.
Therefore, we only present the results when both sets of these effects are excluded.



                                                     16
        Panel B of Table 3 presents the results from excluding the state fixed effects from

the model. In order to stay within the difference-in-difference framework, we include the

binary variable Repeal j that takes the value one if the student resides in an early

legalizing state and zero otherwise. In this specification, which does not account for

permanent, unobserved differences across states that affect adolescent substance use, the

results differ somewhat from those in the baseline model. The point estimates and

significance of interaction terms in the “during period”, when only repeal states have

legalized abortion, are essentially unchanged – except that the estimated effect for

marijuana is somewhat larger. The interactions for the “after” time period are different

than the baseline results, none of which were statistically different from zero. Without

fixed state controls, both alcohol “after” interactions are (weakly) significant as is the

coefficient for recent use of illicit drugs except marijuana. Thus, dropping the state fixed

effects has minor qualitative impacts on the results.

        The third set of results drops the demographic and time-varying state controls

from the baseline specification. Again, the results show that people born in repeal states

in the during period (1970-1972) were less likely to use than were people born at the

same time in other states. The estimated effects are quite similar (if not slightly larger in

magnitude) to the baseline regressions. The results for the interactions in the after period,

however, are dramatically different than both the baseline ever used and recently used

results. When observable controls are dropped from the analysis, virtually all of the

“after” interactions are large and statistically significant.

        In Table 4, we explore why excluding the time-varying state controls might lead

to significant coefficients for the after period. We focus on the time-varying state



                                               17
variables, as the demographic controls remain essentially constant across different waves

of the survey.         The entries on the left of the table are the average of the time-varying

state controls, by repeal and non-repeal state, encountered by students during their 12th

grade year.22 The entries on the right show the difference-in-difference of these means

between repeal and non-repeal states for people born across different pairs of time

periods. If it were the case that the difference in the time-varying factors encountered by

students born in the two types of states remains the same irrespective of when these

students were born, the difference-in-difference terms would all equal zero.

           The table shows that this condition is violated dramatically for all of state

controls, across all pairs of time comparisons.                       For example, the average state

unemployment rate confronted by students in the “after” period from repeal states versus

those from non-repeal states is 2 percentage points higher than the comparable difference

for students from repeal and non-repeal states born in the “before” period. To the extent

that increased unemployment lowers student demand for drugs, the failure to control for

this difference may impart a negative omitted variables bias for the estimated interaction

term in the after period. Similar difference-in-difference results are evident for the other

state controls, all of which will likely impart a negative bias on β 2 . Thus, Table 4

strongly suggests the need to include these time-varying state controls.

           In all likelihood, the results in Table 4 explain why, if the regressions do not

control for time-varying state characteristics, we find greater substance use for people

born in repeal states in the period when abortion was legal nationally. When the time-

varying state controls are added, as is done in the baseline specification, the differential

22
     These averages are across the individuals in our dataset, not simply across the states in question.



                                                        18
effect for people born after 1973 vanishes.       Had the difference in use for people born

from 1970-1972 only been due to changes in observable factors rather than to abortion

legalization in the repeal states, we would not expect the estimated effect of

Repeal j ∗ D7072 to be different than zero when the state-level controls are included. The

fact that these interaction effects are not impacted by the inclusion of the state-level

factors suggests that the estimated effects are truly due to differential abortion exposure.



4.     Analysis Using Birth Rate Variation

       The results in the previous section showed that children who were exposed to

legalized abortions in utero because of early legalization were, on average, less likely to

use controlled substances as adolescents. As we previously mentioned, abortion access

could affect teen use through two mechanisms: an effect attributable purely to the fact

that birth cohorts are made smaller by abortion, or the fact that the composition of cohorts

changes after legalization because of greater use of abortion by relatively disadvantaged

women (positive selection). In this section we analyze whether there is any evidence of a

selection effect above and beyond a pure cohort size explanation for the results in the

previous section.

       Jacobsen (2001) argues that if fixed costs to selling illicit drugs are large, then an

increase in the number of potential users in a cohort may lower drug prices due to

economies of scale in distribution. In addition, if network effects play a role in acquiring

or experimenting with drugs (i.e., it is easier to obtain drugs the larger your extended

network of friends), then larger cohort sizes will increase the likelihood of teen substance

use. Interestingly, all of these effects likely operate not only on the cohort that is smaller



                                             19
because of abortion, but also on surrounding birth cohorts. Students do not interact

strictly within their own birth cohort, and drug dealers probably do not organize their

sales on a cohort-by-cohort basis. Thus, the effect of legalization attributable purely to

changes in cohort sizes should have created an externality that lowered use in the

surrounding birth cohorts as well. By contrast, the effect of legalization attributable to

the selection mechanism operates mainly for the particular cohort that is smaller as result

of abortion. It follows that sharp changes in substance use corresponding to sharp

changes in birth rates associated with legalization are suggestive of an effect of selection

above and beyond a pure cohort size effect.

       We can relate use to birth rates using the equation

      Useijt = α1 Rate j + α 2 D7072 + α 3 D7476 + α 4 X it + α5Γ jt + α 6δ j + α 7τ t + α 8Coh i + ν ijt     (2)

where Rate j is the birth rate of the student’s state (the number of live births per hundred

women). In (2), the coefficient α1 measures how the probability that a teen from a given

cohort uses controlled substances, is affected by the birth rate in his state when he was in

utero. Unfortunately, the OLS coefficient on the birth rate in (2) does not estimate how

birth rate changes induced by legalization affect use, since birth rates change over time

for other reasons.

       We are able to “tease out” the changes in the birth rates due to abortion

legalization using the regression

        Rate j = γ 1 ( Repeal j ∗ D7072 ) + γ 2 ( Repeal j ∗ D7476 )
                                                                                                              (3)
                        + γ 3 D7072 + γ 4 D7476 + γ 5 X it + γ 6 Γ jt + γ 7δ j + γ 8τ t + γ 9Coh i + uijt .

Equation (3), in which the year-of-birth/repeal state interactions are used as instruments

for the birth rate, isolates the portion of the birth rate variation due to the changes in



                                                       20
abortion laws. When we subsequently use the predicted birth rate rather than the actual

birth rate to estimate (2) by Two Stage Least Squares (TSLS), the coefficient α1

measures the impact of birth rates on substance use due solely to abortion legalization.

         For the TSLS approach to tell us anything about whether legalization’s effect on

use derives in part from a selection effect, early legalization in the repeal states had to

affect birth rates. Table 5 shows the results for the first stage equation, (3). We present

results with and without the time-varying state controls for those students who responded

to the ever smoked question.23 The results without observable state controls in column 1

show that from 1970-1972, birth rates in repeal states were more than 3 births per

hundred women of childbearing age smaller than in the rest of the country. The effect is

strongly statistically significant. In the period after national legalization, birth rates

converged swiftly so there was no difference in birth rates between the two types of

states. These results are nearly identical to those found by Levine et al (1996) who use a

similar specification.24       The estimates that include all of the regressors used in the

analysis in column 2 yield comparable results. We present this second set of results to

highlight that the F-test for the excluded instruments shown at the bottom of Table 5 is

large enough to avoid concerns about finite sample biases that may contaminate TSLS

estimates (E.g., see Bound, Jaeger, and Baker 1995).

         Table 5 shows that there were sharp changes in birth rates in repeal and non-

repeal states which correspond neatly with the changes in legalization in the two sets of


23
  There are virtually no differences in the results if we restrict the sample to those who respond to
questions for the different dependent variables.
24
  Note that Levine et al perform their analysis at the state level while our analysis is perform at the
individual level using our sample of MTF respondents. In addition, they use the log of the birth rate as the
dependent variable rather than the level of the birth rate the level of the birth rate.


                                                     21
states. Whether, in turn, part of the mechanism by which these legalization-induced

changes in birth rates affected substance use operated through a selection effect above

and beyond a pure cohort size effect, is indicated by the TSLS estimates. Specifically, if

there was a selection effect, we would expect the TSLS estimates to show sharp changes

in substance use which correspond to the changes in birth rate shown in Table 5. Notice,

this evidence is different from the evidence of changes in use shown in the previous

section, where we merely looked at categorical measures of legalization and there was no

discussion of whether birth rates changed in a manner consistent with abortion access.



Results

          Table 6 presents the OLS and TSLS results for the effect of birth rate on the

probability that an adolescent used controlled substances using the same sample as in

Section 3. In the OLS regressions, the birth rate has no effect on the probability of

adolescent substance use for any of the controlled substances, in either category of use

(ever or past 30 days). However, the point estimates are generally positive, as expected.

As we argued above, these estimates contain variation in birth rates having nothing to do

with legalization and thus do not answer the desired question.

          The TSLS estimates where we instrument for birth rate using the abortion law

reforms show a different outcome. Recall that these estimates isolate the variation in

birth rate attributable to the abortion reforms. For the probability that a 12th grader has

ever used a substance, the TSLS estimates are statistically significant only for the illegal

drug except marijuana category. The point estimates for ever having used marijuana or

any illegal drug are positive, but not statistically significant. There is no effect on the




                                            22
probability of ever using marijuana or tobacco attributable to the changes in relative birth

rates due to abortion legalization.

        In many ways, the “ever use” dimension of use and some of the controlled

substances, are not ideal for testing abortion’s effects. For example, alcohol and tobacco

are prominently and approvingly portrayed in film and other media, and are probably

easily procurable during adolescence. Moreover, it may be that virtually all teenagers try

these substances at least once as a rite of passage. If we do focus on the “ever use”

dimension of use, the best substance on which to focus may be illegal drugs such as

cocaine and amphetamines. Given their serious nature, they are the substances for which

we would most expect legalization, operating through either the selection or cohort size

effect, to matter. For these most serious substances, we estimate an increase in the

probability of use attributable to the sudden and dramatic changes in birth rates following

the abortion law changes.

        For substance use in the past month, the TSLS estimates show that the increases

in the birth rate due to legalization are associated with statistically significant increases in

the probability of recent use for every substance except alcohol and marijuana. Even for

these two substances, there is an estimate increase in the probability of recent use

although the effects are not strongly significant. For each of the other categories, and

especially for recent use of illegal drug except marijuana, we find large and strongly

significant effects.

        The TSLS results show that substance use changes sharply with legalization-

induced birth rates change. This evidence is different from that presented in the previous

section, which showed only that substance use changed sharply with categorical measures




                                              23
of legalization. Legalization could have sharply changed some other factor, and it could

be this other factor that accounts for that earlier evidence. The TSLS results show how

use changed with changes in birth rate arising from legalization. These results indicate

that above and beyond any pure cohort size effect on substance use following

legalization, there was likely also a selection effect associated with these fertility

reductions as well. Had there been no selection effect at all we would not expected the

sharp patterns in the TSLS estimates. Our evidence is consistent with Gruber, Levine and

Staiger (1996), who find cohort specific relative improvements for people from repeal

states for early life outcomes, which also suggests a role for selection.

         Our TSLS estimates imply that a 1 in 100 reduction in the birth rate stemming

from legal abortion was associated in a 1 percentage point reduction in the probability of

recent adolescent use of the illegal narcotics excluding marijuana.                 Relative to the mean

rate of recent use found at the bottom of Table 2, this estimate represents a 10 percent

reduction in the probability of use. One implication of this result is that the children who

would have been born expect for legalization would have had a probability of using

illegal narcotics which exceeded the use of people actually born by more than 10

percent.25 Furthermore, these results indicate that the patterns for national substance use

depicted earlier in Figure 1, which began an upward trend in the early 1990’s may have

trended upwards even more had there been no abortion legalization.




25
  This calculation follows from the well-known results that the average of a variable (in this case the
probability of use) rises only if the marginal change in the variable is greater than that average.



                                                     24
5.       Estimates from Abortion Ratio Variation

         We noted earlier that the only later life outcome that has been previously studied

is crime. Although we follow the other studies in the literature that focus on the impact

of abortion legalization through the birth rate, we briefly discuss the abortion ratio in the

context of our outcome variables because of the attention it has received in the crime

studies. We discuss only the abortion ratio by state of residence – both because serious

questions have been raised about the ratio by state of occurrence, and because the results

for this other measure are virtually identical.26

         Table 7 presents two sets of results. In the first panel, we present OLS and TSLS

results for the effect of the abortion ratio on substance use. We show only the results for

use within the past month. The OLS regression and TSLS regressions are identical to

equations (2) and (3), except that we replace the birth rate in these equations with the

abortion ratio. The second panel of Table 7 shows the first stage results. In these

models, the “state of residence” abortion ratio equals the number of abortions had by

women who live in a state, divided by the number of live births to women in that state.

Total live births are measured from the year from July 1 to June 30, ensuring that the

denominator corresponds to the same set of pregnancies as the numerator.

         The first panel of the table shows that the estimated OLS effect of the abortion

ratio on substance use is not significant for any of the controlled substances, except illicit

drugs other than marijuana. For ease of interpretation, the abortion ratio has been divided

26
  Joyce (2001) criticizes the abortion ratio by state of occurrence because it includes abortions by people
who do not live in the state. This consideration is a potentially important one in the years immediately
preceding Roe v. Wade, since women from states that had not legalized abortion could travel into states in




                                                    25
by 1000 in all of the regressions presented in the Panel A of Table 7. The TSLS

estimates, by contrast, are all negative which means that increases in the abortion ratio

are associated with lower use among 12th graders who were exposed to this greater

abortion activity in utero. In addition, the results are strongly significant for any illicit

drug except marijuana and weakly significant for drinking and all illicit drug use.

        Given these results, which are very consistent with the analogous results for birth

rates presented in Table 5, why do we not emphasize the abortion ratio estimates? The

answer is evident in the Panel B of Table 7. These first stage regressions show that the

abortion ratio was higher in repeal states during the years when abortion was illegal in

other states, as expected. However, the ratio continued to be higher in repeal states, even

after abortion had been nationally legalized.

        The elevated abortion ratio in repeal states relative to the rest of the country even

after national legalization is why we do not emphasize the abortion ratio results, and is

the crux of Joyce’s criticism of Donohue and Levitt. If the only effect of legalized

abortion was that it lowered birth rates, the first stage evidence for the abortion ratio

should track that for the birth rate results presented earlier and there should be

convergence in abortion ratios after national legalization.               The fact that there are

relatively more abortions in repeal states after national legalization raises the question

about what treatment the abortion reform variables actually identify. It is clear the

abortion ratio is does not only capture changes in unintended fertility – the assumption on

which our technique hinges. With that in mind, it is very interesting that the abortion

ratio results are qualitatively similar to both sets of our results.


which the abortion laws had been repealed to have the procedure performed. Ted Joyce graciously
provided us with the “state of residence” abortion data used in our analysis.

6.      Conclusion

        This paper studies the impact of abortion legalization on the use of controlled

substances for people exposed to legalization in utero.            Comparisons of teenage

substance use for people born in states which legalized abortion early to use for youths

from the same cohorts but from states both during the time when abortion was only legal

in a subset of states and then again once abortion was nationally legalized show that in

utero exposure to legalized abortion is associated with diminished substance use,

especially of illegal narcotics.

        We relate teen substance use to state birth rates and find no association in the

simple correlation between these variables.       However, when we focus only on that

portion of the variation in birth rates attributable to the abortion reforms, we find the

lower birth rates reduced teen substance use, but only for the very specific cohorts

exposed to legalized abortion. That there is no effect for cohorts born just before or just

after these particular cohorts indicates that the results derive at least in part from a

selection effect which applied only to these specific cohorts, and not simply from cohort

size effects which we do not expect to apply with the same cohort specificity.

        Our paper undertakes none of the many philosophical and moral questions raised

by abortion legalization and availability. Nor does our examination of the effect of

abortion exposure on substance use address any of the other economic costs or gains

associated with legalization. It would thus be wrong to read our results as supportive of

abortion legalization in particular, or greater abortion availability in general.   However,

we believe that policy questions about abortion should be informed by credible estimates




                                             27
of the policy’s various effects.   Research that examines additional later life outcomes

attributable to the reforms in abortion laws, both within the United States as well as in

other countries, is needed to provide a more complete picture of the impact of such laws.

The Abortion Ratio is the number of abortions by women from a state per the number of live births to women from that state.
The OLS and TSLS results in the Panel A use the abortion ratio divided by 1000 for ease of interpretation.
All regressions contain demographic and time-varying state controls as well as state, survey year, and cohort fixed effects.
Standard errors allow for arbitrary clustering by state. Regressions are weighted using MTF sampling weights.
