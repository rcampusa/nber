                                            ABSTRACT

Despite the adoption of no-fault Workers' Compensation legislation in most states, there is

substantial litigation over the issue of employer liability for injury claims. We develop a sequential

asymmetric information model of liability disputes and estimate the model using data on injury

claims from the state of Minnesota. The key insight of our model is that when workers differ in their

costs of pursuing a injury claim, employers have an incentive to deny liability and force those with

higher costs to abandon their claim. Likewise, workers who expect a bigger return from pursuing

their claim are more likely to fight back when liability is denied. Estimates of the structural model

confirm that the decision rules of both parties depend on the expected costs and benefits of

continuing the dispute. The model provides a parsimonious but relatively successful explanation for

the distribution of liability disputes across different workers and types of injuries.

       No fault Workersʹ Compensation was adopted in most states in the early 20th

Century to eliminate costly litigation over liability for work-related injuries (Fishback

and Kantor, 2000). Under an ideal no fault system, employers agree to pay Workersʹ

Compensation (WC) benefits for all work-related injuries, and employees forfeit their

right to sue in the event of an accident. While the majority of WC claims are settled

without a dispute, in a surprising fraction of cases – 10 percent of lost-time injury

claims in Minnesota, for example – the employer refuses to accept liability for the

injury.1 In many of these instances the injured worker retains a lawyer and pursues the

case through the WC dispute resolution system. The associated litigation costs are

blamed by analysts for contributing to the rapid rise in WC premiums over the past two

decades (e.g., Long, 2004).

       One source of liability disputes is imperfect information on the cause of certain

types of injuries. An employee who sustains a back injury off the job, for example, has

an incentive to claim that the injury arose at work.2 Even in the absence of outright
fraud, employees who suffer injuries of unknown origin have an incentive to file an

injury claim to recover lost pay and medical costs. Firms and insurance carriers have a

countervailing incentive to deny such claims, in the hope that some fraction of

claimants will simply go away.

       In this paper we develop and test a simple model of the dispute process

involving the issue of primary liability for WC claims. Specifically, we model the firmʹs

decision of when to ʺstart a fightʺ by denying liability for an injury claim, and the

workerʹs decision of when to ʺfight backʺ by contesting the denial and launching a

   Barth and Hunt (1980) report that 5-10 percent of all WC claims nationwide are
formally contested.
  2
    Smith (1989) argued that this behavior could explain the so-called “Monday effect” –
an elevated rate of WC claims on Mondays. Later work by Card and McCall (1996) and
Derrig (2001) suggests that most of the Monday effect arises because of higher on-the-
job injury rates on that day.

formal dispute resolution process.3 The key assumption in our model is that workers

differ in their willingness to fight back. If employers cannot observe which particular

workers are more likely to contest a denied claim, an optimal strategy is to deny high-

cost injuries for which there is some probability that the worker will drop the claim.

Injured workers with higher costs of fighting back will then be induced to drop their

cases or ʺsettle out-of-courtʺ, saving the firm some fraction of the cost of their claim.

       Our empirical analysis utilizes a large sample of back injuries drawn from

Minnesota WC administrative files from the late 1980s. We focus on back injuries

because of their relatively high cost, and because of the inherent uncertainty over

employersʹ liability for these injuries (Burton, 1992). We develop a relatively simple

structural model that captures the sequential decisions of the firm and the worker. The

model includes a rich set of observed covariates and allows for a flexible specification of

unobserved heterogeneity across dispute pairs. Consistent with the basic insight of our

theoretical model, we find that employers are more likely to deny liability for an injury

when there is a bigger expected payoff to “starting a fightʺ, and that workers are more

likely to respond by filing a claim petition when there is a bigger expected payoff to

“fighting back”. We show that the model reproduces many of the observed features of

the data, including the distributions of indemnity payments from the employer to the

injured worker at the various settlement nodes, and the variation in average denial rates

across different demographic groups. Finally, we use the model to consider the

implications of imposing a “tax” on the initiation of disputes.

variety of legal settings. Thomason (1994) and Falaris, Link and Staten (1995) have
examined disputes in workers’ compensation. Our analysis differs in that it takes a
structural estimation approach that explicitly models the decision making process. See

insurance application process.

I. Institutional Background: The Minnesota WC System

       Employees who incur a work-related injury in Minnesota are entitled to Workersʹ

Compensation benefits for any injury that results in permanent disability or more than 3

lost work days.4 Injured workers are also entitled to full reimbursement of their

medical treatment costs. In the event of a lost-time injury, the employer (or the

employerʹs insurance carrier) has 14 days to either begin paying benefits or deny

liability by filing a ʺnotice of denialʺ with the appropriate administrative body (the

Department of Labor and Industry). During the 1980s, 11 percent of all lost-time injury

claims in the state and a similar percentage of back injuries were initially denied.

       By filing a notice of denial the employer may be disputing the existence of an

injury, denying that it arose in the course of employment, or otherwise challenging the

compensability of the injury.5 In any event, once the employer has filed a notice of

denial, an employee who wishes to contest the denial normally retains an attorney and

then may seek a direct settlement with the insurance company. Failing this, the injured

worker formally initiates the dispute resolution process by filing a ʺclaim petitionʺ (CP)

with the Department of Labor and Industry. Just over one quarter of all denied back

injury claims in the 1980s resulted in the subsequent filing of a claim petition.

       Once a claim petition is filed, the dispute can be either referred to non-binding

mediation by the Department of Labor and Industry, or scheduled for an administrative



  4
    The main type of benefits are ʺtemporary totalʺ benefits paid according to a
statutory formula (based on the pre-injury wage) for each lost work day. Partial
benefits are also available for injured workers who can return to work on a reduced
work schedule. These and other features of the Minnesota system are described in
Minnesota House of Representatives Research Department (1988).
  5
    According to a study conducted by the Minnesota House of Representatives
Research Department (1988), the majority of denials arise over basic factual issues such
as whether the injury occurred at work. An important minority of denials arise over
more subtle issues such as whether WC benefits are payable for stress-related diseases
or occupational injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome.
                                             4

conference conducted by a Departmental settlement judge.6 Failing settlement at this

stage, the dispute moves to the state Office of Administrative Hearings, where cases are

heard in a formal setting by an administrative law judge. The judge’s decision can be

appealed to the Workersʹ Compensation Court of Appeals.

       Figure 1 gives some basic information on the first two stages of the dispute

process involving issues of primary liability for back injuries in Minnesota. The data in

this figure are based on a 10 percent random sample of ʺfirst reportsʺ of injuries that

occurred between 1985 and 1989. Employers routinely file a first report for any serious

injury that might result in an indemnity claim, and a first report is legally required for

any injury that actually leads to an indemnity payment (i.e., payments to the injured

worker for lost work time or as compensation for permanent disability). Thus, the

sample frame includes all back injuries with positive indemnity benefits, as well as

some injuries that were filed on a first report but never generated an indemnity claim.7

       The figure shows the fraction of injury cases with positive payments and the

mean payment amounts for each of 3 possible denial/claim petition states: injuries

where the employer accepted liability; injuries where liability was denied and no claim

petition was filed; and injuries that were denied and for which a claim petition was

filed.8 Overall, injured workers receive indemnity payments in 40 percent of denied
claims. The probability of receiving a payment is relatively high for denied cases with a

claim petition (74 percent) but is far from negligible (25 percent) even for denied cases


  6
   The formal dispute resolution process is described in much more detail in
Minnesota House of Representatives Research Department (1988).
  7
    The sample excludes some fraction of minor injuries that resulted in medical costs
but only 1 or 2 days of lost work time. Employers can (and sometimes do) dispute their
liability for medical costs in such “medical only” claims.
  8
   The payment amounts in the figure include all forms of benefits, including lump
sum amounts paid to resolve certain cases, as well as temporary total and permanent
partial benefits.
                                              5

with no claim petition. These numbers suggest that a significant fraction of denied

cases are eventually revealed to be valid injury claims. Average payment amounts

conditional on having any payment are far higher for denied and contested cases than

for either of the other two categories, suggesting that liability disputes tend to involve

costly injuries.9



II. A Theoretical Model of Denials and Disputes

        This section describes a simple theoretical model of disputes over employer

liability in the Minnesota WC system. We model these disputes as the outcome of a

two-person sequential game in which the employer first decides whether to deny

liability, and the injured worker then decides whether to fight this decision. We model

the post-claim petition process (i.e. the settlement conferences and administrative

hearings) as a ʺblack-boxʺ characterized by two parameters: B, the probability of a

positive payment to the worker; and 2, the average amount that is paid conditional on a

positive payment.

        The game tree associated with the theoretical model is presented in Figure 2, and

corresponds directly to the payoff tree in Figure 1. In the first stage of the game the firm

decides whether or not to deny liability.10 If liability is accepted, the worker receives $2
and the game ends. If the firm decides to deny liability, the firm incurs an immediate

cost $d and the game moves to the second stage. In the second stage the worker must

decide whether to dispute a denial (i.e. ʺfight backʺ) or not. If the worker fights, he or

   9
    WC payment amounts tend to be highly skewed. Thus the median payment
amount in each denial/claim petition category is far below the mean. The median
payment for non-denied cases is $632. The median for denied and uncontested cases is
$1,273. The median for denied and contested cases is $14,000.
   10
    The decision to deny liability is normally made by the firmʹs insurance carrier. We
make no distinction between the firm and its carrier, although we recognize that the
divergent interests of principles and agents may be an important aspect of the dispute
process. See McCall (1990) for an application of this idea to the arbitration setting.
                                                   6

she incurs a cost $c, and the game moves to the final ʺdispute resolutionʺ stage. If the

worker decides not to fight, the game ends with no further payments from the firm to

the worker.11

             For simplicity, we assume that both the employer and the employee observe the

injury characteristics 2 and B. We assume, however, that there is asymmetric

information concerning the workerʹs cost of contesting a denial. In particular, we

assume that each worker knows his or her own value of c whereas the employer knows

only the distribution of c, as summarized by a distribution function F (or a conditional

distribution function F(c*x) that depends on a set of observable characteristics x). For

simplicity, we assume that both the worker and the firm are risk neutral, and we ignore

any delay between the stages of the game. We also assume that all workers who suffer

an injury of a given class (2, B) actually file a WC claim.

             The solution of the game is obtained by backward induction. Once an injury is

denied, the worker will ʺfight backʺ if the expected utility of fighting exceeds the cost of

fighting, or if     B2 > c. The firm will deny liability if its expected costs given that it
denies liability are lower than the cost of accepting liability. The probability that the

worker fights is F(B2), the expected cost to the firm if the worker fights is       B2 + d, and
the expected cost to the firm if the worker decides not to fight is d. Hence, the firm will

deny the claim if

(1)          F(B2)@B2 + d <   2.
Inspection of equation (1) shows that denials arise in this simple model for two reasons:

because of ex ante uncertainty over the likelihood of a liability determination in the

dispute resolution process (i.e. B < 1); and because of heterogeneity in workersʹ costs of

pursuing a claim. Even if B = 1, it may be optimal to deny a claim on the chance that an

injured worker with a higher value of c will ʺgo awayʺ rather than contest the denial.

      11
           This assumption is relaxed below.
                                              7

By the same token, even if c=0 (so F(B2)=1), when B is strictly less than 1 it is optimal to

deny all claims with sufficiently high expected costs, since there is some probability that

the firm will be found not liable for the injury in the final dispute resolution stage.



What if Firms are Better Informed?

        Although this very simple model incorporates asymmetric information on

workersʹ costs of pursuing a claim, no real strategic play occurs because the informed

party (the worker) moves after the uniformed party (the firm). A slight extension of the

model assumes that firms have better information than workers regarding the likely

outcome of the dispute resolution process.12 This information structure leads to

equilibrium bluffing behavior, since employers who know that an injured worker is

likely to prevail if a denied claim is actually contested have an incentive to conceal their

information.

        For example, suppose that B can take only two values, BH > BL, and that the firm

observes the realization of B while the worker doesnʹt. In this game, workers will

update their beliefs about their chances of winning a contested denial after observing

the firmʹs denial decision.13 This learning process will induce some firms with B = BH to

ʺbluffʺ by denying liability, even though in the absence of asymmetric information on

the value of B a firm in the same situation would not deny the claim. In particular, it
can be shown that the optimal strategy for a firm that observes B = BH is a mixed
strategy, with a probability of denial that declines smoothly from 1 (for injuries with

expected cost 2 above some threshold) to 0 (for injuries with expected cost below some


   12
    This asymmetry may arise if firms or insurers develop experience in dealing with
contested denials in the dispute resolution system.

    Note that if workers observe 2 and know that firms play pure strategies, then
   13

workers can infer the realization of B from the firmʹs denial decision for any value of 2
for which the pure strategy denial decision is different given B = BH or B = BL.
                                               8

threshold). Such a mixed strategy equilibrium generates a higher rate of denials than

would arise in the same environment in the absence of asymmetric information about

B.


More Complex Game Structures

          A second limitation of the model described in Figure 2 is the assumption that

claims that are denied and not contested generate no benefit payments. As we noted in

the discussion of Figure 1, however, a quarter of denied and uncontested WC claims

generate positive payments to the injured worker. One possibility is that these

payments represent the outcome of “pre-trial” negotiations between the firm and the

worker. Bebchuk (1984) and Nalebuff (1987) present models of pre-trail negotiations

built on the assumption that the defendant (in our case, the employer) has superior

information on the likelihood of liability, and that prior to trial the plaintiff (in our case,

the worker) makes a single take-it or leave-it offer and proceeds to trial (i.e., files a claim

petition) if the offer is rejected.14 Under this set-up, only employers with a relatively

low likelihood of liability proceed to trial, implying that the probability of a payment to

workers, and the mean payment size, will both be higher if the case is settled without a

claim petition then if it goes to the next stage of dispute resolution. These predictions

are inconsistent with the patterns in Figure 1, suggesting that the structure of the

Bebchuk-Nalebuff model is inappropriate for our setting.15



     14
    Sieg (2000) uses a version of Nalebuff’s (1987) model to study the pre-trial outcomes
of malpractice suits.
     15
     Contrary to the data, this simple adaptation of the Bebchuk-Nalebuff model also
implies that workers receive a positive payment in all denied cases that are settled
without a claim petition. In the case of medical malpractice suits, Sieg (2000) shows that
the probability of a payment to the plaintiff, and the conditional mean for positive
payment, are both higher for cases that are settled out of court than for those that go to
trial (as would be expected in the Bebchuk-Nalebuff model).
                                             9

       An alternative assumption is that the parties receive some additional information

between the date of the injury and the deadline for filing a claim petition that can lead

the employer to accept liability, or induce the employee to drop his or her claim.

Informal discussions with WC practitioners suggest that in cases where employers (or

insurers) have not received all the relevant information to assess a claim, they often file

a notice of denial to leave open the option of disputing the claim.

       Unfortunately, our data set does not allow us to identify cases where information

arrives late, or to distinguish between the types of settlements reached by the parties.

We therefore make the simplifying assumption that regardless of the process that leads

to the outcomes for a denied but uncontested claim, the parties’ “reduced form” payoffs

to this node can be summarized by two variables: the probability of a positive payment,

and the distribution of payment amounts conditional on a positive payment for a

denied and uncontested claim. This assumption leads to a set of decision rules that are

very similar to the ones described above. In particular, suppose that the probability of a

positive payment if the claim is denied and contested is B1, and that the probability of a

positive payment if the claim is denied and not contested is B2 < B1. Denote the

expected payment amounts (conditional on a positive payment) in these two cases by 21
and 22. Then a worker with cost c of contesting a claim will file a claim petition if

(2)    B121 > B222 + c ,
which occurs with probability pc, where pc = F( B121 - B222 ).
       A similar issue arises in modeling the payments to workers for cases in which

liability is not denied. Although most injured workers whose claim is not denied

receive some form of WC payments, about 10 percent receive nothing (see Figure 1).

Most of the latter cases presumably represent injuries that involved less than 3 days of

lost work time. To incorporate this possibility, let B3 represent the probability of a
                                                10

positive payment if a claim is not denied, and let 23 represent the associated payment

(conditional on a positive amount). Then the firm will deny liability for the claim if

(3)    pc @ B121 + (1-pc) @ B222 + d <   B323 .
This decision rule reduces to the simpler expression given by equation (1) above if B2 =

0, B3 = 1, and if 21 = 22 = 23 = 2. More generally, if B2 > 0 or B3 < 1, or if the expected

payment amounts differ depending on the denial and claim petition status of the injury,

then these differences must be taken into account in the firmʹs denial decision.



Empirical Implementation

       To take this model to the data we need to specify the observed and unobserved

components of the payment probabilities (B1, B2, B3) and the conditional payment levels

(21, 22, 23). We assume that the probabilities Bj are given by:

(4a)   Bj = M((jx) ,
where M(z) is the Gaussian distribution function evaluated at z, and x represents a set

of observed characteristics of the injury claim. We assume the payment amounts 2j are

given by:

(4b)   2j = exp ( x$j + vj + ej ) , j=1,2,3 ,
where (v1, v2, v3) represent cost components that are observed by the parties but
unobserved by us, and the ej represent purely random payment components that are

unanticipated by the parties. For simplicity, we assume that the ej’s are normally
distributed. Conditional on (v1, v2, v3), the payment amounts are therefore log-normally

distributed.

       The two other ingredients of the theoretical model are the workerʹs cost of

contesting a claim c, and the firmʹs cost of denying a claim d. We assume that these are

given by:

(5a)   c = x$4 + e4 ,
                                                 11

(5b)    d = x$5 + e5 ,

where e4 and e5 are normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviations s4 and s5,

respectively. We assume that the error terms (e1, e2, e3, e4, e5) are mutually uncorrelated.

        Under these assumptions the expected payment amounts, conditional on denial

and claim petition status, are as follows:



       Denial/CP Status                 Expected WC Payment Amount

       denied, contested                E1 = M((1x)exp( x$1 + v1 + s12/2 )

       denied, not contested            E2 = M((2x)exp( x$2 + v2 + s22/2 )

       not denied                       E3 = M((3x)exp( x$3 + v3 + s32/2 )


where we have made use of the formula for the expected value of a log-normally

distributed variable. Conditional on a claim being denied, and on x and (v1, v2, v3), a

worker will contest the denial if E1 - E2 > c, which occurs with probability

(6)     pc =   M [ ( E1 - E2 - x$4 ) / s4 ] .
The firm will deny a claim if pcE1 + (1-pc)E2 - E3 > d, which occurs with probability

(7)     pd =   M [ ( E3 ! pcE1 !(1-pc)E2 ! x$5 ) / s5 ] .
        The likelihood function for the observed data, conditional on x and (v1, v2, v3),

consists of six parts, as follows:
                                                   12


    Denial/CP Status/Payment                    Likelihood


     not denied, no payment                     (1-pd) (1-B3)

     not denied, payment y                      (1-pd) B3 f3(y)

     denied, no CP, no payment                  pd (1-pc) (1-B2)

     denied, no CP, payment y                   pd (1-pc) B2 f2(y)

     denied, CP, no payment                     pd pc (1-B1)

     denied, CP, payment y                      pd pc B1 f1(y)

where fj(y) is the density function for a log-normally distributed variable with Mean

[log(y)] = x$j + vj, and Variance [log(y)] = sj2.

       As in other structural econometric models, a key issue is the parameterization of

the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity in the payout functions (v1, v2, v3). We

assume that the vector (v1, v2, v3) has a point-mass distribution with a relatively small

number of points of support:

       Prob { (v1, v2, v3) = (v1k, v2k, v3k) } = qk,    for k=1,2....

This parameterization allows the unobserved heterogeneity components in (21, 22, 23)

to be arbitrarily correlated across injuries. Each point of support contributes 4

additional parameters: 3 location parameters (v1k, v2k, v3k), and a probability qk. The
overall likelihood of the observed data is then obtained by taking a probability-

weighted average of the likelihood for each point of support.



Evaluating the Model
       The model represented by equations (4)-(7) is highly restrictive. For example, it

ignores any unobserved heterogeneity in the probabilities (B1, B2, B3). Morever,

depending on the exclusion restrictions imbedded in the parameter vectors $1 - $5, the

model imposes a number of restrictions on the way the observed covariates affect the
                                             13

B’s, the 2’s, and the probabilities pd and pc. As we discuss in more detail below, in our
empirical work we include a unrestricted set of covariates in the models for the

probabilities of a positive payment, and for the conditional payment amounts, but we

assume that the cost functions (5a) and (5b) depend on only a limited set of x’s. Under

these assumptions, the x’s that are excluded from (5a) only effect pc to the extent that

they shift E1 ! E2, whereas those that are excluded from (5b) only effect pd to the extent

that they shift E3 !pcE1 !(1!pc)E2. A natural way to test the model is to compare the

predicted and actual probabilities of denying a claim (or contesting a denied claim) by

characteristics that are not directly included in x$4 and x$5. For example, if the costs c

and d are assumed to be independent of the cause and type of injury, then predicted

differences in denial rates by cause and type of injury can only arise through systematic

differences in the way that these characteristics affect the B’s, the 2’s. A high

correlation between the actual and predicted denial rates for different causes and types

of injuries would therefore provide support for the assumed structure of the model.

       Another informal way to evaluate the specification is to compare the actual and

predicted distributions of payments for each of the three denial/claim petition states.

As we show below, specifications with more points of support for the unobserved

heterogeneity vector (e.g. 5 points versus 1-3) provide a much better fit to the observed

distributions.

       Finally, a more formal test of the model can be obtained by testing the

restrictions on the functional forms of the denial and claim petition models. In

particular, the theoretical model implies that the expected payment differentials E1 !E2
and E3 !pcE1 !(1!pc)E2 enter the claim-petition filing equation and denial equation with

coefficients of unity. As an alternative, suppose that the expected cost differentials are

discounted by factors *1 and *2, respectively. Then the probabilities of contesting a

denial and denying a claim become
                                                  14

(6a)    pc =   M [ ( *1(E1 - E2) - x$4 ) / s4 ]
and

(7a)    pd =   M [ ( *2(E3 !pcE1 !(1!pc)E2 ) - x$5 ) / s5 ] ,
respectively. Since s4 and s5 do not enter any of the other equations of the model, only

the coefficient ratios ( *1/s4,   $4/s4) and (*2/s5, $5/s5) are identified. Under the assumptions
of our basic model,     *1 = *2 = 1 and therefore both *1/s4 and *2/s5 must be strictly
positive. Under the alternative assumption that injured workers and employers have

non-forward-looking behavior (or that they base their choices on factors other than their

expected payoffs), it is reasonable to test that *1/s4 > 0 and     *2/s5 > 0. This test provides a
useful check on the assumed structure of the model. If either *1/s4 or *2/s5 is negative,

or insignificantly different from zero, we can infer that the model is mis-specified.

        Closely related to this idea, note that equations (6a) and (7a) imply that pc and pd

depend only on the differences in expected payouts between the various outcome nodes.

More generally, consider the alternative models:

(6b)    pc =   M [ (*11 E1 ! *12 E2 ! x$4)/s4 ] ,
(7b)    pd =   M [ (*21 E3 ! *22 pcE1 ! *22(1!pc)E2 ! x$5)/s5 ] .
The validity of our model and specification can be evaluated by testing that (*11/s4) =

(*12/s4) and that (*21/s5)=(*22/s5)=(*23/s5).16


III. Data Description and Preliminary Analysis

        Before turning to a formal econometric analysis of the model described in the

previous section, we present an overview of the Minnesota WC data and results from a

descriptive analysis of the decision processes of the two parties. As noted earlier, our

main data source is a 10 percent random sample of the first reports of injuries filed with


    Exclusion of some of the x’s from x$’4 and x$’5 is likely to increase the power of
   16

these tests. In the absence of such exclusions, the * parameters are essentially identified
by functional form.
                                             15

the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry between 1985 and 1989. We also have

information on 100 percent of the denied claims from the same time period, allowing us

to construct more accurate tallies for the subset of denied injuries. Throughout this

paper, we analyze only those injury claims with valid (non-missing) data on the date of

the injury and the injured workerʹs gender and pre-injury wage.17 Characteristics of the

resulting sample are presented in column 1 of Table 1. We also present data for the

subsample of claims involving a back injury in column 2, and for back injuries by denial

status in columns 3 and 4.

       The means in column 1 suggest that injured workers are relatively young,

predominantly male, and typically employed in blue-collar occupations. The

characteristics of workers with back injuries are fairly similar to those of the overall

sample (compare column 2 to column 1), as are the characteristics of workers with a

back injury whose claims were either denied or not (columns 3 and 4). The industry

distributions for the various subgroups are shown in rows 6-9. Again, these are not too

different, though service workers account for a larger fraction of back injuries than they

do of overall injuries, and injured construction workers appear to be less likely to have

their claim denied than those from other industries. Rows 10-12 of the table show the

fraction of claims arising from firms with three key types of insurance arrangements:

self-insurance; insurance through the state-run competitive fund; and coverage through

the stateʹs assigned risk pool. (The remainder of firms are insured with private

insurers). Comparing the percentages in columns 2, 3, and 4, it appears that self-

insured firms have slightly higher denial rates than other insurers, while denial rates at

firms covered by the assigned risk pool are nearly twice as high as average. Finally, the

bottom rows of Table 1 show mean denial rates and on the average indemnity


  17
    These requirements eliminate about 10 percent of the sample. The main missing
variable is the injured workerʹs weekly wage.
                                             16

payments associated with different types of injuries. Employers denied liability for

approximately 11 percent of all injury claims filed in the late 1980s, and a very similar

fraction of back injuries. As shown in rows 14 and 15, back injuries are more likely to

generate a positive indemnity payment to the injured worker, and are substantially

more costly than other injuries.

       As we noted in the discussion of Figure 1, the probability of receiving WC

payments and the mean level of payments differ significantly between denied and non-

denied claims. Although denied claims are less likely to generate payments, the mean

level of payments among denied claims with a positive payment is much higher. Figure

3 shows smoothed estimates of the frequency distributions of log indemnity payments

(conditional on a positive payment) by denial status. The entire distribution of

payments for denied claims is shifted to the right relative to the distribution for claims

that were not denied. Interestingly, the distributions of log payments for both types of

claims are bimodal.

       Figure 4 presents similar plots of the conditional distributions of indemnity

payments for claims that were denied and not contested (left panel), or denied and

contested (right panel). The two distributions are quite different: the mean payment

for denied and not contested cases (conditional on a positive amount) is $5943, whereas

the mean for denied and contested claims is $18,956. The non-contested denials have a

bimodal distribution similar to the overall distribution for non-denied cases, whereas

the denied and contested cases have a unimodal distribution centered close to the

second peak of the denied and uncontested cases.

       Although back injuries constitute a relatively homogeneous subset of WC claims,

there are still significant differences in claim characteristics by the type and cause of the

injury. Some of these differences are documented in Table 2, which presents claim

characteristics – including denial rates, CP-filing rates, and payment data – for 4
                                            17

different injury types and 6 different injury causes.18 Claims with either the type or

cause of the injury coded as unknown or missing have relatively high denial rates and

relatively low probabilities of a positive payment. In cases where payments are made

for these injuries, however, the mean payment tends to be high. Dislocation injuries are

also characterized by relatively high denial rates and higher-than-average CP-filing

rates, although the probability of payment for these injuries is not significantly lower

than average.

       We have also conducted a descriptive multivariate analysis of the probabilities

that a claim is denied, that a denied claim in contested, and that positive indemnity

payments are made conditional on denial and contest status. We included in these

models information on the injured worker, on the injury type and cause, and on the

insurance arrangements of the firm (see Appendix Table 1). A key fact that arises from

these models is that denial rates vary substantially with insurance arrangements, with

the highest denial rates for firms in the Assigned Risk Pool. Interestingly, differences in

denial rates across carriers are only partially explained by the nature of the injuries and

the types of workers covered by different carriers.



Simple Descriptive Models
       As a final step in our descriptive analysis we attempted to provide some simple

evidence on the empirical plausibility of the two key behavioral equations in our model.

Equation (6) states that the probability that an injured worker contests a denial (pc)
depends on the gap between the expected indemnity payment for a denied and

contested injury (E1) and for a denied and uncontested injury (E2). Equation (7) states

that the probability the firm denies liability (pd) depends on the gap between the

  18
   We use the 100% sample of denied claims to construct the means for denied claims
shown in this table.
                                              18

indemnity payment for a non-denied claim (E3) and the expected payment if the claim is

denied ( pcE1 + (1-pc)E2 ). To evaluate these hypotheses, we began by fitting a set of

probit and linear regression models for the probability of a positive payment, and total

payment amount (if positive) for injury claims that were denied and contested, denied

but not contested, and not denied. Each of the 6 models included 29 explanatory

variables: linear and quadratic terms in age, indicators for gender and marital status, an

indicator for a blue collar occupation, the log of the pre-injury weekly wage, 4

indicators for injuries of various types and causes, 3 indicators for insurance type (self-

insured firms, those in the State Fund, and those in the Assigned Risk Pool with the

omitted category being a private carrier), 4 dummies for WC benefit replacement rate,

and dummies for 1-digit industry and year.19 ,20 We then used these models to estimate

the expected payment amounts E1, E2, E3 for each injury in the sample. We also fit a

simple probit model for the probability that the worker filed a claim petition if the

injury was denied with the same set of 29 observed covariates. The full set of models is

reported in Appendix Tables 1 and 2.

        For all the injuries that were denied, we then used a local linear regression

procedure to estimate the relationship between (E1!E2) and the probability that the

injured worker contested the denial. The resulting fit is shown in Figure 5. Note that

the estimated expected gain to contesting a denial is nearly always positive, with a 10th
percentile value of $4,800 and a 90th percentile value of $17,016. Consistent with the



   19
    The four injury type and cause variables included in the models were selected after
considerable experimentation, and generally give as good a fit as a complete set of
indicators for the injury type and cause.
   20
    During the time period under consideration, the temporary total disability benefit schedule
in Minnesota set replacement rates equal to 67 percent for many workers, but because of
minimum and maximum benefit rates and other features, replacement rates could range from
substantially below 67% (for high-wage workers) to over 100% (for low-wage workers). The
dummies indicate whether the replacement rate is 67%, between 67% and 100%, equal to 100%,
or over 100%, with an omitted category for replacement rates under 67%.
                                             19

basic insight of our model, the probability of contesting a claim is an increasing function

of the expected payoff. Of course this finding has to be interpreted carefully, because

(unlike the results from our full model, presented below) the calculation of (E1!E2)

ignores any correlation between the unobserved determinants of E1 and E2, and

resulting selectivity bias in the payment amounts observed for the two types of

settlements.

       Next, we used our estimates of E1, E2, and E3, together with the unrestricted

probit estimate of pc, to form an estimate of the payoff to the firm of denying liability.

We then used a local linear regression procedure to estimate the relationship between

the payoff (E3!pcE1!(1!pc)E2) and the probability of denying liability. The results are

shown in Figure 6. Interestingly, for many injuries this simple procedure suggests that

the expected payoff to denying liability is negative. Over most of the range of the data

the probability of denying liability is positively related to the firm’s expected payoff for

denial, confirming the prediction of our model. Again, we stress that this simple

evidence has to be interpreted carefully in light of the potential effects of unobserved

heterogeneity in the payoffs. Nevertheless, we view the results in Figures 5 and 6 as

supportive of the basic structure of our model.



IV. Structural Estimation of a the Model
Estimation Results

       We fit a series of versions of our structural model with different numbers of

points of support for the unobserved heterogeneity distribution, including a baseline

model with no heterogeneity, and specifications with 2, 3, and 5 mass points. Using the

Akaike information criterion, we found that the 5 mass point model provided the best

fit to the data. Following up on the discussion in Section II, we also compared the

predicted and actual distributions of log indemnity payments implied by the alternative
                                             20

models at each outcome node. The results of these comparisons are summarized in

Figures 7 through 9, which show the predicted and actual log cost distributions for

injury claims that were accepted without denial, denied and contested, and denied and

not contested, respectively, from each of the four alternative model specifications.21 As

can be seen from these figures, the 5 mass point model is the only specification that

successfully reproduces the bimodal log cost distributions for claims that were accepted

without denial and for claims that were denied and not contested.

       Parameter estimates from this specification are presented in Table 3. The first

panel of the table reports the estimates for equations (6) and (7) – the models for the

probability of denying a claim, and contesting a denied claim, respectively. The second

panel presents the estimates of equations (4b), which specify the conditional claim

amounts 21,   22, and 23 for each of the three possible ending states. Finally, the third
panel of Table 3 presents estimates of the models for the probability of a positive

payment in each state (i.e., the models for B1, B2, and B3). The models for 2j and Bj

(j=1,2,3) include a total of 13 covariates: a linear and quadratic term in age, a gender

dummy, a dummy for blue collar occupation, log pre-injury weekly wage, controls for 4

different causes/types of injuries, and a set of 4 dummies indicating the WC benefit

replacement rate. The latter variables are included to capture the possibility that claim

durations (and hence injury claim costs) are affected in part, by the relative generosity

of WC benefits (Thomason, 1994).

       In contrast to the unrestricted nature of the models for 2j and Bj, we include only
a few selected control variables in the contest and denial models (equations 6 and 7,

respectively). Recall that control variables enter these equations only to the extent that

they affect the firm’s cost of denying an injury, d, or the worker’s cost of contesting a

claim, c. We assume that denial costs vary with the worker’s wage, and with the firm’s

insurance carrier. Based on evidence from Appendix Table 1, and some

experimentation, we decided to include only 3 insurance carrier dummies. On the

employee side, we assume that the cost of contesting a claim varies with a worker’s

wage, and with age and marital status. For our basic specifications we assume that

employees discount the expected monetary payoff to contesting a denial by a factor of

*1, and that employers discount the expected payoff to denying a claim by a factor *2.
Strictly speaking, the estimated discount factors shown in Table 3 are estimates of *1/s4

and   *2/s5.
        The parameter estimate for the discount factor in the denial equation (see column

1 in the first panel of Table 3) suggests that employers are forward-looking, in the sense

that an increase in the expected gain from denying a claim significantly increases the

probability that the claim will be denied. Evaluated at the sample means for the

various payouts this estimate implies that a 10% reduction in pc (the probability that a

claimant will contest a denied claim) raises the probability of denial by 78% (from 11 to

18 percent). Thus, employers appear to be more likely to deny claimants that have a

lower probability of “fighting back”. The corresponding estimate of *1 in the contest

equation (column 2) is also positive and statistically significant, suggesting that injured

workers are similarly forward looking. Using the mean values for the payouts at the

various outcome stages, the estimate of 7.868 implies that a $1000 increase in the

expected benefits of contesting a denial increases the probability of fighting back by

9.9% (from about 25 to 28 percent). The other parameter estimates in the denial

equation suggest that claims from more highly-paid workers are more likely to be

denied, and that self insured employers and those in the assigned risk pool are more

likely to deny a claim than those with private coverage, while employers in the state

fund are less likely to deny a claim. The parameter estimates in the contest decision
                                             22

model suggest that there is a “check-shaped” age profile in the willingness to contest a

denied injury, with the strongest likelihood of contesting a denial among older workers.

Married workers are also somewhat more likely to contest a denial.

       Turning to the parameter estimates for the conditional payment amounts and the

payment probabilities, notice that the age, gender, blue collar, and wage effects have a

complex pattern across the six equations. One consistent finding is that higher-wage

workers have more costly indemnity claims, conditional on a positive payment. Since

temporary total disability benefits are proportional to pre-injury wages (subject to

various minimums and maximums) this makes sense. Offsetting the higher payment

amounts conditional on a positive payment, however, the probability of receiving an

indemnity payment is lower for more highly paid workers in two of the three outcome

stages. Female workers are more likely to receive positive payouts at any stage of the

process, although the effects are not very large. The age effects on the probabilities of a

positive payout, and on the conditional amount of the payout, are also relatively small

and unsystematic.

       While lost time indemnity payments in Minnesota are based on simple two-

thirds replacement rate formula, there is a lot of variation in the actual replacement rate,

induced by the presence of minimum and maximum benefit rules. Claimants with

higher benefit rates may have less incentive to return to work in a timely fashion after

suffering an injury (Krueger, 1990; Meyer et al. 1995). They may also have a greater

incentive to file claims with questionable validity, since if they are successful they

receive a larger WC payment relative to the opportunity cost of working at their pre-

injury wage. These observations have led some observers to hypothesize that

employers are more likely to deny claims filed by workers with higher benefit

replacement rates (e.g., Thomason, 1994).
                                             23

       To evaluate the potential impacts of differing replacement rates on the various

payout components in our model, we included a total of 4 dummy variables, indicating

whether the injured worker’s replacement rate was greater than 1, exactly equal to 1,

between 2/3 and 1, or exactly equal to 2/3.22 The omitted category is for workers with

replacement rates under 2/3: these are the workers affected by the maximum benefit

provision. The estimated models for the probability of a positive payment (in the third

panel of Table 3) show an interesting pattern of effects associated with these dummies.

The probabilities of an indemnity payment if the claim is accepted, or denied and

contested, are both monotonically decreasing in the replacement rate. For claims that

are denied and not contested the probability of a positive payment is less strongly

related to the replacement rate, though it appears that workers with replacement rates

under 2/3 have the lowest likelihood of a positive payment in this case.      To

summarize the implied effects of variation in the replacement rate on the observed

behavior of the parties, we calculated for each injury claim the predicted probability

that the claim was denied, and contested if denied, under the assumption that the

injured worker’s replacement rate was equal to either 2/3 or 1. We then averaged these

predicted probabilities across all workers in the sample. The results, shown in the

following table, suggest that higher replacement rates are indeed associated with a

higher probability of claim denial, but with relatively little change in the probability of

contesting a denied claim:




  22
    The schedule for temporary total disability payments in Minnesota in the late 1980s
included a two-step minimum: an unconditional minimum (which could result in a
replacement rate over 1) and a conditional minimum (which resulted in a significant
subset of workers receiving a replacement rate of exactly 1).

Note that the implied effects of the replacement rate on denial and contest behavior

work through the implicit cost calculations of the parties: our denial and contest models

exclude any direct effect of the replacement rate.




Evaluating the Model

       To test the adequacy of our structural model, we examined whether the

predicted distribution of denials across different injury cases matches the actual

distribution. As mentioned above, several variables (including the replacement rate

and the cause and type of injury) only impact denial probabilities through their effects

on the expected net benefit of denying a claim. Thus, to check model adequacy we

computed actual and predicted denial frequencies within replacement rate × gender ×

injury-cause × injury-type cells. For simplicity, we grouped injury causes into two

groups (slip, other), injury types into three categories (dislocations, unknown, and

“other”), and replacement rates into two categories: less than two-thirds and greater

and equal to two-thirds. Thus, we have a total of 24 (=2×2×2×3) cells. The predicted

and actual numbers of denials in each cell are shown in Table 4. Overall, the model

does a relatively good job of predicting the distribution of denials across cells: a simple

Chi-square statistic for the goodness of fit is 20.7 , which is below the expected value of

a Chi-squared variate with 23 degrees of freedom.
                                             25

       As a second test of the structural model, we estimated the decision models of the

worker and the firm, allowing for separate coefficients on the sub-components of the

expected payoffs associated with each of the 3 final outcomes. In particular, following

the specification of equation (6b), we included E1 and E2 with separate coefficients in the

model for the probability of contesting a denied claim. At the same time, following

equation (7b), we included E3, pcE1, and (1!pc)E2 with separate coefficients in the model

for the probability of denying a claim. The resulting coefficient estimates are somewhat

imprecise, but the overall log likelihood of the model is not much different than the

likelihood for the more restrictive specification shown in Table 3. In particular, the test

for the 3 implied restrictions in our structural model yields a Chi-square statistic of 2.4,

which has a probability value of 0.5. Thus, these restrictions are not rejected by the data.

       Finally, we used the parameter estimates from our model to evaluate the effect of

imposing a penalty (or “tax”) on employers in the event that a denied claim was

contested and subsequently found valid, where we define the latter outcome as cases

where a denied and contested claim resulted in a positive payout. Specifically, we

assumed that if the claimant wins the claim dispute then the employer must pay the

claimant an additional $1000 . Assuming that this change has no effect on the other

parameters of the model, or on the distribution of injury claims filed by workers, our

structural estimates imply that the imposition of such a penalty would cause the denial

rate for back injury claims to decline from 10.8% to 5.7%, and would also lead to a

decline in the probability of a claimant contesting a denied claim, from 30% to 22%. The

average costs of accepted claims would decline from $6,730 to $6,334 while the average

costs of denied and contested claims would rise from $19,367 to 21,256 (excluding

penalty costs). Thus, a tax on denials that are subsequently found to be valid would

lower the rate of litigation over liability, and cause a compositional shift that reduces

the number of lower-cost injuries that are litigated.

V. Conclusions

       This paper presents a model of liability disputes in the workers’ compensation

system. A simple sequential asymmetric information model is developed and

structurally estimated using data from the state of Minnesota. We find that employers

are more likely to deny liability for injury claims when their expected gains from doing

so are larger. In particular, they are more likely to deny liability when faced by an

injury claimant who is less likely to “fight back” if denied. Claimants, on the other

hand, are more likely to contest denied claims when their expected returns from

fighting back are larger.

       For back claims, the structural model fit the data reasonably well, and provides a

relatively successful explanation for the distribution of liability disputes across different

injury classes. Whether it would perform as well for other types of injury claims is left

for future research. The model was tailored explicitly for the dispute system in

Minnesota. Since WC laws and dispute procedures differ across states, it may not be

directly applicable to other states. Moreover, because of data limitations, we only

modeled the first two steps of the dispute process and made no attempt to disentangle

the various factors governing subsequent stages of litigation. Nevertheless, when richer

data become available, we believe it may prove fruitful to develop and estimate more

complete models of the dispute process that build on the model presented here.
