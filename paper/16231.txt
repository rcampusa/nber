                                             ABSTRACT

It has been a well-known puzzle why the yen has not been used more in trade invoicing among Japanese
exporters. Despite the yen’s status as an only fully convertible currency in Asia, two patterns stand
out as puzzling features of an excessively small share of yen invoicing: First, a strong tendency of
Japanese exporters to choose importer's currency in their exports to advanced countries, and second,
the prevalence of US dollar invoicing in Japanese exports to East Asia even though Japanese firms
have built a regional production network in the last two decades. New possible determinants of currency
invoicing at a firm-level are found through interviews with Japanese representative exporting firms.
Invoicing behavior is examined by probit estimation using the unique data set on the firms' currency
invoicing choice by destination. Our novel findings suggest that a surprisingly low share of yen invoicing
among Japanese exports even in the 2000s can be attributable to (1) a scale-economy in concentrating
currency risk at the headquarter as intra-firm trades with overseas operations of Japanese firms grew;
and (2) the production/trade structure of Japanese electronics companies in Asia in which final products
tend to be exported to the United States or Europe.

1. Introduction

          Exporter’s price setting and currency invoicing practices have important implications for
how macroeconomic shocks are transmitted to and from foreign countries. Whereas a lot of attention
has been paid to this issue, detailed data and information on the invoicing choice by
industry/commodity and by destination/source country are rarely published or disclosed. Although the
aggregate data are available in some countries, they are not sufficient for a rigorous empirical
examination.
          There are three strands of empirical studies on the invoicing choice. The first strand of
research is to conduct a cross-country analysis of the invoicing choice by collecting as many
information as possible on the share of currency invoicing at a country level (Goldberg and Tille, 2008,
Kamps, 2006). Second, Goldberg and Tille (2009) utilize the highly detailed Canadian import data at a
customs level spanning from February 2002 to February 2009 with rich information on the source
country, invoice currency, and value of transactions, etc.1 The determinants of invoicing currency
choice in Canadian imports are empirically tested using a large number of observations. It is difficult
to follow the approach of Goldberg and Tille (2009) because such a highly detailed customs level data
is rarely available. Third, Friberg and Wilander (2008) made a questionnaire survey analysis with
Swedish exporting firms and conducted empirical tests on determinants of currency invoicing, which
is a useful approach to obtain the detailed data at a firm level.
          The purpose of this paper is to analyze the determinants of currency invoicing in Japanese
exports. To overcome the limitation of data availability, we employ a different approach from the
previous studies. Specifically, we conducted interviews with 23 Japanese representative firms in the
four industries—automobile, electrical machinery, general machinery and electrical component—in
order to obtain information on their currency invoicing practices and their exchange rate risk
management. New evidence on the destination breakdown share of currency invoicing is obtained for
the above four industries. It is found that (1) Japanese exporters tend to invoice in importer’s currency
when destination is an advanced country and (2) the share of US dollar invoicing is larger than that of
yen invoicing in Japanese exports to Asia. They violate one of the well-known stylized facts of the
currency invoicing pattern, such as Grassman (1973, 1976). To solve these puzzles, we conducted
interviews of (the finance department of) representative Japanese firms. The following possible
determinants of currency invoicing among Japanese exporters emerged from the interviews: (i) Who
are trading partners. Intra- or inter-firm trade, or exports through Sogo Shosha (Japanese trading
companies); (ii) Costs of exchange rate hedging; (iii) The degree of market competition and
differentiation of exporting products; (iv) Exports from Asian production base to the final retail

1
  Donnenfeld and Haug (2003, 2008) also use the similar data set in testing the determinants of currency
invoicing in Canadian and US imports.

destination, namely the US market. We supplement the survey with a firm-level data set obtained from
annual financial statements of each sample firm, we conduct probit estimation to reveal the
determinants of currency invoicing at a firm-level export.
          Our novel findings are three-fold. First, invoicing in importer’s currency is prevalent in
Japanese exports to advanced countries, because most of their exports are destined for local retail
subsidiaries. To the extent that the sales and/or production subsidiaries face severe competition in the
local markets, Japanese parent firms have a strong tendency to assume an exchange rate risk of
intra-firm trade by invoicing in the local (importer’s) currency, which conforms to the
pricing-to-market (PTM) behavior discussed in the literature.2 Second, Japanese firms that export
highly differentiated products or have a dominant share in global markets tend to invoice their
products in the yen for exports to advanced countries as well as exports to developing countries. Third,
although Japanese firms have shifted their production bases to Asian countries, exports from these
Asian production subsidiaries tend to be invoiced in US dollars as long as the final destination market
is in the United States. Then in order to avoid currency risk at the assembly in Asia, Japanese parents
export with invoices in the US dollar even in exports from Japanese head office to the production
subsidiaries in Asia. Thus, a smaller share of yen invoicing in Japanese exports even in the 2000s is
due not only to the growing intra-firm trade promoted by active overseas operations of Japanese firms
but also to the development of Japanese production network and trade structure in Asia driven mainly
by Japanese electronics companies. As long as US dollar invoicing is prevalent in Asia, both Japanese
and Asian firms have no choice but to take exchange rate risks against the US dollar. This aspect will
have important implications for a new strategy of optimal exchange rate risk management and, hence,
establishing regional currency arrangements such as a common currency basket in East Asia.
          The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the puzzling
evidences of the Japan’s currency invoicing pattern. Section 3 explains the details of our interview
analysis. In Section 4, the new evidence of the Japanese currency invoicing pattern at a firm level is
presented. In Section 5, possible determinants of an invoice currency are derived from the interview
analysis. These determinants are tested empirically using a new firm-level dataset. Finally, Section 6
concludes.



2. Puzzles of the Japanese Currency Invoicing Pattern

          It is often pointed out that the currency invoicing pattern of Japanese trade differs markedly

from that of other advanced countries.3 Table 1 compares the share of both domestic currency
invoicing and US dollar invoicing across six advanced countries. First, the Japan’s share of domestic
currency invoicing is the smallest among the six countries even in the 2000s. Only 40.1 percent and
23.8 percent are invoiced in the yen as of 2004 in Japan’s exports and imports, respectively. Second,
the US dollar invoicing is particularly high in Japan's exports and imports compared to other advanced
countries except the United States. It is only in Japan that the share of US dollar invoicing exceeds that
of the domestic currency invoicing in both exports and imports.

               More generally, how is Japanese pattern of invoicing understood in light of the empirical
regularities, or ―classical stylized facts‖, discussed in the literature? The following stylized facts tell us
that the invoicing choice is conditional on a trading partner country and the characteristics of goods

3
    See, for instance, Tavlas and Ozeki (1992), Ito (1993), Fukuda and Ji (1994), Kawai (1996) and Sato (1999).

    Classical Stylized Fact 1: Trade of manufactured products between advanced countries tends to
       be invoiced in the exporter’s currency, which is known as the ―Grassman’s Law‖ (Grassman,
       1973, 1976).
    Classical Stylized Fact 2: Trade of manufactured products between advanced and developing
       countries tends to be invoiced in the advanced country’s currency or, to a lesser extent, in a
       major international currency such as the US dollar (Grassman, 1973, and Page, 1977, 1981).
    Classical Stylized Fact 3:        Differentiated products such as machinery products tend to be
       invoiced in the exporter’s currency. More homogeneous products such as crude oil and primary
       commodity are typically invoiced in the international currency such as the US dollar
       (McKinnon, 1979).


           Dose the Japan’s currency invoicing pattern correspond to the classical stylized facts? Figure
1 shows that the Japanese currency invoicing pattern differs across destination countries (regions).
First, in Japanese exports to the world, the share of the yen rose from 28.9 percent in 1980 to 42
percent in 1983, and then declined to 33.4 percent in 1987. Such a fall of the yen invoicing share from
1983 is generally attributed to the PTM strategy of Japanese exporters.5 Specifically, during a rapid
appreciation period of the yen against the US dollar from 1985 to 1987, Japanese firms are said to
have stabilized the selling price in the local (US) market by invoicing in US dollars in order to
maintain their own market share. Since the mid-1980s to the present, the share of yen invoicing has
fluctuated within the range from 30 to 40 percent in Japan’s exports to the world.
           Second, the destination breakdown data gives us more interesting evidence, though the data
is available only from 1987. The share of yen invoicing is very low in exports to the United States,
which may partly reflect a special position of the US dollar as an international currency (Tavlas and
Ozeki, 1992). Even in exports to the Euro area, the share of yen invoicing has declined from 44.0
percent in 1987 to 28 percent in 2009. Although not reported in Figure 1(c), 50-51 percent of Japanese
exports to EU were invoiced in the euro as of 2009.6 The above observation strongly suggests that
Japanese firms tend to choose local currency invoicing in exports to advanced countries, which
conflicts with the classical stylized fact 1. This is one of the puzzles of the Japan’s invoicing choice.
As will be discussed below, this puzzle has to do with a growing intra-firm trade as well as the PTM
behavior of Japanese exporting firms.7


4
  Ligthart and da Silva (2007) make a good literature review and propose the following three stylized facts.
5
  See Krugman (1987), Marston (1990, 1991) and Tavlas and Ozeki (1992).
6
  If including the UK pound in the local currency, the share of local currency invoicing in Japanese exports to
EU amounts to 54-56 percent in 2009.

               Third and more importantly, the share of yen invoicing has not increased much since 1990 in
Japanese exports to Asia. Specifically, the share of both the yen and the US dollar accounts for about
50 percent from the 1990s to 2009 in Japanese exports to Asia, and the share of US dollar invoicing
exceeds that of yen invoicing for the last few years (Figure 1(d)). This evidence is contradictory to the
classical stylized fact 2, in that the share of US dollar invoicing accounts for 50 percent or more in
Japan's total exports to Asia.
               Such an invoicing pattern is puzzling, because until around the mid-1990s, when a question
of the internationalization of the yen was lively debated, it was generally conjectured that the use of

Knetter (1989, 1992), Marston (1990), Takagi and Yoshida (2001) and Parsons and Sato (2008).

                                                             7
the yen as an invoice currency would be growing in Asia if intra-firm trade increased between
Japanese parent companies and local subsidiaries through active foreign direct investment in Asia by
Japanese firms.8 In particular, as most exports from Japan to Asia were regarded as capital goods and
differentiated products, the share of yen invoicing was expected to increase steadily, as suggested by
the classical stylized fact 3. Figure 1(d) clearly shows, however, that the share of yen invoicing has not
increased from 1990 to the present, even though Japanese firms have built a regional production
network during that period. Instead, US dollar invoicing is far more prevalent than suggested by the
classical stylized facts. To get a clue to understanding of this second puzzle of the Japan’s currency
invoicing pattern, it is necessary to obtain the detailed data on the invoicing choice of Japanese exports
both by commodity/industry and by destination. Since the detailed data is not published, we conducted
an interview analysis with major Japanese exporting firms to collect a firm-level data, which will be
discussed in the next section.



3．The Interview with Major Japanese Exporting Firms

3-1．Sample Firms of the Interview Analysis


          To solve the puzzles of Japan’s currency invoicing pattern, we conducted an interview with
23 Japanese representative exporting companies in two consecutive years: the 1st interview was in
2007 (September–November 2007) and the 2nd interview in 2008 (July–December 2008).9 The 23
sample firms were chosen from four major machinery industries: the automobile, electrical machinery,
machinery, and electrical component industries.10
          Our strategy of an interview analysis is to focus on the two largest industries, the electrical
machinery and automobile industries, in terms of export amounts and sales abroad. Table 2 shows the
basic information of our sample firms. We finally made an interview with 9 firms in the automobile
industry and with 7 firms in the electrical machinery industry. In terms of foreign sales, the 9
automobile firms account for 79 percent of all transport equipment firms that are listed in Tokyo Stock
Exchange (TSE) in the fiscal year 2007. The share of our 7 electrical machinery firms also amounts to
55 percent of all electric appliance firms listed in TSE. Thus, although the share is very small in terms


8
   Kawai (1996), for instance, pointed out that the international use of the yen would naturally grow as Japan’s
economic interdependence with Asia deepened through intra-industry trade, foreign direct investments and
various types of financial flows.
9
   In most cases, we made an interview with a director of the finance department of sample firms based on the
questionnaires that we had sent before visiting them.
10
    As might be expected, it is very difficult to make an appointment with Japanese companies for interview. With
the help of METI and RIETI, we could finally interview 23 machinery companies. Due to the time constraint, we
could not interview with many candidate companies from the machinery and electrical component industries.

                                                       8
of the number of firms, the result of interviews with our sample firms provides a comprehensive
picture of currency invoicing practices of major Japanese exporting firms.

            In addition, we made an additional interview with 4 electrical component firms and with 3
machinery firms. Some of these firms are said to have strong competitiveness in their exports, as they
have a large market share or export highly differentiated products, which enables us to take into
account in our analysis the currency invoicing practices of these companies that have strong export
competitiveness. Other firms, especially electrical component firms, operate actively in Asian by
building a production network and facilitating intra-firm trade. These aspects will give us new insights
into the puzzles of Japanese exporter’s invoicing practices.


3-2. Questionnaires


            Our interview research is conducted based on the questionnaire entries that are composed of
the following four topics.


                                                               9
(1) Production and Sales Structure: To comprehend the profile of each company, we asked the
    following questions: (i) the production structure (whether to have overseas production
    subsidiaries), (ii) the sales structure (whether to have overseas sales subsidiaries and regional head
    quarters; whether to trade through Sogo Shosha (Japanese trading companies); whether there is
    any difference between physical distribution and commercial distribution of goods), (iii)
    characteristics of goods traded (such as competitiveness and market share), (iv) Basic policy on
    the exchange rate risk management.


(2) Invoice Currency: Our main interest is in collecting the destination breakdown data on currency
    invoicing at a firm level. Our questions are which currency is used (i) in exports from Japan to
    each destination country, (ii) in exports from Japan to overseas sales and/or production
    subsidiaries, and (iii) in exports from overseas production subsidiaries to final destination markets.
    Furthermore, we asked whether the invoicing choice is affected by (iv) inter- or intra-firm trade
    and by (v) characteristics of products traded such as the degree of product differentiation.


(3) Exchange Rate Risk Management: We asked questions about which kind of hedging strategies
    they use (forward, future and options through market, marry and netting, etc.)


(4) Revision of Price Setting: Our question is whether they periodically change the export price itself
    irrespective of the invoicing choice. We also asked whether they have any explicit policy of price
    revision in the face of sharp and large fluctuations of the exchange rate.



4．New Evidence of the Choice of an Invoice Currency

         Through the interviews, we obtained the detailed data on currency invoicing from most
sample firms. To assure anonymity, however, the actual share of currency invoicing for each sample
firm will not be presented in this paper. Instead, we present the evidence of the sample firms’ invoicing
choice in the following two ways.


4-1. The Share of Currency Invoicing by Industry


         We first aggregate the firm-level data into the industry share of currency invoicing in exports
to the world and Asia. Sample mean and median (in parenthesis) of the invoicing share for each
industry are reported in Table 3. Not all sample firms answered the share of currency invoicing in


                                                   10
exports to the world and Asia: 14 out of 23 firms answered the invoicing share in exports to the world
and 18 out of 23 firms in exports to Asia. For the rest of sample firms, we reasonably assess the share
of currency invoicing for each firm. Suppose some firms did not show us the invoicing share in
exports to the world, but provided us with the information on the invoicing share in exports to North
America (the United States), the Euro area and Asia. In this case, we obtained the regional breakdown
data on their foreign sales from the annual securities report of the sample firms concerned, which
enables us to compute the firm’s invoicing share in exports to the world with the reasonable
assumption that the firm’s exports are destined for the above three regions.11 As a result, the data for
21 firms are used to calculate the simple average share of currency invoicing in exports to the world,
and the data for 22 firms in exports to Asia.
         The following notable pattern of currency invoicing is observed in Table 3. First, when
looking at the simple average share (all sample firms) of currency invoicing in exports to the world,
the US dollar accounts for 51.6 percent, the euro 14.0 percent, and the yen 29.9 percent. The share of
US dollar invoicing is somewhat higher in Table 3 than in Figure 1, while the yen invoicing share is
lower in Table 3 than in Figure 1. It is true even in the simple average share in exports to Asia. This
observation suggests that our sample firms have a tendency to use the US dollar more (the yen less)
than what we observed in Figure 1.
         Second, turning to the industry data, there is a marked difference in the invoicing pattern
across industries. In exports to the world, more than 70 percent are invoiced in US dollars in the
electrical machinery and electrical component industries, while only about 12 percent are in the yen.
In contrast, the share of yen invoicing is 61.7 percent in exports of machinery firms to the world,
which may reflect machinery firms’ relative strength in export competitiveness.
         Third, turning to exports to Asia, the difference in the invoicing choice across industries
becomes far more evident. The share of US dollar invoicing is 93 percent in the electrical machinery
industry and 88.8 percent in the electrical component industry, while the share of yen invoicing is 80
percent in the machinery industry. More interestingly, the share of yen invoicing in exports to Asia
becomes much higher (65.6 percent) in the automobile industry. To solve the puzzles, that is the high
share of dollar in exports to Asia, of Japan’s currency invoicing pattern, it is necessary to analyze why
such a sharp difference is observed across industries and how the industry characteristics are related
with the invoicing choice.




11
  Because of a lack of information, we could not assess the invoicing share reasonably for two electrical
machinery firms, whose data were treated as a missing value.

                 Fourth, Table 3 does not show any clear relationship between the invoicing share and the
share of foreign sales by region. The sixth through ninth columns in Table 3 report the average share
of foreign sales and the regional breakdown of the share of foreign sales.12 Interestingly, the share of
sales in Asia differs markedly across industries. The machinery and electrical component industries
show a very high share of sales in Asia: 48.2 percent in the machinery industry and 57 percent in the
electrical component industry. However, these two industries show a very different pattern of the
invoicing choice as discussed above.


4-2．The “Main Invoice Currency” by Region


                 We have so far investigated the currency invoicing choice of major Japanese firms by
industry. To advance our analysis of the destination specific invoicing choice while assuring
anonymity of the sample firms, we employ the ―main invoice currency‖ approach in this subsection.

12
   ―Foreign sales by region‖ reported in the consolidated financial statement of the annual securities report is not
identical to the export from Japan to each region, because the former includes the data on the sales of overseas
subsidiaries in the local market and/or abroad. Nevertheless, ―foreign sales by region‖ can be regarded as a proxy
variable for the share of exports from Japan to each region. For further details, see Appendices 4 and 5.

                                                                       12
The main invoice currency is defined as the most frequently used currency in exports to the destination
country. Our interview analysis reveals that a single currency tends to be used in exports to each
destination. However, there are several firms that use two or more invoice currencies in exports to a
single destination country, in which case the main invoice currency does not mean that the currency is
100 percent used in exports.13
          Table 4 shows the currency invoicing in exports from Japan to advanced countries including
Mexico and Russia. In this table, we count the number of firms that use one of four currencies as the
main invoice currency for each destination. For instance, looking at the far left of the first row in Table
4, [20/22] indicates that 20 out of 22 sample firms use the US dollar as the main invoice currency in
exports to the United States. Industry breakdown data are also reported in the 2nd through 5th rows.
No figures in the table mean that the firm does not export to the region/country in question, or that we
could not get any clear answers about the main invoice currency.
          Table 4 shows the choice of the main invoice currency by destination and by industry in
2007-2008. First, importer’s currency invoicing is prevalent in Japanese exports to advanced countries.
In exports to the United States, 20 out of 22 firms use the US dollar as the main invoice currency. In
exports to the Euro area, 14 out of 21 firms choose the euro as the main invoice currency, while the
yen is the main invoice currency for 5 firms. The importer’s currency is evidently chosen even in
exports to UK, Australia and Canada.
          Second, in contrast to the case of advanced countries, the importer’s currency is rarely used
in Mexico and Russia. Instead, the US dollar is chosen as the main invoice currency in both countries.
Third, even in exports to the United States and the Euro area, several Japanese firms in machinery and
electrical component industries use the yen as the main invoice currency. These firms clearly answered
to our interviews with recognition of high export competitiveness in the global markets. This conforms
with stylized fact No. 3. Fourth, the electrical machinery firms do not use the yen at all as the main
invoice currency. Interestingly, US dollar invoicing is chosen even in Japanese exports to some
advanced countries other than the United States.
          The above observation indicates the strong tendency of major Japanese exporting firms to
use the importer’s currencies as the main invoice currency in exports to advanced countries, which
conforms to the PTM behavior discussed earlier. From a standpoint of the foreign exchange risk
management, the importer’s currency invoicing means that the foreign exchange risks are taken and

  For example, we regard the US dollar as the main invoice currency in exports to Asia, if 50 percent of its
exports to Asia are invoiced in US dollars, 30 percent in the local currency, and 20 percent in the yen. Friberg
and Wilander (2008) also employ this main invoice currency approach for their questionnaire survey analysis
and conduct empirical examination.

Note: This table counts the number of firms that use one of four currencies as the main invoice currency for each destination.

For instance, looking at the far left of the first row in this table, [20/22] indicates that 20 out of 22 sample firms use the US

dollar as the main invoice currency in exports to the United States.

           Let us next turn to the choice of the main invoice currency in Japanese exports to Asia (Table
5). First and the most distinctive feature is that, in exports to Asia as a whole, the importer’s currency
is not used as the main invoice currency. The importer's currency invoicing is observed only in exports
to a particular destination country. Interestingly, the Chinese yuan is not used at all as the main invoice
currency in exports to China that is the largest market in the region. This part is not surprising because
Japan is an advanced country and most Asian countries are still developing countries. Second, sample
firms dominantly use either the US dollar or the yen as the main invoice currency: 13 out of 22 firms
choose the US dollar, while 9 firms use the yen. The extensive use of the US dollar is somewhat
surprising since it is a third country currency. This part needs more examinations. Third, the choice of
an invoice currency varies across industries. Firms in both the electrical machinery and the electrical
component industries tend to use the US dollar, while the automobile firms tend to choose the yen.
More interestingly, the yen tends to be used more in automobile and, especially, machinery exports to
Asia, which contrasts markedly with the electrical machinery and electrical component firms.

5. Empirics of Invoicing Decision

5-1. Determinants of Currency Invoicing in Japanese Exporting Firms


              Through a face-to-face discussion with each firm, we obtained the following possible
determinants of currency invoicing. The details are concisely summarized in Appendix 3.


(i) To Whom to Sell:         Intra-firm, outside firm or trading companies (Sogo Shosha)
              Almost all sample firms clearly state that a majority of their exports to advanced countries
are destined for their own local subsidiaries (i.e., intra-firm trade). To free their local subsidiaries from
any exchange rate risks, the Japanese headquarters have a strong tendency to choose invoicing in
importer's currency and to manage all exchange rate risks at the finance department of its head office.
In contrast, a substantial portion of exports to Asia and other developing countries are directed toward
independent firms or joint ventures with a low share of ownership, in which case Japanese
headquarters have less incentive to take the exchange rate risk. In these cases, there is a tendency to


                                                                 15
invoice not in the importer's currency but in the yen for exports to Asia and other developing countries.
The ownership relationship with importers is different between advanced countries and developing
countries, which tends to affect the choice of an invoice currency. We propose the following
hypothesis that has not yet been formally stated or tested in the literature.
          Hypothesis 1: The higher (lower) the ownership ratio or the equity participation is, the more
(less) likely are Japanese firms to choose the importer's currency invoicing.


          In addition, Japanese general trading companies, Sogo Shosha, play a certain role in the
exporter's invoicing choice. In exports to developing economies, Japanese firms do not necessarily
build their own distribution network. An alternative for exporters is to use Sogo Shosha that has
developed its own global distribution channels/network especially in the market of developing
countries. In the interviews, Japanese firms answered that their exports through Sogo Shosha were
invoiced in the yen. Presumably, Sogo Shosha can manage currency risk very well, by marry, netting,
and other ways. Thus, the share of yen invoicing will be growing if Japanese firms export more
through Sogo Shosha. This hypothetical relationship has not been tested in the literature.14
          Hypothesis 2: Japanese firms tend to invoice their export products in the yen when they
export through Sogo Shosha.


(ii) Cost of exchange rate hedging
          Many sample firms point out that the hedging cost of currency is one of the most important
factors in choosing an invoice currency. The hedging cost of local currencies in Asia and other
developing countries tends to be higher than that in advanced countries mainly due to various
regulations and restrictions. Japanese exporting firms will not choose the importer’s currency
invoicing to the extent that the hedging cost is high between the yen and the importer’s currency.15
Thus, the following hypothesis is typically tested in the empirical analysis of the invoicing choice.
          Hypothesis 3: The higher (lower) the hedging cost between the yen and the importer's
currency is, the lower (higher) is the use of the importer's currency as an invoice currency.


Although spot markets with underlying international transaction and investment are fully permitted in
most Asian countries, onshore and offshore markets are mostly divided, which makes Asian forward

14
   When the internationalization of the yen was debated in the 1980s and the early 1990s, most studies pointed
out that trade through Sogo Shosha had prevented yen-invoiced trade, since Sogo Shosha tends to use the US dollar
in external trade, especially in importing crude oil and other natural resources (see, for instance, Kawai, 1996 and
Fukuda and Ji, 1994). Our interview analysis, however, reveals the counter-evidence that exports through Sogo
Shosha tend to be invoiced in the yen.
15
   Another possible determinant is the transaction cost of the currency. The US dollar is generally considered as
a currency with the lowest transaction cost. It is widely recognized that the dominant use of the US dollar as a
vehicle currency in foreign exchange markets is likely to facilitate the use of the US dollar as an invoice currency,
even in trade between countries other than the United States. See Krugman (1980, 1984) for such a discussion.

                                                        16
markets still undeveloped. The high transaction costs or the inconvenient risk hedge instruments have
discouraged Japanese exporting firms to use Asian local currencies as invoice or settlement currencies.


(iii) The degree of market competition and differentiation of exporting products
          As discussed above, the importer's currency invoicing prevails in exports to advanced
countries, which has to do with the PTM behavior of Japanese firms. Specifically, many Japanese
firms, especially those in automobile makers and electrical machinery industry, pointed out that it was
too difficult to impose the exchange rate risk on importers in advanced countries due to high degree of
competition in the markets. In contrast, a firm that exports differentiated products and has the largest
market share in developing countries answered that its local subsidiaries could manage the exchange
rate risk even when the headquarter chose yen-invoicing in exports to the local subsidiaries. Thus, the
degree of product differentiation and market competition is an important factor in determining an
invoice currency.
          The result of our interview analysis conforms to both stylized fact no. 3 explained in earlier
section and the recent theoretical development of the choice of an invoice currency. The previous
studies, such as Giovannini (1988) and Donnenfeld and Zilcha (1991), model the firm’s choice of an
invoice currency by solving the maximization problem of the firm’s expected profit with an
uncertainty of exchange rate movements. They show that the choice of an invoice currency depends on
the shape of the firm’s profit function that is, in turn, conditional on the curvature of the demand
function in the destination markets. The more (less) differentiated the firm’s export product is, the
lower (higher) the elasticity of demand for them is, which leads to the exporter’s (importer’s) currency
invoicing.16 Thus, it is theoretically shown that the invoicing choice depends on the characteristics of
the goods traded, which is consistent with the classical stylized fact 3.17 Some of machinery firms and
electrical component firms in our sample, which export/sell competitive and highly differentiated
products in the global market, clearly have a strong position to negotiate their invoicing currency with
customers.
          Hypothesis 4: Export products tend to be invoiced in the yen if they are highly differentiated
and/or competitive.


16
   See Fukuda and Ji (1994) and Sato (1999, 2003) for the empirical estimation of invoicing practices in
Japanese exporters based on the firm’s maximization behavior of expected profits.
17
   Johnson and Pick (1997) and Friberg (1998) extend theoretical model of the invoicing choice by analyzing in
which condition the third currency invoicing is chosen. They show that not only the shape of the firm’s profit
function but also the exchange rate volatility (variance) against the importer’s currency determines the choice of an
invoice currency. While the above theoretical models are analyzed under the partial equilibrium framework, recent
studies apply the general equilibrium model to the choice of an invoice currency, motivated by development of the
New Open Economy Macroeconomics. For instance, Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2005) analyze the choice of
invoice currency under the two-country general equilibrium model, and show that the producer’s currency pricing
(PCP) is chosen if the exporting firm’s market share is larger in the destination market and if the economic size of
exporting firm’s country is larger

                                                        17
(iv) Exports from Asian production base to the US market
          Most of electrical machinery and electrical components firms that choose US dollar
invoicing in exports to Asian countries have a particular trade structure in that their production
subsidiaries exhibit a strong tendency to export their products to the US market or US firms. Under
this production/distribution structure, the firms typically choose US dollar invoicing not only from the
local subsidiaries in Asia to the US market but also from Japanese headquarters to the local
subsidiaries in Asia, since it is advantageous to use the same currency in both transactions.18 This is a
key to solve the second puzzle of the Japan’s currency invoicing pattern, that is why the third currency,
the US dollar is used in Japanese exports to Asia.
          While exports to the United States previously accounted for the largest share in the total
exports of Japan and Asian countries, it is now well recognized that intra-regional trade in Asia has
become more important for these countries in recent years. Most sample firms, however, answered that
the final destination market was the United States, since growing intra-regional trade was largely
driven by processing trade. Whereas such an Asian trade structure is often pointed out, to our
knowledge, it has never been tested empirically in the literature on invoicing choice. We construct a
new variable and attempt empirical examination to take into account this aspect in the next
sub-section.
          Hypothesis 5: Japanese firms tend to choose US dollar invoicing in exports their products to
the production subsidiaries in Asia when the production subsidiaries export high proportion of their
products to the US market.



5-2. Empirical Results


The Details of the Explanatory Variables
          The most commonly used explanatory variable for invoicing decision is the share of exports
to a particular destination country in total exports, which is typically related to the choice of the
destination country’s currency invoicing or PTM (see, for instance, Goldberg and Tille, 2008 and
Friberg and Wilander, 2008). Since we use a firm-level data and information, however, the above

18
   Moreover, to manage the exchange rate risk as efficiently as possible, some of major electrical machinery firms
and electrical component firms adopt an efficient settlement strategy, the so-called "re-invoicing". Specifically,
suppose a Japanese firm exports parts and components to its own production subsidiary in Asia to assemble them
into finished goods and then the finished goods are exported directly from the subsidiary to the United States.
The Japanese headquarter conducts accounting transactions by first purchasing the goods from the local
subsidiary and then selling the goods to the US importers (possibly its own sales subsidiary in the United States).
As long as all stages of accounting transactions are invoiced in US dollars, the Japanese firm can concentrate all
exchange rate exposures against a single currency, the US dollar, at the headquarter. This re-invoicing strategy
will impede the further use of the yen in Japan’s trade with Asia.

                                                       18
export share for each firm is hard to obtain. Alternatively, we use the ―share of foreign sales in the
region (North America, Europe, or Asia) in the total foreign sales.‖ Since most exports of our sample
firms are destined for overseas subsidiaries, the variable of the "share of foreign sales in the region"
can be considered as a good proxy for the share of exports to a particular country/region.
          In addition, we set up the following explanatory variables to empirically investigate the
determinants of currency invoicing in Japanese exporting firms.19
          The first and second explanatory variables are associated with the determinant (i) ―intra- or
inter-firm trade‖ (Hypothesis 1) and ―exports through Sogo Shosha‖ (Hypothesis 2). We set a ―dummy
for the equity share of overseas subsidiary (> 90%)‖ that takes 1 if firm i has overseas subsidiaries
with more than 90 % shares of equity in k region, and 0 otherwise.20 Furthermore, we use a ―dummy
for trade through Sogo Shosha‖, because trade through Sogo Shosha is regarded as a factor of
promoting yen invoiced trade.
          The third explanatory variable is related with the determinant (ii) ―cost of exchange rate
hedging‖ (Hypothesis 3). We use a bid-ask spread of outright forward transactions between the yen
and the importing country’s currency as a straightforward proxy for the cost of exchange rate hedging.
          The fourth explanatory variable is based on the determinant (iii) "the degree of market
competition and differentiation of exporting products" (Hypothesis 4). As shown in A (c-3) of
Appendix 3, three machinery firms and one electrical component firm answered that they tend to
invoice their exports in the yen, because their products have strong export competitiveness. The four
firms cited high market shares of their products as evidence of their products’ strong export
competitiveness.21 We use a "dummy for export competitiveness" that takes 1 for the four firms that
have strong export competitiveness, and 0 otherwise.
          The fifth explanatory variable is associated with the determinant (iv) ―exports from Asian
production subsidiaries to the US market‖ (Hypothesis 5). We set a ―dummy for firm’s plants in Asia
to export‖ that takes 1 if the ratio of intra-firm sales from Asia (i.e., exports to subsidiaries outside
Asia) to foreign sales in Asia (i.e., sales to Asian customers) is 50 percent or over, and 0 otherwise.


Probit Estimation on the Determinants of Currency Invoicing


          We empirically test the hypothesis about the determinants of an invoice currency by using
the above explanatory variables. Since the importer’s currency invoicing is prevalent in Japanese
exports to the advanced countries, which is the first puzzle of the Japan's currency invoicing pattern as


19
   See Appendix 4 for the details of making these explanatory variables.
20
   See Appendix 5 for sample firm head office's equity share on local subsidiaries and segment information by
region.
21
   In the interviews, based on the data on the global market share, it was confirmed that the export products of
these firms accounted for a very large share in the world market.

                                                        19
discussed in Section 4, our main interest is in analyzing in which currency Japanese exports to
advanced countries are invoiced, the exporter’s currency (the yen) or the importer’s currency. We
conduct probit estimation to analyze the determinants of currency invoicing, where the dependent
variable is a binary variable that takes 1 if the importer’s currency is used as the main invoice currency
and 0 otherwise.
          First, the results of estimation when exporting to the United States and Euro area are
presented in columns (1) through (5) in Table 6. As a key determinant of currency invoicing, we use (i)
the forward spread of the importer’s currency against the yen, (ii) the share of foreign sales in the
region, (iii) the head office's ownership (equity) share of local subsidiaries, and (iv) the dummy for
export competitiveness. In columns (1) through (5), the forward spreads are negative and statistically
significant at least at the 5 percent level, which indicates that the larger the hedging cost is, the less the
importer’s currency is used for trade invoicing. In columns (1) through (5), the effect of foreign sales
in the region is also included to investigate whether the invoicing choice is affected by the extent of
export dependence on the destination market. These are all positive but statistically insignificant in
columns (3) and (5). Furthermore, to allow for the effect of intra-firm trade, the head office's equity
share of local subsidiaries or its dummy (>90 percent) are included in columns (2) through (5). These
are all significantly positive at least at the 5 percent level, which strongly supports our hypothesized
relationship that intra-firm trade facilitates importer’s currency invoicing. Furthermore, the dummy for
export competitiveness is included in columns (3) and (5), which indicates that the degree of export
competitiveness negatively affects the extent of importer’s currency invoicing.
          Second, columns (6) through (8) show the results of probit estimation when including the
advanced countries in North America and Europe (i.e., the United States, Canada, Euro area and UK)
as a destination market. The estimated result is similar to the case of the United States and Euro area
(columns (1) through (5)) except for the estimates of the share of foreign sales that are all positive but
insignificant.
          Overall, the results of the probit estimation reveal that the importer’s currency is used as an
invoice currency, if (i) the hedging cost of the importer’s currency is lower, (ii) the headquarter has a
high ownership (equity) share of the local subsidiaries, and (iii) export products are less differentiated
or not competitive in the destination market. The second reason is particularly important in
considering the first puzzle of the Japan's currency invoicing pattern. Since most Japanese exports to
advanced countries are intra-firm transactions, the headquarter of Japanese exporting firms have a
strong incentive to free their overseas subsidiaries from the exchange rate risk by invoicing in the local
(importer’s) currency. Such importer’s currency invoicing is much more likely if the destination
market is highly competitive or if the sample firm’s export products are less competitive or
differentiated.

             We next conduct the similar estimation focusing on Asian economies where Japanese firms
have built a regional production network. In this estimation, the destinations include the following
eight economies: Mainland China, Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and
the Philippines. Our main interest is in solving the second puzzle of the Japan's currency invoicing
pattern, i.e., why US dollar invoicing is larger than yen invoicing in Japan's exports to Asia. In
conducting probit estimation, the dependent variable for columns (1) through (5) in Table 7 is a binary
variable that takes 1 if the US dollar is used as the main invoice currency and 0 otherwise. In addition,
columns (6) through (10) in Table 7 present the case where the dependent variable is a binary variable
that takes 1 if the yen is used as the main invoice currency.
Let us first look at the results of estimation reported in columns (1) through (5) of Table 7 where the
determinants of US dollar invoicing are analyzed. First, in contrast to the results of the previous
estimation for advanced countries (Table 6), forward spreads do not have significant effect on the
choice of an invoice currency. The dummy for the head office's ownership (equity) share of local
subsidiaries affects positively the US dollar invoicing choice at the 1 percent significance level in
columns (1) through (5), which implies that Japanese firms, which have local subsidiaries in Asia with
more than 90 percent equity share, tend to choose US dollar invoicing.

1)     Method: Probit estimation. The dependent variable is a binary variable that takes 1 if the US dollar (columns (1)

       through (5)) or the yen (columns (6) through (10)) is the main invoice currency and 0 otherwise.

              Second, the dummy for trade through Sogo Shosha consistently indicates a negative impact
on the US dollar invoicing, though the coefficient is significantly negative at the 5 percent level only
in columns (3) and (5).
              Third, whereas the share of foreign sales in Asia does not have any significant effect on the
invoicing choice (columns (1), (2) and (4)), the share of foreign sales in North America positively
affects the US dollar invoicing at the 5 percent significance level in columns (1) through (5). This
result is somewhat puzzling, because it shows that the larger the firm's sales in North America (mainly
the United States), the more the US dollar will be used in the firm's exports from Japan to Asia. The
clue of understanding this puzzling relationship is to understand the definition of the data on the
"foreign sales in the region".22 This foreign sales variable covers the exports of Japanese firm’s

22
   Assuming that North America is identical to the United States for simplicity, let us consider the definition of
"the firm i's foreign sales in the United States". This foreign sales variable covers (i) the exports of the firm i from
Japan to the United States (i.e., customers in the United States except for the firm i’s subsidiaries), (ii) the exports
of the firm i's overseas (but non-US) subsidiaries to the United States, and (iii) the local sales of firm i's
subsidiaries in the United States. Since, as discussed earlier, major Japanese firms tend to export their products to
the local subsidiaries, the export channel (i) does not account for a large share in the total foreign sales in the
United States. Based on the consolidated accounting, the firm i’s exports from Japan to the local subsidiaries in the
United States are not directly counted in "the firm i's foreign sales in the United States", but are indirectly allowed
for by the channel (iii). As reported in, for instance, METI, White Paper 2009, Asian countries export a large

                                                                               22
subsidiaries in Asia to the United States and other external countries. Given the triangular trade where
the Japanese production subsidiaries in Asia import intermediate goods from the Japanese head office
and export finished products to the United States, US dollar invoicing will be chosen at each stage of
trade transactions. The positive and significant coefficient of the foreign sales in North America may
show the invoicing choice in the above triangular trade.
          To confirm the effect of the above triangular trade on US dollar invoicing, the ―dummy for
plants in Asia to export‖ (Asian plant dummy) is also included in columns (4) and (5) as an
explanatory variable that represents the exports from Japanese production subsidiaries in Asia to the
US market.23 The coefficient of this Asian plant dummy is positive and statistically significant at the 5
percent level in column (4) and at the 10 percent level in column (5). In columns (2) and (3) where the
dummy for export competitiveness is included, coefficients of export competitiveness dummy has
negative signs though their significant levels are marginal around the 10 percent level. These results
do support our hypothesized relationship that exports from Asian production base to the US market
facilitate US dollar invoicing in Japanese exports to Asian countries.
          Next, the determinants of yen invoicing are analyzed using the same data set. The results
reported in columns (5) through (10) are consistent with those presented in columns (1) through (5).
The forward spread does not have significant effect on the extent of yen invoicing. The dummy for the
head office's ownership (equity) share of local subsidiaries has negative and significant influences on
the yen invoicing choice. The dummy for Sogo Shosha exhibits positive and statistically significant
coefficients in all cases. Although it is said that the role of Sogo Shoha has been declining in Japanese
exports, our interview analysis has shown that exports through Sogo Shosha still play a certain role
when the destination is Asia and other developing countries. The results of our estimation suggest that
the share of yen invoicing will be increasing when exporting through Sogo Shosha. While the
coefficient of Asian plant dummy is not statistically significant, the dummy for export competitiveness
shows all positive and significant coefficients, which suggests that Japan's exports of differentiated
products to Asia facilitate yen invoicing transactions.
          In summary, the second puzzle of the Japan's invoicing pattern can be explained by the
growing intra-firm exports from Japan to Asian subsidiaries based on their regional production
network combined with the fact that Japanese production subsidiaries in Asia tend to export a large
proportion to the US market.

intra-Asian trade including trade between Japan and Asian subsidiaries, which is covered by the channel (ii).

6. Concluding Remarks

          This paper empirically examines a firm-level pricing behavior of Japanese exports to propose
new determinants of invoicing behavior and to present new evidence on traditional and newly
proposed determinants. We interviewed 23 Japanese representative exporting firms to collect
information on their currency invoicing behavior and also on their explicit policy/strategy of choosing
their invoice currency. Through interviews, we found that Japanese electronics and automobile
companies have a strong tendency to choose local currency invoicing in exports to advanced countries,
while U.S. dollar invoicing is largely used when exporting to Asian countries, especially in exporting
electronics products. Such an invoicing strategy aims at stabilizing the local currency (U.S. dollar)
price of their export products in local markets, which conforms to the pricing-to-market behavior
discussed in the literature.
          This paper proposes the new determinants and hypotheses of an invoice currency and tests
those hypotheses using a newly-constructed firm-level data set. Our novel findings are three-fold. First,
importer’s currency invoicing is prevalent in Japanese exports to advanced countries, because most of
their exports are destined for local subsidiaries that face severe competition in the local markets. In
this case, Japanese parent firms have a strong tendency to take an exchange rate risk by invoicing in
the importer’s currency, which is consistent with the PTM behavior discussed in the literature. It also
makes sense to concentrate currency risk at the headquarter, since it is better equipped with risk
management expertise and with scale economies. Second, Japanese firms that export highly
differentiated products or have a dominant share in global markets tend to choose yen invoicing even
in exports to advanced countries. Third, although Japanese firms have shifted their production bases to
Asian countries, exports from these Asian bases tend to be invoiced in US dollars as long as the final
destination market is the United States, which results in the US dollar invoicing even in exports from
Japanese head office to production subsidiaries in Asia. Thus, a smaller share of yen invoicing in
Japanese exports even in the 2000s is due to the growing intra-firm trade promoted by active overseas
operations of Japanese electronics firms combined with its final destination being the US markets.
          While Japan’s production networks in Asia reinforce its unique pattern of currency invoicing,
country-specific foreign exchange regulations in Asia also cause US dollar invoicing in Japanese
exports to Asia. Since the Asian currency crisis in 1997, foreign exchange regulations and controls in
Asian countries have been strengthened and reinforced the use of US dollars in Asia.

              Figure A1 shows the share of both yen and US dollar invoicing in Japan’s imports from 1980
to 2009. In Japan’s imports from the world, the share of yen invoicing increased gradually from 2.4
percent in 1980 to 20 percent in 1993, but it did not increase much from then on and remained at 24.6
percent even in 2009. The US dollar is most used in Japanese imports and its share was 70.1 percent
even in 2009. As the classic stylized fact 3 suggests, the more imports of crude oils and raw materials
are, the higher the share of the US dollar is in Japan’s imports. Whereas Japan has long been


                                                            29
dependent heavily on imports of oils and raw materials, Japan’s import pattern has structurally
changed in recent years with a substantial increase in procurements of manufactured products from
Asian countries. As the regional integration has been deepening and production network has been
developed further by Japanese firms, the use of the yen can be expected to increase in Japan’s imports
from Asia. Figure A1(d) shows, however, that more than 70 percent of imports from Asia are invoiced
in US dollars and the share of yen invoicing has never exceeded 30 percent even in the 2000s. It is
confirmed that the US dollar is still dominantly used in trade between Japan and Asia.

Appendix 2: Currency Invoicing and the Share of Foreign Sales


             For further investigation of the possible relationship between the invoicing choice and the
foreign sales by region, we plot the data in Figures A2 to A4, where the ―share of currency invoicing
in exports‖ (US dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen) for each of 21 sample firms is placed on the vertical
axis and the "share of foreign sales " (North America, Europe, and Asia) on the horizontal axis. A
cross-section OLS is also conducted and the regression line as well as the 45 degree line is presented
in the figures.

             Figure A2 shows the relationship between the share of US dollar invoicing and the share of
foreign sales in North America. Assuming that the size of the US market is dominant in North America,
the larger the share of foreign sales in North America, the higher the share of US dollar invoicing is. If
the US dollar does not play a role of vehicle currency in Japanese trade with other region, all points in
Figure A2 would lie along a 45 degree line (dotted line) 24.
Interestingly, most sample companies are distributed at the upper side of the 45 degree line. A
regression line (solid line) has the positive and statistically significant intercept (0.36) while its
24
   Figure A2 in this paper is similar to Goldberg and Tille (2008, Fig.1) that show the relationship between the
share of US dollar invoicing in export of each sample country and the share exports to the United States in the
total exports of the country concerned.

                                                                  31
estimated slope coefficient is positive (0.55) but not statistically significant. This evidence strongly
suggests that US dollar invoicing is prevalent not only in exports to North America (or US) but also
other countries. This observation is consistent with the view that there is a vehicle currency role in the
US dollar. Moreover, although not explicitly shown in Figure A2 to assure anonymity of sampled
firms, most electrical machinery and electrical component companies are distributed at the far upper
side of the 45 degree line, which implies that US dollar is globally used especially in the electronics
trade.

            Figure A3 shows the relationship between the share of Euro invoicing and the share of
foreign sales in Europe. In contrast to Figure A2, all sample firms are distributed on or below the 45
degree line. A regression line has a positive slope coefficient (0.65) that is statistically significant at
the 1% level and also has an insignificant constant term (-0.02). This result indicates that Japanese
firms tend to conduct the PTM behavior in exports to the Euro area by invoicing in the euro.

          Figure A4 shows the relationship between the share of yen invoicing and the share of foreign
sales in Asia. As it is easily recognized, there is almost no relationship between two shares. While the
regression line has positive intercept (0.10) and slope (0.48), they are not different from zero at any
significant level. Though not explicitly shown, the automobile and machinery companies exhibit a
high share of yen invoicing, while the electrical machinery and electrical component companies tend
to have an extremely lower share of yen invoicing, which is consistent with Table 3.

Appendix 4: The details of the explanatory variables


The following are used as the explanatory variables in our probit estimation.


(1) Firm i’s equity share of overseas subsidiary in the k destination country (region)
          It is a proxy for the share of intra-firm trade in firm i’s exports from Japan to each country
(region). We first scrutinize the list of consolidated subsidiaries (companies) in each company's annual
financial statements (as of FY2006 or 2007) to investigate whether each firm owns equity method
affiliates in respective destinations If overseas subsidiaries are found in the destination, we use the
equity share held by its parent firm (head office) in Japan as a proxy for the share of intra-firm trade
between Japan and the destination country (region). If there are two or more subsidiaries in one
destination country (region), we use the average of their equity shares. We also set the ―dummy for
equity share of overseas subsidiary (> 90%)‖ that takes 1 if firm i has overseas subsidiaries in the k
country (region) with more than 90 % equity shares, and 0 otherwise. Appendix 5 summarizes the
status of equity share of overseas subsidiaries held by head office in Japan.


(2) Dummy for trade through Sogo Shosha
          The General Trading Company is called ―Sogo Shosha‖ in Japanese. Since the data on the
share of exports through Sogo Shosha by country/region is not available, we obtained the information
from the annual financial statements on the fiscal-year-end balance of trade accounts receivable. We
set the ―dummy for trade through Sogo Shosha‖ that takes 1 if we find the name of Sogo Shosha in the
top 5 of balance of trade accounts receivable in the fiscal-year-end, and 0 otherwise.


(3) Firm i’s share of foreign sales to region k (k=North America, Asia)
          We use the share of firm i’s foreign sales in region k’s market in its total foreign sales as a
proxy for the share of the region k in the firm i's export destinations. Appendix 5 summarizes the
segment information by region and foreign sales in the financial statement


(4) k country/region currency’s forward spreads(%) as of Feb.2008
          As a proxy for the cost of exchange rate hedging, we use a bid-ask spread of forward outright
transactions between the yen and the destination country’s currency. The bid-ask spread is calculated
in percentage of the transaction basis by using the actual market bid-ask spreads of both spot and
forward swap transactions as follows:
 Bid - Ask spread of forwardoutright rate (%)
   Ask of forwardoutright rate－Bid of forwardoutright rate                                                100
                                                             Middle of Bid and Ask forwardoutright rate



                                                      36
All data of spot and forward swap rates (3 month) were obtained in the whole trading date of April
2008. All data were downloaded from Bloomberg.


(5) Dummy for firm i’s plants in Asia to export
         Combined with the explanatory variable (3), i.e. the firm i’s share of foreign sales in North
America, we use a new dummy variable to take into account the firm that exports its products from
subsidiaries in Asia to the final destination, the United States. We set the ―dummy for firm’s plants in
Asia to export‖ that takes 1 if the ratio of intra-firm sales from Asia (i.e., exports to subsidiaries
outside Asia) to foreign sales in Asia (i.e., sales to Asian customers) is 50 % or over, and 0 otherwise.


(6) Dummy for firm i's export competitiveness
         This dummy variable takes 1 if the firm i is objectively considered to have strong export
competitiveness, and 0 otherwise. Export competitiveness is measured by the market share of the main
export products of sample firms and also by the information obtained in the interview analysis on the
degree of product differentiation and the profitability of export products.
