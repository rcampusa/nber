                  Social Security and Earlier Retirement in Japan:

                              Cross-Sectional Evidence



                                     ABSTRACT



      The estimated elasticity of the probability of retirement with respect to

 social   security retirement benefits declines as individuals age. The negative

 Impact of social security retirement benefits on        full—time workers is much
greater than the impact on part—time workers for all

 in Japan is, therefore, more effective on full—time workers than part—time

workers among the elderly. Social security retirement benefits also provide

the elderly with an incentive to prolong their unemployment status. The nar-

ginal effect of the market unemployment         rate on full—time work is       si.g-

nificantly larger than that on part—time work       and both effects are negative.
The elasticity of retirement with respect    to the market unemployment rate for
those in their 60s is two to three tines larger than         those aged 70 and over.
Retirement of those in their 60s is quite       responsive to     changes in labor
market condition.

                                         I. Introduction

         At the request of Japanese government, Japanese firms have recently begun

 to      increase    mandatory retirement ages beyond the traditional age of
 fifty-five.1 Japanese business firms and other institutions             are required by
 law to have 6.9 percent of their total employment to be comprised of in-

 dividuals, 55 and over.2

        As Japan is becoming an "aging society"            a more comprehensive social

security retirement system is necessary. The provision of such a system al—

 leviates the financial problems of the elderly and is likely to encourage

elderly workers to leave the labor market            earlier, possibly      imposing a rela-

tively higher tax burden on working generations. Yet job vacancies due to the

earlier retirement of the elderly may provide job opportunities for younger

working generations.

        Despite its social—and—economic-policy importance in Japan, few theoreti—

cal and empirical studies have explored the          effects   of social security retire-

ment benefits on the retirement behavior of elderly male workers, with the
exception of the recent studies by Takayama (1982) and Ito (1983) . However,
these two studies do not specifically focus on the relationship between social
security retirement benefits and the retirement decisions of the elderly in an
econometric  multivariate analysis. Consequently, the quantitative impact of
the socia.l—security—retjrenrent—benefj t effect on the retirement decisions is
riot   well   documented.'
        The purpose of this   study is     to analyze the retirement deci sions of
elderly mal e workers iii the      context    of mul tivar late ant lysis    We hypothesize



                                              —1--
that the responses of retirement decisions to soda—economic factors differ by

age. We consider the age groups 60—64, 65-69, and 70 and over. 8y further

separating each age group according to their degree of labor attachment, e.g.,

full—time work, part—time work, unemployment, and retirement, we examine the

transitional aspects of the retirement decisions of elderly male workers. This

sort of application should not be underestimated for two reasons: first,

understanding the effect of social security retirement benefits on the retire-

ment decisions of the elderly is valuable and crucial in determining social

and economic policy. Secondly, an evaluation of the quantitative effects rests

on empirical studies such as ours.

       The organization of the subsequent sections is as follows. Section II

contains a brief review of the Welfare Pension in Japan. In       Section   III we

describe     our theoretical model. We present the the empirical results in Sec-
tion   IV   and state our conclusions in Section V.

                    II. A Brief Review of the Welfare Pension

      In Japan, the social security program (Welfare Pension) was introduced in

1942. The Welfare Pension covering a majority of Japanese workers is a par-

tially funded system, not a pay—as—you-go system.4 Under the Welfare Pension a

flat tax rate of 10.6% is applied to monthly labor earnings up to a maximum of

410 thousand yen from a minimum of 45 thousand yen for male workers. The rate

is 8.9% for female workers.5 Half of the social security tax rate is paid by

the employer, as is true with the U.S. social security system.

     Retirement benefits of the Japanese Welfare Pension (social security

retirement benefits, SSRB) are indexed to the inflation rate and generally

require 20 year minimum contributions. The normal retirement age is 60 for men

and 55 for women.6 The basic schedule of monthly social security retirement

benefits for a typical individual 'i' is given as follows (Japan, White Paper

of Welfare l983):

SSRB. = 2,050    x T{T=20 if T. 20; T=T. if 20 < T.< 35;

       and T35lf Ti? 35} ÷ N
                                       W     /12 T.)

       x (1/100) x LI,           (1)

where T. = number of preretirement working years, and W.        =   monthly   labor

earnings in time t. The payment of monthly social security retirement benefits

is reduced according to the amount of an individual's monthly labor earnings

as shown in Table 1. Table 1 provides the schedule of the payments.

                     [Table 1 should be here]

     As we note from the above schedule, the current system of social security

retirement benefits in Japan has only an income effect for the elderly in the

age categories of 60—64 and 65 and over. In Figure 1, we have drawn illustra-

tive monthly budget constraints for the elderly in both age groups.

                      [Figure 1 should be here]

The distance OA indicates the amount of monthly social security retirement



                                       —3—
benefits, assuming no other non—labor income, for individuals working zero

hours a month (the benefits and wage rates are assumed to be the same for both

age groups) . The saw shaped budget line ABFGHIJ Is the schedule for the el-

derly in the 60-64 age category, whereas the budget line ABCDE is for those in

the 65 and over age category.

     Noting that the income level at F (in Figure 1) is more than that at 0

and H, the elderly in the 60—64 age category are likely to work either rela-

tively few hours (less than or equal to T1 hours or T2 hours) a month while

receiving at least eighty percent of their social security retirement benefits

or a substantially larger number of hours (more than T4 hours) with zero

social security retirement benefits.8 This budget constraint results from a

lump—sum reduction in social security retirement benefits according to their

labor earnings, rather than a proportional reduction of labor earnings from

social security retirement benefits as with the United States social security

system.

     On the other hand, the elderly in the age category of 65 and over face a

minimal social security retirement benefits reduction. The reduction is only

20 percent of the benefits when their labor earnings exceed 150 thousand yen.

That is, in the transition from the 60—64 age group to another age group of 65

and over the elderly will experience a strong income effect from social

security retirement benefits (i.e., from budget constraint ABFGHIJ to ABCDE in

Figure 1), resulting in a reduction either in their working hours or their

labor force participation.

     In this study, we focus on the labor force participation of three dif-

ferent age groups of elderly men: ages 60—64. 65—69, and 70 and   over.   Further-

more, among     each age group we separate the degree of labor involvement by
classifying   full—time work, part—time work, unemployment, arid retirement.    An

advantage of using the labor force participation rates of the elderly and



                                        —4—
classifying each by labor attachment is that we are able to examine the tran-

sitional aspects of their labor retirement decisions.




                                     —3-
                            III. Empirical Model and Theoretical Arguments

        The percentage of full—time male workers among the total number of el-

derly male workers diminishes with age as follows: 85.0 percent among those

aged 55 to 59, 71.0 percent among those aged 60 to 64, and 61.0 percent among

those aged 65 to 69, in 1980 (White Paper of Labor, l983). On the other hand,

the corresponding percentages of part—time workers rises with age, 14.7 per-

cent, 28.7 percent, and 38.7 percent for those aged 55 to 59, 60 to 64. and 65

to 69, respectively. These rates illustrate the transitional aspect of working

decisions. A similar pattern is also observed In U.S. studies (Gustman and

Steinmeier 1983 and 1984; Honig and Hanock 1985), Thus, we separate full—time

work, part—time work, unemployment, and retirement for each of the three age

groups: 60—64, 65—69, and 70 and over.10

        The variables in our model are cross—sectional market averages primarily

drawn from the 1980 Population Census of .Japan. Our approach assumes that a

typical elderly man faces four mutually exclusive alternatives with the cor-

responding probabilities P1. P2, F3, and P4, which represent the probabilities

that the man chooses full-time work, part-time work, unemployment, or retire-

ment, respectively. By definition, the sum of the probabilities is equal to

one. The logistic probability function is:



(1)     P.    =    [exp(a.÷ .(B..X.)) / (1+       £.    exp(a.÷   E.(B..X.)))],

        i =       1,2,and   3

and:

(2) p4 =           [1/   (1± .   exp(a.+   E.(B..X.)))],

where the X, j=l                  in, are the independent variables.

        By solving for the log-odds ratio of the 1th type of participation deci—

sion (P. relative to P4), the logistic equation can                   be   expressed in the linear

form:




                                                       —6--
(3) ln(P./P4) = a.+ L(B.X) 1=1,2, and 3.

The marginal effect of X. on P. is obtained from:

                                        P.L(B1.P.),       1=1,2, and 3.

       (
            6P4/OX.)
       In our model, the                are unobserved and constrained to the interval from

zero to one. For the estimation of equation (3), we substitute Pf (the propor-

tion of elderly men in a given age group who are full—time participants in the

labor market) for P1; P (the proportion of those men who are part-time par-

ticipants) for P2 Pu (the proportion of unemployed elderly men in the age

group) for P3; and P (the proportion of those men who are retired) for P4.

Each equation will be estimated using generalized least squares so as to

correct for heteroscedasticity. The weights to be used are given by:

(6)        W1 =   [(total   male population in a given age group)P.P]½, i=f,p, and u.

       This study employs the following explanatory variables: social security

retirement benefits, full—time male wages, part—time male wages, unemployment,

family wealth, education, presence of spouse, family structure, and hea]th

condition. The variables are defined in Table 2 and their statistics are

reported in Table 3. We briefly discuss the explanatory variables of interest.

                        [Tables 2 and 3 should be herej

       The availability of social security retirement benefits (SSRB) will

discourage the labor force participation of the elderly due to its income

effect, as discussed in Section 1112 An increase in either full—time or part—

time wages is likely to influence the elderly to substitute between full-time

and part—time work, after considering the effect on social security retirement

benefits. We use two proxy variables for family wealth: the sum of income

flows from assets such as housing, land, stocks, and bonds; and personal

savings. Their effects on the retirement decisions of the elderly will be



                                                   —7--
different because their liquidity differs.

     Elderly men, with spouse present, are likely to be integrated into their

communities as workers and/or to have financial responsibility. We expect the

presence of a spouse to a positive effect on labor force participation. The

family structure variable is the proportion of elderly living with their

children and grandchildren. Elderly living      with    their   children   and

grandchildren seem to have income effect against labor force participation due

to other members' earnings. Finally, the health condition of the elderly

cannot be ignored. Health improvement positively affects their work efforts

(Rones 1980; Fuchs 1984). Noise, population density and heavy traffic may

cause tension to rise and consequently to have an adverse effect on an

individual's health condition (Gerking and Schulze 1981; Cropper 1981). Life—

sty]e health habits, e.g., cigarette smoking and diet, will also influence

health quality (Rosen 1981; Wolfe 1984).

                                 IV. Empirical Results

     Tables 4, 5, and 6 present the results obtained from our estimation model

for three age groups: 60-64, 65—69, and 70 and over, respectively.

                [Tables 4, 5 and 6 should be here]

     One notable finding is that the estimated coefficients on the social

security retirement benefits variable (SSRB) are statistically significant and

negative in the full-time and part-time equations for all age groups. The

estimated elasticity of the probability of retirement with respect to social

security retirement benefits, evaluated at the sample means, is 1.29 for

elderly men in the 60—64 age category.13 The retirement elasticities for the

elderly in the age categories of 65—69 and 70 and over are .57 and .08,

respectively. An increase in social security retirement benefits induces

earlier retirement of elder'y men.

     The declining elasticity of retirement with respect to social security

retirement benefits with age is composed of the following factors:

(1) the proportion of retirement (R) rises from .211 (60—64), to .377 (65—

   69) and .675 (70 and over) as ages advance;

(2) the ratio of full—time work to retirement (F/R) decreases from 3.35

    (60—64) to 1.29 (65-69), and .34 (70 and over); and

(3) the full—time elasticities with respect to social security retirement

   benefits ( 6lnF/O1nSSRB   )   are   —.40 (60—64), —.39 (65—69), and -.19

    (70 and over). A one percent increase in social security retirement

   benefits wi1l lead to a .4 percent decrease in full—time labor force

   participation among the age groups 60-64 and 65—69, and a .19

   percent reduction among the age group of 70 and over.

In comparison to the elasticity of full—time work with respect to social

security retirement benefits, the part—time elasticity is much smaller and

invariant with age: -01 (60-64), -.02 (65-69), -.01 (70 and over). These



                                          —9—
results indicate that the earnings test in Japan is more effective on full—
                                                               14
time workers than part—time workers among the elderly.

     The positive effect of social security retirement benefits on unemploy-

ment for all age groups (column 3 in Tables 4,              5 and 6) show that the
eligibility for both unemployment Insurance benefits and social security

retirement benefits provides the elderly with an incentive to prolong their

unemployment status and, hence, the unemployed elderly maximize their entitled

benefits,15 This finding Is congruent with the report of Ito (1983).

     Another noteworthy finding is that retirement among the elderly is a

consequence of their difficulty of finding jobs In Japan. In Tables 4,           5 and
6, the effects of the market unemployment rate on full—time work and part—time

work are significantly negative for all age groups. A decrease in the prob-

ability of labor force participation in full-time work and part—time work due

to an increase in the unemployment rate represents the discouragement effect.

The marginal effects of the market unemployment rate on full—time work are

much greater than those on part—time work for all age groups.16 A one percent-

age point increase in the unemployment rate reduces full—time-work labor force

participation by 4.1 percentage points (60—64), 4.0 percentage points (65—69),

and 3.0 percentage points (70 and over). The reductions in the labor force

participation rates for part—time work are .01 percentage points (60—64),           .08

percentage points (65—69), and .02 percentage points (70 and over).

     The elasticity of retirement with respect to the market unemployntent rate

(the discouragement effect) is .40 (60—64), .26 (65—69), and .12 (70 and over)

at the sample means. In comparison with the estimated elasticity of retirement

with respect to social security retirement benefits (the induced retirement

effect) of 1.29 (60—64), .57 (65—69), and .08 (70 and over),               the induced

retirement effect is larger           iii   magnitude   than the discouragement effect,

except   for   the elderly in the   70 and over age category. Yet,    the statistically



                                            —10—
significant discouragement effect indicates that the elderly face the dilemma

of discouragement from searching unsuccessfully for jobs and the consequent

stigma of unemployment. Dwindling job opportunities for the elderly during a

period of high market unemployment persuade them to exit the job market.

     The estimated coefficients on the presence of a spouse variable in the

full-time work equation are statistically significant and poitive for all age

groups. Financial responsibility for the spouse is likely one of the reasons.

With respect to family structure, the elderly living with their children and

grandchildren tend to reduce their full—time work activity. However, the

positive effect on part-time work among all age groups suggests that the

family structure does not necessarily force the elderly to leave the labor

market completely, but lets them stay at the intermediate state as part-time

workers before retirement.

     To represent health conditions, we included tension and life expectancy

variables. The former is measured by public nuisance complaints (noise pollu-

tion) received by local public bodies. For the latter, the predicted value of

life expectancy is used: the instrumental variables are medical care, daily

diet of salty paste, cigarette smoking, nutrition guidance, education, inspec-

tive facilities of food and enviroment sanitation, and air pollution. The

tension variable has negative effects on full-time work, part-time work and

unemployment for all age groups. That is, a rise in teision reduces the work

effort of the elderly, shortens their labor market activities and consequently

compels the elderly to withdraw from the labor market, namely to rtire. The

effects of the life expectancy variables are weak, though some of them are

statistically significant and positive.

                                   V. Conclusion



      The Japanese Goverment recently requested private firms and public or—

ganizations to extend mandatory retirement ages beyond the traditional age of

fifty-five. To implement proper socioeconomic and health—related policy ac-

tion, we consider it indispensable to understand the underlying factors in-

fluencing the retirement decisions of the elderly. We examined the effect of

social security retirement benefits on the retirement decisions of elderly

male workers in different age groups (60-64, 65—64, and 70 and over) with

full—time work, part—time work, unemployment, and retirement separately

studied for each. The variables in our model are cross—sectional market

averages primarily drawn from the 1980 Population Census of Japan.

      The major findings in this study are that retirement decisions are mainly

determined by social security retirement benefits and the market unemployment

rate. An increase in social security retirement benefits induces the elderly

to leave the labor market when they become eligible for the benefits (i.e. the

induced retirement effect). Retirement among the elderly is also a consequence

of their difficulty in finding jobs (i.e. the discouragement effect). The

induced retirement effect dominates the discouragement effect.

      The estimated elasticity of the probability of retirement with respect to

social security retirement benefits declines as ages advance. The negative

impact of social security retirement benefits on full—time workers is much

greater than on part—time workers for all age groups. Earnings test in Japan

is,   therefore, more effective oii full—time workers than part—time workers

among the elderly. Social security retirement benefits also provide the el—

deny with an      incentive to    prolong their unemploymed status. The marginal

effect   of the market unemployment rate on full—time    work is significantly
larger    than that on   part—time work and both effects are negative. The elas—


                                      —12-
ticity of retirement with respect to the market unemployment rate for those in

their 60's is two to three times larger than for those ages 70 and over.

Retirement of those in their 60s Is also quite responsive to changes in labor

market conditions.

     Among the other variables in our model, we found that elderly men with a

spouse are strongly attached to the full—time labor market, indicating their

integration into communities and financial responsibility. When living with

their children and grandchildren, the elderly tend to reduce their full-time

work activity but stay at the intermediate state, working part time before

complete retirement.

    As a concluding remark, the retirement nf the elderly is attributable

mainly to social security retirement benefits and dwindling job opportunities.

To advance the understanding of socioeconomic activities of the elderly, more

studies of this type are encouraged in Japan.

at 55 or less, accounted for 39.7 percent of the total business firms. Those

with retirement ages between 56 and 59 years old accounted for 20.1 percent

while those with ages 60 or over accounted for 39.7 percent. These proportions

in 1982 became               35.5 percent, 18.2 percent, and 56.9 percent, respectively

(White Paper of Labor, Showa 58 Nenban (1983), pp. 66 —                    70).
        2. Under the law the ratio of the elderly workers was gradually raised

from 5.8 percent in 1979 to 6.2 percent in 1980, 6.6 percent in 1981, and 6.9

percent in 198 2 (White Paper of Labor, Showa 58 Nenban (1983), p. 69).

       3. In the United States, the social security system seems to create a

trend toward              earlier retirement, though some studies negate the earlier

retirement eff ects. Boskin (1977), Pellechio (1979), Hurd and Boskin (1984),

and Mitchell              and Fields (1984) suggest that social security retirement

benefits exert a significant influence on the retirement decision and induce

earlier retir ement. Blinder, Gordon and Wise (1980), and Hanmermesh (1984),

however, find that social security retirement benefits do not present a work

disincentive          to the elderly under age 65 but rather that the elderly stay

longer    in the labor market becasue of an increase in deferred retirement

benefits.

       4. Another social security retirement program is the National Pension for

self—employed             workers and housewives who are not employed. Private pensions
are   sti 1.1   at   an   early stage   in   Japan   and the   data are not aval liable.


                                                     —14—
     5. After April in 1986, the rates were raised to 12.4 percent and 11.3

percent for male and female workers, respectively.

     6. After April in 1986, the normal retirement age for female workers was

raised to sixty years old with gradual adjustments.

     7. A typical retired male with zero working hours a month, received 136

thousand yen (SSRB) per month in 1983, based on the condition that he, with

spouse present, had worked for 30 years. The replacement rate, proxied by the

ratio of social security retirement benefits to personal disposable income per

capita in real terms, was about 50 percent on the average over the period from

1970 to 1982. This rate is low in comparison to the U.S. standard (Aldrich

1982).

     8. According to the Wage Census 1983, a typical male aged between 60 and

64 earned 1,290 yen per hour on at the average full—time job. In Table 1, if a

typical male worker receives labor earnings more than 92 thousand yen but less

than 150 thousand yen a month, his total income (social security retirement

benefits plus his labor earnings) is often smaller than the case in which he

earns labor earnings between 45 thousand and 92 thousand yen. The fact is that

the labor earnings of more than 92 thousand yen but less than 150 thousand yen

result in a 50 or an 80 percent reduction in social security retirement

benefits, while the other income range results in only a 20 percent reduction.

Therefore, it is clear that choosing working hours in the labor income range

of than 92 thousand yen but less than 150 thousand yen is an inferior solution

to maximize total income.

     9. The proportion of the elderly in the age category of 70 and over is

not reported.

     10. According to the 1980 Population Census of Japan (pp. XI-XXI),

"employed" persons refer to all persons who did any work during the week prior

to the census date for pay or profit, such as wages, salary, allowance, bust—



                                     -15—
ness profit, etc. ,    as well as persons who had a job or business but did not

work at all during the week prior to the census date because of vacation,

illness, bad weather, labor dispute, or personal reasons. Unemployed persons

refer to those who had no job but were able to work and were actively seeking

a job during the week prior to the census date. Among employed elderly men,

the two major categories in the Census are "mainly working or mostly worked'

and "secondarily working or working besides doing housework". There are,

however, no classifications for employed elderly men in terms of working hours

or weeks. Therefore, full—time work and part—time work in this paper refer to

"mainly working or mostly worked" and "secondarily working or working besides

doing housework' In the Census, respectively.

     11. Japan is administratively divided into forty—seven prefectures, of

which one carries the suffix "To", one carries "Do", two carry "Fu', and

forty—three    carry     "Ken".      Each prefecture is further subdivided into

"Shi(city)" and "Gun(rural county)". 'Gun" are further subdivided Into

"Cho(town)" and "Mura(village)". In our study, we employ data for urban areas,

referred to as "Shi(cities)". Further insight into the retirement decisions of

Japanese elderly men awaits the availability of individual and logitudinal

data, which, we find after conversations with Professor Yoshio Higuchi, are

inaccessible to reseachers not affiliated with the Japanese Government.

     12.   In the studies on the United States, Burtless and Moffitt (1985),

Duggan (1984), Hanoch and Honig (1983), Honi.g and Hanoch (1985),         Hurd   and

Boskin (1984), and Mitchell and Fields (1984) find social security retirement

benefits to induce earlier retirement.

     13. The retirement elasticity is obtained from the following formula:

(dIn R/dlii SSRB) =    — [(F/R)( ölnF/O1nSSRB )÷(P/R)( ölnP/ö1nSSRB )+

                          (U/R)( ólnU/OInSSRB )],

where R, F, P, and U of the       elderly in a   given age category are



                                          —16-
average proportions of retirement, full—time work, part-time work,

and unemployment, respectively, and R +      F + P + U =   1.

     14. There are little qualitative and quantitative changes, when social

security retirement benefits are treated endogenous and the predicted va1ues

are used in the model.

     15. The stated period of unemployment insurance benefits is 300 days and,

in addition, an extension is allowed from 60 to a maximum of 90 days under

certain conditions. The unemployment benefits are not subject to the reduction

of social security retirement benefits.

     16. The marginal effect is obtained from the application of equation (4).
