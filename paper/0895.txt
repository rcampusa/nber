                      Productivity Measurement Using Capital Asset
                   Valuation to Adjust for Variations in Utilization


                                       Abstract



    Although a great deal of empirical research on productivity measurement

has taken place in the last decade, one issue remaining particularly

controversial and decisive is the manner by which one adjusts the productivity

residual for variations in capital and capacity utilization. In this paper we

use the Marshaflian framework of a short run production or cost function with

certain inputs quasi—fixed to provide a theoretical basis for accounting for

variations in utilization. The theoretical model implies that the value of

services from stocks of quasi—fixed inputs should be altered rather than their

guantiy. This represents a departure from most previous procedures that have

adjusted the quantity of capital services for variations in utilization. In

the empirical illustration, we employ Tobin's q to measure the shadow value of

capital, and find that for the U.S. manufacturing sector, we can attribute

about 50%   of   the traditionally measured decline in productivity growth during

1973—77 to a decline in capacity utilization. Hence, adjusted for

utilization, the 1973—77 productivity slowdown in U.S. manufacturing is

considerably less than that measured using traditional productivity accounting

techniques.

 I. Introduction

     Ever since the early work of Jan Tinbergen [1942], George Stigler [1947]

 and Robert Solow [1957], the rate of multifactor productivity growth has

 typically been calculated as the difference between growth rates of output and

aggregate input. The resulting productivity "residual" includes conceivably

 the effects of a host of only partially quantifiable phenomena. This has led

Moses Abramovitz to refer to the residual as a "measure of our ignorance"

[1956, p. 11].

    Analysis and further understanding of factors affecting the productivity

residual has been the goal of much recent empirical research. For example,

improvements in the skill and quality of the labor force,' returns to

investment in research and education,2 changes in the composition of output
          3                       ..              .                .4
and input, and effects on productivity growth of increased regulation

have all been examined carefully. One issue which remains particularly

controversial and decisive, however, is the manner by which one adjusts

aggregate input and hence the productivity residual for variations in capital

and capacity utilization. A brief review of the literature may help to put

this controversy into proper perspective.

    It has long been recognized that productivity movements tend to be

procyclical.5 In his 1957 paper, Robert Solow calculated multifactor

productivity under the assumption that stocks of capital and labor inputs

experienced unemployment to the same degree. Labor input was measured by

Solow as manhours employed, and capital in use (as distinct from capital in

place) was computed as the constant dollar capital stock multiplied by one

minus the unemployment rate. Using this cyclically adjusted data, Solow

concluded that over the 1909—49 time period in the U.S., about one—eighth of

the total increase in output per manhour was due to increased capital per

manhour, and the remaining seven—eighths to multifactor productivity growth

("technical change").
                                          (2)
     Entirely   reversed findings were reported a decade later by Dale W.

Jorgenson and Zvi Griliches [1967], who concluded that for the U.S. rivate

domestic economy, 1945—65, the relative contribution of technical change was

negligible:

           "After elimination of aggregation errors and correction for
           changes in rates of utilization of labor and capital stock, the
           rate of growth of input explains 96.7 per cent of the rate of
           growth of output; change in total factor productivity explains
           the rest."6

One critical difference in measurement procedures between Jorgenson—Griliches

and Solow was that .Jorgenson—Griliches permitted capital to experience

unemployment to a different degree than labor. Specifically,

Jorgenson—Griliches    multiplied their aggregate capital stock series by an
estimate of the utilization of capital,     calculated as the relative utilization

of   electric motors in U.S. manufacturing and based on data constructed by
Murray Foss [l963]. Since, among other things, over this time period the
average number of shifts worked increased, capital in use increased more

rapidly than capital in place, resulting in a larger measure of aggregate

input and hence a smaller productivity residual.

     The .Jorgenson—Griliches findings and measurement procedures were debated

vigorously in a series of    articles and comments,8 with Edward F. Denison

objecting in particular to the capital utilization adjustment. Denison [1969]

argued it was inappropriate to adjust all capital inputs ——     equipment,
structures, land and inventories in the entire U.S. economy ——     by the
manufacturing electric motor utilization index. A year later, Laurits R.

Christensen and Dale W. Jorgenson [1970] reported results with only

non—residential    structures and   producers' durable equipment adjusted by the

electric   motor utilization index. Based on this reduced role of the
utilization adjustment and new annual data      for U.S. gross private domestic

product    (excluding household capital services), the Christensen—Jorgenson
estimate of the contributions of technical progress 1948—67 rose from a
                                        (3)

negligible 3% to 38%, while that of growth in input fell from 97 to 62%.
     In   his most recent research on productivity, Jorgenson has abandoned

entirely the practice of adjusting measured capital input for cyclical

 variations in utiU.zation.'° Among other noted productivity analysts, John

W. Kendrick [1973, 1979] and 3. Randolph Norsworthy et al. [1979] make no

adjustment to measured capital input for cyclical variations in utilization.

On the other hand, Denison adjusts his measure of total factor input for

"fluctuations in intensity of use" [l979a, p. 176] using an index of the

corporate profit share in corporate national income, a procedure which has

been criticized since it is unlikely to distinguish accurately between

cyclical and secular movements in profit shares.

    The difference between Denison and Norsworthy et al. in accounting for

variations in capacity utilization has recently generated a significant new

controversy. Denison [1979a] argues that the "mysterious" productivity

slowdown in the U.S. began in 1973, while Norsworthy et al. date the

unexplained decline as beginning much earlier, perhaps as early as 1965. The

reason for this disagreement on timing, Denison acknowledges, "...is my

inclusion of an estimate for the effect of fluctuations in intensity of demand

as a determinant of output per unit of input." Hence the dating of the

decline in productivity growth depends critically on the capital utilization

adjustment l2

    The above remarks, though admittedly not exhaustive, suggest clearly that

the manner by which one adjusts the productivity residual for variations in

utilization is both controversial and decisive. Notably, what has not

appeared in this controversy is a discussion of how basic economic theory

might clarify some of the issues. This paper represents a first step in the

attempt to interpret more clearly and measure more consistently the

productivity residual, adjusted for variations in the utilization rates of

quasi—fixed inputs such as capital plant and equipment.
                                           (4)
      In   Section II the traditional productivity measurement procedure is

related to the theory of cost and production. There it is noted th the

traditional method is appropriate only if the firm's output is produced at the

minimum point of its short run unit or average total cost (SRUC)       curve)3

In Section III a more general framework is adopted within the Marshallian

convention of a short run production function or a short run cost function

where      some input stocks are quasi—fixed (fixed in the short run but variable
in   the long run), other inputs     are variable, and output might not necessarily
be produced at the minimum point of the SRUC curve. In such a case, the

contributions of quasi—fixed inputs should be valued at their shadow prices,

not at their market prices. Adjustment of the productivity residual for

variations in capacity utilization is therefore made by altering the value not

the   quantity of capital. An attractive feature of' the     proposed procedure is

that it is non—parametric and does not require regression analysis or

econometric estimation. In Section IV an attempt is made to implement these

procedures empirically, using information from the stock market and "Tobin's

q",   which is interpreted    as the ratio of the   shadow value to the market value

of quasi—fixed capital.14 Section V provides concluding remarks. An
Appendix discusses and lists the data.

II. Theoretical Foundations Underlying Traditional Productivity Measurement
      The economic theory underlying traditional productivity measurement is

closely related to the theory of cost and production. Let there be a constant

returns to scale production function15 with traditional neoclassical

curvature properties relating the maximum possible output V obtainable during

period t from the flows of services of n inputs, X1, X2•••Xn and the

state of technology A:



                            Y(t) =   F[Xi(t),X2(t),...,Xn(t),A(t)]•                    (1)
                                                         (5)

 An increase in time t is assumed to lead to improvements in the state of'

 technology A(t) arising from disembodied technical change. A logarithmic
 differential of'   (1)   can be written as




        din y(t) -          3m Y(t)                 din x1(t)
                 —                                              +
                                                                    3m Y(t)       din A(t)
           dt               3m   X1(t)
                                            '
                                                         dt         3in A(tY            dt            (2)



Denoting the output elasticities                               by W, setting                 =   1,
and interpreting logarithmic derivatives as rates of growth we can write (2) as


                                            =
                                                        i1wi                                           ()
or

                                                =
                                                                                                       (4)

The actual (as opposed to measured) multifactor productivity growth rate A/A.

is given by (4). Under the assumption of constant returns to scale W1 = 1

and the last term in (4) can be interpreted as the elasticity—weighted

aggregate input. If output elasticities and all service flows were

observable, (4) would provide the correct measure of muitifactor productivity

growth independent of factor market and capacity utilization issues. These

latter issues arise due to the different possible ways of measuring W and

the flows of services from capital inputs; and hence A/A.

     The conventional method of measuring A/A is to assume that observed inputs

and outputs have been generated by firms in competitive long run equilibrium.

With prices of output and inputs fixed, the firm chooses input levels so as to

maximize profits. The first order conditions for profit maximization are then




                          Y(t)       P(t)
                                 —
                                     P(t)           '                  1   ,. •                       (5)
                      x(t)
                                             (6)

where P(t) is output price and P1(t) is the market price of the        th
input.   Now since the output elasticities can be written in terms of' arginal
products,



                    1n Y t
                -— 1n           -     Y(t) x(t)         '          '." '         (6)
                         t      —

                                      BX(t) Y(E)

we can substitute (5) into (6), and obtain


               1n             P.(t)        x.(t)
                    Y(t) ——    1            1

                                           Y(t)
                                                   = S (t) '
                                                   —           =1                (7)
              1n X(t)          P(t)



Under competitive conditions, profits are zero and revenue equals costs,

implying that the output elasticity W1 can be measured by the cost share of

the 1th input in total costs of production.'6 Hence

                                                   =                             (8)




and A/A is measured by




                                       =                                         (9)




    Under the assumption of competitive long run equilibrium, all capital

inputs are optimally utilized in the sense that total cost of production per

unit of output is minimized. This long run optimal utilization is what we

will call "full" utilization. When utilization is "full", flows from capital

inputs can be assumed to be proportional to the stocks. This leads to the
                                               (7)

 replacement of unobserved capital services flows in (9) by observed stocks.

 The rate of' multifactor productivity growth is then calculated from (9) as the

difference between the growth rates of output and aggregate input X/X,



                                      A1       =
                                                     y-,                                  (10)


where aggregate input growth )/X is the revenue or cost share—weighted

aggregate of the individual input growth rates, i.e.




                                           =
                                                                                         (ii)


      Finally, it should be noted that a well—known discrete approximation to

the continuous Divisia index (9) is the Tbrnqvist index



         ln[ATCt)/Al Ct-i)] =   in[Y(t)/Y(t-i)]          -
                                                               (t) 1n[X (t)/X (t-i )],   (12)


where


                          S1(t)   = l/2[S1(t)        +   S(t - 1)].                      (13)

      The above measure of multifactor productivity is inappropriate whenever
firms are not in long run cost—minimizing equilibrium. In order to highlight
the   capacity utilization issue in the following section, we will assume that a

firm is not in long run equilibrium whenever output is produced at a level

other than that corresponding with the minimum point on the firm's short run

unit cost curve. This, of course, is the relevant condition for a perfectly

competitive industry. Were the firm under observation not in a perfectly

competitive industry, we would say that it is not in long run equilibrium
                                                  (8)

whenever it is producing output at a level other than that corresponding to

the tangency point of a short run average cost curve and the long ru average

cost curve. An analogous argument to that constructed in the following

section could be developed for such a case.

      Before proceeding to the next section, we note that the methods outlined

in the introduction which have been used to adjust capital services can of

course be viewed as attempts, when the firm is considered to be out of long

run equilibrium, to relax the proportionality assumption used to identify

capital flows from stocks. With the exception of Baily's [1981b] constant

share Cobb—Douglas model these adjustments have been ad hoc and have not

recognized explicitly that the long run marginal conditions used to obtain the
value (cost) shares are no longer appropriate.

III. A Generalized Approach to Productivity Measurement
      In   the traditional long run equilibrium treatment, it is assumed that all
inputs     are variable and that for each input,        marginal product equals P1/P.
We now relax this assumption. Let us partition the set of n inputs into two

exhaustive and mutually exclusive subsets, one subset of 3 variable inputs,

v =           v2,...,v3}, and another subset of M quasi—fixed inputs,
      {v1,
f                                 The quasi—fixed inputs are fixed in the short
      {r1,

run, and can be varied over time but only by incurring increasing marginal

costs of adjustment.

      Using this partition of inputs, we now specify a short run production

function17




             Y(t)                                                     fM(t);   A(t)],
                        F[v1(t), v2(t)..., v3(t); f1(t), f2(t).. .3

                    =
                        F[v(t);    f(t); A(t)].                                         (14)
                                                               (9)

In (14), Y(t) is the maximum amount of output obtainable during period t given

flows of variable inputs v(t), stocks of quasi—fixed inputs f(t) and the state

of technology A(t). Note that in (14) we no longer have a flow—stock

identification problem since the quasi—fixed (capital) inputs are specified as

stocks. The logarithmic differential of (14) can be written as


                                                                          M

    Now suppose a firm is not in long run competitive equilibrium but instead

is in short run competitive equilibrium. A firm maximizing expected short run

variable profits [given f(t)] will choose levels of' variable input flows so

which looks just like (7), except that (18) holds only for the variable

inputs, not for the quasi—fixed inputs. Expenditures on a particula variable

factor in (7) and (18) are numerically equal but         S.(t)   1 unless there
                                                    j1
are no quasi—fixed factors.

    Since by definition the    are quasi—fixed in the short run, it follows

that for the short run (one period) profit maximizing firm, marginal product

values of the m are not necessarily equal to transaction prices Pm(t)

where m is now the market user cost, or one—period market rental price of

the mth input stock. Hence output elasticities will differ from value

shares. Define the expost realized shadow user cost of the mt quasi—fixed

input as Zm:



                               z t' —   P(t)aY(t)                                 19

and the ex ante expected shadow user cost as Z:




                              Z*(t) =   p*(t)y(t)                                 20)
                               m             m(t)



where P*(t) is the expected output price. Note that we are now considering a

disequilibrium process (relative to the long run equilibrium) and non—realized

expectations are possible. Implicit in our formulation is the assumption that

at the beginning of the period (ex ante), the firm forms expectations about

future input and output prices. Its optimal response in adjusting quasi—fixed

factors is based on these expectations. Hence the expected value of the

marginal product [z(t)] is the relevant shadow rental price, corresponding

to the observed levels of the quasi—fixed inputs. Ex post, once actual input

and output prices are known, the firm chooses the levels of its variable

factors and output, conditional on the prior choice of the quasi—fixed factors.
                                               (11)

This means that the actual value shares [S(t)] are the correct weights for

the variable factors.

    Z*(t) represents the additional expected variable profits during period

t obtained by adding one more unit of'                for one time period. Differences

between the transaction rental prices Pm(t) and expected shadow rental

prices z(t) are usually thought to be due to the presence of increasing

marginal costs of adjustment for the quasi—fixed inputsJ8 When Z >
    the   firm expects a relative shortage of m and has incentives to

invest in additional units of            when          <         the firm expects to

find itself with relative surplus of' f'm and has incentives to disinvest;

finally, when Z =           the   short and long run levels of t'm coincide,

implying that no incentives exist to change stocks of f'm• This suggests an

important relationship among Z, P and capacity utilization which will be

discussed later.

    The output elasticity of the mth quasi—fixed input can be expressed in

terms of the expected shadow prices Z(t) as follows:

When Z decreases from       =        to Z <                     for   all m (a relative

surplus of stocks of f'm exist), f'm is valued less highly                               is utilized

to a lesser extent), and therefore aggregate input growth X*/X* is less than

/X, implying by (10) and (24) that A2/A2                        is    greater than A1/A1. If

the firm is in long run disequilibrium because capacity has become

underutilized between periods t — 1 and t, A2/A2 is the correct measure of

A/A and the traditional measure A1/A1 understates true multifactor

productivity growth. Our empirical results, presented in section IV, suggest

that this is the case for U.S. manufacturing during the period 1973—77, that

the   reverse bias occurred during 1965—73, and hence that the productivity
downturn after 1973 has not been as great as conventionally measured.
      The decreased utilization of                  when
                                                                Z<P           is accounted for in

(24) by adjusting values of stocks f, not their quantities of'                             service
flows. Recall from the introduction that previously some productivity

researchers have adjusted the quantity of quasi—fixed factors (like capital)
                                             (13)
 for   utilization, not the value weights of these factors. Finally, it should

 be clear that when        =
                               Z   for all m, X/X =   X*/X*,   and the traditional and

 our alternative measures of multifactor productivity coincide.

       A graphical analysis may be helpful at this point. In Figure 1 below, we

 show the long run unit cost (hereafter, LRUC) curve as being flat, with the

level of LRUC equal to c0. The LRUC curve is flat because we have assumed

that the long run production function is characterized by constant returns to

scale. As seen in Figure 1, however, the short run unit cost (average total

cost, hereafter, SRUC) curve is U—shaped, reflecting the fact that in the

short run certain inputs are quasi—fixed. The position and shape of' the SRUC

curve depend on technology, Y, P, f'm' Dm and A.

       At the level of output Y0 in Figure 1, the SRUC curve reaches a minimum

point c0. Based on a tradition dating back at least to the work of 3. M.

Cassels [1937], Lawrence Klein [1960, 1962] and Bert Hickman [1964], Y0 has

been called the firm's                 level of output. Notice that at Y0,        the
LRUC curve is tangent to the SRUC curve)9 It might also be noted that this

short run unit cost—minimizing level of output V0 will not necessarily

coincide with the firm's short run profit maximizing level of output. For

example, if the firm faced competitive markets and if suddenly the market

price of Y increased to a level greater than c0, the firm            could   enhance its

short   run profits by expanding its output beyond V0 until short run marginal
cost equalled market price.20 Nonetheless, the capacity level of output
V° embodies desirable economic welfare properties, in that if market
                                                                     prices
reflected   marginal social costs, V0 would be that level of output for which
society would be expending minimum unit social costs. Finally, as noted by
Hickman,   if   the output level were sustained at Y0, there would be no

economic incentive for the firm to alter its production technology by varying

quantities of its quasi—fixed inputs. In contrast, if' an output level

   > V0 were sustained, the firm could reduce unit costs by adding to

its net stocks of f'm' thereby eventually shifting its SRUC curve in Figure 1

to SRUC1, and ultimately attaining again the minimum level of unit cost c

at the increased output level V'. With the increased stocks of f and the

new unit cost curve SRUC1, new short run capacity output would of' course be

equal to V1.

    Having discussed capacity output, we now define the f'irrn's rate of

capacity utilization u as actual output V divided by capacity output V0, i.e.


                                       u V/V0                                   (26)


When u < 1 so that V < Y°, the firm is to the left of the minimum point

on the SRUC curve; reductions in unit cost can be achieved by increasing

output. On the other hand, when u > 1 so that V > Y0, the firm is to the

right of the minimum point on the SRUC curve, where increases in output result

in greater SRUC. If one defines short run returns to scale as the percentage

change in output divided by the percentage change in the quantity of each

variable input, all quasi—fixed input stocks fixed, then when u < 1 the firm

enjoys short run increasing returns to scale, and when u > 1 it encounters

short run decreasing returns to scale.21

    As an example, consider the case of a single quasi—fixed factor (capital)

and a single variable input (labor) producing output (value added). Whenever
V > Y0, then not only will u >   1,   but the expected shadow rental price

of capital (Z*) will be greater than the market rental price of capital

      Define the ratio of Z to         as           i.e.


                                             z*

(In the next section we relate    to Tobin's q in order to measure the

shadow value weight W.) When the rate of capacity utilization is gr3ater

than unity,    will also be greater than unity. Intuitively, unit cost is

rising because of diminishing returns to the increasingly utilized fixed

factor capital; if the firm increased its stock of capital by renting one more

unit for one period, average total costs for that period would fall. Thus the

one period value of the capital to the firm ——   the   shadow rental price of

capital, the one period reduction in unit costs ——     is greater   than the market

rental price of capital, implying that      is greater than unity and that

cost—reducing investment is induced; the rate of such investment depends of

course on the magnitude of adjustment costs.

    In a similar way, when the firm is expecting to produce output to the left

of the minimum point on the SRUC curve (u <    1),     is also less than

unity, and incentives for net increases in the capital stock do not exist.

When the firm's expected output equals its capacity output, both u and

equal unity, and average cost is expected to be at a minimum.

    The notion of multifactor productivity growth is illustrated in Figure 2.

Let the original LRUC curve be LRUC0, and let the new LRUC curve reflecting

an improved state of technology be LRUC1. Assuming that input prices remain

unchanged between periods 0 and 1, the effect of disembodied technical

progress is to reduct LRUC from c0 to c'. Under conditions of long run

competitive equilibrium, multifactor productivity growth would be calculated

in Figure 2 by holding input quantities constant between time periods 0 and 1,

but letting output increase. Hence total cost would remain unchanged while

unit costs fell, and A1/A1 would be indicated by the output growth BO and

would be measured, using (12), as a logarithm of the ratio 0Y1/0Y.

    This traditional measure of inultifactor productivity growth is based on

the assumption that in both time periods actual output equals capacity output,
                                                   (17)

 i.e., u =    i.22   In terms of Figure 2, it is traditionally assumed              that all
 observed points correspond to economic             capacity output   levels   and minimum   unit
 costs such as (c
                     00
                     ,   V   )

                                 and (c , V   ).   We now provide a graphical

 interpretation of multifactor productivity measurement when rates of capacity

utilization differ from unity.

       In Figure 2, let the original level of output be               rather than V0 and

for simplicity assume ex ante expectations are realized. Since                  V <
the   original rate of capacity utilization u0 is less than unity. Let the

output level at time period 1 be V'. This implies that while u0 <                   1,
u1 =   i.23   Assume that input prices do not change between time periods 0

and 1. Now if only the two data points (c°, Y) and (c', Y1) were

observed, if it were incorrectly assumed that both points represented long run

equilibria (where u =        1),   and if multifactor productivity growth were then

measured using (12), true multifactor productivity growth would be overstated,

since the horizontal distance y1              yS is larger than Y' — V0.       By

incorrectly assuming that (c°, Y) represented a long run equilibrium, the

researcher would be attributing to improvements in the state of technology

ACt) increases in output due partly to increases in the rate of capacity

utilization. Although improvements in the state of technology would be

reflected in output increases from V0 to Y', the additional increase in

output from      to V° would have nothing to do with multifactor productivity

growth, but instead solely reflect gains due to exploitation of short run

increases in capacity utilization from u0 < 1 to u1 =                  24

      Let us now summarize the discussion to this point. Traditional

multifactor productivity growth measures are appropriate only if the observed

data points coincide with long run equilibrium conditions where output is

 multif'actor productivity growth should be measured using (22) which

a measure of multifactor productivity growth that properly accounted for

variations in the rate of capacity utilization. This is the approach taken in

the next section.


IV. Empirical Illustration Employing Tobin's g

    In this section we present an empirical implementation of multifactor

productivity measurement that attempts to incorporate variations in capacity

utilization in a theoretically consistent manner. Although the general

empirical applicability of the utilization—adjusted multifactor productivity

growth measure (22) may be circumscribed due to difficulties in obtaining

reliable data on the expected shadow values of quasi—fixed inputs, here we

consider one case of special empirical interest for which an estimate of

shadow values is available.

    Assume the short run production function has 3 variable inputs

v1,v2,. ..Vj and only one quasi—fixed input, physical capital K. A

discrete approximation to the productivity growth measure A2/A2 in (22)

can be written as26

Recall from (21) that (t) employs the expected shadow rental value of'

capital Z(t) rather than the ex post market rental value Pk(t). Also, by

way of comparison, note that the traditional multifactor productivity formula

(12) for A1/A1 assumes that capital is a variable input and that

production always takes place at the minimum point on the short run unit cost

curve.

    In order to implement empirically measurement of A21A2          using   (22), it

is necessary to obtain data on the expected shadow rental price of capital,

Z. Our approach here is to utilize a notion of James Tobin, called Tobin's

q, and defined by him simply as the market value of the firm (the value of the

firm's securities —   debt plus equity —   in   the securities market) divided by
                                                          27
the replacement cost of its physical capital stock.

    Tobin's q was originally presented in the context of a financial portfolio

model, where a firm faced the choice of buying claims to a firm's assets or

investing in the new plant and equipment directly. Whenever marginal q is

greater than unity, the firm maximizing its net worth will invest in plant and

equipment directly, rather than purchase financial claims to these assets, for

in such a way net worth is increased by the difference between the market

valuation and the costs of investing in the capital goods.28 A slight

variant   of q with more "real" than "financial" structure was developed
initially by Andrew Abel [1978,   Essay    IV],   discussed    also by John Ciccolo and

Gary Fromm [1979], and extended by Hiroshi Yoshikawa 11980] and Fumio Hayashi

[1982]. In its amended form, q is defined as the shadow price of installed

capital goods divided by the tax—adjusted price of uninstalled capital goods.
                                     (21)

The numerator represents the marginal benefits of investment, while the

denominator represents the marginal costs. Using a dynamic optimization

framework, Abel showed that investment is an increasing function of the shadow

price of this q. E. R. Berndt [1980b] has implemented empirically Abel's

notion of q, incorporating also internal costs of adjustment.

    As noted by Hayashi [19823, Tobin's q incorporates information on

expectations held by investors with respect to future market conditions; hence

expectations regarding input and output prices are implicit in the stock

market valuation process. This implies that Tobin's q is linked not to the

post actual shadow price zk(t) but to the ex ante expected shadow price

Z(t), as we require. It is this powerful informational content of Tobin's

q which allows us to avoid explicit specification of an expectations

hypothesis in our empirical analysis. Note also that regression techniques

are not necessary.

    From the equations of' motion of the cost of adjustment model, it can be

shown that the expected shadow rental price Z can be obtained by replacing

the capital stock transactions price a(t) by q.a(t) in the standard

Jorgenson neoclassical user cost of capital formula.29 As long as the

capital gains term is ignored, Z can be obtained equivalently as


                                 z=q k                                         (30)


where the measure of    is the traditional Hall—Jorgenson rental price of

capital formula that includes tax variables, but that uses as the interest

rate a weighted average of the debt and equity borrowing costs of capital.3°

    Jorgenson's measure has typically been an ex post internal rate of return,

and therefore use of that measure yields Zk rather than k• Note as well

that Jorgenson's measure does not yield Z unless expectations are

realized. We consider this issue in more detail below.
                                     (22)

   Empirical estimates of q for the U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector on an

annual basis are published regularly in the U. S. Economic Report of the

President.31 Measurement issues have been discussed by, among others,

Daniel M. Holland and Stewart C. Myers [1979, 1980], who work from the notion

that "...q reflects the expected profitability of corporate investment

relative to the opportunity cost of capital" [1979. p. 117]. Holland—Myers

note that alternative estimates of q can be obtained from the same underlying

data base, due to alternative assumptions about depreciation and service

lives, historical book value versus current replacement cost accounting, and

"narrow" (structures, equipment, and inventories) versus "augmented"

(structures, equipment, inventories, land and working capital) measures of

capital stock.32

    In Table 1 below we present four estimates of q, three for the total U.S.

nonfinancial corporate sector and one for the U.S. manufacturing sector.33

Columns 1 and 2 are estimates constructed by Holland—Myers. Their "standard

q" estimates in column 1 tend to be slightly larger than their "augmented q"

estimates in column 2, primarily because the former include in the denominator

of q only structures, equipment and inventories, while the latter add to the

denominator estimates of land and working capital. The cyclical behavior of

both measures is quite similar, however, each reaching a trough in 1949 and a

peak in 1965.

    In column 3 we list estimates of q as published in the 1981 Economic

Report of the President. These estimates are smaller than the Holland—Myers

augmented q estimates in all years except 1958 and 1970; the difference,

however, is rather small except for 1974. Unfortunately, the Economic Report

of the President does not provide details on how the estimate of q was

constructed, but merely defines it as equity plus interest—bearing debt

divided by current replacement cost of net assets. In column 4 we present

Holland—Myers estimates of q (based on the "standard" rather than "augmented"

assumption) for the U.S. manufacturing sector. These sector—specific

estimates are more volatile than those for the entire nonfinancial coporate

sector. The manufacturing estimates vary, for example, from 1.98 in 1965 to

0.56   in   1978, whereas the corresponding high and low nonfinancial corporate

sector estimates are 1.57 and 0.71.

    Finally, since in our theoretical development we relate q to an economic

notion of capacity utilization, in the final two columns of Table 1 we list

Wharton and Federal Reserve Board (FRB) estimates of capacity utilization (CU)

for the U.S. manufacturing sector. It should be noted here that these

published measures of CU are constructed in a rather mechanical way and have

only a limited relationship with the economic measure of CU defined earlier as

the ratio of actual output to the output at which short and long run average

cost curves are tangent.34 The Wharton measure of CU is lowest in 1961, is

surprisingly high in the 1974—79 time period, and hits its peak in 1973; by

contrast, the Holland—Myers estimate of q is lowest in 1974 and highest in

1965. Hence there appears to be considerable differences between q and the

Wharton measure of CU. Trends in the FRB measure of CU, however, move more

closely with q. As seen in the last column of Table 1, the FRB is lowest in

1975 (when q is also very low), and is highest in 1966 (when q is also very

high).35 Hence there appears to be considerable agreement between movements

in q and in the FRB measure of' CU.36

       Having discussed alternative measures of q, we now incorporate q into the

measurement of rnultifactor productivity. While the q theory allows

computation of Z, we cannot compute W exactly since F*(t) is unknown.

Instead, we estimate W by W where



                             z(t)      K(t)
                        W=
                         k    P(t) .   Y(t)          k' /   P(t)
                                                                                   31
                                           (25)
 In   essence, we replace the unobserved expected output price with the observed

 actual output price. This substitution may affect the measurement of

productivity. However, if output price expectations are realized, it has no

effect. Also, if expectations errors are small and random, the effect should

be minimal. A third distinct possibility is that investors systematically

underestimate cyclical variations. In that case

P(t) <   P*(t)   when u < 1 and P(t) >   P*(t)   when u > 1.   It follows that

        W when u      1. In this case our empirical results would underestimate

the contribution of capacity utilization effects to variations in traditionally

measured multifactor productivity growth.

      We now calculate both A1/A1 and A2/A2. Recall that the former

assumes all inputs are variable, whereas the latter allows capital to be

quasi—fixed in the short run and permits production to be at output levels

other than at the minimum point on the firm's short run unit cost curve, i.e.,

A2/A2   incorporates   variations over time in capacity utilization. Our

results   for A1/A1 and A2/A2 are presented in columns 1 and 3 of Table
2. These results utilize annual data provided by 3. Randolph Norsworthy and
Michael 3.   Harper   of the   U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on capital (K), labor

(L), energy (E), non—energy intermediate materials (H), and gross output (Y)

for the U.S. manufacturing sector 1958—77. These data are listed and

discussed in greater detail in the Data Appendix.

      The market rental price of capital k used in our measure of Z         =    q
k employs as the cost of capital r a borrowing rate from the securities

market. This procedure differs from that of Jorgenson and his associates, who

typically assume q = 1 but use as their estimate of r in            the ex post

internal rate of return earned on the beginning—of—year capital stock. The

rental price of capital using such an ex post internal rate of return is just

Zk, the actual expost shadow price. Hence Jorgenson's procedure can be
                                       (26)

 interpreted as adjusting the productivity formula for capacity utilization by

 employing the weight Wk(t) rather than the correct weight, W(t) or its

 proxy W(t). For comparison purposes we present in column 2 of Table 2

 measures of' average annual productivity growth using Wk(t) as weights.

    We first compare columns 1 and 2, the traditional and Jorgenson measures.

 Over the entire 1958—77 time period, the two average annual growth rates are

virtually identical —   0.829 and 0.832 percent per year. Moreover, these two

measures differ only very slightly over the 1958—65 sub—period. Beginning in

1965, however, the measures show slightly greater differences:

drops 0.459% per year from 1965—73 to 1973—77 (.671 to .212) whereas the

Jorgenson exç shadow price measure drops 0.343% per year (.628 to .285).

This implies that 25% of the traditionally measured decline in productivity

growth from 1965—73 to 1973—77 in the U.S. manufacturing would be captured by

declines in capacity utilization using the expost measure.

    Now comparing A1/A1 with the correct A2/P2 measure, we first note

that our utilization—adjusted measure of' the growth rate over the 1958—77

period is somewhat less than that of the traditional measure. This reflects

the fact that, on average, economic capacity utilization has been growing and

been greater than full utilization, thereby inducing positive net capital

accumulation. The two measures differ in all periods and the differences are

substantial after 1965. In particular, from 1965—73 to 1973—77 our measure

declines only 0.232% per year (compared with 0.459% for A1//.'1). Hence our

analysis attributes 50% of the traditionally measured decline in total factor

productivity gnwth after 1973 to declines in capacity utilization. This

suggests that when properly measured, the productivity growth slowdown in U.S.

manufacturing since 1973 is less than typically measured.

    We conclude with two observations. First, although incorporation of'

capacity utilization into productivity calculations substantially reduces
                                          (28)

the differences in growth rates among sub—periods, some considerable

differences still remain to be explained. The contribution of the A2/A2

residual to "explaining" growth in output is 24% in 1958—65, 14% in 1965—73,

and jumps to 28% in l973—77. Second, our results indicate that the major

decline in long run productivity growth occurred about 1965 —      not 1973. This
presents a challenge to simple energy crisis explanations of the productivity

growth slowdown.


V. Concluding Remarks

       Although a great deal of empirical research on productivity measurement

has taken place in the last decade, one issue remaining particularly

controversial     and decisive is the manner by which one adjusts the productivity
residual for variations in capital and capacity utilization. In this paper we
have used tl-e Marshaflian framework of a short run production or cost function

with certain inputs quasi—fixed, and have provided a theoretical basis for

accounting for variations in utilization by altering the value of services

from   stocks of quasi—fixed inputs, rather than their guantiy. This
represents     somewhat of a departure from previous procedures that adjusted the

quantity of capital services for variations in utilization. An attractive

feature of our approach is that it is non—parametric and therefore does not

require regression analysis. In the empirical illustration, we have employed

Tobin's q to measure the shadow value of capital, and have found that for the

U.S. manufacturing sector, we can attribute 50% of the traditionally measured

decline in productivity growth, from 1965—73 to 1973—77, to a decline in

capacity utilization.

      Our discussion has focussed on inultifactor productivity measurement, but

our results also have implications for the interpretation of labor

productivity growth. Of course the measure of labor productivity growth, Y/Y

—   L/L,   is unaffected by variations in the utilization of' non—labor inputs.
                                               (29)
 However, since labor productivity growth can be rewritten in terms of

 multifactor productivity growth,

 it is clear   that   the role of the properly measured utilization—adjusted

      in "explaining" growth in labor productivity is affected by

variations in capacity utilization.

    In this paper differences between shadow values and market values of

capital have been posited to be due to costs of' adjustment. This suggests

that costs of adjustments could be included explicitly into the short run

production or cost function, and productivity could then be represented as the

time shift in this function.38 Capacity output could be redefined in terms

of costs inclusive of' adjustment costs. Alternative expectations assumptions

could also be incorporated. An empirical disadvantage of such an approach,

however, is that data on adjustment costs are not easily obtained, and thus

empirical implementation might be difficult.

    Finally, it is well known that average and marginal values of q are likely

to differ, particularly when the characteristics of the capital stock in place

vary considerably from those emobdied in new plant and equipment. For

example, the energy efficiency of certain equipment manufactured and sold in

the U.S. during the late 1960's and early 1970's may be lower than that sold

in the 1950's or being produced today. As a consequence, the market value of

capital in place may be considerably less than the market value of new

equipment, and average q may be much smaller than marginal q.39 Such

vintage effects need to be examined more carefully, both theoretically and
                                     (30)

empirically, and their implications for productivity measurement assessed.4°

    We conclude that in order to understand better recent trends in

productivity growth, particular account must be taken of the utilization and

characteristics of' the capital stock. This paper represents a first step in

that direction.

DATA APPENDIX

    Annual data on input prices and quantities for capital (K), labor (L),

energy (E) and non—energy intermediate materials (M), as well as gross output

(Y,OUTPUT) are listed in Table A—l. These data were generously provided by 3.

Randolph Norsworthy and Michael 3. Harper of the U.S. Bureau of Labor

Statistics. Capital is a Divisia aggregate index of producers' durable

equipment, nonresidential structures, land and inventories; the capital rental

price accounts for tax factors, depreciation, and uses for the rate of

interest the Moody AA bond yield. Labor quantity measures incorporate

variations over time in the composition and educational attainment of the

labor force, as well as inter—industry shifts. The energy data represent

purchases of' various energy types for heat, light and motive power, while M

data are based on establishment surveys and censuses, and include sales

between establishments within the manufacturing and nonmanuf'acturing firms.

The gross output measure represents deflated sales plus changes in inventories.

10. See for example Frank M. Gollop and Dale W. Jorgenson [1979, 1980], who

   estimate that over the 1948—1973 time period in the aggregate U.S. private

   economy, growth in inputs contributed 67.5% to growth of value added

   output, while technical progress was responsible for the remaining 32.5%

   [1979, 9.5, p. 9—25]. It should be noted that in the Gollop—Jorgenson

   disaggregated sectoral analysis, the output measure used is gross output

   rather than value added, and intermediate inputs such as energy are

   Included. The incorporation of energy inputs into total factor input

   measures indirectly takes account of variations in capital utilization,

   but measured capital input is still unaffected by fluctuations in

   utilization. See E.R. Berndt [1980a] for additional details.

13. A more complete discussion of the dual cost—price relationship in

    productivity measurement is found in Berndt—Fuss [1981].

14. A related approach has recently been taken by Martin Baily [l981b].

    He also develops a theoretical model in which capital asset valuation and

    Tobin's q play important roles in the utilization adjustment. However

    his model leads to an adjustment of the quantity of' capital. As Baily

    notes, the production function must be of' the Cobb—Douglas functional

    form for his utilization adjustment procedure to be valid. Our method

    is   more general and in particular is applicable to any neoclassical
    production   function.

15. The constant returns to scale assumption is not crucial to the development

    of this section, although it does simplify the exposition. For a similar

    analysis in the case of non—constant returns to scale, see Michael Denny,

   Melvyn Fuss and Leonard Waverman [1981].

16. This result can also be obtained by assuming the firm is a cost minimizer

   subject to exogenous output requirements. See Denny, Fuss and Waverman

    [1981] for the derivation under this assumption which does not assume

   perfect competition in output markets.

17. The notion of a short run profit or production function was discussed in a

   rigorous manner by Paul A. Samuelson [1953—1954].

18. Adjustment costs have been discussed in a rigorous manner by Robert E.

   Lucas, Jr. [1967] and have been implemented empirically by Berndt, Fuss

   and Waverrnan [1979] and Catherine 3. Morrison and Ernst R. Berndt [1981].

19. As noted earlier, this tangency relationship is the general criterion,

      valid in non—competitive environments.

20. However Y0 would correspond to the firm's long run profit maximizing

      output in a competitive industry with easy entry and exit.

21. For further elaboration see Morrison and Berndt [1981].

22. See Berndt-.Fuss [1981] for a discussion of the corresponding productivity

      measurement based on the dual.

23. We could have assumed x1 = 1 without any conceptual change, but with some

      unnecessary additional complication to Figure 2.

24. Using the above analysis, we can decompose the traditional measure of

      multifactor productivity growth; since A1/A1 = Y/Y — X/X = (V/Y —

      X*/X*)    +   (X*/X*   -   /X)   =
                                           A2/A2
                                                   +   (k*/x*   -   /X)   where (X*/X* -   /X)   is

      the capacity utilization effect. A similar decomposition exists for the

      dual measures analysed below.

25.   However one could find               such that F*(Y/f) =              p   and use

      m' Dm in the productivity formulae. This would be equivalent to

      adjusting the quasi—fixed factors for capacity utilization effects.

26. Denny and Fuss [1982] have shown that the approximation (28) can be

      obtained as the difference between two second order logarithmic expansions

      of (14) around the exogenous variables evaluated at t and t — 1

      respectively. Equation (28) is exact if (14) is quadratic in logarithms

      (i.e. a translog function).

29. See for example equation (9) in Hayashi [1982] which can be rearranged
                                       X
    to yield   Tik =   p*(t)   =
                                   1   -   [r   +   s   —   x/x]   where x, the tax

    adjusted expected value of capital, = q                 .   a(t).   This assumes the cost

    of adjustment function depends only on investment so that                      =   0.
30. Discussion of this formula is found in, among other places, Ernst R.

    Berndt [1976].

    p. 333; for 1981, Table B—86, p. 331; and for 1980, Table B-85, p. 303.

32. One could interpret q as the market value of the firm's intangible plus

    tangible capital divided by the replacement value of its tangible capital.

    Holland—Myers [1979, p. 150] find, however, that the intangible assets,

    growth opportunities and monopoly rents "counted for very little when

    NFC's [nonfinancial corporations] are examined in aggregate".

35. Note also that q measures are based on end of year securities' values,

    while CU measures are averaged over the four quarters of the year.

36. For t€ manufacturing sector 1958—77, the simple correlation between the

    Wharton measure of CU and q is only .012; between FRB and q, 0.675; and

    between Wharton and FRB, 0.621.

39. Hayashi [1982] has proposed a method for calculating marginal q from

    average q. However his method depends, among other things, on the
                                      (37)

    assumption that the cost of adjustment function depends on the stock of

    capital as well as on its rate of change. In this case the shadow user

    cost is not observable from observations on average q, for Hayashi's

    equation (9) contains the unknown parameter iPK•
