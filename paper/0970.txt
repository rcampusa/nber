            The Optimal Level of Social Security Benefits



                               ABSTRACT



     The optimal level of Social Security benefits depends on balancing

the protection that these benefits offer to those who have not provided

adequately for their own old age against the welfare costs of distorting

economic behavior. The primary such cost is the distortion in private

saving. The present paper derives the level of Social Security benefits

that is optimal in three basic cases.

     In the first section of the paper, the optimal level of benefits is

derived for an economy in which all individuals do not anticipate retire-

ment at all and therefore do not save. The second and third sections then

derive the optimal benefits for economies with two different definitions

of attitudes toward retirement and saving.

           The provision of social security retirement benefits is a major
government activity in every industrial nation. In the United States, these
public   pensions now account for more than 20 percent of the federal budget. The

principle rationale for such mandatory programs is that some individuals lack

the foresight to save for their retirement years. Since the provision of social

security benefits imposes real costs on a nation, the optimal level of benefits

requires balancing the protection of the nropic against the costs of distorted

real resource allocation.

           The primary cost of providing social security benefits is the welfare

loss that results from reductions in private saving.1 In addition, the paent

of benefits distorts retirement behavior and the imposition of the tax used to

finance the program distorts the labor supply during the preretirement period.2

If tastes differ and borrowing is restricted, some individuals may be forced to

consume more in their retirement years than they would with perfect foresight

have chosen to do. Although all three types of welfare cost should be considered

There has been substantial research on the effect of social security on private
saving. Although there is no agreement on the magnitude of this effort, most
studies find that social security reduces private saving. See e.g., Blinder,
Gordon and Wise (1981), Diamond and Haussman (1982), Feldstein (19T6, 1982a) and
Kotlikoff (1979).

in selecting the optimal benefit level, the present analysis focuses exclusively

on the savings distortion.

           In principle, the adverse effect of social security benefits on pri.-

vate saving can be offset if the government accumulates an adequately large

social security trust fund (Feldstein, 1977). Mare generally, as Samuelson

(1975) has noted, a social security trust fund could acquire enough capital to

bring the econon to golden rule efficiency. In general, this would require

that the social security obligations are more than fully funded and may require

the trust fund to own the nation's entire capital stock. As a practical matter,

however, the social security programs in the United States and in many other

countries operates on a pay—as—you—go basis without a capital fund.    I shall in

this paper derive the optimal benefit level in an unfunded program.

           To focus on the welfare cost imposed by the saving distortion, I will

assume that labor is supplied inelastically and that the retirement date is exo-

genous. This also excludes the problem of uncertain health status that Diamond

and Mirrles (1978, 1981) have examined. In the economy that I study, all indivi-

duals also have equal earnings and identical tastes although they differ in

their ability to plan during their working years for their future retirement

period. There is no uncertainty about future rates of return, rates of popula-

tion   growth, productivity and demographics.
           The paper   begins by deriving the optimal level of benefits in an

economy in which individuals do not anticipate their retirement at all and there-

fore do no saving.     This establishes the general framework of analysis and pro-

vides a standard of reference for evaluating the effect of more realistic saving

behavior on the optimal level of benefits. The second and third sections then
                                                      —3—



derive these optimal benefit levels for two different definitions of incomplete

myopia. There is a brief concluding section that discusses possible extensions

of this analysis.


1.     Qptimal Social Security with Complete Myopia
               The framework of analysis here follows Samuelson (1958) and uses a
life cycle model with        overlapping generations. Individuals work   in the   first

period of their lives and retire in the second. The population grows at rate n

per period. But unlike Samuelsonts analysis, I assume that physical capital is

a productive resource.         'lb avoid the problem of an endogenous and varying rate

of return, I assume that the marginal product of capital remains constant at p.

               If Lt is the labor force at time t and At is the number of aged

retirees at that time, population growth at rate n implies:


(i.i)                                =       (i+n)   Lt_l
and

(1.2)                                    =
                                              (1+n)A.

Fach worker in period t earns a age of wt. The government imposes a tax at

rate    Gf   and   therefore collects taxes of

(1.3)                                =


Each aged retiree receives benefits of bt, implying that total benefits are


                                     =
                                Bt       btAt.

The pay—as—you—go character of the program implies that benefits and taxes are
eqia1 (Bt = Tt) and therefore that
(1.5)                          btAt =       OtwtLt.

From equation 1.2 it therefore follows that


                                     =            +
(i.6)                                     Ow.(i

Equation 1.6 shows the relation between the social security tax rate and the
level of benefits relative to concurrent earnings.

            I will write the utility function of the representative individual in

separable form as uIJ +       v[1        where the argument of the u function is first

period consumption and the argument of the v function is consumption during

retirement. Since the individual is nropic and does no saving, first period con-

sumption is the net—of—tax wage, (1—O)w, and retirement consumption is the

social security benefit, bt. An additive social welfare function implies that

social welfare at time t is


(1.7)
                          =
                              L   uE(1_O)wI + AtvEbt
                          =   {(i   + n) uI(1_6t)wtl +   v[btl    } Lt_i.



Using 1.6 to replace bt implies:


(i.8)                 Wt =     ((1 + n) u[(1_Ot)vtl +      vIOw(1    +   nfl   } LLt_l•



            The first order condition for a maximum          of   Wt is dWt/det =    0    or



(1.9)       —Ci + n) wt u't + (1 + n) wtv't = 0


or simply


(i.io)              u't   =
                              V't.
                                            ——



It   is thus optimal1 to divide the total income of the working generations between

the young and the old until their n.rginal utilities of consumption are

equalized. This egalitarian optimum reflects the assumption that taxes do not

distort any type of behavior and is reminiscent of the Edgeworth (1897) and

Lerner (1944) conclusions about optimal income taxation and income redistribution.

            Obtaining an explicit value for the optimal level of benefits requires

making an assumption about the nature of the utility functions of workers and

retirees. If we assume that u and v have the same functional form, the optimum

condition of equation 1.10 implies that the arguments of u and v are equal and

therefore that the optimal tax rate, Ot, satisfies


(1.11)                (l_e*) w =     twt(1+n)
or

(1.12)                0t       2+n

Substituting &*.   into    equation 6 shows that the ratio of optimal benefits, b*t,

to concurrent wages is


(1.13)                    *=                 = ______

           Note first that the optimal tax rate and the optimal benefit ratio are

constants that are independent of time. If there is no population growth (n0),

0* =   * = -/2.   In this case, workers give up half of their wages in tax and

retirees receive benefits that are equal to half of the annual wage level. When

the population is growing (n >     0),   there are more workers than retirees. If


   11t is clear from 1.9 and 1.8 that the second order condition is always
satisfied.
                                               ——


each worker gives up in taxes less than half of his wages, the retirees can

still receive benefits that equal more than half of the annual wage level. The

specific fraction is chosen to make the level of benefits equal to the after—tax

wage. The faster the rate of population growth, the lower is the optimal tax

rate and the higher is the corresponding ratio of benefits to wages.

            To provide a numerical illustration of these optimal values, it is

important to recognize that n refers to the growth rate per period and not per

year. Since Lt/L÷_i = 1 +         n,   the value of n is the growth rate per generation.

If the annual population growth rate is 1.14 percent1 and a generation is 30

years, 1 + n =    (1.014)30   =   1.52.    Equation 1.13 then implies that   =   0.60   and

    =   0.40.   A decline in the population growth rate to 0.7 percent a year
                                   30
implies that 1 + n =    (1.007)         = 1.23 and therefore that optimal benefits are

lower (* = 0.55) while the optimal tax rate is higher (e* = 0.145).


2. Optimal Social Security Benefits with Partial Myopia

            In reality, of course, not everyone is completely myopic. The

interesting problem is therefore to characterize the appropriate partial nropia

and to derive the corresponding optimal level of social security benefits. That

optimization involves balancing the advantage of income support for the nropic

against the loss caused by reduced saving.

            Economic irropia has two aspects. The most important is that some or

all individual's have, in Pigou's (1920) words, a "faulty telescopic faculty't

that causes them to give too little weight to the utility of future consumption.

Such faulty vision may also cause them to ignore or underestimate the size of

their future social security benefits, thereby reducing the extent to which



   1This was the average annual growth rate for the three decades beginning in 1950.
                                           -7-


those promised benefits change personal saving.

           One way to model incomplete riropia is to divide the population into

two types, the first of which optimizes according to life cycle principles with

perfect foresight while the second is completely myopic and does no saving. The

optimal level of social security benefits depends on the relative numbers of

life—cyclers and myopes in the population. I will develop this approach in the

next section.

           The second ay to analyze the problem is to assume that all indivi-

duals are alike and are neither perfectly foresighted life—cyclers nor comple-

tely myopic.1 though the individual's "true" utility function is given by

u(c1) + v(c2) where c1 and c2 are consumption during the first and second

periods of his life, he makes his saving decision during the first period of his

life by maximizing u(c1) + A v(c2) where A ' 1        represents the degree of

discounting of future consumption. If A = 1, the individual is a proper life—

cycler with no myopia. If A =     0,   the individual is completely myopic and has no

reason to save.

           Each individual earns a wage of wt during his working years, pays

taxes of     and chooses to save St. His first period consumption is therefore

Ct = (1—O)w —     s.   His saving earns a rate of return p and therefore provides

him with st(1-+-p) in his retirement period. Ib simplify the analysis, I shall

ignore capital income taxes in this section. The individual's consumption

during retirement is thus              =   (1+p) + bt+i where bt+i is the

individual's social security benefit. Myopic individuals may not only give too

little weight to v(c2) but may also underestimate their future social security


   11t would of course be possible to analyze a more general case in which there
is a distribution of degrees of nopia but this would probably provide no addi-
tional analytic insights.
benefits by anticipating future consumption of only Bt(l+p) + a                     with a < 1.

           To summarize, each individual chooses St to maximize u[(l_O)wt—st]

+ A     v [st(1+P) + t+i}. Society chooses 0 to maximize the sum over all

periods of the true utilities uI(l—0) wt_stl + v [s(l+P) + bt+i] where the St

must be chosen by the individuals themselves.

           The individual's first order condition for maximizing lifetime utility

with 0 and       taken as parameters is


(2.1)                          = X(l+p).

The lower the value of A, the lower is the chosen u' relative to v' and there-

fore the higher is the chosen c1 relative to c2.

           To permit an explicit solution for the chosen value of s, I will

assume a logarithniic utility function: u(c1) =         ln    c1 and v(cp) =   in   c2.

Equation 2.1 then implies that the chosen value st* satisfies


                                                        =     A(1-4-p)

Note that this is an extension of the usual result with a log—linear utility

function; with A = 1 and b =       0,   we get the familiar result that St* =        0.5   (1_0)vt

and therefore Cjt =   0.5(1_0)wt.        The rate of return matters only in converting

the future income (bt+i) to its present value. Low values of A and high values of

b both reduce saving while the underestimation of future social security bene-

fits (a low value of a) raises saving.

           As I noted in section 1, the pay—as—you—go nature of social security

 implies that

 Substituting 2.5 into 2.3 and noting that wt+l =                 (1+g)w   and that (l+g)(l+n) = 1+1

yields

          Equation 2.6 describes the saving behavior of all relevant                   generations

except the generation of retirees who receive unrequited benefits when the

social security programs began. Although this group receives per capital bene-

fits of b0 =    0w0(l+n), these were not anticipated at time t =                —l when they made

their savings decisions. Thus

(2.10)                       = (l+r)t { (i+n) ln[i_O+aO(i+y)(i+p)-]

where C is a function of time that is independent of the policy parameter
            It is clear from the form of 2.10 that the value of 6 that maximizes
      for any t > 0 also maximizes Wt for all other values of t > 0. This value
of 0 does not correspond to the full social optimum since it ignores the
transfer of income from the first generaltion of workers (at t                               = a) to the   con-
current   generation of retirees. Nevertheless, unless future utility is

discounted at a very high rate, this initial period effect will be unimportant

relative to the effect in all future periods.



   1This is of course the "true" utility. The paranieters A and c enter because
they influence individual 'behavior 'but not social evaluation.

 To see this, note that the true optimum O            maximizes the discounted sum   of

The second term converges to a finite value if and only if ri > n. This is also

a sufficient condition for the third term to converge.1 Since this term is

independent of 0, it can be ignored in the maximization.

            Using equation 2.6 and 2.8 to write W0 explicitly and evaluating the

infinite sum in equation 2.12 implies that the optimal value 0* maximizes:2

therefore increases more slowly than (l+n)t for n > n as t tends to infinity.

in    the first period (t = 0) while the third and fourth terms correspond to the

utility of workers and retirees in all future years. As the utility discount

rate approaches the rate of population gro'.rth, the relative size of the terms

corresponding to the first period tends to zero.

            I shall begin therefore by ignoring the first period effect and

finding the value of 0 that maximizes the steady—state level of utility. I

must emphasize that this is not equivalent to ignoring the obviously positive

transfer to the initial retirees but ignores the taxes paid by the initial

workers as well. After examining the steady—state solution, I shall return to

the more general problem and derive the optimal 0* corresponding to different

values of the utility discount rate.

            The value of 0 that maximizes the steady—state level of utility is the

solution of the first—order condition1:


                    (l+n)   I   a(l+y)(1+p)_1]       +        (l+a)(l+i)—X(1+p)               =0
(2 l)
                     1—aO(1+y)(1+ p)1                         X(l+ p)(l— e)÷(i+   a) O(1+y)
The   special   case of a = 0 is interesting because it corresponds to the situation

in which individuals do not reduce their saving because of anticipated social

security benefits. Saving is affected only by the reduction in disposable

income caused by the tax at rate 0. With a =             0,   equation 2.l4 implies



(2 15)                 0*   =         (l÷X)(1+y)   — A(1-i-p)(2-i-n)
                                   (l+A)(l+y)(2+n) — A(1+p)(2+n)



   'This condition is equivalent to dwt/dO = 0 where W. is defined by equation
2.10 or equivalent dS'/dO=O with the first two terms of S' ignored. The second
order condition is easily checked and is always satisfied.
                                                  —l-.--


              Note first that with complete myopia ( A               0) this reduces to O =   (2+n),
the value derived in section 1 under the simpler specification of the complete

myopia problem. A reduction in myopia, i.e., an increase in A, necessarily

reduces 6*.      It can be shown that

(2.16)
                  dO*                           —(l+n)(l+i)(l+p)
                  dA                   (i+X)(1+y) — A(1+p)12(2+n)

This confirms that complete myopia sets the upper bound on the optimal tax and

benefit levels.

              With anything less than complete myopia, individuals save and social

security distorts saving. The welfare loss of this distortion is an increasing

function of the marginal product of capital. vbre specifically, it is clear

that an increase in p reduces the numerator and denominator by an equal amount

I A(2+n) per unit of p] and therefore d6*/dp < 0 if A > 0.

              The extent of the welfare loss that is caused by reduced saving

depends on the implicit return that individuals receive from the unfunded social

security program. Since that rate of return is y, an increase in I reduces the

loss caused by decreased saving and therefore raises the optimal value of 6.

Differentiating         with respect to I shows

(2.17)
                        dO*   =         A(1+A)(l+p)(2+n)(1+n)
                        dl              [l+y+A(y—p)] (2+n)

which is clearly positive for A > 0.

              Equation 2.15 shows that there is a wide range of parameter values for

which it is optimal to have no social security program at all. More specifi-

cally, equation 2.15 shows that 0* = 0 when (l+A)(i-i-i) = A(1-s-p)(2+n), i.e., when
                                       —1
A =   (i+i)   [(l+p)(2+n) —   (i+y)1        .   Since      0* > 0 at A = 0 and equation 2.16 shows
                                        -1



that dO*/dA <   0, 0 < 0 for all values of A > (1+1) t(1+p)(2+n)—(l+y)].
If social security taxes and benefits are constrained to be non—negative, &0

for all A> (1—i) [(l+p)(2+n)—(l+y)].

            To evaluate this critical threshold for A, it is important          to
interpret   the values of n, y and p as growth rates per period and not per year.

The model specifies that l+n is the ratio of the labor force in one generation

divided by the labor force in the previous generation. I shall again take a

generation to be 30 years. Since the U.S. labor force grew at an annual rate of
                                                                           30
1.14 percent for the three decades beginning in 1950, l+n = (1.0114)            =    2.97.
Finally, I will use the estimate that the average annual marginal product of

capital in U.S. nonfinancial corporations    during these years 'was   11.14 percent
                                                                                30
(Feldstein,   Poterba and Dicks—Mireaux, 1981) and ite 1+p =       (1.1114)          =   25.5.
Substituting these values implies that the critical value    of A is 0.0149. A

positive   social security program is justified under these conditions only if
individuals   give a weight of less than five percent to future utility.
            Although these numbers are only illustrative, they do indicate that a
social security pension may 'be inappropriate even if economic myopia is univer-
sal   arid very substantial. This conclusion is not very sensitive to variations

in   the three parameters (p, y, and ri) that determine the critical value of A.
For example, reducing the annual marginal product of    capital    from 11.14 percent
to 8.0 percent or increasing the growth of   income from 3.7     percent   to 7.0 per-

cent still implies that 0*   0 for any A     0.114.

            In these calculations, I have assumed that cx   0,    i.e., that indivi-
duals   ignore future social security benefits when making their savings decision.

Social security therefore affected savings only by reducing the disposable
 income of workers. When the analysis is extended to recognize that vorker

 reduce      their saving in anticipation of future benefits, the optimal level of

 social security benefits is even lower.

                Consider, for example, an economy in which the annual marginal product

 of capital is 8.0 percent, population grows at l.4 percent a year, and real

 income rises at 2.3 percent a year. If A = 0.05 and a = 0, the optimal social

 security tax rate is 0* =              0.28.    If individuals take 10 percent of their future

social security benefits into account (cx =                 0.10),   the optimal tax rate falls

slightly to 0* =            0.26.    If individuals take half of their benefits into account

(cx    =   0.50),   0* =    0.20.    Further increases in a cause 8* to decline rapidly. At
 a =   0.67,    0* =   0.

               As I noted earlier, the value of O that maximizes steady state

welfare ignores the effect of taxing the first generation of workers and trans-

ferring these revenues to the first generation of beneficiaries. The importance

of this omission depends on the discount rate, Ti, used to discount future utility.

We have implicitly been examining the limiting case of n n in which the

first period is irrelevant and the steady state welfare is the criterion. As

Ti   increases,     more weight is given to the initial period relative to the steady

state. It is interesting therefore to consider the other extreme in which

n =        and only the initial period is important. With n =                    and a = 0, the

first—order condition for a maximum of S' in equation 2.13 is


2.18'/                       —      (l+n)       +          (1-i-A)(l+y)      -
                                                                             —
                                    (i—o)                                          0
                                                       A(l+p)+(1+A)(1+y) 8


Using      the values of      n,    y and p that    correspond to the last three decades of       U.S.

experience      implies that 0*             0 if and   only if   A   0.083. Thus   taking the first
                                       —




year   effects into account raises the critical value of A from 0.0149 to 0.083 but

leaves unchanged the conclusion that a positive social security program is

justified only if the universal nropia is extreme. For high 'but finite rates of

utility discount, the critical value of A lies between these extremes. For

example, an annual rate of utility discount of 5    percent implies that the criti—
cal value of A is o.o66 while a 10 percent discount rate makes the critical

value o.oi8.

            Even when these high utility discount rates imply O >   0,   the optimal

value of       remains low. For example, with an annual utility discount rate of

10 percent, the optimal value of 0 is only O.l4 implying an optimal benefit—wage

ratio of 0.21.


3.   Optimal Benefits with a Heterogeneous Population

           The conclusion of the previous section, that even with universal and

extreme rrropia it may be optimal to have no social security pension, rests on

the assumption that no one is completely rrropic.   If some individuals are

completely nopic, some provision must be made to support them in their old age.

This might take the form of a means tested program or of private charity, as it

did before the introduction of the universal social security program. In this

section, however, I will assume that the only such support is the universal

social security program. I will divide the population into a group who are

completely myopic and a group who are not myopic at all and will examine how the

optimal   level of social security 'benefits varies with the fractions of the popu—
lation who are "myopes" and "life—cyclers".
           As in the analysis of the previous section, the initial period differs
from all subsequent periods 'because the initial retirees receive an unpredic—
                                                   -17-



table windfall so that those who are not myopic have more private retirement

wealth than life—cyclers will in subsequent generations. All subsequent periods

are identical and the value of e that maximizes total utility in any one period

will maximize it in all periods. Lb simplify the analysis of this section, I

will focus on this steady state level of utility.

             As in the previous section, workers earn wt and pay a social security

tax               The myopes consume their entire disposable income, (1-e)w. The

life—cyclers set their saving optimally and therefore, using equation 2.3 with
   =    = 1, 5 = JI2[(l.0)wt         —
                                         bt+i/(1+p)1.      Lifecyclers therefore consume

l[(l_O)wt + bt+i/(l+p)J during their working period. In retirement, the rrropes

consumption is equal to their social security benefits (bt+i) while the life—

cyclers consume st(l+P) + bt+i =            l/2E(l_0)wt(1+P)      + bt+i].

             The rate of growth of the labor force implies that there are always

1 + n workers for every retiree. I shall denote the fraction of myopes by U and

normalize the social welfare equation by dividing all terms by the number of

retirees in that generation. For this model, total welfare in period t can

therefore be written:


(3.1)      Wt = (l-+-n)p ln[(l_O)w1 + (l+n)(l—U) in 0.5[(1_e)w +

                      + ii in bt + (1—U) lnO.5[(l_8)wt (') + bt].


Since Vt      (+g)V_1 and bt =           (1÷n)t,      equation 3.1 is equivalent to


(3.2) w =        (1-4-n)U in [1—Q)w] + (1+n)(l—U)irj 0.5 [(l—O)wt +

              + p in (i+n) Owt + (1—ii)ln 0.5 [(1_O)w (g)(1+p) + (1+n) t]

Since Vt is a factor of every term, it can be eliminated without altering the

value   of 0 that    maximizes Vt. Similarly the 0.5 factors can be eliminated and
                                                    -1 -

the last term can be rewritten (1—i)ln(1+n) + (1—p)ln [(i—e)(i+p)(i+y' + o].
            With   these algebraic simplifications, the problem can be defined as
selecting   0 to riiaxinüze

 (3.3)      W' =   (l+n)ln(1—6)         +   (l+n)(1—p)ln1-0)    +

                  + ln6 +    (1—u)ln [(i—o)(i+p)(i+yr1 +                 0]

The first two terms correspond to the utility of the two groups of workers while

the second two terms correspond to the utility of the concurrent retirees. It

is clear from the third term (the utility of the myopic retirees) that 0 = 0 can

never be optimal.

            The   first—order       condition for a maximum       of          W' with respect to 0 is:


                    (1+n)                (l+n) (i—a) [(i+y)(i+p) —i]
(3.14)    0=—                       +                                                  +
                     1—0                       1—0 +   0(1+y)(i+p)                         6




                                +
                                            ('—n) [l—(l+p)(l+y)      I

                                            e + (l—6)(l+p)(i+y)

            Note first that complete myopia for the entire population means U

and therefore implies


                               —(÷I)         + —i— = 0

or

(14.6)
                                    *= 1     2+n


This is the same optimum condition derived for complete myopia in sections 1 and

2.   It again represents the upper bound on the possible values of 0*. With the

1.14 percent annual population growth rate of the U.S. since 1950, this upper

bound is 0* = 0.140.        At the opposite extreme, if everyone is a lifecyler, ii                  =0
 and condition 3.1k cannot be satisfied for any 0 ' 0; the optimum O is negative

 and the feasible optimum is to have no social security program.

               Some tedious but straightforward manipulation permits equation 3.14 to

 be    rewritten as:

 (3.)                   e2 (2+n)(l—x)-0f(2+n)(l—x)(l—p) + p(3+n—x)] +        p =


where    x=(l+y)(1+p). This quadratic equation shows that that optimal social
 security tax rate varies from 0 = 0 to 0* = (2+nY as the frequency of myopia
varies    from ii     = 0 to p = 1.    For the values of a, y and p corresponding to the

U.S. experience of the past three decades, the optimal value of 0 varies almost

linearly with p with 0* = 0.11 at p =          0.25,    0* =   0.21 at p = 0.50 and 0* = 0.31
at p =    0.75.       The corresponding optimal benefit—wage ratiOs are            =   0.17 at
 p =   0.25,   t3 =   0.32   at p =   0.50 and =   0.147 at p =   0.75.   Thus more than half

of the population must be completely myopic for the optimal benefit—wage ratio

to be as high as one—third and more than three—fourths must be completely myopic

for the optimal benefit—wage ratio to be as high as one—half.

               A realistic description of the population presumably involves a

distribution of degrees of myopia. The analysis of this section and of the pre-

vious one suggests that even if (say) one—fourth of the population were completely

myopic while three—fourths were so myopic that they gave future utility

only one—fourth the weight of the current utility, the optimal ratio of social

security benefits to wages would be very low, probably less than 0.20.


14.    Conclusion

               Although the specific numerical results reflect the simplified model

and the logarithmic utility structure, the broad qualitative results are likely
                                          —20—




to be valid more generally. The analysis has shown that even if every indivi-

dual is substantially myopic (and would therefore save less for his retirement

than perfect foresight utility maximization would imply) ,       it   may be optimal to

have either no social security retirement program or a very low ratio of

benefits to earnings. If some fraction of the population is completely myopic

and would in the absence of a social security pension do no retirement saving,

it cannot be optimal to have no social security program (unless some other

retirement income is provided for nonsavers.) Nevertheless, the optimal level

of    benefits nay   be quite low unless a large fraction of the population is

completely    myopic.
             It   would, of course, be desirable to examine the sensitivity of these

results to a richer class of models. Such extensions might include          a tax on
capital income (implying a gap between the marginal product of capital and the
rate of return that influences individual savings decisions)1 and a wider class
of    individual utility functions. The "mixed case" of a fraction of the popula—

tion that is completely nryopic while the rest are partly nryopic might also be

usefully analyzed. The assumption of predetermined retirement behavior should

be modified to recognize that social security benefits influence retirement

behavior and that planned retirement alters the individual's rate of saving.

            The analyses of both models show how the optimal size of the social

security program is related to the steady—state rates of growth of population

and productivity and to the marginal product of capital. Current policy

discussions about the adjustment of social security to the productivity slowdown

and   the changing demographic structure of      the population suggest that these

models might provide a useful framework for studying how the level of social

security benefits should be changed in response to tenrporary changes in the

rates of growth of population and productivity.

            Finally, it would be good to relax the assumption that benefits are to

be provided uniformly and without reference to accumulated assets. The

appropriate role for means—tested benefits for retirees could be derived by

including such transfers as an additional parametric option in an extended ver-

sion of the present models.
