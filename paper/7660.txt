                                               ABSTRACT

        In this paper, we compare the characteristics of real world financial contracts to their counterparts
in financial contracting theory. We do so by conducting a detailed study of actual contracts between
venture capitalists (VCs) and entrepreneurs. We consider VCs to be the real world entities who most
closely approximate the investors of theory. (1) The distinguishing characteristic of VC financings is that
they allow VCs to separately allocate cash flow rights, voting rights, board rights, liquidation rights, and
other control rights. We explicitly measure and report the allocation of these rights. (2) While convertible
securities are used most frequently, VCs also implement a similar allocation of rights using combinations
of multiple classes of common stock and straight preferred stock. (3) Cash flow rights, voting rights,
control rights, and future financings are frequently contingent on observable measures of financial and non-
financial performance. (4) If the company performs poorly, the VCs obtain full control. As company
performance improves, the entrepreneur retains / obtains more control rights. If the company performs
very well, the VCs retain their cash flow rights, but relinquish most of their control and liquidation rights.
The entrepreneur’s cashflow rights also increase with firm performance. (5) It is common for VCs to
include non-compete and vesting provisions aimed at mitigating the potential hold-up problem between the
entrepreneur and the investor. We interpret our results in relation to existing financial contracting theories.
The contracts we observe are most consistent with the theoretical work of Aghion and Bolton (1992) and
Dewatripont and Tirole (1994). They also are consistent with screening theories.

1.        Introduction.

          There is a large academic literature in financial contracting theory. The papers in this

literature often begin with a situation in which an investor negotiates with an entrepreneur over

the financing of a project or company. These theoretical papers typically make a number of

different assumptions concerning the nature of these negotiations. These assumptions concern

observability of actions, contractibility of actions, the ability to renegotiate, and the nature of

information and uncertainty. Given the assumptions and the models, the papers then generate

predictions. For example, a key assumption in Hart and Moore (1998) is that firm output is

observable by outsiders, but not verifiable. As a result, it is not possible to write contracts on

output.

          Despite the large volume of theory, relatively little empirical work exists that compares

the characteristics of real world financial contracts to their counterparts in financial contracting

theory.      In this paper, we attempt to inform theory by conducting a detailed study of actual

contracts between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. Venture capitalists (VCs) are real world

entities who most closely approximate the investors of theory. VCs have strong incentives to

maximize value, but, at the same time, receive few or no private benefits of control. In

describing these contracts, we consider the appropriateness of different assumptions and

predictions in financial contracting theory.

          In this paper, we study detailed information on 200 venture capital investments in 118

portfolio companies by fourteen venture capital firms.1 For each portfolio company investment,

the VC firm provided the contractual agreements governing each financing round in which the




1
    We use the terms venture capital firm and venture capital partnership interchangeably.



                                                           2
firm participated. The VC firm also provided (if available) the company’s business plan, internal

analyses evaluating the investment, and information on subsequent performance.

       We describe the contracts between the portfolio companies / entrepreneurs and the VCs

in great detail. We then consider how well these contracts are described by the assumptions and

predictions embodied in five different types of financial contracting theories. The theories

interpret financial contracts as the solution to conflicts of interest or agency problems between

investors and the entrepreneur.2 A conflict exists because the entrepreneur must transfer a

portion of the profits generated by the project back to external investors in return for their

financing. The entrepreneur will not take the optimal action because he does not get all the

monetary benefits from taking that action, while alternative actions give other benefits to the

entrepreneur. The different financial contracting theories assume different types of conflicts of

interest in choice of actions. These include: (1) not exerting the optimal amount of costly effort;

(2) taking actions that yield private benefits rather than monetary benefits; (3) spending

resources on perks or stealing; (4) holding up investors by threatening to leave the project.

       The traditional principal-agency approach, pioneered by Holmstrom (1979), assumes that

the agent’s effort is unobservable to the principal. The optimal incentive contract ensures that

the agent puts in enough effort by making the agent’s compensation dependent on the outcome

of the signals. In the context of a financing problem, the signal is typically output or profits.

Harris and Raviv (1979) show that with a risk-neutral principal and agent, and no wealth

constraints, the optimal financing contract is to give a fixed payment to the investor and make

the manager the residual claimant. These theories stress the importance of providing monetary

incentives or cash flow rights to the entrepreneur. Ownership is relevant only as it affects pure

cash-flow rights.




                                                  3
           The control theories change the assumptions in the traditional principal-agent models by

assuming that actions are indeed observable, but not verifiable. Output and monetary benefits

are contractible. As a result, control rights that determine who chooses which action to take will

be important. The control theories build on the incomplete contracting literature, pioneered by

Grossman and Hart (1986). Two important papers that take this approach to security design are

Aghion and Bolton (1992) and Dewatripont and Tirole (1994).

           In Aghion and Bolton (1992), the project yields both monetary benefits, i.e. profits, that

are verifiable and can be transferred to outside investors, and private benefits or actions that are

non-verifiable and only go to the entrepreneur. The magnitude of these benefits, in turn, depends

on what (non-verifiable) action that is taken with respect to the project. This introduces a

conflict of interest. Aghion and Bolton show that it is optimal to give the investor control in the

worst states of the world where profits are likely to be low. Aghion and Bolton (1992) point out

that a debt contract that transfers control to investors in default states has this feature.

           Dewatripont and Tirole (1994) build on Aghion and Bolton (1992) by focusing on the

optimal correlation between control rights and cash flow rights. They show that the party in

control should look more and more like a debtholder (because debtholders prefer less risk) when

things get worse, while more control should be transferred to the entrepreneur or to an

equityholder (because equityholders prefer more risk) as performance improves.

           A different set of control theories that we call “stealing theories” make the assumption

that which cash flows are either not observable or not verifiable. These papers include Hart and

Moore (1998), Gale and Hellwig (1982), Bolton and Scharfstein (1990), and Fluck (1998). The

optimal financial claim in these models is a debt-like claim in which (1) the entrepreneur

promises a fixed payment to the investor; and (2) the investor takes control of the project and

2
    Extensive theoretical overviews can be found in Allen and Winton (1995) and in Harris and Raviv (1992).

                                                          4
liquidates the assets if the payment is not made. Liquidation rights, therefore, are crucial in these

models.

       A fourth set of theories, beginning with Hart and Moore (1994), relax the stealing

assumption and develop a model that has an intuition similar to those of the stealing theories.

Hart and Moore (1994) focus on the inalienability of human capital. They assume that (1) the

firm’s value with the entrepreneur exceeds its liquidation value and (2) the entrepreneur /

manager cannot commit not to leave firm. Because the firm is worth less without him, the

entrepreneur can threaten to leave the firm unless any promised payment is negotiated down

closer to the liquidation value. The optimal contract calls for a debt security, where control is

transferred to the investor if the promised payment is not fulfilled, in which case the firm is

liquidated. The size of the promised debt payment is limited by the liquidation value of the assets

and by the relative bargaining power of the investor.

       Whereas the models described above analyze general financial contracts, a number of

other papers focus specifically on venture capital contracts. These include Admati and Pfliederer

(1994), Berglof (1994), Cornelli and Yosha (1998), Garmaise (1998), Hellman (1998), and

Repullo and Suarez (1999). Most of these theories try to explain the use of convertible securities

in venture capital financings (based on the results in Sahlman (1990)).

       The models described above are largely agency / moral hazard models. Lazear (1986)

shows that in a traditional principal-agent framework, contracts also can be used as a screening

device if the ability of the entrepreneur / manager is uncertain. By setting the agent’s

compensation as increasing function of performance, the venture capitalist discourages less able

agents from accepting the contract.




                                                  5
       We obtain the following findings. First, a key feature of VC financings is that they allow

VCs to separately allocate cash flow rights, voting rights, board rights, liquidation rights, and

other control rights. We explicitly measure and report the allocation of these rights. We

believe our measurements are more comprehensive and substantially more detailed than those in

any previous work.

       Second, while convertible securities are used most frequently, VCs also implement the

same set of rights using combinations of multiple classes of common stock and straight preferred

stock. We also note that VCs use a variant of convertible preferred called participating preferred

in roughly 40% of the financings. Participating preferred, under most circumstances, behaves

more like a position of straight preferred stock and common stock than a position of convertible

preferred.

       Third, cash flow rights, voting rights, control rights, and future financings are frequently

contingent on observable measures of financial and non-financial performance. These state

contingencies are more common in first VC financings and early stage financings.

       Fourth, these rights are allocated such that if the company performs poorly, the VCs

obtain full control. As company performance improves, the entrepreneur retains / obtains more

control rights. If the company performs very well, the VCs retain their cash flow rights, but

relinquish most of their control and liquidation rights.

       Fifth, we find that it is common for VCs to include non-compete and vesting provisions

aimed at mitigating the potential hold-up problem between the entrepreneur and the investor.

Vesting provisions are more common in early stage financings where it is more likely that the

hold-up problem is more severe.




                                                  6
       Finally, we find that cash flow incentives, control rights, and contingencies implemented

in these contracts are used more as complements than as substitutes.

       Our results have the following implications:

       First, cash flow rights matter in a way that is consistent with the principal-agent models.

       Second, control rights matter, strongly suggesting that contracts are incomplete.

       Third, cash flow rights and control rights can be separated and made contingent on

observable and verifiable measures of performance. This is most supportive of theories that

predict shifts of control to investors in bad states – Aghion and Bolton (1992) and Dewatripont

and Tirole (1994).

       Finally, we think our results suggest fruitful avenues for future theoretical research. In

particular, our results indicate that the allocations of cash flow, control and liquidation rights

shift gradually with performance and are interrelated. In many theoretical models, these rights

are all-or-nothing and are not interrelated.

       In comparing financial contracting theories to real world contracts, we believe this paper

breaks new ground. In describing venture capital contracts, our paper extends previous work by

Sahlman (1990), Gompers (1998), and Black and Gilson (1998).

       Sahlman (1990) describes the basic deal structures used in venture capital investments

and the economic rationales for them. His is the first detailed discussion of these issues that we

are aware of. We extend Sahlman (1990) in several ways. First, Sahlman bases his analysis on

forty stock-purchase agreements from a broad range of VCs. His analysis, however, is almost

entirely qualitative. He does not present any systematic description and analysis of those

agreements. Second, Sahlman focuses on the typical set of terms and does not report or analyze

the broad range of terms and contingencies. This is particularly important for considering the




                                                   7
appropriateness of the assumptions and predictions of the theories that distinguish between cash

flow rights, control rights, and liquidation rights.3

         The data and approach in this paper are perhaps most closely related to those in Gompers

(1998). His paper is similar to ours in that he describes aspects of venture capital contracts. He

also concludes that the covenants in the contracts allocate control rights independently of cash

flow rights. Our paper differs, however, in a number of respects. First, Gompers’had access to

only a subset of the contracts and information that we have analyzed. He does not analyze data

on ownership (cash flow rights), voting rights, liquidation rights, or descriptions of the

underlying businesses (from the business plans). Second, Gompers selected his sample to

consist entirely of investments in convertible preferred stock, therefore, eliminating some of the

important variation that we find.

         Black and Gilson (1998) consider explanations for the greater vitality of the venture

capital market in stock market- versus bank-centered capital markets. In so doing, they describe

different aspects of venture capital contracts. They make the argument, which we confirm as

important, that automatic conversion provisions provide important non-monetary incentives to

entrepreneurs because they transfer control from the VC to the entrepreneur if the entrepreneur

performs well. Like Sahlman (1990), however, they do not present any systematic evidence on

the contracts themselves.

         The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes our sample. Section 3 describes the

venture capital contracts. Section 4 describes the assumptions and predictions of a number of

prominent financial contracting theories and discusses our results in relation to them. Section 5

   Because much of the new financial contracting theory had yet to be written, it is not surprising that Sahlman
(1990) did not address these issues.

among theories. Section 6 summarizes and discusses our results.



2.     Sample

       We analyze 200 VC investments in 118 portfolio companies by fourteen venture capital

partnerships.



       2.1      Description

       To obtain this sample, we asked each VC to provide detailed information on as many of

their portfolio company investments as they were willing to provide. For each of these

companies, we asked the VC to provide the term sheet as well as the stock purchase and security

purchase agreements for each financing round in which they participated. These documents

typically include the financing terms, the firm’s equity ownership – investors, founders,

management, etc. – and any contingencies to future financing. We also asked the VC to provide

(if available) the portfolio company’s business plan at the time of the financing, the VC’s

internal analysis of the investment, and the subsequent portfolio company financial performance.

Finally, we also requested that the VC provide the private placement memoranda / offering

documents for the funds that they have managed over the sample period.

       Table 1 presents summary information for our sample. As mentioned above, panel A

indicates that we have 200 investments in 118 portfolio companies by fourteen VC firms.

Seventy-three of these investments are pre-revenue (which we will refer to as early stage)

rounds. I.e., the firms receiving financing either did not have revenues or were not yet operating.

The remaining investments are later stage rounds in which the firms had revenues and were




                                                 9
already operating. We have contractual documents for all 200 investments; some internal VC

description of the investment for ninety-three investments; and business plans for ninety-three

investments. As a result, we do not have complete information for all 200 investments. The

sample sizes in our results will vary according to the availability of the relevant information.

         Panel B shows that 159 of the financing rounds were completed between 1996 and 1999.

We view the young age of the sample as positive for two reasons. First, our findings will reflect

current practice in venture capital financing. Second, it is unlikely that the VCs selected many of

these the companies based on the final outcome because the final outcome of most of the

investments was unresolved when the VCs provided the companies to us.

         Panel C shows that the portfolio companies were provided by fourteen venture capital

firms with no more than twenty-two companies from any one VC.

         Panel D indicates the amounts of the sample financings. The VCs committed a median of

$4.8 million in equity in each financing round. (This amount is the total for all VCs investing in

the round.) The VCs actually disbursed a median $3.8 million at the time the round closed.

         Panel E presents the geographical distribution of the portfolio companies in our sample.

The distribution is fairly uniform across California (29%), the Midwest (20%), the Northeast

(26%), and elsewhere. Relative to the venture capital industry as a whole, this represents a slight

undersampling of California firms and an oversampling of Midwest firms. According to Venture

Economics4, 41% of overall VC investments were in California firms and only 14% in Midwest

firms.

         Panel F presents the industry distribution of the portfolio companies in our sample.

Consistent with the venture capital industry, the greatest percentage of companies, 36%, are in

   Venture Economics maintains an extensive database on venture capital investments in portfolio companies. These
figures are for the period between 1996 and 1999.


                                                       10
the information technology and software industries. An additional 13% are in

telecommunications. Both of these industries include a number of internet related investments.

This concentration is roughly consistent with the industry distributions reported in Venture

Economics.

       Before we present our results, it is worth pointing out that while we have a great deal of

data, we do not have complete data on every financing round. As a result, the number of

observations will vary from analysis to analysis.



       2.2     Sample selection issues

       In this section, we discuss potential selection issues concerning our sample. Our sample

of portfolio companies and financings is not a random sample in that we obtained the data from

fourteen venture capital firms with whom we have a relationship.

       We do not believe that this selection is of much concern to our results because we are not

attempting to measure performance. Rather, we are attempting to characterize what contracts

look like in general and, perhaps more importantly, what contracts are possible.

       It is worth emphasizing that the contracts represent financings by more than the fourteen

VC firms that provided data. The 118 companies in our current sample received VC financing

from over 90 additional VC firms either in the financing round in our sample or in other

financing rounds. A total of over 100 different VC firms, therefore, invested under the terms of

the contracts in our sample. This suggests that the financings in our sample are likely to be

representative of VC contracts in general.

       The more likely bias in our sample is that we have selected VC firms that are better than

average and that the contracts in our sample may be above average in some sense. If this is so,




                                                11
we believe this strengthens our results because we are more likely to have identified

sophisticated, value maximizing principals.



3.     Results

       In this section, we describe the contracts between the portfolio companies / entrepreneurs

and the VCs in great detail. We first describe the securities issued. We then describe how these

contracts allocate cash-flow rights, voting rights, board rights, and liquidation rights. Last, we

consider in more detail the contingencies involved in allocating those rights.

       In the analysis, we distinguish between early stage financings and later stage financings.

We consider a financing to be early stage if the company is pre-revenue – does not have any

revenue – at the time of the financing. Later stage or post-revenue rounds are financing rounds

that are completed when the company has revenue. This distinction is an interesting one because

uncertainty about viability, inalienability, and verifiability of the company should be greater in

early stage than in later stage rounds. This will be important in distinguishing among financial

contracting theories. In our sample, 77 of the 194 rounds we can classify are pre-revenue.

       We also distinguish whether a round is the first one in which the company utilizes VC

funding. This distinction is an interesting one because asymmetric information between the VC

and the founders should be greater in the first VC round than in subsequent rounds. Again, this

will be important in distinguishing among financial contracting theories. In our sample, 88 of

the 200 rounds represent the first round in which a venture capitalist invested.




                                                 12
          3.1      Securities

          Panel G of table 1 reports the types of securities used in the 200 financing rounds.

Consistent with Sahlman (1990) and Gompers (1998), convertible preferred stock is the most

commonly used security, appearing in 189 of 200 financing rounds. Panel G also indicates,

however, that VC financings (1) do not always use convertible preferred stock; and (2)

frequently include securities in addition to convertible preferred stock. Seven of the 200

financing rounds do not use any form of convertible security. Instead, they use multiple classes

of common stock or a combination of straight preferred and common stock.

          Panel G also reports that in 72 of the financings, the VCs use a variant of convertible

preferred called participating preferred. Upon the liquidation or exit of a participating

convertible preferred, investors receive both the principal amount of the preferred – as they

would in an investment of straight preferred – and they receive common stock. As a result,

participating convertible preferred is better categorized as a position of straight preferred stock

and common stock. than as a position of convertible preferred.5 In some instances, the

participating preferred does not receive a return of principal if the company return is sufficiently

high.

          While the VC financings utilize different types of securities, the financings are similar in

that they allow for different allocations of cash flow, voting, board, and liquidation rights. For

example, in the financings that use multiple classes of common stock, the VCs receive a different

class of common stock than the founders who receive two or more classes of common stock.

The VC class of common stock has voting, board, and liquidation rights that are different from

those of the founders’classes of common stock. The cash flow rights of the classes of common


5
    Gompers (1998) describes participation provisions and refers to them as superpriority provisions.



                                                          13
stock also differ in that the founders’stock classes vest under different conditions than the VC

class (which vests immediately). Hence our focus is on the allocation of different rights rather

than on the use of a particular security.



       3.2      Cash flow rights

       Table 2 presents our results on cash flow rights. By cash flow rights, we mean the

fraction of a portfolio company’s equity value that different investors and management have a

claim to. Measuring cash flow rights is not trivial, however, because many of the cash flow

rights accorded to founders and management are contingent either on subsequent performance

(through performance vesting) or on remaining with the company (through time vesting).

       Table 2, therefore, present three measures of cash flow rights. The first – minimum VC

ownership – measures cash flow rights under the assumption that management meets all

performance and time vesting milestones or contingencies. The second – maximum founders

and employees vesting – measures cash flow rights under the assumption that all non-

performance / time-vesting stock and options vest. The third – maximum VC ownership –

measures cash flow rights if management does not meet any performance or time vesting

milestones. Under each of the three measures, VC%, founders% and other% are, respectively,

the percentage of cash flow rights owned by the venture capitalists, the founders, and others.

Founders include the founding management team. Others include employees and previous non-

VC investors.

       The ownership numbers are imperfect because we do not always have complete

information on the vesting terms for issued options. When we do not have such information, we




                                                14
assume that the issued options are vested. This means that our results surely understate the true

extent of state contingent cash flow rights.

       Panel A indicates that the VC controls roughly half the cash flow rights on average;

founders roughly 30%; and others, roughly 20%. These suggest that substantial equity

ownership on the part of founders / managers is desirable. On the other hand, it also indicates

that founders / managers give up a large fraction of ownership.

       Table 2 also indicates that there are meaningful state-contingencies built into the cash

flow rights. The VC stake is a median of 3.5% lower (average of 8.1%) lower under full vesting

and good performance compared to the minimum vesting, bad performance state. For early-

stage companies, the average and median are 11.9% and 6.1%, respectively. The state-

contingency (i.e. the use of performance benchmarks and vesting) is significantly higher (at the

1% level) in earlier stage, pre-revenue financings compared to later stage, post-revenue ones.

State-contingencies are also greater in first VC rounds compared to subsequent ones.



       3.3     Voting rights

       Table 3 reports post-round voting rights. Voting rights measure the percentage of votes

that investors and management have to effect corporate decisions. Most decisions are based on

majority rule. As such, voting rights provide one measure of control rights. Board rights,

described in the next section, provide another.

       In table 3, minimum (maximum) VC votes represents the minimum (maximum) votes the

venture capitalists control based on subsequent management performance and stock vesting

milestones or contingencies. % VC, % Founder, and % Neither control are, respectively, the

percentage of instances in which voting control is held by the venture capitalists, the founders, or




                                                  15
neither. Switch in control indicates the percentage of instances in which voting control can

switch based on subsequent performance.

       Table 3 indicates that VCs have a voting majority in 56% of all financings in the

minimum contingency case. Panel B shows that VCs control a majority of votes in 66% of the

early stage financings (in the minimum contingency case) versus 49% for later stage financings.

Panel C indicates that VCs control a majority of the votes in 44% of first VC rounds and 65% of

subsequent VC rounds. In the maximum VC vote contingency cases, VCs control a voting

majority in 71% of the financings with greater percentages in the early stage rounds.

       Importantly, our results indicate that state-contingent control rights (i.e. not only in case

of default on a debt payment) exist. In 17.5% of the financings, we see voting control switching

depending on state-contingencies. This state-contingency result as well as those that follow are

important in light of several of the financial contracting theories we describe in section 4. State-

contingent voting control is more likely in early stage rounds and first VC rounds.



       3.4     Board rights

       Board rights and board seats also have an effect on the rights to control corporate

decisions. While they tend to be related to voting rights, they need not be identical. We

distinguish between normal board rights that reflect the board rights or composition at the

completion of the financing from adverse state board rights that reflect board rights or

composition if the portfolio company performs poorly or reaches an adverse state.

       We distinguish between three kinds of board members – VCs, founders, and outsiders.

VC seats are board seats that are reserved for or controlled by venture capitalists. Founder seats

are board seats that are reserved for or controlled by the founders / entrepreneurs. Outsider seats




                                                 16
are board seats that are to be filled by individuals mutually agreed upon by the VCs and the

founders / entrepreneurs.

           Table 4 reports the board results. The boards have an average of 6.1 members and a

median of 6 members. These boards are appreciably smaller than those of public companies.6

Overall, the VC has the majority of the board seats in 26% of the cases, the founders in 12% of

the cases, and neither in 62% of the cases. Interestingly, the VCs are less likely to have board

control than they are to have voting control. VC board control is less common for early-stage

financings compared to later stage. State-contingent board provisions (i.e. the VC gets full

control of the board in the bad state) are present in 15% of the cases. This provides another

important example of state-contingent control rights.

           VC board control does not tend to differ much across early versus later stage rounds. VC

board control does tend to increase, however, with subsequent VC rounds. This is not surprising

given that new VCs often invest in each round and request a board seat as a condition of the

investment.



           3.5     Liquidation rights

           Much of the theoretical security design literature stresses the importance of liquidation

rights. In these models, an investor’s ability to liquidate, or threaten to liquidate, the firm’s

assets if the firm defaults is the main way for an investor to ensure repayment. In this subsection

and in table 5, we describe the liquidation rights in VC financings.




6
    For example, see Yermack (1998) or Gertner and Kaplan (1996).



                                                        17
       First, it is clear that VCs have claims that in liquidation are senior to the common stock

claims of the founders. This is true in all but one of the sample financings. In that financing, the

VC firm bought common stock.

       Second, the claims of the VCs in liquidation are typically at least as large as the original

investments. Panel A of table 5 indicates that this is true in 98% of the financings.

       Even though most of the financings give liquidation claims to the venture capitalists,

there are some cross-sectional differences in how strong these are for different deals. One

common way of making the liquidation rights stronger is by giving the investor cumulative

preferred dividends. Even though these are dividends, and strictly speaking do not have to be

paid out, they will accumulate and be added to the liquidation claim. Cumulative preferred

dividends are present in 46% of our financings.

       Optional redemption and put provisions also are commonly used to strengthen the

liquidation rights of the venture capitalist's investment. These provisions give the venture

capitalist the right after some period time to demand that the firm redeems the venture capitalists

claim, typically at liquidation value (or occasionally, at the maximum of the liquidation value

and "fair market value"). This is very similar to the right to repayment of principal at the

maturity of a debt claim. Without this provision, the liquidation right loses much of its bite

because there are no other contracted payments to the venture capitalist that the firm could

default on. Panel C indicates that optional redemption or put provisions are present in 84% of

our financings. The maturity of these provisions is typically five years.




                                                  18
       3.6     Contingencies

       As mentioned earlier, different theories make different assumptions concerning what it is

and is not possible to write contracts on. For example, it is common among some financial

contracting theorists – e.g., Hart and Moore (1998) – to assume that the entrepreneur and outside

investors can observe firm output, but they cannot write contracts on that output because output

cannot be verified in court.

       In this section, we report the extent to which contracts between venture capitalists and

entrepreneurs are written contingent on subsequent output, performance, or actions. We also

detail the types of output that such contracts are written on.

       Table 6 reports specific examples of contingencies in the VC financings in our sample.

Panel A shows that 41 of the financing rounds (roughly 20%) include provisions that are

contingent on subsequent financial performance. In one financing round, the VCs contractually

obtain voting control from the entrepreneur if the firm’s EBIT -- earnings before interest and

taxes -- falls below a mutually agreed upon amount. In another financing round, VCs obtain

board control if a firm’s net worth falls below a threshold. Net worth, in this instance, is a

measure of a company’s cumulative cash flow. These examples indicate that VCs are able to

write (and presumably enforce) contracts in which control rights are contingent on subsequent

output quite independently of cash flow rights.

       Panel B shows that 25 of the financing rounds (12.5%) include contingencies based on

subsequent non-financial performance. In one instance, share vesting is contingent on product

functionality or performance. In several others, vesting is contingent on FDA or patent

approvals. The disbursal of committed funding also can be contingent on non-financial




                                                 19
performance. For example, one financing was contingent on successfully completing clinical

tests.

         Panel C reports that 28 of the financing rounds (14%) include contingencies based on

certain actions being taken. For example, in different rounds, the disbursal of committed funding

is contingent on hiring new executives, developing new facilities, and completing a new business

plan. Presumably, these actions are both observable and verifiable.

         Finally, panel D indicates that contingencies based on the sale of securities are included

in almost ten percent of the financings. In particular, ownership and vesting are commonly

linked to a subsequent initial public offering or sale of the company.

         Overall, table 6 generates two strong results. First, investors (VCs) commonly write (and

presumably enforce) contracts in which control rights are contingent on subsequent measures of

financial and non-financial performance or output. Second, there is a great deal of variation in

the contingencies in these contracts. The contingencies appear to be related to the performance

measure that is most important to the investors and the company.

         Table 7 quantifies the qualitative information on contingencies in table 6. Panel A

indicates that contingencies based on subsequent financial or non-financial performance, actions,

or sales of securities are used in 36.5 percent of the financings.

         Table 7 also indicates that 15% of the sample financings themselves are partially

contingent on the attainment of some milestone. In these financings, the VCs provide only a

portion of the total funding commitment at the closing or signing of the financing. Additional

funding is provided contingent on subsequent performance and actions. In two financings, the

VC provided only 5% of its total commitment at closing with the rest being contingent. This was




                                                  20
more common in early stage than in later stage financings and more common in first VC rounds

than in subsequent rounds.



          3.7      Other terms

          VC financings include a number of additional terms and conditions. Bartlett (1995) and

Levin (1998) detail many of these. In this section, we describe several of the terms and

conditions that we believe are relevant to the financial contracting theories.



                   3.7.1 Automatic conversion

          It is common for securities in venture capital financings to include automatic conversion

provisions. Under these provisions, the security held by the venture capitalists – convertible

preferred stock, convertible debt, or a class of common stock – automatically converts into

common stock under certain conditions. These conditions generally, although not exclusively,

relate to an initial public offering (IPO) and require the IPO to exceed a designated common

stock price, dollar amount of proceeds, and / or market capitalization for the company.

          As Black and Gilson (1998) are the first to argue, the effect of these provisions is to

require the venture capitalists to give up the superior control, voting, board, and liquidation

rights associated with their securities if the portfolio company attains a desired level of

performance.7 Upon superior performance, the VCs retain only those rights associated with

their ownership of common stock. If the company does not deliver that performance, the VCs

retain their superior control rights. This provides the entrepreneur an incentive to increase the

value of the firm over and above the monetary incentive.


7
    Gompers (1998) also discusses the automatic conversion provision.



                                                         21
       Panel A of table 8 indicates that an automatic conversion provision was present in almost

94% of the financing rounds. Panel A also shows that the financings in rounds that included an

automatic conversion provision required that the company complete an IPO at an IPO stock price

a median 3.0 times greater than the stock price of the financing round. The ratio is significantly

higher in early stage rounds – 4.0 times – than in later stage rounds – 2.7 times.

       It is worth noting that at the median ratio of 3.0 times, the VCs are not willing to give up

any control unless they triple their money. Over a four-year horizon, this works out to a return of

31% per year.



                3.7.2 Antidilution protection

       Venture capital financings also frequently include antidilution protection which protects

the venture capitalist against future financing rounds at a lower valuation than the valuation of

the current protected round. In the extreme case, known as full ratchet antidilution protection,

the protected security obtains a claim to enough additional common shares to effectively reduce

the price of the protected issue to that of the new issue. In a convertible issue, this is

accomplished by decreasing the conversion price on the protected issue to the same conversion

price or common stock price of the new issue. The other common type of antidilution protection

is the weighted average ratchet. Under a weighted average ratchet, the reduction in the

conversion price (or common stock price) of the protected issue is a function of the number of

shares issued and the conversion price of the new issue.

       Panel B of table 8 indicates that the financings in almost 95% of the rounds receive

antidilution protection. Almost 76% of the financings utilize the weighted average method rather

than the full ratchet method.




                                                  22
               3.7.3 Vesting and non-compete clauses

       The inalienability of human capital theories of Hart and Moore (1994) assume that the

entrepreneur cannot contractually commit to stay with the firm. Even though it is not possible to

write enforceable contracts that force the entrepreneur to stay with a firm, there are contractual

provisions that make it more costly for the entrepreneur to leave. In real-world contracts, two

methods are commonly used to make it costly for the entrepreneur to leave the firm.

       First, the entrepreneur’s shares can vest over time. This means that the company receives

or can buy back any unvested shares for some low value if the entrepreneur leaves. The earlier

the entrepreneur leaves, the more shares are still unvested. Second, the VCs can require the

entrepreneur to sign a non-compete contract with the firm that prohibits him from working for

another firm in the same industry for some period of time in case he leaves. Both of these

provisions improve the bargaining power of the VCs if the entrepreneur tries to hold up the VC.

       Table 8 shows that the VC financings in our sample commonly utilize both founder

vesting and non-compete clauses. Founder vesting is used in almost 42% of financing rounds.

Such vesting is significantly more frequently in early stage financings than in later stage ones

with vesting present in almost 55% of pre-revenue financings, but in only 33% of post-revenue

financings. Non-compete clauses are used in approximately 70% of the portfolio companies.



       3.8     Evolution of Contracts over Time and Rounds

       The analyses in the previous sections assume in some sense that each financing round is

independent. This is, of course, not the case. Accordingly, in table 9, we report cash flow rights,

voting rights, board rights, liquidation rights, and other terms as a function of the financing




                                                 23
round. We distinguish between first round financings in which future financing is contingent on

performance (ex ante staging) and those that are not.

           Table 9 indicates that founders’cash flow, voting, and board rights decline over

financing rounds while VC rights increase.8 The most notable pattern involves voting rights.

Founders relinquish voting control by the second VC round in all but 11.5% of the financing

rounds. Analogously, the VCs obtain explicit voting control in over 60% of the second VC

rounds.

           The increase in VC cash flow and control rights over financing rounds is consistent with

the VC demanding more and more equity and control as compensation for providing additional

funds to the venture. Interestingly, the allocation of cash-flow and voting rights in the ex-ante

staging contracts are very similar to later stage rounds, although the allocations are more

sensitive to performance.



           3.9      Summary

           We make several general observations concerning the descriptive results in this section..

           First, VC financings allow VCs to separately allocate cash flow rights, voting rights,

board rights, liquidation rights, and other control rights.

           Second, while VCs use convertible securities most frequently, they also implement the

same allocation of rights using combinations of multiple classes of common stock and straight

preferred stock. Furthermore, participating convertible preferred is used frequently. This is

significant because participating preferred is the equivalent of a position of preferred stock and

common stock rather than a position of convertible preferred.



8
    We do not report liquidation rights because they remain roughly constant across rounds.


                                                           24
       Third, we find that cash flow rights, voting rights, control rights, and future financings

are frequently contingent on observable measures of financial and non-financial performance.

These state contingent rights are more common in first VC and early stage financings.

       Fourth, rights are allocated such that if the company performs poorly, the VCs obtain full

control. As company performance improves, the entrepreneur retains / obtains more cash flow

rights and control rights. If the company performs very well, the VCs relinquish most of their

control and liquidation rights. This occurs when the VC’s investment automatically converts

into common stock.

       Fifth, we find that it is common for VCs to include non-compete and vesting provisions

aimed at mitigating the potential hold-up problem between the entrepreneur and the investor. The

vesting provisions are more common in early stage financings where it is more likely that the

hold-up problem is more severe.

       Finally, there is a tendency for VCs to use greater state-contingencies in early stage

financings and in first venture capital financings.



4.     Relation of Results to Financial Contracting Theories

In this section, we interpret our results in relation to the financial contracting theories described

in the introduction. We do so by examining the extent to which the contract provisions we have

examined are consistent with the assumptions and predictions of the theories.



       4.1     The "traditional" principal agent problem

       The traditional principal-agent models assume that actions or efforts of the entrepreneur

are unobservable. However, signals – i.e., firm performance – are correlated with those actions




                                                  25
or efforts. These signals can be contracted on. The division of cash-flow rights is designed to

affect the pay-performance sensitivity of the entrepreneur. In general (in the absence of risk-

aversion), the investor will want to maximize this pay-performance sensitivity, which can be

achieved by giving the entrepreneur a substantial part of the firm’s equity. Moreover, it is in the

investor’s interest to make the entrepreneur’s compensation contingent on as many verifiable

signals correlated with effort as possible. Also, the larger the incentive conflict between the

investor and entrepreneur, the higher the pay-performance sensitivity should be.

       Our results are clearly consistent with the theoretical assumptions in that cash flow rights

are contingent on a number of performance-based results, both financial and non-financial. On

the other hand, we do find that some actions or efforts are observable and are contracted on.

       Our results also are consistent with some of the predictions. In all our financings, the

entrepreneur gets a substantial fraction of equity in the firm. Furthermore, the entrepreneur’s

equity stake increases with firm performance. This sensitivity is greater in early stage firms

where observability problems presumably are the largest. Moreover, the contracts often

condition the entrepreneur’s equity compensation on a multitude of signals, both financial and

non-financial.

       It is clear, however, that the traditional principal agent models do not completely explain

the contracts we observe because the principal agent models make no predictions about the

allocation of control rights. In the contracts we study, control rights are important and separate

from cash flow rights.




                                                 26
       4.2     "Control theories": cash-flow verifiable but not actions


       The control theories make assumptions and predictions concerning cash flow rights that

are consistent with those made in traditional principal agent models. Higher pay-performance

sensitivity increases the weight entrepreneurs put on monetary benefits rather than private

benefits.

       At the same time, control rights are central to the theories of Aghion and Bolton (1992)

and Dewatripont and Tirole (1994). Because giving up control rights is costly for the

entrepreneur in terms of private benefits, the entrepreneur will try to avoid doing so as much as

possible. As the external financing capacity of the project increases (e.g. the later the stage, the

higher the verifiable monetary benefits, etc.), these theories predict a movement from more

investor control to more entrepreneur control. Moreover, if the entrepreneur has to give up

control rights, he will do so first in the states where control rights are most valuable to the

investor. Finally, to the extent that actions are contractible, the entrepreneur will find it useful to

precommit to take certain actions.

       The extensive use and contracting on control rights in our sample is broadly consistent

with the assumptions and predictions of these theories. Allocating state-contingent voting and

board control rights is a common feature in these contracts. This state-contingent contracting is

much more elaborate than the control rights inherent in ordinary debt contracts that only give

liquidation rights in case of default on a promised payment. As shown in Table 6, control can be

made contingent on financial performance relative to projections or cumulative cash-flow, or on

non-financial events such as the termination of the manager, quite independently of the division

of cash-flow rights.




                                                  27
         Hence, our results provide empirical support to the incomplete contracting approach

pioneered by Grossman and Hart (1986). The control theories, however, do not fully explain VC

financings. In particular, the shift of control in these theories is all-or-nothing and is determined

by whether performance does or does not exceed a certain level. In practice, control shifts along

a number of dimensions –voting rights, board rights, liquidation rights, redemption rights, etc. –

and shifts at different levels of performance. 9 At extreme poor performance, VCs get liquidation

rights in default. For “normal” performance, VCs and the entrepreneur share voting rights and

board rights, although they shift toward the entrepreneur as performance goals are met. Finally,

for extremely good performance, the VC relinquishes all special control rights (generally through

automatic conversion at an IPO).



         4.3      “Stealing theories”: cash flows neither observable nor verifiable

         The “stealing” theories of Hart and Moore (1998), Gale and Hellwig (1982), and others

are less successful in our data. First, these theories do not explain the division of residual cash-

flow rights in VC financings. Because they assume the entrepreneur can expropriate all the

residual cash-flow of the firm, these models implicitly assume that the entrepreneur owns all the

equity. Second, these models assume that it is not possible to write contracts on profits or other

measures of financial performance is assumed impossible in these models. Third, the only

control rights that matter in these theories are liquidation rights.

         In all our financings, investors accept claims with equity features -- such as convertibles,

warrants or common stock – that promise residual cash-flow rights in the future. More

importantly, contracts are frequently written contingent on both financial and non-financial


9
 Dewatripont and Tirole (1994) come closest to capturing this in that control shifts to different parties as
performance changes.


                                                          28
measures of performance. Finally, in these theories, the only verifiable signal to contract on is

default on promised payments. While these theories are consistent with the use of ordinary debt

contracts, they do not explain the rich state-contingent contracting that we find in venture capital

contracts.

       In the models of outside equity financing in Myers (forthcoming) and Fluck (1998), the

liquidation right is replaced by the right to fire management, which will occur if dividends are

too low. Here it is essential, then, that outside equity investors have this right, which in turn

implies that they need to hold a majority of the votes. Moreover, in these models, the firm has to

pay out dividends. Both of these assumptions are frequently violated in our venture capital

financings. For a significant fraction of our observations, 43% of our cases, the venture capitalist

lacks voting control. Moreover, very few of our firms are required to pay cash dividends.

Hence, these theories do not seem to be able to explain the structure of our venture capital

financings.

       There is, however, an important sense in which the “stealing theories” are successful.

Our results indicate that liquidation rights are allocated to VCs. If the company is liquidated, the

liquidation proceeds go to the VCs ahead of the entrepreneur. Furthermore, the VCs do have

some power to liquidate through redemption rights, explicitly through ex ante staging and,

implicitly through the ability to not fund a subsequent round.



       4.4     Inalienability of human capital

       The inalienability of human capital theories of Hart and Moore (1994) assume that the

entrepreneur cannot contractually commit to stay with the firm. Because the firm is worth more




                                                  29
with the entrepreneur than without him, this leads to a hold-up problem where the entrepreneur

will threaten to leave the venture unless the investor’s claim is written down.

         Our results suggest that this is an important issue. Venture capitalists frequently use

contractual remedies, such as non-compete clauses and time vesting of founder shares to make it

more costly for the entrepreneur / manager to leave.10 Both of these provisions improve the

bargaining power of the VCs versus the entrepreneur in any subsequent renegotiation because

the entrepreneur has relatively more to lose.

         Furthermore, vesting provisions also are more common in early stage firms. These

provisions explicitly make it more costly for the entrepreneur the earlier he leaves. This is

consistent with Hart and Moore (1994) if the entrepreneur is more crucial for the firm’s

operations in the earlier stage. As time passes, and the firm becomes less and less dependent on

the specific skills of the original founder, more and more of the founder’s shares vest. This

scheme also gives some protection to the entrepreneur from being completely held up by the

venture capitalist at the point when the entrepreneur is no longer needed to run the business.



         4.5      Venture Capital-Specific Theories

         The venture capital-specific theories are arguably less successful overall in explaining

our results. Among these theories, the predictions in Hellman (1998) are the most consistent

with our results.

         Berglof (1994) predicts that control rights will be allocated based on firm performance.

At the same time, however, he also predicts that cash flow rights will not be allocated based on




10
    The vesting provisions also provide an incentive for the entrepreneur to exert effort and succeed. It is very costly
to the entrepreneur if he is fired by the VC before his shares have vested.


                                                          30
firm performance and that the entrepreneur receives private benefits not cash flow rights. These

latter two predictions are clearly at odds with the data.

       Similarly, the key prediction in Cornelli and Yosha (1998) that the cash flow rights

allocated to VCs upon conversion increase with the signal of firm performance is contradicted by

our data. In our data, VC cash flow rights (as a fraction of all rights) decline with firm

performance.

       The assumptions and predictions in Repullo and Suarez (1998) meet with mixed success

in our data. Repullo and Suarez correctly predict that entrepreneurs and venture capitalists will

both have equity ownership and, therefore, share the cash flow rights of the company. They also

predict a contract that looks somewhat like convertible preferred for start-up financings.

However, they predict that later stage financings will be done with all common stock. Our

results indicate that financings at all stages – early and later – utilize convertible preferred stock

or multiple classes of common stock. We also question their assumption that the VCs primarily

add value in the expansion stage rather than the start-up stage.

       Garmaise (1998) develops a model in which venture capitalists who have privately

observed signals about a project bid for the entrepreneur's venture using different contract

provisions. The optimal strategy for the venture capitalist involves offering to take a debt claim

when the private signal is low, and an equity claim when the private signal is high. Because we

do not observe VCs offering straight debt contracts or straight equity contracts, our results do not

appear consistent with Garmaise’s model.

       In Hellman (1998), the optimal financing contract calls for: (1) giving the entrepreneur all

equity compensation to increase his effort and decrease his resistance towards replacement; and

(2) giving the venture capitalist control if the benefits from replacing the entrepreneur are high




                                                  31
enough. Although entrepreneurs do not receive all equity compensation, it is safe to say that the

larger part of their compensation comes from the upside associated with their equity stake.

Furthermore, it is common in our data for the VCs to have voting control at the close of the

financing. This is consistent with Hellman if the expected benefits of replacing the entrepreneur

are higher in early stage deals.

       While Hellman (1998) is consistent with some of our findings, the model fails to capture

the contingent nature of control rights in our results. In Hellman (1998), control rights are set at

the beginning and do not shift as a function of performance.



       4.6     Screening Models.

       It also is apparent venture capital contracts perform important screening functions.

Lazear (1986) provides the most relevant theoretical treatment of these issues. Prendergast

(1999) also describes and summarizes these models. For example, those provisions that make

cash flow rights contingent on performance not only motivate entrepreneurs to provide effort, but

also discourage entrepreneurs with bad projects from accepting the contract.

       Similarly, anti-dilution provisions also penalize entrepreneurs with bad projects or bad

skills because the current VC investment will be re-priced downward if a future financing is

completed at a lower price.

       The use of participating convertible preferred compared to straight convertible preferred

also provides a screening function. Assume that a VC places a particular distribution of values

on an entrepreneur’s company. Assume next that the VC offers a convertible preferred contract

and a participating convertible preferred contract to the entrepreneur with the same expected

payout to the VC. Because the VC obtains a return of principal in the participating preferred




                                                 32
contract, the participating preferred will require a lower percentage ownership than the

convertible preferred for the same expected value to the VC. Now take the entrepreneur’s

perspective. All else equal, entrepreneurs who know or believe they will succeed will prefer the

participating preferred over the convertible preferred. Thus, participating preferred is potentially

useful in screening entrepreneurs who are better or more optimistic.



5.      Cross-sectional Tests and Relationships

        In this section, we report the results of cross-sectional tests. We investigate how the

contracts vary as a function of different proxies for the severity of the agency problem between

the VC and the entrepreneur as well as for information differences between them. We then

interpret these results in relation to the predictions of the different theories.



        5.1     Dependent variables

        The potential conflicts of interest between the entrepreneur and the VC should depend on

the degree of uncertainty about the project's economic viability. This uncertainty should be

higher at the early stages of a project’s life, when the quality and value of the project are still

highly uncertain. To capture this, we use the "Pre-revenue venture" variable, taking the value of

one if the company had no revenues at the time of financing, and zero otherwise.

        We expect this variable to be related to the agency problem for a number of reasons. At

the early stage in the project's life, the input of the entrepreneur is arguably more crucial to the

project's success. Hence, providing incentives to the entrepreneur to "work on the right things"

becomes crucial. Also, asymmetric information problems are also likely to be higher, in

particular regarding the viability of the business idea and the entrepreneur's skills. Similarly,




                                                   33
when the uncertainty about the project viability is higher, the VCs are more likely to find

themselves in the situation where they want to shut down the project or replace the management

team, leading to potential conflicts with the entrepreneur.

           The VC may have prior information on the quality of the founders which reduces the

likelihood of adverse selection and the uncertainty of the venture. To measure this, we form a

dummy variable, "repeat entrepreneur", taking the value of one if the founders had previously

founded a company that was either taken public or was acquired by another public company

before the financing round, and zero otherwise. We use the company business plan and the VC

analysis to obtain this information. This variable may also capture the degree to which the

entrepreneur is financially constrained. It is likely that a previously successful entrepreneur will

have acquired some wealth that can be invested in the project, reducing the need for VC

financing.

           The extent to which the VC needs to protect itself from agency problems, and the

required stake that the VC needs to be allocated to invest in the venture, will also in general

depend on the amount of funds the VC invests in the project. Including the dollar amount

invested by the VCs directly as a dependent variable would be problematic, however. First, it is

an endogenous variable, since the amount invested by the VC in a particular round potentially

will be lower when agency problems are more severe.11 Second, the financing amount should be

measured in relation to the total financing need of the project and the expected future cash flow

which are difficult to determine.

           Instead, we try to capture this effect by including the financing round number, which is

correlated with the accumulated financing provided by the VC, but suffers less from endogeneity



11
     Results in Gompers (1995) suggest that this is likely to be the case.


                                                             34
and normalization problems. One potential problem with this variable, however, is that it might

also capture the degree of uncertainty about the project in a similar way to "Pre-revenue

venture".

        To control for possible effects of industry, geographical location, and the identity of the

particular VC firm, we also include dummy variables for these in some of our specifications.



        5.2     Determinants of cash-flow right allocations

        The allocation of cash-flow rights to the entrepreneur will affect the pay-performance

sensitivity of the entrepreneurs’claims. The classical principal agent theories predict that pay-

performance sensitivity should be higher when agency problems are more severe (i.e. when the

return to managerial effort is high, see e.g. Prendergast (1999)).

        Table 10 examines the cross-sectional determinants of pay-performance sensitivity using

two different measures. The first measure is simply the share of equity allocated to the

entrepreneur. This measure is essentially the pay-performance measure introduced by Jensen and

Murphy (1990) and applied to venture-capital financed IPO firms by Baker and Gompers (1999).

The cross-sectional results in table 10 using this measure are quite weak. If anything, the results

go against the predictions of theory since the founders’equity stake is lower for pre-revenue

ventures and higher for successful entrepreneurs (even though the coefficients are not significant

in all specifications).

        The problem with this as a measure of pay-performance sensitivity is that it is very much

related to the overall value of the venture relative to the amount of funding the VC is providing.

When uncertainty and agency problems are high, the VC will require more cash-flow rights in

return for the financing provided, driving down the founders’equity stake. The significantly




                                                 35
negative effect of the round of VC investment is consistent with this interpretation. For each

financing round, the VC puts more funds into the venture and requires a higher equity stake. This

suggests that the founder equity stake is not a useful measure of incentive provision for

entrepreneurial firms.

       Even if the VC demands a large equity stake, it can still increase the pay-performance

sensitivity for the entrepreneur by making the allocation more state-contingent. This is addressed

by our second measure of pay-performance sensitivity, the difference in the founder equity stake

between the best and the worst case state. In the second set of regressions in table 10, the

founders’equity percentage is significantly more sensitive to performance for pre-revenue

ventures. In addition, the equity percentage of previously successful entrepreneurs is somewhat

less sensitive to performance, although the relationship is not statistically significant when

location, industry, and VC firm controls are included, or when we restrict the sample to first VC

financings.

       Overall, these results support the prediction of the classical principal agent theories. They

also are consistent with a screening model (e.g. along the lines of Lazear (1986)) where pay-

performance sensitivity is used to screen out bad entrepreneurs, since more able entrepreneurs

will benefit more from state-contingent cash-flow allocations.



       5.3     Determinants of control right allocations

       The incomplete contracting theories of Aghion and Bolton (1992) and others focus on the

allocation of control between the investor and the entrepreneur. Aghion and Bolton (1992) show

that as the external financing capacity of the project increases (e.g. the later the stage, the higher

the verifiable monetary benefits, etc.), control moves from more investor control to more




                                                  36
entrepreneur control. In particular, for projects with high external financing capacity (i.e. small

agency problems or small required investment) the entrepreneur always should have control. As

external financing capacity decreases there should be state-contingent control. Finally, for

projects with low external financing capacity, the investor should always be allocated control.

        Table 11 tests this prediction using two measures of control -- voting control and board

majority. Panel A estimates an ordered logit regression of voting control on our proxies for

agency problems. The dependent variable takes the value of zero if the entrepreneur always

controls a majority of the votes, one if the VC has voting control only in the worse state, and two

if the VC always has voting control.

        Panel A of table 11 shows that the pre-revenue variable is significantly positively related

to VC control in all of the specifications. The repeat entrepreneur variable is negatively related

to VC control, significantly so in two of the regressions. Finally, the amount of VC funding, as

measured by the round of financing, is strongly positively related to VC control. These results

are generally consistent with the predictions in Aghion and Bolton (1992).

        In panel B, we repeat the exercise using board rights as our measure of control. Here we

define the VC control variable as zero if the founders control a majority of the board seats, one if

neither the VC nor the founders have board control, and two if the VC controls the board. Here

the results are similar, but not as strong as for voting rights.12




12
   We had to exclude industry and VC fixed effects because of collinearity problems. In particular, one VC firm
(with more than 10 deals) had no case where the VCs had board majority. Similarly, in one industry (retail) there
were no cases where the VCs had a board majority.



                                                        37
        5.4      Determinants of liquidation rights and claims

        Most of the financial contracting theories predict that the investor should have a senior

claim compared to the entrepreneur. The other important characteristic of liquidation rights is

the ability to liquidate the firm when performance is bad. According to the "Stealing Theories",

the investor's ability to liquidate when a contracted payment has not been met is critical to be

able to recoup the investment. Table 5 showed that the VC is almost always senior to the

entrepreneur in liquidation, while contracted payments are largely absent from the contracts, with

the exception of redemption rights.

        Table 12 investigates the cross-sectional determinants of liquidation rights. Because

liquidation rights typically do not change over time, we restrict attention to the first financing

round available for each company only to avoid "double-counting" of observations.

        First, redemption rights are unrelated to the pre-revenue variable, but are significantly

less likely to be present when the entrepreneur has previously founded a successful venture.

Second, cumulative preferred dividends are negatively related to the repeat entrepreneur variable

and insignificantly related to the pre-revenue dummy. 13 This provides some evidence that

redemption clauses and cumulative preferred dividends are used when the adverse selection

problem with respect to the entrepreneur is more severe.

        Third, the presence of participating preferred stock cannot be explained by either of our

two proxies for agency problems. Both the pre-revenue and the repeat entrepreneur dummy are

generally insignificant.

        To sum up, our results for liquidation rights are not incredibly strong. While the presence

of redemption rights and cumulative dividends does seems somewhat related to agency problems


13
 The repeat entrepreneur dummy is significant in all specifications, except when location dummies are included.
On the other hand, the location dummies are not jointly significant.


                                                       38
as measured by the repeat entrepreneur variable, the use of participating preferred stock does not.

Also, the pre-revenue variable that was critical in explaining the use of cash-flow incentives and

the allocation of control rights does not at all relate to the liquidation rights.



        5.5     Determinants of contingencies / contracting space

        The results in table 6 showed that VCs contract on a number of different measures of

financial and non-financial performance, all presumably observable and verifiable. As noted

earlier, this result is at odds with the strong contracting assumptions made in Hart and Moore

(1998) and others. On the other hand, a large fraction of the contracts in our sample do not

include any performance contingencies.

        In this section, we consider the potential determinants of such contingencies. One

possibility is that state-contingencies are less appropriate for more uncertain environments where

it is more difficult to define and verify future contingencies.

        This interpretation, however, does not get much support in the data. In the first three

columns of table 13, the dependent variable takes the value of one if there is any contingent

contracting in the deal (on cash-flow, control, liquidation rights, or future financings) and zero

otherwise. The degree of contingent contracting is unrelated to whether the venture has revenues

or not. Instead, the extent of contingent contracting is related to the round of VC investment.

Contingent contracting is significantly more common in earlier financing rounds and somewhat

more common for entrepreneurs without a previous record of success (when the degree of

uncertainty should be higher). This suggests that the use of contingent contracts is more closely

related to VC screening of companies and entrepreneurs.




                                                   39
       In the last two columns of panel A, contingencies are divided into those based on

financial and non-financial performance. Contingent contracting on non-financial performance

is more common in earlier stage financings. This suggests that VCs find other observable and

verifiable signals when financial measures are unavailable.



       5.6     Determinants of ex-ante staging

       Table 14 examines the presence of ex-ante staging in the initial VC financing contracts.

In an ex-ante staged deal, part of the VC’s committed funding is released at a later date

contingent on explicit financial or non-financial performance milestones. These provisions can

be interpreted as another type of liquidation right. By giving the VC the ability to withhold the

rest of the financing if performance is unsatisfactory, the VC essentially gets the right to

liquidate the venture in the bad state of the world.

       Most VC financings are at least implicitly staged, in the sense that even when all the

funding in the initial round is released immediately, it is understood that future financing rounds

will be needed to support the firm until the IPO. Hence, the same mechanism is present

implicitly in most VC financings. The ex-ante staging, however, makes this liquidation right

stronger and more explicitly related to performance.

       Table 14 looks at two different measures: logit regressions on a dummy variable

indicating ex-ante staging, as well as tobit regressions on the fraction of future committed

financing to total financing committed. The results are very similar for both measures and mimic

the results for liquidation rights. While the pre-revenue venture variable is not significant, the

repeat entrepreneur dummy is negatively related to ex-ante staging and generally significant.

Again, the ability to withhold part of the VC financing is used more when the uncertainty about




                                                 40
the entrepreneur's type is higher. Table 14 also indicates significant differences across

industries.14



          5.7.    Complementarity and substitutability of contract provisions

          So far, we have examined the different contractual rights and provisions one at a time.

One important finding, however, is that VCs use several different governance mechanisms, such

as pay-performance compensation, board and voting control, and liquidation rights,

simultaneously in their contracts. This section takes an exploratory step in examining the

interaction between these rights. Here, theoretical predictions are largely absent because

financial contracting models typically focus on one mechanism in isolation.15 We restrict the

comparison to initial financing rounds in order to "purge" the comparison from effects due to the

evolution of the contracts over time documented in table 9.

          Table 15 considers contracting provisions for the initial VC investments in our sample

along three different dimensions – the degree of VC voting control16, the extent of pay-

performance sensitivity in the founder's equity stake, and whether the next financing round is

specified in the contract and contingent on performance. Similar patterns emerge in all three

panels.

          First, panel A shows that voting control and board control are significantly positively

correlated. Hence, these two control mechanisms seem to be complementary. They also are

strongly positively related to the amount of equity that the VC holds in the firm. Despite the fact

that they are separately contracted upon and not perfectly correlated, cash-flow rights and control

14
   This result should be interpreted cautiously because collinearity precluded VC dummies from being included
directly in the regressions. In a separate analysis, VC firm effects were significant (in a Kruskal-Wallis chi-square
test).
15
   Notable exceptions are Dewatripont and Tirole (1994) and Hellmann (1998).



                                                          41
rights largely go together. Also, when VCs have control, they are more reluctant to relinquish it.

The stock price (relative to the current price) at which the automatic conversion provision is

significantly higher when VCs have control.

           Second, panel A shows that the performance sensitivity of the founder's equity claim is

positively related to the degree of VC control in general, and state-contingent control in

particular. When the VC has voting control, roughly one-third of the founders’equity stake is

contingent on performance versus only three percent when the founders always have voting

control. The results are similar for board control and founder vesting provisions. Founders’

pay-performance incentives and VC control, therefore, seem to be more complements than

substitutes.

           Third, the relationship between liquidation rights and the other rights is less clear-cut.

Cumulative dividends and redemption clauses are largely independent of control rights, while the

use of participating preferred stock is more common the higher the degree of VC voting control.

On the other hand, both redemption rights and cumulative dividends are significantly positively

related to founders’pay-performance sensitivity, while participating preferred is not related.

           Fourth, panel A shows that the use of explicit contracting on different measures of

performance is positively related to VC control, and in particular to voting control. The use of

any contingencies occurs in 57.5% of the financings in which the VCs always have a voting

majority, but in only 28% of the financings in which the founders control the majority of the

votes. The differences are even greater for contracts with contracting on financial or non-

financial performance. Hence, the contracting space seems to be larger when VCs are in control

compared to when the entrepreneur is in control.



16
     The results are similar for board control. We do not present them due to space considerations.


                                                           42
       Finally, panel C shows that the allocation of rights is strongly related to the presence of

ex-ante staged financing. In financing rounds with ex-ante (contingent) staging: VCs are much

more likely to have voting and board control; founders have more contingent pay-performance

sensitivities; vesting provisions are more common; automatic conversion prices are a larger

multiple of the stock price of the round; and default board provisions and full ratchet anti-

dilution protection are more common.

       To sum up, to the extent the different governance mechanisms are related, they are more

complements than substitutes.



6.     Discussion and Conclusion

       In this paper, we have compared the characteristics of real world financial contracts to

their counterparts in financial contracting theory by conducting a detailed study of actual

contracts between venture capitalists (VCs) and entrepreneurs.



       6.1     Findings

       Our main findings include:

       (1) The distinguishing characteristic of VC financings is that they allow VCs to

separately allocate cash flow rights, voting rights, board rights, liquidation rights, and other

control rights. We explicitly measure and report the allocation of these rights.

       (2) While convertible securities are used most frequently, VCs also implement a similar

allocation of rights using combinations of multiple classes of common stock and straight

preferred stock. Also, participating convertible preferred is effectively straight preferred and

common stock.




                                                  43
       (3) Cash flow rights, voting rights, control rights, and future financings are frequently

contingent on observable measures of financial and non-financial performance. These state

contingencies are somewhat more common in first VC and early stage financings.

       (4) If the company performs poorly, the VCs obtain full control. As company

performance improves, the entrepreneur retains / obtains more control rights. If the company

performs very well, the VCs retain their cash flow rights, but relinquish most of their control and

liquidation rights. The entrepreneur’s cash flow rights also increase with firm performance.

       (5) It is common for VCs to include non-compete and vesting provisions aimed at

mitigating the potential hold-up problem between the entrepreneur and the investor. The vesting

provisions are somewhat more common in early stage financings where it is more likely that the

hold-up problem is more severe.

       (6) Cash flow incentives, control rights, and contingencies implemented in these

contracts are used more as complements than as substitutes.



       6.2     Implications for theory

       Many of the theories we consider explain different aspects of the results we find.

However, several theories stand out. First, our results are most consistent with the control

theories – such as Aghion and Bolton (1992) and Dewatripont and Tirole (1994). These control

theories make predictions concerning cash flow rights that are similar to those made in

traditional principal agent models – e.g., higher pay-performance sensitivity increases the weight

entrepreneurs put on monetary benefits rather than private benefits. At the same time, these

theories emphasize control rights that are contingent on measures of performance. The extensive

use of and contracting on control rights in our sample is broadly consistent with these theories.




                                                44
       Second, inalienability of human capital appears to be important as argued in Hart and

Moore (1994). However, contractual remedies exist to mitigate the problems associated with

inalienability. Also, these theories do not explain residual cash flow and control rights.

       Third, various aspects of VC contracts clearly have the effect of helping VCs screen good

entrepreneurs and companies from bad ones.

       Finally, no one theory explains the multi-dimensional nature of the allocation of control

rights we observe in these financings. Control rights are allocated across a number of

dimensions – voting rights, board rights, liquidation rights. In addition, we find that those

different control rights shift from VC to entrepreneur at different levels of performance. At very

low levels of performance, the VC has the right to liquidate. At low levels of performance, the

VC will typically have voting control and board control. As performance improves, the

entrepreneur gains more cash flow rights as well as voting and board rights. As performance

reaches a high level – i.e., a successful initial public offering – the VC’s investment

automatically converts into common stock and the VC relinquishes all the special control rights

associated with its initial investment.

future performance occurs if the financing round is staged. I.e., some of the funding committed in the round will be funded contingent on meeting certain
milestones. Examples of the different classes of contract provisions can be found in table 6. Pre-revenue rounds differ from post-revenue rounds at the: 1%
***; 5% **, and 10% * levels.

Other terms for 200 investments in 118 portfolio companies by 14 venture capital partnerships. Investments were made between 1987 and 1999. Terms include extent
to which venture capital contracts include (1) automatic conversion provisions; (2) antidilution protection; (3) time-vesting of founder shares and (4) non-compete
clauses for the founder. Conversion price is the IPO or sale price per share of common stock at which the venture capital securities automatically convert into common
stock. Round price is the price per share of common stock at which the securities issued in the current round convert or are priced. If a company subsequently issues
equity at a lower price per share than the current round: under a full ratchet provision, the conversion price on the currentround drops to the new issue price; under a
weighted-average provision, the conversion price of the current round declines to a value between the current round and the new issue price. Seed and start-up rounds
differ from later stage rounds at the: 1% ***; 5% **, and 10% * levels.

A.          Determinants of voting control

Ordered logit regressions of degree of VC voting control on various independent variables for 201 investments in 118 portfolio
companies by 14 venture capital partnerships. The dependent variable takes the value of 0 if the VCs never have control, 1 if the VCs
have control only in the bad state, and 2 if the VCs always have control. Investments were made between 1987 and 1999. Z-statistics
are in parentheses. Asterisks indicate statistical significance at the 1% ***; 5% **, and 10% * levels.

  Note: Industry and VC fixed effects were excluded because of collinearity problems. In particular, one of our VC firms (with more
than 10 deals) had no case where the VCs had board majority. Similarly, in one of our industries (retail) there were no cases where the
   VCs had board majority and in two more industries (telecom and healthcare) there were only one case of founder board majority.

                                                         Determinants of contingencies

Logit regressions of use of contingencies as a function of various independent variables for 201 investments in 118 portfolio
companies by 14 venture capital partnerships. Contingencies are based on financial performance, non-financial performance, action, or
future financing. Investments were made between 1987 and 1999. T-statistics are in parentheses and are calculated using White (1980)
robust standard errors. Asterisks indicate statistical significance at the 1% ***; 5% **, and 10% * levels.
