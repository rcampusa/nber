                                         ABSTRACT

We describe the economic history of the rise of the American minimum wage between 1910 and
1968. Each new FLSA amendment led to a new peak in the real purchasing power of the national
minimum. Exemptions to the FLSA were progressively closed and the share of workers covered
finally increased from about 50 percent of the private sector workforce in 1937, to 77 percent of
the private sector and 40 percent of the public sector workforce in 1966. By the late 1970s
coverage was nearly complete, with only the smallest employers exempted. We describe the
political economic history of the minimum wage laws, as well as the debates among economists.
Another key feature is a renewed emphasis on the roles played by the states in passing the
original minimum wage laws for women. The states filled some of the gaps in coverage left by
the FLSA after 1938 and set higher minimum rates for women in some sectors in the 1940s and
1950s than the FLSA set for men and women in interstate commerce. Since 1981 a rising number
of states have set general minimum wages that substantially exceed the national minimum.

                         The Rise of American Minimum Wages, 1912 to 1968

       Minimum wages have been among the most controversial government interventions in

labor markets. There have been several waves of minimum wage activity over the past century.

The stances of the interest groups have been consistent over time, and largely centered around

prevailing wage levels. In several waves of debates economists developed similar themes while

repackaging them with more technical language while improving the quality of the statistical

analysis.

       The American experience with minimum wages began when 15 states passed minimum

wage laws for women and youths between 1912 and 1922. In political debates, advocates viewed

minimum wages as an essential protection for less-skilled workers to provide them with a "living

wage", defined by the amount necessary to keep the worker, and perhaps their family, at a modest

level of comfort. Low-wage employers worried about the effect on their costs and were staunchly

opposed. High-wage employers have supported minimum wages as a means to restrict "unfair"

competition in periods when they were paying well above the minimum. Institutional and

neoclassical economists in the 1910s disagreed about the theoretical impact of minimum wages

using reasoning similar to the later debates in the 1940s and 1950s and again in the modern era.

Between 1923 and 1936 the U. S. Supreme Court in a series of close decisions found minimum

wage laws to be unconstitutional violations of the "freedom to contract." Despite the rulings, the

federal and state governments continued to propose new laws, and the Supreme Court reversed

course in 1937.

       After intense debates the Fair Labor Standards Act (FSLA) of 1938 established a national

minimum wage for workers in interstate commerce, while roughly half the states set minimum

                                                                                                2
rates for workers in some sectors left uncovered by the FLSA. The federal law set nominal

minimum wages and future rate increases required new legislation that was often delayed by

disputes between interest groups. In consequence, the purchasing power of the national minimum

wage has followed the sawtooth path in Figure 1 with a jump when each new nominal minimum

wage was set and then a decline as inflation eroded its purchasing power. While the national

minimum wage remained constant in the 1940s, verbal theoretical disputes between institutional

and neoclassical economists heated up.

       After increases in the nominal and real national minimum rates in 1950 and 1956,

economists' disagreements centered on empirical debates that foreshadowed the modern debates

of the 1990s through the present time. Amendments to the FLSA in 1961 and 1966 raised the real

minimum wage in several steps until it reached an all-time peak in 1968. Between 1960 and 1990,

academic studies exploited longer data series since the initial passage of the FLSA and used

increasingly sophisticated econometric techniques. During this period, the neoclassical view

became increasingly accepted and most studies confirmed their prediction of negative employment

effects, particularly for the young and unskilled. By the late 1960s, legislators had begun directly

referring to these studies in the Congressional Record. In 1980 Ronald Reagan became the first

President to actively oppose minimum wages, and a new minimum was not set until 1989. Despite

a new empirical debate over the minimum wage that started in the mid-1990s, the long delays

between FLSA amendments have continued, and the 2019 national minimum wage has less

purchasing power than the 1950 minimum. In consequence, as many as 32 states have passed

minimum wages that exceeded the national minimum during the 2000s (Neumark 2019).

       Our focus in this paper is on the economic history of the rise of the American minimum

wage between 1910 and 1968. Each new FLSA amendment led to a new peak in the real purchasing



                                                                                                  3
power of the national minimum. Exemptions to the FLSA were progressively closed and the share

of workers covered finally increased from about 50 percent of the private sector workforce in 1937,

to 77 percent of the private sector and 40 percent of the public sector workforce in 1966. By the

late 1970s coverage was nearly complete, with only the smallest employers exempted. We describe

the political economic history of the minimum wage laws, as well as the debates among

economists. Another key feature is a renewed emphasis on the roles played by the states in passing

the original minimum wage laws for women. The states filled some of the gaps in coverage left by

the FLSA after 1938 and set higher minimum rates for women in some sectors in the 1940s and

1950s than the FLSA set for men and women in interstate commerce. Since 1981 a rising number

of states have set general minimum wages that substantially exceed the national minimum.



A History of American Minimum Wage Legislation

       In the early 1900s, labor law was the responsibility of state and local governments.

Massachusetts enacted the first law for women and minors in 1912. Washington, DC and 14 more

states listed in Table 1 followed (Phelps 1939 and United States Women's Bureau 1928). A few

set flat minimum wages, while most copied earlier laws in Australia, New Zealand, and the United

Kingdom and created commissions to issue wage orders by sector.

       The primary argument given by supporters of the early state laws covering women and

children was the ending of "sweated" labor ­ hard work for very low pay under poor conditions

(Webb 1912, Commons 1935). Reformers considered this to be a health and safety issue. The

Supreme Court had upheld men's hours laws in dangerous industries and women's hours law in

all industries (Fishback 2018). Reformers thought a natural extension was to prevent unhealthy

conditions for women and their children by preventing wages from falling below a "living wage",



                                                                                                 4
and used the argument to win support for the laws in state supreme courts in Arkansas,

Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Oregon, and Washington (Clark 1921, p. 33).

           After a 4-4 tie in the Supreme Court's Stettler v. O'Hara and Simpson v. O'Hara cases left

the Oregon minimum wage in place, the Court in 1923 declared the District of Colombia law

unconstitutional by a 5-3 vote in Adkins v. Children's Hospital and Adkins v. Willie A. Lyons. 1 The

majority affirmed the doctrine of "freedom of contract," and stated that "wages, unlike hours

affected health only `indirectly or remotely.'" Oliver Wendell Holmes dissented, arguing the law's

correct goal was to remove conditions causing "ill health, immorality, and the deterioration of the

race." 2

           Despite a series of court rulings striking down minimum wage laws, the votes were often

close, and several states continued to set advisory wages (US Bureau of Labor Statistics 1933b,

pp. 1344-54). As happened with most state labor laws, enforcement relied on the employer's

willingness to abide by the law, pressure from workers, and public opinion. Wage declines during

the Depression led seven states in 1933 to pass new laws, often based on a standard bill sponsored

by the National Consumers' League (US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1933, p. 1259). The Bureau

of Labor Statistics (1933b, p. 1346) supported the laws on grounds that Depression had made it

"apparent that unfair wage standards not only undermine the health and well-being of the workers

but threaten the stability of industry itself." The laws protected "the public health, morals and

welfare."

            Worries about industry stability and declining wages led President Hoover to "jawbone"

leading manufacturers to set up work-sharing arrangements with reduced weekly hours, more

employment, and no reductions in hourly earnings (Rose 2010; Neumann, Taylor and Fishback

2013). The New Dealers followed in 1933 with the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of

1933, which called for employers, workers, and consumers in each sector to limit excessive

competition by negotiating codes that included minimum wages. While waiting for the codes,

President Roosevelt convinced thousands of firms to sign President's Reemployment Agreements

(PRAs) that set maximum hours and minimum wages with the stated goal to "raise wages, create

employment, and thus increase purchasing power and restore business." 3 Hundreds of sectors then

developed codes, although violations largely went unpunished. In L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp.

v. United States (295 U. S. 495, 1935), the Supreme Court unanimously struck down the codes

because they had become the equivalent of regulations created by market participants and such

delegation of power was unconstitutional (Taylor 2011).

        In 1936 the court also struck down a 1933 New York minimum wage law with a 5-4 vote

in Morehead v. New York ex. Rel. Tipaldo (298 US 587, 1936) despite New York's attempts to

differentiate it from the D. C. law declared unconstitutional in 1923. Chief Justice Hughes

dissented: "I can find nothing in the Federal Constitution which denies to the state the power to

protect women from being exploited by overreaching employers." (p. 619). In a separate dissent

Justices Stone, Brandeis and Cardozo declared that in the prior decade society had learned that a

wage is not always the outcome of free bargaining; that it may be "forced upon employees by their

economic necessities and upon employers by the most ruthless of their competitors." Insufficient

wages burdened society as a whole, and the problem should be solved by the legislative branch

(pp. 635-6).

 The PRAs required minimum weekly earnings of $15, $14.50, $14, and $12 in areas of descending size. The hourly
minimum was 40 cents unless the 1929 wage was less. Signing the PRAs was attractive to employers because the
government developed a massive ad campaign asking consumers to buy from the firms (Taylor 2011).

                                                                                                             6
        The minimum wage was ruled constitutional when Justice Owen Roberts switched sides

and voted to uphold the 1913 Washington state minimum wage law for women in West Coast

Hotel v. Parrish (300 US 379, 1937). Roberts joined the court after the 1923 Adkins decision and

later claimed that he had voted against the New York minimum because it was similar to the D. C.

law and New York's lawyers failed to challenge the Adkins ruling. In 1937 Washington state

lawyers directly challenged the Adkins decision, and he chose to support their law because women

were "especially liable to be overreached and exploited by unscrupulous employers," which was

"not only detrimental to the health and wellbeing of the women affected, but casts a direct burden

for their support upon the community." 4

        The decision opened the door for a minimum wage, but a federal minimum was

controversial. 5 Northern Democrats and some Republicans viewed minimum wages as a moral

imperative needed to end sweated labor. 6 President Roosevelt spoke of the need to end "starvation

wages." Senator William Borah (R, ID) proclaimed people worthy of hire are "entitled to sufficient

compensation to maintain a decent standard of living" (Congressional Record, 1938, p. 7793).

High-wage producers of shoes and textiles in New England and lumber in the Northwest supported

minimum wages in order to eliminate "excessive," "unfair" competition from the low-wage

South. 7 The opposition was led by Congressmen from low-wage states and some northern

  Another argument raised in 1937/38 was that minimum wages would promote national recovery by increasing
aggregate demand, a view which was also central to President Roosevelt's New deal wage policies. However, by the
1950s, the Depression was long over and this argument had all but vanished from Congressional debates.

Republicans, who saw minimum wages as an unwarranted federal government intrusion into

private contracts. Nearly half of all southern manufacturing workers, and higher shares in textiles

and lumber, earned less than 40 cents per hour in 1937.

       Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins wrote the original bill. It specified a 40-cent minimum

but appointed Industry Committees, comprising industry insiders and members of the public, were

allowed to raise the rate to 80 cents, well above estimates of a living wage and prevailing wage

rates (Congressional Record, 1937, p. 439). The Senate passed the bill in July 1937. When it

reached the House, southern Democrats raised strong objections to the Industry Committees. They

expected high-wage northern interests to capture the committees and set minimum wages near 80

cents and disallow regional differentials. Union leaders also objected because they believed that

wage bargaining was their exclusive domain.

       After months of political wrangling, the bill looked set to die in committee because

southern Democrats held out-sized representation and more seniority on the key committees. The

tide turned in May when ardent minimum wage supporters Senator Claude Pepper and

Representative Lister Hill overwhelmingly beat bill opponents in Democratic primaries in Florida

and Alabama. The entire House then petitioned for and passed the bill in late May 1938. The Act

phased in the minimum wage at 25 cents in October 1938, rising to 30 cents in October 1939, and

then gave Industry Committees the discretion to raise it to 40 cents between October 1940 and

October 1945. It was confined to employees who were "engaged in interstate commerce or the

production of goods for interstate commerce." Further, the entire public sector, agriculture, retail

establishments, local services, domestic service, and small businesses were excluded from

coverage. The constitutionality of the FLSA was upheld in 1941 by a 9-0 Supreme Court vote in

United States v. Darby.

                                                                                                  8
       Between 1945 and 1967 Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson all

supported increases in the minimum wage and expansions of coverage. The term "minimum wage"

appeared in 16 presidential State of the Union addresses between 1937 and 1967 (Complete State

of the Union Addresses). Yet, only the four FLSA amendments listed in Table 2 were enacted. The

minimum was raised six times and coverage was expanded twice. Congress was the site of the

continued struggle between liberal Democrats, including Senator Paul Douglas (1972, 374-80), a

former University of Chicago professor and president of the American Economic Association, and

an opposition composed largely southern Democrats and some but not all Republicans.

       The primary argument for the minimum wage in the Congressional Record became the

moral imperative to protect the most vulnerable workers. In 1960 John F. Kennedy (1960) called

for expanded coverage: "To pass them by ... shocks the conscience of those who care." The

emphasis on a living wage continued, as well. In 1946/1947 Congress asked the Bureau of Labor

Statistics to calculate "the dollar amount required to maintain the family at a level of adequate

living" for families of four throughout the country (Lamale and Stotz, 1959, p.1). After 1954,

the budgets began appearing in the Congressional Record (1955, p. 7871; 1961, pp. 5987-89;

1974, p. 7313) as did the much lower standard of the official poverty level in the 1970s (1974, pp.

7312-13; 1977, p. 32715). The argument that the minimum wage reduced "unfair competition"

never vanished completely but receded in importance because regional wage differences narrowed

and extensions to coverage mainly affecting the untraded sector.

       Widespread popular support for minimum wages was expressed in Gallup polls. Gallup

pollsters carefully defined the minimum wage and highlighted the group most likely to be affected

in asking the following question (with updated numbers each time). "At the present time the

minimum wage that can be paid to workers in every state in most businesses and industries is 40



                                                                                                 9
cents an hour. This means that all persons working in such businesses, in every state, including

young people who have never worked before, cannot be paid less than 40 cents an hour. Would

you approve or disapprove of raising this minimum to 60 cents an hour?" The polls showed that

between 61 and 78 percent supported increases from 40 to 65 or 75 cents before the 1950 change,

from 75 cents to $1 in 1953 or to $1.25 in 1954 and from $1 to $1.25 in 1957. The only poll without

majority support called for a raise from 40 cents to $1 in 1948. 8

        Congressional opponents therefore were careful to state that their support for the overall

objective of helping the working poor and reducing poverty but regarded minimum wages as the

wrong way to achieve it. From 1937 through 1966, the most frequently raised objections to

amendments to the FLSA concerned 1) the direct cost to employers and 2) the indirect costs created

by the administrative requirements of complying with the FLSA. Some opponents argued that

raising business's costs would reduce employment of less skilled workers, but this argument was

not central to their case until the late 1960s and early 1970s, when a growing number of academic

studies found minimum wages had employment effects.


        Faced with popular and presidential support for minimum wages, opponents were able to

delay raising the minimum but eventually had to accede. They were more successful in delaying

the expansion of coverage of the Act. Senator Douglas (1972, pp.377-78) reported disappointment

that the compromises in 1949 and 1955 traded away expansions of coverage for a higher minimum.

The 1961 amendment in Table 2 finally raised the coverage of private sector employees from 55

to 63 percent by including employees in large retail and service enterprises, local transit,

workers was set below the minimum for previously covered workers until 1965. Coverage with

lower minimum rates was expanded to 77 percent of private workers and 40 percent of government

workers with the 1966 amendments that included government employees in hospitals, nursing

homes, and schools; and also to agriculture, laundries, dry cleaners, large hotels, motels, and

restaurants (Willis 1972). The minimum rates were not equalized for all covered workers until

1978, when roughly 87 percent of private employees were covered in Table 2.

         State Minimum Wages

        The FLSA left large gaps in coverage. Roughly half of the states partially filled these gaps

by setting minimum wages, mostly for women, in industries such as retail stores, laundries, offices,

hospitals, beauty shops, hotels, recreation, and in some cases manufacturing. Most of the laws

established boards that set minimums that varied by occupation, hours of work, age, gender and

experience. Over time many of the states added men and covered more occupations. (Women's

Bureau 1950, 1958). However, domestic work, agriculture, non-profit work, and most government

occupations were left uncovered in the FLSA and many state laws until the 1960s.

        Many of the states set higher minimum rates than the FLSA for at least some workers

during several periods. In 1939, 18 states set at least one minimum higher than the 30-cent federal

minimum (Women's Bureau, 1939). In 1949, 19 states had at least one minimum wage above the

40-cent federal minimum. 9 After the federal minimum rose to 75 cents in 1950, 9 states reached it

by 1955. After the FLSA minimum rose to $1 in 1956, 14 states had at least one $1 minimum by

 Between 1942 and 1950 when the FLSA minimum was 40 cents state boards issued 77 orders; there were 3 above

1959, two years before the 1961 amendment to the FLSA established a $1 minimum for newly

covered workers. 10 However, by the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, when the federal

minimum was at its highest and the exemptions to coverage were being successively closed, the

importance of state laws declined.

          Even during the unconstitutional period from 1923-1936, the state laws were not just "dead

letters." Case studies of minimum wages in the 1910s and 1930s showed increased earnings and

declines in hours of employment, although there was an intense debate about ceteris paribus

conditions (Peterson 1958, 1960; Lester 1959). Benewitz and Weintraub (1964) found

employment effects from the 1962 New York City increase in the minimum wage to $1.50.

Campbell and Campbell (1969) found higher unemployment in cities with state minimum wage

rates. More recently, Marchingiglio and Poyker (2019) find significant effects on female

employment of women in a triple-difference analysis of state minimum wage laws using the full

censuses from 1880 through 1930.



Comparing the Minimum Wages to Living Standards

          In the January 1938 Monthly Labor Review (Stilt and Smith 1938, p. 201), the Department

of Labor described the criteria for a minimum wage. "Certain basic standards of adequacy are

generally recognized as inherent in the concept of a minimum wage based on the cost of living."

The purpose of minimum-wage legislation has been variously expressed in the laws as the

establishment of wage levels "necessary for health and welfare," or sufficient for "decent

maintenances" and "adequate living." These fairly vague standards have been benchmarked

against budgets estimated by American observers and government agencies since as early as 1870

                                                                                                 12
(Barrington and Fisher 2006, pp.2-629 to 2-647). These budgets are based on estimated needs in

categories including food, housing, clothing, medical care, transportation, and other goods and

services (see for example, Lamale and Stotz 1960, p. 789).

        A low standard for comparison is the official poverty line, which was originally based on

budget estimates by Molly Orshansky (1965) in the 1960s. We interpolated the line back to 1940

using estimates constructed by Oscar Ornati (1966) in a manner similar to Orshansky's. Figure 2

shows that the national minimum wage covered more than the poverty line cost of living in a

household with one or two people in most years and in some years for 3 people. Except for 1943

and the late 1940s, the annualized minimum wage has always been above the poverty line for an

individual under age 65. From 1939 through 1941, in 1950, and from 1956 through 1984 it was at

or above the 2-person poverty line. It exceeded the 3-person poverty line in only 15 years between

1961 and 1979, and has never exceeded the 4-person poverty line.

        All involved in the process of setting the national minimum wage realized that the cost of

living varied substantially across the country. In the original FLSA debates this led to demands

from low cost areas to allow for regional variation in the minimum rates. In June 1938 the Gallup

Organization asked "If Congress passes a minimum wage law do you think the minimum wage

per hour should be the same all over the country, or should it be different for different sections?"

and 62 percent responded that it should be different. Support for a national law rose thereafter, but

did not reach a majority in a Gallup poll in September 1948 when 46 percent replied national, 31

percent state, and 13 percent replied no law at all. 11

       Between 1939 and 1981, the BLS intermittently created a consumption bundle and priced

it for at least 30 different cities in the same year for a 4-person family with a working father, a

nonworking mother, an 8-year old girl and a 13-year old boy. The versions prior to 1946 were

based on a Works Progress Administration bundle developed for an "unskilled manual worker"

and did not reach the level "the skilled worker hoped to attain, but [afford] more than a

`minimum subsistence' living" (Margaret Loomis Stecker WPA 1937, xiii, xiv). After a

request from Congress in 1946/47 the BLS developed its own bundle to price the budgets.

The new budget covered " the dollar amount required to maintain the family at a level of

adequate living, according to prevailing standards of what is needed for health, efficiency,

the nurture of children, and for participation in social and community activities  a level of

living described as ` modest but adequate'" (Lamale and Stotz, 1959, p.1).

       Table 3 shows in each city the national minimum wage (assuming a work week 40

hours and 52 weeks worked per year) as a percentage of the adequate budget for a four-person

family that could have been purchased in 1940, 1950, 1959, and 1967. As in Figure 2, the

minimum wage fell well short of covering an adequate budget for a 4-person family. The

percentages at the median for different size families at the bottom of the table again shows

that the minimum comes closer to covering a single individual under 65. The minimum wage

ranged from 82.7 to 92.7 percent of the median for that group.

       There was substantial variation in the budgets. In 1940 in Mobile, Alabama, the lowest

cost city, had 28.5 percent more purchasing power than New York City, the highest cost city.

The distribution of purchasing power appears to have been reduced during the 1940s war

decade to a 13.9 percent gap between the lowest cost and highest cost cities. Then it rose to

21.3 percent in 1959 and 38.7 percent in 1967 (25.7 percent without Honolulu). Generally,


                                                                                                14
the minimum wage covered more of the budget in southern and midwestern cities and less in

northeastern cities in most years. The rankings, however, did not hold steady throughout. The

positions of New York and Atlanta, for example, shift substantially across the years in Table

3.



Economists and the Minimum Wage.

       American economists have debated the impact of minimum wages throughout the past 120

years. There have been multiple waves of debates that address many of the same themes, although

with different language and increasingly sophisticated empirical methods. Institutional economists

associated with the American Association of Labor Legislation (AALL) played significant roles

in arguing for the women's minimum wage during the Progressive Era. Notables John Andrews,

John R. Commons, Richard Ely, Henry Seager, and Leo Wolman drew lessons from minimum

wages set in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, where Sydney Webb (1912) and

Mathew Hammond (1915) claimed minimum wages had yielded wage increases with at worst

weak negative consequences.

       Robert Prasch (2000, 2007) identifies several themes in their arguments. The most

important were 1) Women had limited opportunities and weak bargaining power, and John Bates

Clark (1913, p. 292) suggested that they might be hired for less than their "worth as measured by

the productivity test." 2) Minimum wages would prevent women from receiving less than a living

wage that provided the "necessary comforts of life." Better health and improved attitudes would

lead to increases in productivity and avoid strikes. 3) Sidney Webb (1912) argued that the low

wage firms in "sweated trades" were "parasitic" and created conditions in which employers had to

compete against each other by driving down wages. Minimum wages would force employers to



                                                                                               15
compete by increasing productivity with new machinery and more efficient organization of labor.

This was a common theme that led large, unionized, and more productive employers to join

reformers in supporting other progressive labor legislation as well (Fishback and Kantor 1998;

Seltzer 1995).

       Economists in the marginalist tradition, including John Bates Clark (1913), Frank Taussig

(1916), A. C. Pigou (1913), and Frank Fetter (1917) warned of the negative consequences for

employment. Bates Clark (1913, p.294) summarized their reasoning:

       "What is probable, even as the result of a more modest legal increase of pay, is as

       follows: Of the lowest grade of workers some would be promoted to a higher rank

       and some would be discharged. The output of the business would be reduced."

Taussig (1916) argued against views that "parasitic" industries were a cause of low wages, instead

laying the blame for low wages more on a large supply of low-skilled women that was made larger

by immigration. Clark and Fetter seemed willing to experiment with minimum wages, but Clark

(1913, pp. 296-7) argued that it should be accompanied by emergency relief for those left

unemployed. Fetter and Taussig suggested that poverty might better be prevented through

improved education, training, and housing, and immigration restrictions.

       After the passage of the FLSA, minimum wages became the source of renewed debate.

After a decade of Depression, the discussions often assumed less than full employment and

imperfections in commodity and input markets. The arguments for the minimum wage echoed

the Progressive Era arguments with updated, more technical language: 1) Setting minimum

wages in monopsonistic labor markets would move wages closer to the marginal revenue product,

raising both wages and employment. 2) The minimum wage would improve workers' health and

productivity enough that the consequent increase in labor demand could more than offset the



                                                                                               16
negative employment effect of the higher wage. 3) Higher wages would induce inventions and

improvements in managerial efficiency that would raise labor productivity and increase the

demand for labor (Bronfenbrenner (1943). Weir Brown (1940) developed a new argument that

an economy-wide minimum wage could shift income from entrepreneurs with lower propensities

to consume to low-income workers who would spend their full incomes, leading to demand

increases for consumer goods and services that promoted more output and employment.

       Martin Bronfenbrenner (1943) and George Stigler (1946) argued against all four

arguments. Stigler (1946, p. 358) shifted the focus of the debate, claiming that everybody agreed

on the goal to eliminate extreme poverty. The important questions were 1) do minimum wages

diminish poverty? (2) Are there better alternatives?" Stigler said no to the first because the likely

result of a minimum wage would be the discharge of "workers whose services are worth less than

the minimum wage." After conceding that employment, wages, and output could be increased

when employers have wage setting power with "a skillfully set minimum wage," he was skeptical

that policy makers possessed a "tolerably accurate method" of determining the optimum wages

over time for each occupation, firm, and quality of worker. Hours worked and many other factors

made the connection between the hourly wage and family income "remote and fuzzy." Like the

earlier marginalists, Stigler believed that alternative policies would be more affective at helping

the poor and added a negative income tax like the modern EITC to the list offered by Fetter,

Taussig, and Bates Clark.

       Richard Lester (1946, 1947) castigated Stigler and other marginalist thinkers for their

inadequate understanding of the operation of labor markets and how employers made decisions.

His surveys of southern entrepreneurs showed that they focused primarily on demand changes

when choosing employment, did not think in terms of marginal analysis, and did not adjust their



                                                                                                  17
capital-labor ratios in response to North-South wage differentials. They responded to the minimum

wage shock by improving management practices and increasing sales efforts. Fewer than 10

percent mentioned reducing output. His own studies of wage determination had not found the

single wage predicted by marginalists. Instead, he found diversity in pay for equally productive

workers.

        Seeing these marked differences in predictions from economists at major universities, the

ultimate guide for policy makers would have been empirical work. At various times between 1910

and 1951 state labor departments and the U. S. Department of Labor collected data on earnings

and employment just prior to and after the adoption of a minimum wage. Most of the studies

performed by the departments reported weak or no effects of the minimum wage on employment.

John Peterson (1957) argued that many of these reports had failed to dig very deeply into the data.

In re-examining the data in a more disaggregated fashion he found support for the "hypothesis that

employment changes will be inversely related to wage increase imposed by a minimum (p.430)."12

        This led to a debate between Richard Lester and Peterson in the 1960 Industrial and Labor

Relations Review in which they criticized each other nearly line by line as they discussed several

minimum wage episodes involving low-paid workers. The debate centered on empirical issues that

are familiar to modern empirical economists. They both discussed "causal inference" and both

focused heavily on issues related to ceteris paribus conditions. As in the modern debates, they

used difference-in-difference comparisons and sometimes difference-in-difference-in-difference

comparisons to compare outcomes pre- and post- minimum wage in treatment and control areas.

Their debate over ceteris paribus conditions examined simultaneous events and prior trends. In a


12
  In a similar fashion the initial Department of Labor reports on the increase in the minimum wage to $1 showed
small employment effects, while later academic studies found larger effects (Macesich and Stewart Jr. (1960) and
Douty (1960)).


                                                                                                             18
study of the 70-cent minimum wage, Peterson mimicked a regression discontinuity design by

showing cross-tabulations before and after the minimum wage for firms in several wage categories

ascending from well below the minimum to well above prior to the increase. He also compared

covered and uncovered firms within the same town and the same industry. The problem these

studies faced was that the available data was heavily aggregated and there were not enough

observations for them to effectively control for multiple confounds with regression analysis. The

results showed negative effects on hours or employment in more than half of the comparisons.

Peterson argued that given the rough nature of the comparisons that this was enough to suggest

negative consequences for employment from the minimum wage in low wage industries, while

Lester remained unconvinced.

Epilogue

       As shown in Figure 1, the purchasing power of the national minimum wage remained near

1968 levels through the 1970s. Since 1980 it has fallen sharply. Five FLSA amendments have

raised the minimum 14 times, but the last three amendments only managed to raise the real

minimum wage back to its level in 1950 or slightly higher. The national minimum has also receded

in terms of political importance. Between 1968 and 1990, the term "minimum wage" appeared

only once in a presidential State of the Union address (by Jimmy Carter in 1981). Except for 1997,

increases in the national minimum were all passed when Democrats controlled both houses of

Congress.

        One source for the change in political outcomes was a shift in the consensus of academic

economists. After the Peterson-Lester debates, the neoclassical (Chicago) view gained the upper

hand. Most papers in the late 1960s and especially into the 1970s found negative employment




                                                                                               19

effects, particularly for the less-skilled, teens, and the disadvantaged.                 Milton Friedman became

the public face of opposition to minimum wages. In an oft-quoted 1966 Newsweek editorial,

Friedman (1966) noted that Congress had just raised the minimum wage, which would "add to the

ranks of the unemployed." He added, "I am convinced that the minimum-wage law is the most

anti-Negro law on our statute books--in its effect not its intent" (Friedman 1966). Prominent

Keynesians agreed that minimum wages had negative consequences. For example, James Tobin

wrote: "People who lack the capacity to earn a decent living need to be helped, but they will not

be helped by minimum-wage laws. ... The more likely outcome of such regulations is that the

intended beneficiaries are not employed at all." (Congressional Record, 1966, p. 11270). By the

late 1960s the view that high minimum wages reduced employment of low skilled workers featured

widely in Congressional debates. 14 In 1973 President Nixon vetoed a FLSA amendment with no

youth subminimum rate, because he believed the new minimum would harm teenage employment

(Congressional Record, 1974, p. 4706). While supporting the 1974 amendment, he cautioned

against raising it too high (Congressional record 1974 p. 4706). By the mid-1970s, minimum wage

opponents were entering the negative findings from academic studies by Adie (1973), Mincer

(1976), Gramlich et al (1976), Welch (1974), Ragan (1977), and Cotterill and Wadycki (1976) into

the Congressional Record.

         The newer studies had access to more data (e. g. longer time series since the

implementation of minimum wages) and increasingly sophisticated econometric methodology.

Researchers increasingly adopted time series techniques that used the real minimum wage or the

coverage) as the measure of the minimum. 15 A survey by Brown, Gilroy, and Kohen (1982)

reported a widely cited consensus that "time series studies typically find that a 10 per cent increase

in the minimum wage reduces teenage employment by one to three percent." They also concluded

that cross sectional studies produce smaller and less precise estimates, with "estimates from 0 to

.75 percentage points [being] most plausible". The increasing academic consensus influenced

Ronald Reagan to become the first President in office to actively oppose minimum wage increases

and no increases were enacted during his administration.

         By the 1980s and into the 1990s, these studies led to consensus among academic

economists. A 1992 survey of economists found that 57 percent agreed and 21 percent

disagreed with the statement that "a minimum wage increases unemployment among young

and unskilled workers" (reported in Whaples 1996). A survey by Robert Whaples (1996, p.

729) found that 87 percent of labor economists agreed that minimum wages increased

unemployment for teens and the unskilled. Their median estimate of the impact of a 10-

percent rise in the minimum was 2 percent, similar to the earlier consensus. 16 In the 1990s, the

debate was reignited when David Card and Alan Krueger (1994, 1995, 2000) published a series of

studies using firm-level panel data techniques and found weak to zero employment effects of the

minimum wage and David Neumark and William Wascher (2000, 2008) challenged their findings

with alternative data sources. More recent polls show much less certainty. A 2015 poll asked

leading academic economists whether increasing the minimum wage to $15 (from the current level




15
   Kennan (1995) noted that most of the primary variation in the Kaitz index did not come from the wage minimum
or coverage; therefore, using it to estimate the effect of minimum wages was akin to "looking for a needle in a
haystack".
16
   Despite these sentiments, 57 percent felt that the current minimum wage should be increased, particularly those who
estimated teen employment losses of 3 percent or more.

                                                                                                                   21
of $7.25) by 2020 would substantially reduce employment of low-skilled workers (IGM Forum,

2015). Only 26% agreed or strongly agreed, 24% disagreed, 38% were uncertain, and the

remainder did not answer. The majority who answered indicated low confidence in their answer.

       Following the sharp decline in the real value of the national minimum, the states have

returned to the fore. When a new FLSA amendment was passed in 1989, 15 states had

minimum wages above the national level. The number fell back to 4 after the national

increases in 1990 and 1991 and then rose to 32 in 2007. In 2018, 31 states had higher rates.

These rates average $2.28 above the federal minimum of $7.25, a historic high. A further 46 cities

and counties have set their own minimum rates of up to $15.00.

All data are from Carter, et. al. (2006). The Minimum wage series is Ba4422 on p. 2-284,
after adjusting the minimum to 0.40 for 1944 through 1949. The poverty series is the official
series from 1959 to 1999 (series Be96, Be99, Be101, and Be103 on p. 2-665). For period
1938 to 1958 we interpolated the national poverty series using the average of the ratio
between the U. S. poverty series above and Oscar Ornati's estimates (Be85) estimates for a 4-
person minimum subsistence budget, which is 1.126. To get different family sizes for the
period we used the 1959 poverty series to develop ratios to the 4-person family size of 0.506
for one under 65, 0.657 for two under 65, and 0.782 for the three-person family.
