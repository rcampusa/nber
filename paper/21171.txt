Kingpin Approaches to Fighting Crime and Community Violence: Evidence from Mexico's
Drug War

                                           ABSTRACT

This study considers the effects of the kingpin strategy, an approach to fighting organized crime in
which law-enforcement efforts focus on capturing the leaders of criminal organizations, on community
violence in the context of Mexico's drug war. Newly constructed historical data on drug-trafficking
organizations' areas of operation at the municipality level and monthly homicide data allow us to
control for a rich set of fixed effects and to leverage variation in the timing of kingpin captures to
estimate their effects. This analysis indicates that kingpin captures have large and sustained effects
on the homicide rate in the municipality of capture and smaller but significant effects on other
municipalities where the kingpin's organization has a presence, supporting the notion that removing
kingpins can have destabilizing effects throughout an organization that are accompanied by escalations
in violence.

1     Introduction
The two main reasons for waging war on drugs are to reduce societal costs associated with
drug abuse and to reduce societal costs associated with the drug trade. The former includes
effects on health, productivity, violent behavior, and broader impacts on health care and
public assistance programs. The latter includes violence involved with the enforcement of
contracts and turf battles, corruption, and activity in related “industries” that are detri-
mental to welfare including protection rackets, human smuggling, kidnapping, prostitution,
weapons trafficking, theft, etc.1 Naturally, the relative importance of these costs depends
on many factors, including the types of drugs involved, the level and spatial distribution of
demand, and the organization of the supply network.2 Correspondingly, there is significant
heterogeneity in the approaches that have been used to wage war on drugs. Demand-side
approaches take the form of prevention efforts, treatment for abusers, and increases in the
cost of abuse through enforcement efforts and punishment. Supply-side approaches, on the
other hand, focus on disrupting operations by way of confiscation of drugs and guns, target-
ing precursors, and arresting and punishing those involved in the drug trade. Given resource
constraints, policy-makers have to consider which of these policies to use and how intensely
to use them, highlighting the importance of understanding their costs and benefits. Towards
this end, this paper considers the effects of a particular supply-side approach that has played
a prominent role in Mexico’s drug war—the targeting of high-ranked members of criminal
organizations, also known as the “kingpin strategy”—on community violence.
    To put this study into context, it is important to note that most of the existing re-
search in this area focuses on the effects of drug-related interventions on drug abuse in
“downstream markets.” For example, researchers have shown that the Taliban stamping
out poppy production reduced heroin use in Australia (Weatherburn et al. 2003), that
the effect of Plan Colombia on the supply of Cocaine to the United States was relatively
small (Mejı́a and Restrepo 2013), that reductions in methamphetamine availability in the
   1

and an empirical analysis of drug and alcohol prohibition enforcement in the United States that supports
this view.
   2
     For example, the societal costs associated with the drug trade are most important in areas heavily
involved in the illegal production and distribution of drugs to be consumed elsewhere.



                                                    2
United States in the mid-1990s reduced drug-related harms (Cunningham and Liu 2003;
Dobkin and Nicosia 2009; Cunningham and Finlay 2013), that US state laws limiting the
availability of Pseudoephedrine have not changed methamphetamine consumption (Dobkin,
Nicosia, and Weinberg 2013) nor have graphic advertising campaigns (Anderson 2010), and
that substance-abuse treatment availability reduces mortality (Swensen 2015). In contrast,
relatively little is known about the causal effects of “upstream interventions” on “upstream
communities,” i.e., the effects of interventions on outcomes in areas where production, dis-
tribution, and their associated costs are most relevant. The two studies that speak most
directly to this specific issue are Angrist and Kugler (2008), which shows that exogenous
shocks to coca prices increase violence in rural Colombian districts as groups fight over ad-
ditional rents and Dell (2015), which shows that drug-trade crackdowns in Mexico driven by
PAN mayoral victories increase drug-trade-related homicides.3
       This paper contributes to this literature by considering the effects of the kingpin strategy,
which has featured prominently in Mexico’s war on drugs. Proponents of the kingpin strategy
argue that removing a leader weakens an organization through its effect on its connections,
its reputation, and by creating disarray in the ranks below, and that this may in turn reduce
the organization’s level of criminal activity. Detractors, however, point out that this strategy
may increase violence as lower ranked members maneuver to succeed the eliminated leader
and rival groups attempt to exploit the weakened state of the organization. Given sound
logic underlying arguments in favor of and against the kingpin strategy, there is a clear need
for empirical research on the subject. That said, there are two main empirical challenges to
estimating the effect of the kingpin strategy that are difficult to overcome. First, policies
targeting organized crime are almost always multifaceted, involving the simultaneous use of
various strategies. Mexico’s war on drugs is no exception—it also involved various approaches
implemented at various times with varying degrees of intensity, which we discuss in greater
detail in the next section. The second main challenge is that the capture of a kingpin is fairly
rare because, by definition, they are small in number. As a result, establishing compelling
evidence on the effect of eliminating kingpins in some sense requires a series of case studies.
   3
    In related work, Mejı́a and Restrepo (2013) estimate the causal effect of the drug trade on violence using
variation in the prominence of the drug-trade in Colombian municipalities based on land suitability for coca
cultivation.



                                                      3
This study attempts to overcome these challenges by exploiting variation in the timing with
which different Mexican DTOs had their leaders captured during Mexico’s drug war and by
using detailed data on the geographic distribution of DTOs over time (based on Coscia and
Rios (2012)) to form different comparison groups. This approach allows us to abstract away
from the effects of broader policies and shocks (at the national and/or state level) and to
conduct several ancillary analyses to guide our interpretation of the results.4
    We find that the capture of a DTO leader in a municipality increases its homicide rate
by 80% and that this effect persists for at least twelve months. Consistent with the notion
that the kingpin strategy causes widespread destabilization throughout an organization, we
also find significant effects on other municipalities with the same DTO presence. In partic-
ular, we find a significant short-run effect (30% 0–6 months after capture) that dissipates
over time for neighboring municipalities with the same DTO presence and an effect that is
immediately small but grows over time (18% 12+ months after capture) for more-distant mu-
nicipalities with the same DTO presence. We find little evidence of any effect on neighboring
municipalities where the captured leader’s DTO did not have a presence.
    Several additional pieces of evidence support a causal interpretation of these main results.
First, there is no indication that homicides deviate from their expected levels prior to a
kingpin’s capture, suggesting that the main results are not driven by the sorts of efforts that
might precede a capture such as the mobilization of troops into an area. We also show that
the main results are driven by effects on the individuals most likely to be directly involved
in the drug trade: males and, more specifically, working-age males. In an additional effort
to show that the main results are not simply reflecting an increase in propensities to engage
in violence that coincides with captures in the relevant municipalities, we demonstrate that
domestic violence and infant mortality do not respond to these events. Lastly, we present
    4
      Our study was conducted in parallel with Calderón et al. (forthcoming), which also considers the
effects of kingpin captures during Mexico’s war on drugs on homicides in the municipality of capture and
its neighboring municipalities. A major distinguishing feature of our study is its use of detailed data on
the geographic distribution of DTOs over time, which allows us to form different comparison groups, to
distinguish between neighbors under the same DTO influence and those not under the same DTO influence,
and to consider spillover effects of captures onto non-neighboring municipalities that are under the same
DTO influence. Calderón et al. (forthcoming) use synthetic control approaches to form comparisons and
additionally considers effects on areas of particular strategic importance. Another important difference is
that we focus solely on the first kingpin capture from each DTO, for reasons discussed in Section 4, while
Calderón et al. (forthcoming) consider all kingpin captures.

evidence that operations themselves do not increase homicides in an analysis of the first
major operations of the war on drugs.
        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we provide
background on Mexico’s drug war, including a discussion of the events that precipitated it,
and the relevant DTOs. We then discuss our data and empirical strategy in sections 3 and
4, respectively. Section 5 presents a graphical analysis, the main results, and supporting
analyses. Lastly, Section 6 discusses the results and concludes.



2         Background

2.1        Drug-trafficking in Mexico

In many ways, Mexico is ideally situated for producing and trafficking drugs. In addition
to having a climate that allows for the growth of a diverse set of drugs, it shares a border
with the world’s biggest consumer of drugs, the United States. Drug trafficking has also
been able to flourish in Mexico as a result of corruption and weak law enforcement. The first
DTOs were protected by the government, which designated the areas in which each DTO
would carry out their illegal activities. In the 1980s, former police officer Miguel Ángel Félix
Gallardo—together with Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo—founded the
first Mexican Cartel: the Guadalajara Cartel.5 After the incarceration of his partners in 1985,
Félix Gallardo kept a low profile and decided to divide up the areas in which he operated.6
According to Grayson (2014), the government and the DTOs had unwritten agreements
that “DTO leaders respected the territories of competitors and had to obtain crossing rights
before traversing their turfs...criminal organization[s] did not sell drugs in Mexico, least of
all to children...and prosecutors and judges would turn a blind eye to cooperative criminals.”
        In the 1990s, however, the environment became less stable as Guadalajara’s DTO splin-
    5
     In addition with his connections with the Mexican government, Félix Gallardo was the first Mexican
drug trafficker to make connections with Colombian cartels, particularly he established a solid relation with
Pablo Escobar (leader of the Medellı́n Cartel).
   6
     Joaquı́n Guzmán Loera and Ismael Zambada Garcı́a were given the pacific coast area, the Arellano Félix
brothers received the Tijuana corridor, the Carrillo Fuentes family got the Ciudad Juárez corridor, and Juan
Garcı́a Abrejo received the Matamoros corridor.

tered into four separate DTOs7 and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) lost political
power (Astorga and Shirk 2010). Morales (2011) describes the late 1990s and early 2000s
as a period in which the DTOs became more independent, going from a regimen of political
subordination to one of direct confrontation to dispute the control of territory. In late 2005,
a new DTO—La Familia—was established in the state of Michoacán followed by a wave of
violence.8 At the beginning of the war on drugs there were five DTOs (or alliances of DTOs),
Sinaloa/Beltrán-Leyva, Gulf, Tijuana, La Familia, and Juárez.


2.2       The War on Drugs

As shown in Panel A of Figure 1, the homicide rate in Michoacán grew dramatically between
2005 and 2006. That said, the national homicide rate continued to be extremely stable at
0.8 per 100,000 residents per month (Figure 1, Panel B). Nonetheless, eleven days after
the beginning of his term, the newly elected President Felipe Calderón declared war on the
DTOs on December 11, 2006, citing the increase in violence in Michoacán as the last straw.
While pundits highlighted his desire to have significant reform associated with his presidency
and the fact that he was born and raised in Michoacán, his stated reasons for initiating the
war was a concern “about the growth of drugs-related violence and the existence of criminal
groups trying to take over control of entire regions.”9 Calderón’s strategy mainly consisted
in a frontal attack led by members of the army, the navy, and the federal police seeking
the eradication of crops, the confiscation of drugs and guns, and the incarceration or killing
of high ranked drug traffickers (the kingpin strategy). The first operation took place in
Michoacán on December 11, 2006, where more than 5000 army and federal police elements
were deployed, and subsequent operations followed in other parts of the country.
       Mexico’s war on drugs was initially viewed as a great success. As shown in Figure 2,
plotting data from 2001 to 2010, the national homicide rate dropped sharply in January
2007. The homicide rate jumped back up to 0.72 in March—not quite to its earlier level—
   7
     After the arrest of Félix Gallardo in 1989 and his transfer to a the maximum security prison La Palma
in Mexico state, the leaders of the designated areas became independent and founded the second generation
of cartels (Sinaloa, Tijuana, Juárez, and Gulf).

and then held steady for the following 9 months. Then, at the beginning of 2008 in a clear
break from trend, the homicide rate started to climb. It would continue to climb for several
years, reaching a level 150% higher than the pre-drug-war rate at the end of 2010.
       This dramatic increase in violence in Mexico has drawn the attention of researchers from
different disciplines trying to explain its causes—most attribute this increase in violence to
Calderón’s war on drugs. Different researchers have focused on the role of the deployment
of federal troops all across the country (Escalante 2011, Merino 2011), the expiration of the
U. S. Federal Assault Weapons Ban in 2004 (Chicoine 2011, Dube et al.. 2012), the increase
of cocaine seizures in Colombia (Castillo et al. 2012, Mejı́a 2013), and the increased effort
to enforce law initiated by the National Action Party (PAN) mayors (Dell, Forthcoming).
       Our research is motivated by the observation that the escalation of violence began in
January 2008, which was the month in which the first cartel leader was captured during
the war on drugs (Alfredo Beltrán Leyva). Naturally, many other things were going on in
Mexico and around the world at the same time, necessitating a more rigorous consideration
to be able to draw any strong conclusions about the effects of Mexico’s kingpin strategy. In
order to conduct such an analysis, we make use of newly constructed data on the geographic
distribution of DTOs over time—in conjunction with several other data sets—to consider the
first captures of kingpins associated with each of the five DTOs in operation at the beginning
of the war on drugs. These data and the associated identification strategy are described in
the next sections.



3        Data
Our analysis brings together data from several sources that ultimately yields a data set at
the municipality-month level, spanning January 2001 through December 2010. Our primary
outcome variable is based on monthly homicides at the municipality level, constructed using
the universe of death certificates from the vital statistics of the National Institute of Statistics
and Geography (INEGI).10 In order to put these data into per capita rates, we use estimated
  10
    Less than one percent of death certificates with homicide as the presumed cause of death are missing
the municipality of occurrence. These observations are not used in our analysis.




                                                   7
municipality population counts from the National Council of Population (CONAPO) and El
Colegio de México (COLMEX), which are based on projections from the Census of Population
and Housing. While we note that drug-related homicides are available from December 2006
to October 2011, we do not use these data out of concern for the endogeneity of homicides
being classified as “drug related” or “not drug related.”
      Our information on kingpin captures are from a compendium of press releases of the
Army (SEDENA), the Navy (SEMAR), and the Office of the Attorney General (PGR).
While these press releases contain a wealth of additional information, we focus on the timing
of the first capture of a leader or lieutenant from each of the DTOs during the war on drugs.
To put into perspective the types of kingpins we are considering, as the name implies, leaders
are at the very highest level of the DTO. Lieutenants are immediately below leaders in the
DTO organization. As a practical matter, we classify an event as a capture of a DTO leader
when a press release indicates that the individual was a head (or one of the heads) of a DTO
and identify an event as a capture of a DTO lieutenant when a press release indicates that
the individual was a leader of a DTO in some state or region. We do not consider events
in which the press release indicates that the individual was a leader only in a particular
municipality, indicating that the individual was likely a plaza boss.
      As shown in Table 1, there is significant variation in the timing with which high-level
kingpins were captured for the five DTOs in operation at the beginning of the war on drugs.
The first took place on August 29th, 2007—eight months after the war on drugs began—
when Juan Carlos de la Cruz Reyna, a lieutenant in the Gulf Cartel was captured. The first
other four DTOs (Sinaloa-Beltrán-Leyva, Tijuana, Juárez, and La Familia) had top level
leaders captured at various times between January and December of 2008.11
      We use newly available historical data on the municipalities of operation for each DTO,
the construction of which is described in detail in Coscia and Rios (2012). Briefly, the data
was constructed using a MOGO (Making Order using Google as an Oracle) framework for
selecting the most reliable subset of web information to collect information on relationships
between sets of entities (DTOs and municipalities in this case). It uses indexed web content
(e.g., online newspapers and blogs) and various queries to identify DTOs’ areas of operation
 11
      Sinaloa and Beltrán-Leyva DTOs were allied before the drug war commenced.



                                                    8
at the municipality level between 1990 and 2010.12 To avoid concerns about endogeneity,
we define areas of operation using only data before the war on drugs began (2001-2006).
Moreover, we take a conservative approach and specify that a DTO had a presence in a
municipality if the municipality was an “area of operation” for the DTO in any of these
six years. Figure 3 maps out the distribution of the DTOs based on this definition. One
important takeaway from this figure—which we exploit in our empirical analysis—is that a
large share of Mexico has no DTO presence (or a DTO presence that is too weak or inactive
to be picked up using Coscia and Rios’ approach).



4       Empirical Strategy
While we begin our analysis of the effects of the kingpin captures homicides with a series of
graphical comparisons, our main results are based on a generalized difference-in-differences
approach. In particular, we estimate the effects of kingpin captures using the following
regression model:
                                ln Hmt = Dmt δ + αm + γt + Xmt β + umt                        (1)

where ln Hmt is the natural log of the homicide rate in municipality m at time t; Dmt is a
set of indicator variables reflecting whether a kingpin relevant to the municipality has been
captured in 0–5 months ago, 6–11 months ago, or 12+ months ago; αm are municipality
fixed effects; γt are month-by-year fixed effects; Xmt can include time-varying municipality
controls; and umt is an error term.13 As such, the estimates are identified by comparing
changes in violence among affected and non-affected municipalities using variation in the
timing with which different municipalities are affected because of their links to different
DTOs (and having no link to any DTO). This approach allows us to avoid biases that
would otherwise be introduced by fixed differences across municipalities and by the effects
of any shocks or interventions that are common across municipalities. The fact that we
have municipalities associated with different DTOs who have kingpins captured at different
times and we also have municipalities without any DTO presence allows us to additionally
 12
      Such data was previously only available to the research community at the state level.
 13
      We add one to the homicide count to avoid missing values.



                                                      9
control for the effects of the war on drugs that are common to municipalities with a DTO
presence, which we accomplish by including variables for 0–5, 6–11, and 12+ months after
the beginning of the war interacted with an indicator for the presence of a DTO in the
municipality. We can also control for additional spatial heterogeneity by including state-by-
year fixed effects in the model.
      Two main aspects of the empirical analysis that we have yet to discuss in detail are:
how to define whether a kingpin capture is “relevant to a municipality” and what sorts of
captures are considered. We define a kingpin capture as being “relevant to a municipality”
in four different ways to allow for treatment effect heterogeneity. In particular, we separately
estimate effects of a kingpin capture on the municipality of capture, neighboring municipal-
ities where the captured kingpin’s DTO had a presence, other neighboring municipalities,
and non-neighboring municipalities where the captured kingpin’s DTO had a presence. As
described in the previous section, our analysis of “kingpins” focuses DTO leaders and lieu-
tenants, i.e., those at the very top level of the organization and those who control a state or
region. We further restrict attention to the first capture of a kingpin for each DTO during
the war on drugs. We do so out of concern for the endogeneity that would be introduced
when the capture of a kingpin affects the outcome while also increasing the probability of
the capture of subsequent kingpins. By focusing instead on the effects of an initial capture,
our estimates will reflect the effect of a kingpin capture on outcomes that is inclusive of the
effects driven by subsequent captures.
      We note that standard-error estimation is not straightforward in this context. While
we are evaluating a panel of municipalities, there may be reason to cluster standard-error
estimates at some higher level(s) because different municipalities may have correlated shocks
to outcomes not captured by our model. In some sense, because the source of variation is at
the DTO level, it may be preferable to allow the errors to be correlated across municipalities
when they share the presence of the same DTO. However, with only five DTOs, this would
lead to problems associated with too few clusters. As a compromise, we instead cluster on
DTO-combinations, which leverages the fact that there are some municipalities where two
or three municipalities have a presence.14 We additionally cluster on states to allow for some
 14
      2,224 municipalities have no DTO presence, 181 have one, 43 have two, and only six have three.



                                                     10
spatial correlation in the errors that might occur naturally or through policies implemented
at the state level, following the approach to multi-way clustering described in Cameron,
Gelbach, and Miller (2011).15



5        Results

5.1       Graphical Evidence of the Effects of Kingpin Captures

Before presenting the results of the econometric analysis described above, in this section we
present graphical evidence. To begin, Figure 4 plots the homicide rate over time separately
for counties with a DTO presence before the war on drugs and those that did not have such
a presence. This figure shows that municipalities with a DTO presence had higher—but not
much higher—homicide rates than municipalities without a DTO presence in the six years
leading up to the war on drugs. Moreover, they tracked one another quite closely. Perhaps
most importantly, they even tracked one another after the beginning of the war on drugs—
both dipping immediately before returning to close to their earlier levels—which provides
support for using municipalities without a DTO presence as a meaningful comparison group
for the purpose of attempting to separate the effects of kingpin captures from the effects
of other aspects of the war on drugs. Twelve months after the beginning of the war on
drugs, however, the two series began to diverge from one another in a dramatic way. While
the capture of Alfredo Beltrán Leyva, leader of the Beltrán Leyva Cartel, would appear to
be the most salient event to happen around this time that would disproportionately affect
municipalities with a DTO presence, we cannot rule out other explanations such as a lagged
effect of earlier aspects of the war on drugs. One explanation that we can rule out is that the
war on drugs did not begin in earnest until this time—several major operations took place
in 2007 which lead to the seizure of 48,042 Kg of cocaine, 2,213,427 Kg of marijuana, and
317 Kg of heroin, significantly more than the amounts seized in the subsequent years.16
       Across the five panels of Figure 5, we take a more systematic look at how homicide rates
  15
     This approach leads to somewhat more conservative standard-error estimates than clustering only on
states, only on DTO combinations, or only on municipalities.

changed over time in municipalities with a DTO presence relative to those without in relation
to kingpin captures. In panels A and B, we plot time series that focus on municipalities with
the presence of DTOs whose first captured “kingpin” was a leader at the highest level of the
organization. In particular, in Panel A we plot the homicide rate over time for municipalities
where Sinaloa or Beltrán Leyva (allies) had a presence prior to the war on drugs in addition to
the homicide rate for municipalities with no DTO presence for comparison. Consistent with
Figure 4, this figure shows that the two series tracked one another closely until the beginning
of 2008 when the first kingpin from either Sinaloa or Beltrán Leyva was captured (Alfredo
Beltrán Leyva). In Panel B we present similar plots but instead focus on municipalities
where the Tijuana Cartel had a presence prior to the war on drugs, highlighting the point
in time when it first had a leader captured in October of 2008. This plot is qualitatively
similar to the one shown in Panel A in that the homicide rate in municipalities where the
Tijuana Cartel had a presence and municipalities with no DTO presence track one another
closely in the years preceding the war on drugs and after the start of the war on drugs until
the Tijuana Cartel had a leader captured.
   In panels C through E we plot similar figures for the first kingpins captured during the
war on drugs for the other three DTOs, noting that these kingpins were lieutenants in control
of large regions as opposed to heads of the organizations. In all three panels we see homicide
rates rise in municipalities with the DTO presence relative to municipalities with no DTO
presence following the relevant kingpin’s capture. That said, municipalities with a Gulf
Cartel presence did not see an immediate rise in their homicide rates after the capture of
Juan Carlos de la Cruz Reyna (a lieutenant in the organization responsible for operations in
the southern part of Tamaulipas and the northern part of Veracruz )—their homicide rates
did not rise until approximately a half of a year later. In contrast, the homicide rates rose
immediately—and have subsequently continued to rise—in municipalities where the Juárez
Cartel had a presence after Pedro Sánchez Arras (a lieutenant in the organization responsible
for operations in the northern part of Chihuahua) was captured in May of 2008. The time
series for municipalities where La Familia Cartel had a presence also shows an uptick in
homicides after the first capture of one of its kingpins during the war on drugs (Alberto
Espinoza Barrón, the lieutenant responsible for the collection of narcotics from the Port of


                                              12
Lázaro Cárdenas). This uptick appears to have not been sustained though it is not clear due
to a large degree of volatility in the homicide rate in the region.
       As a whole, the evidence shown in Figure 5 supports the notion that kingpin captures
escalate violence. That said, the regression-based analysis presented in the next section
can address some outstanding concerns about omitted variables through the inclusion of
control variables in addition to considering heterogeneous effects across different types of
municipalities.


5.2       Regression-based Evidence of the Effects of Kingpin Captures

Columns 1 through 3 of Table 2 present our main results, based on the generalized difference-
in-differences model represented by Equation 1. In particular, these columns show the es-
timated effects of a kingpin capture over time for a municipality of capture, municipalities
where a captured kingpin’s DTO had a presence that do not neighbor the municipality of
capture, neighboring municipalities where a captured kingpin’s DTO had a presence, and
other municipalities neighboring the municipality of capture. The estimates are based on
models that control for municipality fixed effects and month-by-year fixed effects. Column
2 additionally controls for state-by-year fixed effects to address concerns that captures may
be correlated with other state-level policy initiatives and/or shocks while Column 3 further
adds controls for the effects of the war on drugs that are common to municipalities with a
DTO presence by including variables for 0–5, 6–11, and 12+ months after the beginning of
the war interacted with an indicator for the presence of a DTO in the municipality.
       Across these columns, we note that the estimates are somewhat sensitive to the inclusion
of state-by-year fixed effects but not to the inclusion of controls for the effects of the war
on drugs that are common to municipalities with a DTO presence. Regardless of the exact
specification, the estimates indicate significant effects and considerable heterogeneity. In
particular, the estimates reflect an immediate and sustained effect of a kingpin capture on
the homicide rate in the municipality of capture of approximately 60–80%.17 Consistent
with the notion that the kingpin strategy causes widespread destabilization throughout an
  17
    As the outcome is the log of the homicide rate, the percent effects are calculated by exponentiating the
coefficient estimate—in this case 0.48 and 0.58—and subtracting one.



                                                    13
organization, our preferred estimates (Column 3) suggest significant short-run effects on
homicide rates in municipalities where the captured kingpin’s DTO had a presence that
neighbored the municipality of capture: 28% 0–5 months after the capture and 17% 6–11
months after capture. These estimates are relatively imprecise due to the limited number of
municipalities contributing to the estimates, and they are only statistically significant at the
10-percent level. In contrast, the estimated effects on non-neighboring municipalities where
the captured kingpin’s DTO had a presence are relatively precise, indicating a significant
effect in the short-run (7% 0–5 months following a capture) that appears to grow over
time (9% 6–11 months following a capture and 18% 12+ months following a capture). The
estimated effects on municipalities neighboring the municipality of a kingpin capture who do
not share the same DTO presence are routinely negative, suggesting that kingpin captures
may lead to a spatial displacement of violence; however, these estimates tend to not be
statistically significant.
       Columns 4 and 5 of Table 2 assess the validity of the research design by considering
whether homicide rates deviate from their expected levels prior to a kingpin capture in any
of these types of municipalities. These estimates are routinely close to zero and are never
statistically significant, which provides support for a causal interpretation of the estimates
discussed above.


5.3       Further Analyses Supporting a Causal Interpretation of the
          Main Results

Similar to our analysis verifying that there are no “effects” before a kingpin capture occurs,
which would otherwise suggest that our regression model is picking up something other than
the effects of kingpin captures, in Table 3 we separately consider the estimated effects on
male homicide rates, female homicide rates, rates of domestic violence, and infant mortality
using our preferred model.18 These estimates provide further support for a causal interpre-
tation of our main results: they indicate that the effects are larger for males than females,
  18
    Domestic violence data comes from administrative records of individuals arrested for the crime of do-
mestic violence from Estadśticas Judiciales en Material Penal de INEGI. Infant mortality data is based on
the same source as the homicide data described above.




                                                   14
which is consistent with gender differences in participation in the drug trade; no effects on
domestic violence, which provides reassuring evidence that the main results are not driven
by idiosyncratic shocks to levels of violence coinciding with kingpin captures; and no effects
on infant mortality, which provides reassuring evidence that the main results are not driven
by compositional changes towards a higher-risk population in the affected municipalities.
       Table 4 presents evidence along similar lines, considering effects on homicide rates for
males of different age groups. These estimates indicate that the effects on males are driven
by those between the ages of 15 and 59, mirroring participation rates in drug trafficking
(Fairlie 2002, Vilalta and Martı́nez 2012). Moreover, the estimated effects on homicides
rates for younger and older males tend to be close to zero and are not statistically significant
any more than we would expect by random chance.
       Though our main results are able to control for national and state-level policies and
shocks common across areas in addition those common to municipalities with a DTO presence
through the inclusion of fixed effects, a potential concern with the empirical strategy is that
it might conflate the effects of kingpin captures with the effects of military operations more
broadly. In order to speak to this possibility, Figure 6 considers each of the nine major state
(or multi-state) operations of the war on drugs in the timeframe spanned by our data.19
In particular, each panel restricts attention to the state(s) of the operation and separately
plots the homicide rate for municipalities with and without a DTO presence. Collectively,
these nine panels indicate that the major operations of the drug war did not precipitate
increases in homicides. The one panel (h) that does show a major uptick in homicides at
the beginning of the operation is one in which a kingpin was captured soon after its start20
and the location of the next phase of Sierra Madre operation.21
       Figure 7 also focuses on homicide rates as they relate to major operations of the war on
drugs but instead considers municipality-level operations. Notably, all municipalities that
were the target of an operation, saw dramatic rises in their homicide rates. That said, as
  19
     The beginning dates for these operations are based on information from the fifth Calderóns Government
Report (Quinto Informe de Gobierno, 2011). End dates are not specified except for Sierra Madre, Marlı́n,
and Culiacán operations.
  20
     Pedro Sánchez Arras, lieutenant in the Juárez Cartel, captured approximately six weeks after the Chi-
huahua Operation began.
  21
     Sierra Madre operation was launched on January 7, 2007 in the states of Chihuahua, Durango, and
Sinaloa.


                                                    15
with the state level operations, there appears to be no consistent link between operations
of the war on drugs and these rises—some of these municipalities saw their homicide rates
begin to rise before an operation, some after, and some at around the same time.
    Table 5 offers an additional check on the main results by considering the sensitivity of the
estimates to the exclusion of considering any given DTO. In particular, across the columns
of the table we report results systematically excluding from the analysis municipalities where
the Sinaloa-Beltrán-Leyva cartels have a presence (Column 2), where the Tijuana Cartel has
a presence (Column 3), where the Gulf Cartel has a presence (Column 4), where the Juárez
Cartel has a presence (Column 5), and where the Familia Cartel has a presence (Column 6),
respectively. This analysis is motivated by the notion that we should be less confident in the
results if they are driven by any one particular kingpin’s capture. The estimates are most
sensitive to the exclusion of municipalities where the Sinaloa-Beltrán-Leyva and Gulf cartels
have a presence, which span the most municipalities and the municipalities with the largest
populations (as shown in Table 1). That said, the estimates guide us to the same conclusion
regardless of whether any one DTO is not considered in the analysis—kingpin captures have
large and immediate effects on the municipality of capture that are quite persistent; there are
spillover effects onto other municipalities where the captured kingpin’s DTO has a presence;
and there are perhaps some effects on neighboring municipalities where the kingpin’s DTO
does not have a presence.



6     Discussion and Conclusion
In the preceding sections, we have estimated the effects of the first kingpin captures during
Mexico’s war on drugs for the DTOs that were in operation prior to the war. Newly available
data on DTOs’ areas of operation at the municipality level over time and monthly data on
homicides allow us to control for a rich set of fixed effects and to leverage variation in the
timing of kingpin captures to consider the effects on homicides in the area of capture itself in
addition to other areas where the kingpin’s DTO has a presence. The results of this analysis
indicate that kingpin captures have large and sustained effects on the homicide rate in the
municipality of capture and smaller but significant effects on other municipalities where the


                                              16
kingpin’s DTO has a presence, supporting the notion that the kingpin strategy can have
destabilizing effects throughout an organization while highlighting that this does not imply
a reduction in violence. Spillover effects onto municipalities neighboring the municipality
of capture appear to be small and, if anything, positive (as they suggest a reduction in
homicides).
       These estimates offer a new lens through which we can view the dramatic increase in
violence in Mexico since the beginning of the war on drugs. In particular, our estimates
suggest that the kingpin captures we consider lead to an additional 11,626 homicides since
2007, or approximately 17 percent of the homicides since that time. Moreover, the effects
of these kingpin captures can explain 36 percent of the 130 percent increase in the homi-
cide rate (or approximately a quarter) between 2006 and 2010.22 An important caveat to
these figures is that we use an imperfect measure of DTOs’ areas of operation (based on the
MOGO approach described above) and that misclassification would serve to bias our esti-
mates towards zero—as such, they may be best thought of as estimates of the lower bound
of the true effects.
       While our estimates indicate that Mexico’s use of the kingpin strategy caused significant
increases homicides, it is important to note that its war on drugs had several objectives
beyond reducing violence, including the establishing the rule of law, that need to be consid-
ered in evaluating the policy. Moreover, it remains possible that the kingpin strategy could
reduce violence in the long-run in ways that have yet to be seen.




  22
    These numbers were calculated using the regression coefficients from Column 3 of Table 2. In particular,
they are based on the municipalities affected by the capture of a kingpin, multiplying its homicide rate prior
to the capture by the relevant coefficient estimate for each year and adjusting for the change in its population.
These calculations indicate that the capture of kingpins caused an increase in homicides of approximately
600 in 2007, 3,000 in 2008, 3,900 in 2009 and 4100 in 2010.

Notes: Each panel shows the homicide rates in the state(s) corresponding to the operation, with separate
lines for municipalities with a DTO presence and municipalities without a DTO presence. The shaded region
begins when the operation began and ends when the operation ended (where known). Municipalities with
and without a DTO presence prior to the war on drugs are shown in Figure 3. Homicide rates are calculated
based on the universe of death certificates from the vital statistics of the National Institute of Statistics and
Geography (INEGI) and population counts from the National Council of Population (CONAPO) and El
Colegio de México (COLMEX).

Notes: Each panel shows the homicide rates in the municipality corresponding to the operation. The shaded
region begins when the operation began and ends when the operation ended (where known). Municipalities
with and without a DTO presence prior to the war on drugs are shown in Figure 3. Homicide rates are calcu-
lated based on the universe of death certificates from the vital statistics of the National Institute of Statistics
and Geography (INEGI) and population counts from the National Council of Population (CONAPO) and
El Colegio de México (COLMEX).

Notes: All estimates include month-by-year fixed effects and municipality fixed effects. The additional
controls for columns 3–5 are indicator variables for 0–5, 6–11, and 12+ months after the beginning of the war
for municipalities with DTO presence. Standard-error estimates in parentheses are two-way clustered at the
state and DTO-combination levels. Homicide rates are calculated based on the universe of death certificates
from the vital statistics of the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) and population counts
from the National Council of Population (CONAPO) and El Colegio de México (COLMEX). Areas of DTO
operation for each DTO are based on Coscia and Rios (2012) as described in the text.
