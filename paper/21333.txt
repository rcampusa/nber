                                            ABSTRACT

Recent work has supported that there is a connection between the level of domestic debt level and
sovereign default on external debt. We examine the potential linkages in a case study of Venezuela
from 1984 to 2013. This unique example encompasses multiple financial crises, cycles of liberalization
and policy reversals, and alternative exchange rate arrangements. This experience reveals a nexus
among domestic debt, financial repression, and external vulnerability. Unlike foreign currency-
denominated debt, debt in domestic currency may be reduced through financial repression, a tax on
bondholders and savers producing negative real interest rates. Using a variety of methodologies, we
estimate the magnitude of the tax from financial repression. On average, this financial repression
tax (as a share of GDP) is similar to those of OECD economies, in spite of the much higher domestic
debt-to-GDP ratios in the latter. However, the financial repression “tax rate” is significantly higher
in years of exchange controls and legislated interest rate ceilings. In line with earlier literature on
capital controls, our comprehensive measures of capital flight document a link between domestic
disequilibrium and a weakening of the net foreign asset position via private capital flight. We suggest
these findings are not unique to the Venezuelan case.

         The literature on sovereign default has identified the widespread prevalence of “debt

intolerance” when developing nations experience serious debt servicing difficulties, even to the

point of default, at external debt-to-GDP ratios that are substantially below the levels routinely

recorded for advanced economies.1 Reinhart and Rogoff (2009 and 2011) posit that the omission

or underestimation of domestic liabilities in debt-sustainability calculations helps explain

sovereign external default and restructurings at “seemingly low” levels of external debt.2 The

problem is that time series on domestic-currency liabilities (public or private) are hard to come by

and, until recently, the theoretical literature on domestic debt was comparatively sparse.3 As a

consequence, the connection between domestic debt burdens, financial crises, and external

sovereign defaults remains understudied. In this paper, we investigate some of these links for the

case of Venezuela from 1984-2013.

         The Venezuelan experience is unique because it encompasses multiple financial crises,

debt restructuring, cycles of financial and capital account liberalization and policy reversals,

alternative exchange rate arrangements and booms and busts in the country’s terms of trade in a

thirty-year span. We offer an encompassing view of external vulnerability beyond sovereign

a broad array of emerging markets and Bannister and Barrot (2011) for further applications.
2
  Besides the presence of “hidden” domestic liabilities, there are other explanations for the debt intolerance
phenomenon. Reinhart, Rogoff, and Savastano (2003) emphasize the role of reputation and a history of serial default
(countries with a recurring history of adverse credit events cannot digest even what are widely considered as
moderate levels of external debt). Catão and Kapur (2006) highlight the role played by macroeconomic volatility in
explaining debt intolerance. While volatility increases the need for international borrowing to help smooth domestic
consumption, the ability to borrow is constrained by the higher default risk that volatility engenders. Kraay and
Nehru (2006) emphasize the role of institutions while Mendoza and Oviedo (2006) argue that the volatility of
revenues makes continuous debt servicing more challenging.

  Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) provided long dated time series on domestic and external public debt; Abbas et.al
(2010) and Barrot (2015) have recently expanded this line of research. Also, recent theoretical work has begun to
focus on the nexus between domestic debt, sovereign default and, in some instances, inflation (see for instance,
Aguiar, 2013, et.al. D’Erasmo and Mendoza, 2013, and Hur, Kondo and Perri, 2013)

default or restructuring that takes into account the private sector as reflected in capital flight (or

repatriation).

         In the event, financial repression accounts for public revenues similar to those of OECD

economies, in spite of the latter having much higher domestic debt-to-GDP ratios. This owes to

the fact that the financial repression “tax rate” is consistently higher than in advanced

economies.4 Furthermore, the financial repression tax rate is higher still in years of exchange

controls and legislated interest rate ceilings. In line with an earlier literature on capital controls,

our comprehensive measures of capital flight document a link between domestic disequilibrium

and a weakening of the net foreign asset position via private capital flight. These results matter

because, in our view, they are not unique to Venezuela.

         The paper proceeds as follows. Section II describes economic and financial developments

in Venezuela to provide a quantitative narrative of the evolution of domestic and external debt,

while sketching the current system of multiple exchange rates and widespread capital controls. In

Section III, we analyze the mechanisms of financial repression used by the government to default

on or tax the holders of domestic debt obligations (the haircut). The parallels with negotiated

haircuts on external debt, as extensively documented in Cruces and Trebesch (2013), are

discussed. We next describe variations of two different basic methodologies proposed in the

literature to estimate the financial repression tax. The first of these approaches follows Reinhart

and Sbrancia (2011 and 2015) and decomposes the ex-post real returns on domestic debt into the

unexpected inflation and ex-ante financial repression components. The second approach

measures the financial repression tax (or haircut) by comparing the “market-determined” yield on

foreign debt with ex-ante and ex-post returns on domestic financial instruments, as in Giovanini

 Reinhart and Sbrancia (2015) arrive at a similar conclusion for inflation-prone Argentina but not for India or South
Africa, the other two developing countries in their predominantly advanced-economy sample.

and De Melo, (1993).5 Section IV presents the estimates for the Venezuela case. While financial

repression helps to “liquidate” the existing stock of domestic debt, we also show that it tends to

accelerate leakages on the capital account in the form of capital flight (the topic of Section V),

weakening the net foreign asset position. We complement the traditional measure of capital flight

with an estimate of the over-invoicing of imports, which accelerates markedly in periods of

exchange controls. The final section discusses to what extent the results are representative of a

broader experience.



                II. Economic Setting: Debt, Exchange Rates, and Capital Mobility

        Despite soaring oil prices from 2006 to 2013, net consolidated external debt of Venezuela

rose from US $26.9 to US $104.3 billion. The central government, however, only accounted for

roughly a fifth of that increment. The difference, US $60.9 billion (78%), owed to standard

practices of the Bolivarian revolution, and was issued by state owned enterprises and the

relatively new Fondo Comun China-Venezuela (FCCV). The FCCV is a special-purpose vehicle

that allows Venezuela to withdraw from a rolling line of credit at the Chinese Development Bank

in exchange for future shipments of oil. 6

        Domestic debt in local currency also climbed, rising from 36.298 million bolivares (VEF)

in 2006 to 420.502 million in 2013.7 The nominal increase of 1,060% (an average annual rate of

42%) was partially offset by an accumulated price increase of 528% (or an average annual rate of

30%), reducing the cumulative increase in real domestic debt to about 85% (or 9% per annum).



5
  Other measures of the financial repression tax have been suggested by Easterly (1989) and Easterly and Schmidt
Hebbel, (1994); see also background material to Reinhart and Sbrancia (2015) for a discussion of this literature.
6
  The latter escapes the scrutiny of the National Assembly, is shielded from any formal mechanism of accountability
and not included in the official external debt statistics, as reported by the World Bank.
7
  VEF refers to the new currency unit introduced by the Venezuelan Central Bank on January 1st, 2008 (bolivar
fuerte or strong bolivar), equivalent to 1,000 bolivares.

                                                         4
During much of this period, the combination of exchange controls and interest ceilings created a

captive domestic audience for domestic government debt despite markedly negative real ex post

interest rates. The significant losses imposed on domestic bondholders escalated over time, owing

to accelerating inflation.

           The existence of multiple exchange rates over prolonged periods of time makes it difficult

to estimate precise debt burdens. For instance, during 2013, the average parallel exchange rate

premium peaked at 478%, while debt-to-GDP ratios calculated at market rates were about 3.9

times higher than those calculated on the basis of the official rate. Total public debt, calculated at

a moderate 40% of GDP on the basis of the official rate (Figure 1), is transformed to a public

debt burden of about 150% of GDP in parallel market rates are used to convert the existing stock

of external debt (Figure 2). As Venezuela has undergone three extended periods of exchange

controls spanning over 18 of the previous 28 years, we can revisit previous episodes to roughly

assess where debt-to-GDP ratios stabilized once the exchange rate was unified.8

           In 1988, the debt-to-GDP ratio at the parallel market rate was approximately double the

comparable calculation based on the official exchange rate (100.3% vs. 58.1%). Once the system

of financial controls was dismantled, in the process of economic reform of 1989 (El Gran

Viraje), debt-to-GDP ratios stabilized around (68.2%), closer to the estimate calculated using the

official exchange rate pre-liberalization. Figure 3, which traces the evolution of external debt

evaluated at both official and parallel rates, illustrates this point. Of course, these developments

unfolded during a period when the economic outlook for the region was on the mend, as the debt

crisis that engulfed Latin America during most of the 1980s was coming to a closure culminating

with the Brady Plan debt restructuring agreements at the beginning of the 1990s.9 A similar post-

                Table 1 summarizes the drivers behind the fall on foreign debt-to-GDP ratio calculated at

the parallel exchange rate. In 1989, foreign debt-to-GDP ratios fell 31.7 percentage points (from

100.3% to 68.2%), mostly driven by a spike in inflation (84.5%), which was well above the

depreciation registered in the average parallel market rate (15.6%). In 1996, the picture looks

somewhat different. Foreign debt-to-GDP ratios fell by 24.5 percentage points (from 60.5% to

45.7%), driven primarily by a net amortization of foreign debt (9.8%), and an inflation rate

(99.9%) that was somewhat larger than the depreciation registered in the average parallel

exchange rate (79.9%).

            These stylized facts seem to suggest that prices during the period of controls respond to

something close to an average between the official and parallel exchange rates.10 As exchange

rate controls have been accompanied with price controls, the price level embedded in the nominal

GDP does not fully reflect the marginal (parallel) exchange rate. Surely, there is a great deal of

uncertainty on the part domestic importers and producers about the rate at which they will be able

to get the next allotment of foreign currency, but that uncertainty cannot always be transferred to

prices, either because of the existence of price controls, “maximum profit margins,” or demand-

driven considerations.

            In such circumstances, debt-to-GDP ratios calculated at parallel market rates are an upper

bound, as the average marginal exchange rate is used to convert foreign debt into domestic

currency (or alternatively, nominal GDP and domestic debt into foreign currency), but nominal

GDP has not yet incorporated the full price effects implicit on that rate. Once the unification

takes place, often coupled with elimination of price ceilings, inflation takes off and nominal GDP

jumps, stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio at a level much closer to the one previously calculated at

the official exchange rate. Thus, it all depends on the share of economic activity connected to the


10Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) examine this issue for 153 countries over 1946-1998 for which they have monthly
parallel exchange market data. They conclude the parallel rate is a better predictor of future inflation but also note in
the background material that based on their estimates of the over-invoicing of imports and under-invoicing of exports
there is considerable cross-country variation

                                                                       9
official rate. For example, according to Barclays (2014), in 2013 the average exchange rate was

16.0 VEF per dollar, which is somewhere in between the official rates (6.3 and 11.4) and the

average parallel market rate (35.0). At that rate, total debt-to-GDP is 78%, which is closer to the

lower bound at the official rate (40%) than to the upper bound estimated at the average parallel

market rate (154.3%).



              III. Measuring the Financial Repression Tax: Conceptual Approaches

         Financial repression imposes a tax or haircut on domestic debt.11 The haircut is a default,

but de facto rather than de jure, as the terms of the underlying debt contracts are not violated.

The tax is enforced through the combination of exchange controls creating a captive audience for

the domestic public sector debt and inflation running above nominal interest rate ceilings. As a

result, negative ex-post real interest rates are an imposed loss on domestic bondholders—hence,

the analogy to the haircuts on external debt that arise in the context of restructuring agreements.12

Unlike the settlement process of external debts, however, creditors have little or no say in the

magnitude of the haircut. Since domestic banks and pension funds are the usual buyers of the

government debt, these losses are transferred to depositors in the form of even lower negative

real interest rates on deposits, which operate as an effective tax on savings. Unfunded liabilities

in the pension system can quickly accumulate if the haircut is significant and there is little or no

scope to make up for these losses by holding alternative assets, as purchases of foreign assets are

often curtailed or prohibited altogether.

         In what follows, we use two different approaches to assess the magnitude of the financial

repression tax. The first of these is a modified version of Reinhart and Sbrancia (2015), which

11
   Usually refers to the fact that the interest rate ceilings that usually accompany financial repression need not a priori
be binding.

   See Cruces and Trebesch (2013).

introduced a theoretical differentiation between the effects of unexpected inflation and those of

ex-ante financial repression; i.e. domestic nominal interest rates below expected inflation.

         The second approach is based on Giovanini and De Melo (1993), who compare “effective

interest rates” on external debt to the potentially repressed “effective interest rates on domestic

debt.” This is a natural exercise for emerging markets (the focus of their analysis) for the period

that they consider (1974-1987), as emerging market governments funded themselves through

both domestic and external borrowing (in varying degrees), as documented by Reinhart and

Rogoff (2011). The market-determined interest rate on external debt is a logical benchmark

under such circumstances. However, as noted by Reinhart and Sbrancia (2015), there are two

compelling reasons why this approach is neither feasible nor desirable for broader application.

First, most emerging markets had little or no external debt during the heyday of the financial

repression era during Bretton Woods (1945-1973); the depression of the 1930s and the

subsequent world war had all but eradicated global debt markets. Second, some countries (such

as the United States and the Netherlands) do not have and have not had external debt.13 All

government debts are issued under domestic law and in the domestic currency, irrespective of

whether the holders of the debt are domestic pension funds or foreign central banks.

Unexpected inflation, ex-ante financial repression and seigniorage

         Modifying Reinhart and Sbrancia (2015), we introduce foreign debt (in addition to

domestic debt) into the government’s budget constraint.14 The approach departs from the

components are the primary fiscal balance                      , real interest rate payments on domestic debt

in the absence of financial repression                  , real interest payments on foreign debt in

and its corresponding inflation tax are applied to holdings of high-powered money, while the tax

base for financial repression are holdings of government bonds. Moreover, inflation is not a

prerequisite for financial repression nor are interest rate ceilings required to impose inflationary

taxes. That is not to say there are no complementarities between financial repression and inflation

taxes. Indeed, given interest rate ceilings and within certain non-hyperinflationary limits, both

sources of financing are positively related to the rate of inflation. However, from a conceptual

standpoint, it is important to differentiate between these components: As financial liberalization

takes place, inflation-tax need not disappear while will most likely hold while fiscal financing

from financial repression vanish and the market interest rates and the interest rates on

government debt converge.

          As also stressed in Reinhart and Sbrancia (2015), it is important to distinguish between

the effects of inflation surprises and ex-ante financial repression. The former results from agents’

failure to forecast inflation accurately while the latter responds to expected financial repression



                                                        13
effects, (i.e. even if economic agents are able to forecast inflation accurately, interest-rate ceilings

below expected inflation still force real losses on their holdings of domestic bonds).15

         The modification to Reinhart and Sbrancia (2015) allows us to examine the intersection

between domestic debt, financial repression, and external developments. First, it connects the

failure to refinance foreign debt with the need to resort either to financial repression or

seigniorage (for a given level of government spending and taxes). Second, it incorporates the

effects of a real depreciation as a financing mechanism, which usually translate into higher real

money balances (printing more domestic currency in exchange for unit of dollar exports). Lastly,

if government tax revenues are linked to the stock of international reserves, it becomes evident

that capital flight (which is associated with a lower level of international reserves than otherwise

would prevail) would, other things equal, produce larger financing needs. These needs, to the

extent that they are not compensated by other forms of explicit taxation (consumption, income,

etc), leads to a greater reliance on the financial repression or inflationary taxes.




15
   It may be also the case that in periods of financial repression the government may have a higher potential to
“surprise” via unexpected inflation. This owes to the fact that prices do not fully adjust to supply and demand forces,
but rather (at least partially) follow controlled “official price lists” that are adjusted sporadically.

                                                          14
Domestic and foreign cost of borrowing

        The second approach to measure financial repression is based on the difference between

the domestic and foreign cost of borrowing (as in Giovanini and de Melo, 1991). Foreign yields

reflect free-market risk perception. Assuming that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect

substitutes, we can estimate the fiscal effects of financial repression by calculating domestic debt

service at yields demanded by international market on foreign bonds. Of course, this approach

assumes that there are no transaction costs, no risk differentials between domestic and foreign

bonds, and that taxes levied on domestic and foreign debt instruments are similar.



                 IV. Measuring the financial repression tax: The Venezuelan case

        In this section we present empirical estimates of the financial repression tax for Venezuela

over 1980s through 2013 along the lines described in Section III.

Unexpected inflation, ex-ante financial repression and seigniorage: Estimates

        We reconstructed the right hand side of equation (2) for Venezuela for 1984 to 2013.

Given the large changes observed from year to year in the stock of domestic debt, and the fact

that the maturities of these instruments are rather short, we have used the average stock of

domestic debt as the basis for these calculations.16 In order to pin down the first and second

components of the right hand side of the equation, we relied on two assumptions. The first relates

to the construction of a time series for expected inflation, while the second one is a conjecture

about the nominal interest rate that would have prevailed in the domestic market in the absence of

financial repression.




16
  Reinhart and Sbrancia (2011 and 2015) calculated the effective interest rate as a weighted average based on the
actual year-by-year composition of the debt.

                                                        15
         Given the lack of survey data on expected inflation for most of the period in question, we

modeled expected inflation using a “naïve” random walk inflation forecast.17

         No less challenging than constructing a time series for inflation expectations is the

question of the “free-market counterfactual.” In order to proxy the largely unobserved free-

market nominal domestic interest rates over 1984-2013, we separated the years of financial

repression (20 out of 30) from those where free-market conditions prevailed (10). To arrive at

these groupings, every year that begun with price, interest rate and exchange controls is

considered among the former, including the two years where significant reform programs aimed

at liberalizing the economy were introduced. The reason to believe this is a plausible strategy as

in both El Gran Viraje (1989) and the Agenda Venezuela (1996) policy packages caught the

general public largely by surprise, resulting (ex-post) in significant “haircuts” on bond holders

and fiscal savings derived from unexpected inflation and financial repression.

         Over the ten years of comparatively free financial market conditions (1990-1993 and

1997-2002), average nominal interest rates on domestic government bonds were 1.10 times the

inflation rate on average, in contrast with 0.71 on the twenty years of financial repression. As a

very rough approximation, we assume that during the financial repression years, nominal interest

rates on domestic bonds would have yield 1.10 times the rate of inflation.18 The resulting

estimates can be treated as a lower-bound estimate for the financial repression tax, given that

controls are typically imposed on years of economic instability (with the attendant expropriation

risk), where it is plausible to expect that a higher premium over inflation would have been

demanded by domestic bondholders.
17
   We have also estimated expected inflation using an ARIMA model for the period 1957-2013. We have report the
“naïve” random walk forecast because a) the Venezuelan economy has gone through large structural changes over
these fifty-six years, and therefore parameter instability might be a relevant source of bias, and b) results do not vary
significantly, except for the inflation surprise component (Appendix II replicates Table II using ARIMA forecasts).
18
   In terms of real ex-post interest rates, these ratios imply a real rate very close to zero during the financial
liberalization spells and a real rate average of -8.6% during the financial repression eras.

                                                           16
         The results of this exercise are reported in Table 2, where financial repression years are

shaded. At an aggregate level, it is noteworthy that unidentified financial needs (the right-hand

side of equation 2) averaged 5.1% of GDP over the thirty-years studied. Periods of financial

repression and price controls exhibit significantly higher unidentified financing needs (6.3%)

than otherwise (2.8%). Fiscal savings derived from inflation surprises (0.5% of GDP) were

positive and significantly higher than those registered in free-market years (-0.5%), indicating

that governments had more capacity to surprise economic agents in periods of financial

repression. Ex-ante financial repression contributed 1.3% of GDP in years of financial repression,

significantly higher than the -0.03% registered for free-market years. These estimates support the

basic intuition that no one would buy government debt at an anticipated negative yield unless

they were forced to do so.19 Liquidation years, defined as years where real average yield on

government bonds is negative, somewhat overlap with financial repression, but are not unheard

of during free market periods. 20

         The sheer size of fiscal revenues (savings) generated via ex-ante financial repression is

significant, given that the ratio of domestic debt-to-GDP averaged only 11% over the sample

(11.7% over the years of controls). Reinhart and Sbrancia (2015) have documented fiscal

revenues in the range of 2-3% of GDP coming from financial repression in the United States and

the United Kingdom, but one must take into account that domestic debt-to-GDP ratios in any year

in these countries is anywhere between four and eight times larger than Venezuela’s. The

scenario described here is more in line with the Reinhart and Sbrancia findings from chronic-

inflation Argentina. It takes a lot more financial repression (markedly bigger haircuts to

support a “liquidity premium” that would make them viable instruments to hold even at anticipated negative real
interest rates.

bondholders) to generate fiscal revenues/savings in Venezuela, given that the relative size of its

domestic debt is smaller and shrinking.

       Consider for example the years 1989, 1996 and 2013, where fiscal revenues via ex-ante

financial repression totaled 4.4%, 3.9%, and 4.7% of GDP, respectively. Given that domestic

debt-to-GDP ratios were relatively low, in order to achieve those savings, the tax rate (haircut)

had to be substantive. As can be seen from Figure 4, real interest rates on government bonds in

those years were negative to the tune of 37.7%, 23.3% and 25.2%.

       Out of the three components of inflationary/repression financing shown in Table 2,

seigniorage is by far the largest, representing on average 4.0% of GDP per year. As with the

preceding discussion on domestic debt, the real action is not coming from the size of the

monetary base but from the very high inflation tax. Governments tended to resort more on

printing money for generating fiscal revenues in times of repression (4.34%) than in free-market

periods (3.36%); the difference being statistically significant at a 10% level. In any case, deficit

monetization is significant and pervasive across the board. This points out to a chronic

disequilibrium within the Venezuelan fiscal accounts, most likely related to: a) the temptation of

obtaining more domestic currency in exchange for oil exports by means of devaluation, and b)

large real exchange rate volatility.

Domestic and foreign cost of borrowing: The estimates

                These estimates of various forms of inflation/repression financing involve making strong

assumptions about expectations and “normal” levels of real interest rates. We also pursue the

alternative approximation to the financial repression tax suggested by Giovanini and de Melo

(1993). They used an ex-post measure consisting of effective interest rate payments plus arrears,

divided into average outstanding stock of both domestic and foreign debt. From there, they

proceed to calculate the financial repression tax by computing the differential between foreign

borrowing cost (translated into domestic currency) and domestic borrowing cost, times the

average stock of domestic debt.

                While this approach is viable from an accounting standpoint, it misses some important

sources of differentials that influence borrowing costs from an economic perspective other than

interest rate payments. In particular, it ignores the fact that large swing in prices of sovereign debt


                                                                       20
help to adjust for the difference between the coupon rate of foreign debt and the yield demanded

by international markets. The fact that these price adjustments do not occur in most of the

domestic debt markets of developing countries, as the marketability of domestic debt instruments

tends to be limited, is yet another feature of financial repression.

        We chose the Merrill Lynch maturity-adjusted index of sovereign yield on Venezuelan

foreign debt (GDVE)21 as a proxy for foreign borrowing cost. The only limitation is that the

GDVE is available from 1991 onwards, since the Venezuelan foreign debt did not float on

international markets until the Brady Bond exchange occurring that year. For domestic debt

yields, we have taken the effective weighted average yields on domestic public bonds reported by

the International Monetary Fund (IMF)22. Using GDVE yields in US dollars, and the realized loss

of value in domestic currency vis-à-vis the dollar, we calculated equilibrium domestic interest

rates for domestic public debt instruments for every year. We performed two sets of calculations,

using average devaluation in the official market and average depreciation of the parallel exchange

market in years of exchange controls. Equilibrium rates calculated thereby have been subtracted

from domestic public bonds, and multiplied by the average stock of domestic debt.

        Figure 5 below presents the dollar returns on foreign and domestic debt calculated at the

average official exchange rate for the twenty-three years spanning from 1991 to 2013. The

patterns mirror the peculiarities of the exchange rate policy adopted by Venezuela: Periods of

fixed exchange rate regimes (2003-2013) or dirty floating within bands (1994-1995 and 1999-

2002), both largely lagging inflation; followed by large devaluations leading to deep dives in the

dollar return on domestic government bonds. At the official exchange rate the picture is not so

startling, as fifteen years (65%) present positive dollar returns, albeit only half of them are above

the yield of foreign debt instruments. The problem is that these calculated returns are hard to

realize, as access to dollars at the official exchange rate is far from guaranteed, and most of the

time barred for capital account transactions.

       A more realistic approach to dollar returns on domestic debt instrument is presented on

Figure 6, which uses average depreciation of the domestic currency in the parallel exchange rate

market. There are eleven years (48%) of positive dollar returns on domestic debt instruments;

only six of those with yields that are higher than those demanded by international markets.

Average returns on control years are highly negative (-10.2%), and in particular 2013, where

someone investing in a basket of domestic bonds at the beginning of the year would have seen

63.3% of the dollar value of its investment sunk by year end.

       In order to calculate government savings or the financial repression tax, we calculated the

difference between equilibrium domestic borrowing cost as described above, and average yield

on domestic public debt outstanding, times the average stock of domestic debt on the year.

Results are reported in Table 3 (using official exchange rate) and 4 (parallel market rates).

Average fiscal revenues from financial repression range come out at 1.6% of GDP at the official

rate. Financial repression years are somewhat higher than free market years (2.1% vs. 0.8%),

although the difference is not significant. If measured at average parallel market exchange rates,

financial repression, on average, generated savings of 3.4% of GDP, with the average on years of

financial repression (5.2% of GDP) significantly higher than free-market years (0.7%).

                 Year 2013 stands out as extraordinary due to the accelerated depreciation of domestic

currency in the parallel market. Given that the average dollar price in VEF increased 217.9% and

                                                                                    23
that average dollar yield of foreign debt was 13.8%, equilibrium domestic returns on domestic

government bonds would have been 244.8%. This figure is in stark contrasts with realized yields

(16.8%), leading to haircuts from financial repression equivalent to no less than 31% of GDP.

       Tables 3 and 4 also show how parallel market rate estimates of financial repression tend

to precede those at the official exchange rate. Take for example the three years of exchange

controls ranging from 1994 to 1996. The parallel market rate was legal, exhibiting a premium

over the official exchange rate of 9.9% (1994) and 42.3% (1995). As the official exchange rate

lagged both inflation and the parallel exchange rate, estimates on financial repression at the

official rate result in lower fiscal revenues for 1994 (5.6% of GDP vs. 7.5%) and 1995 (-1.8% vs.

2.5%). In 1996 the official price of the dollar increased well beyond the parallel market rate

(135.99% vs. 79.87%), driving our estimates of public revenues from financial repression at the

official exchange twice above those registered at the parallel rate (11.81% of GDP vs. 4.93%).

       Something similar occurred in the period 2005-2010. Between March 2005 and December

2009, in spite of cumulative inflation of 165.1%, the official exchange rate remained fixed at 2.15

bolivars (VEF) per dollar. Throughout that period, the parallel exchange rate premium went from

32.5% to 175.8%, resulting in cumulative fiscal savings 2005-2009 from financial repression at

the parallel market rate (6.3% of GDP) nine times higher than those obtained at the official

exchange rate (0.74%). In 2010 there was a two-step exchange adjustment between January and

February totaling a devaluation of 50%. As a consequence, in 2010 fiscal savings from financial

repression resulted at 6.2% of GDP at the official exchange rate, as opposed to 1.7% at the

parallel market rate. In general, as the parallel market rate maintains a significant premium

throughout the whole exchange control period (see Figure 7), fiscal savings coming from

financial repression are much higher at that rate than at the official exchange rate.

Noteworthy when interpreting these results is the fact that domestic debt during this period

averaged a modest 11.3% of GDP.

Summary

                  Two general insights emerge from the preceding analysis. First, regardless of the

methodology, government savings (the financial repression tax) are greatest during periods of

interest-rate ceilings, exchange and price controls, and come close to zero when none of these

restrictions prevail. The estimates are especially substantive in light of the fact that Venezuela’s

domestic debt-to-GDP ratios are relatively small. Second, large misalignments across our

different indicators for financial repression within the same year mirror either misalignments

between domestic interest rates, exchange rates, and inflation; and/or large differences in the real

exchange rate at the official and parallel markets (most of the time domestic currency is highly

overvalued in the official market, and highly undervalued in the parallel market). As these are

pervasive throughout the sample, one can only conclude that calling years without controls “free-

                                                                                                                             27
market years” in Venezuela may be a euphemism, helpful from a conceptual standpoint and yet

inaccurate. After decades of heavy government intervention and widespread regulations going

well beyond outright controls, the capacity for resource-allocation of the relative price system

may be seriously impaired—not to mention that reforms may not be credible.



                      V. From Financial Repression to External Distress

       Extreme forms of financial repression and high inflation can be expected to influence a

countries’ external balance. Emphasizing the experience during the debt crisis in developing

countries of the 1980s, Dooley (1988), among others, argued that heavily depressed returns on

domestic investments fuel a flight towards safety in the form of foreign assets, impairing the

external balance. Makinen and Woodward (1990) stressed that, depending on the existence of

exchange controls, financial repression and the inflation tax could either be substitutes or

complements. Without exchange controls, high inflation stimulates capital flight, currency

substitution, and leads to a contraction in the demand for domestic currency (and domestic

currency-denominated assets that are imperfectly indexed) eroding the basis for financial

repression (this is the substitutes case). By the same token, exchange controls create a captive

market for assets subject to the financial repression tax (haircut), which can lead authorities to

rely on inflation tax financing than would have otherwise prevailed (the case of complements). In

this section, we investigate whether, in spite of substantial transactions costs and large penalty

risks, financial repression induces capital flight in years where exchange controls prevail.

Measuring capital flight

       In order to estimate capital flight we relied on two sets of calculations. The first of these

was popular in the literature on capital flight of the 1980s (see, for instance, Diaz-Alejandro 1984

and 1985, and Rodriguez, 1987). It basically adds to the stock of international reserves at the
                                                 28
beginning of the year, the current account balance, direct investment, portfolio investment, and

the net variation in public assets abroad; and subtracts the ending stock of international reserves.

It is the equivalent of calculating what would have been the balance of international reserves in

the absence of changes in the net variation of private assets abroad and errors and omissions, and

then contrasting that with the actual change in international reserves.

         A second measure of capital flight quantifies the over-invoicing of imports that is

commonplace in periods of exchange controls and large parallel market premiums. Exporters, of

course, will have incentives to miss-invoice in the opposite direction, understating their true

proceeds.23 In order to approximate the amount of leakages in external accounts arising from this

practice, we contrast the level of imports, as reported by the Venezuelan Central Bank, with total

imports declared by the Venezuelan customs (the authoritative source is the United Nations

Commodity Trade Statistics Database, UN Comtrade). In principle, there is no reason to expect

persistent systematic differences or that the gap between the two sources would be higher in years

of exchange controls.

         We also constructed the comparable measure of miss-invoicing for all the other countries

in the UN Comtrade Database, and tested for each year whether the error recorded for Venezuela

is significantly different from the average error for the rest of the world.24 These exercises is

informative on two different dimensions: a) in the time-series dimension, we are comparing miss-

invoicing practices in the years of exchange controls with other years within Venezuela, and b)

on a cross-section basis, we compare the Venezuelan estimate with the estimates of miss-

invoicing for all other countries. Because the cross-section comparison is done on a year-by-year

   In the case of Venezuela, government-controlled oil exports dominate. As such, this limits the scope for
understating exports.

   We estimate the quotient to perform this test to correct for the fact that larger economies would register larger
absolute errors than smaller ones.

basis, however, we can also determine whether the observed differences between Venezuela and

everyone else was significantly greater in years of exchange controls. Finally, we constructed a

broader measure of capital flight that combines the miss-invoicing estimates with the balance of

payments measure of capital flight. As with the individual components, we test whether is

composite is significantly higher in years of exchange controls.

The Estimates

        We calculated estimates of capital flight on the basis of the balance of payments statistics

published by the Central Bank of Venezuela for 1984 to 2013. As noted, for our measure of

over-invoicing of imports, we relied on the UN Comtrade database as well. 25 To quantify capital

account leakages in the context of multiple exchange rates, we present a range of estimates

involving both official and parallel market exchange rates. We report the estimates as a

percentage of GDP, in constant dollars, and as a percentage of total exports. In the case of the

over-invoicing of imports, we also report the estimates as a percentage of imports.

        As shown in Table 5, capital flight has been a chronic feature in the Venezuelan economy,

representing on average of 4.7% of GDP at the official exchange rate and 7.1% of GDP at the

parallel market exchange rate, while siphoning away 17.2% of total exports. While we lack a

counterfactual (we do not observe what capital flight may have been in the absence of controls),

it would appear exchange controls have not been particularly adept at stemming the exodus.

        By none of our measures capital flight turned out to be lower in years where exchange

controls were in place. Moreover, when measured as percent of GDP at the average parallel

market, rate capital flight turned out to be significantly higher in years of controls (8.0% vs.

5.2%). However, it is not possible to conclude on the basis of this analysis whether controls

  We have used the second revision of the Standard International Trade Code statistics (SITC-R2), available up to
2011 at the moment of writing.

                                                        30
exacerbated capital flight, or deteriorating economic fundamentals led to both tighter controls and

capital flight. The endogeneity of capital controls is recognized in much of the literature (see

Drazen and Bartolini, 1997, Cardoso and Goldfajn, 1998, and Reinhart and Rogoff, 2004).

        As to the actual means through which capital flight takes place even in the context of

strict exchange control regimes, two practices can be identified in the case of Venezuela. The first

arises from the government’s practice of issuing dollar-denominated debt targeting domestic

citizens using domestic currency. The so-called bolivar-dollar bonds of the previous decade were

an attempt by the Venezuelan government to avoid issuing debt in international markets, while at

the same time benefiting from the large exchange premiums on the domestic parallel exchange

market. Domestic agents, to whom these bonds were allocated in a fairly opaque and

discretionary process, would then sell them at a discount in the international market, at an

implicit exchange rate that was “overvalued” relative to the parallel exchange rate. It can almost

be characterized as a government-sponsored capital flight. The second means of capital flight is

standard fare worldwide: Over-invoicing of imports, as already described.

        Over-invoicing of imports turns out to be significantly higher in periods of financial

repression across all the measures at standard significance levels (Table 6).26 As noted earlier,

these results are to be interpreted with care, as the tests are silent on causation. Furthermore, the

fact that over-invoicing also occurs in periods of free market (where a priori there would not be

any incentive to do so) seems to point out to a consistent positive bias in our estimator, but does

not explain why it results consistently higher in periods of exchange controls.

       We also examined whether Venezuela´s estimates of this method of capital flight are

significantly higher than the world mean. Asterisks appear next to the years in Table 6 where

Venezuela’s estimates of miss-invoicing significantly differed from those estimated for the rest of

the countries included in the UN Comtrade Database for each of those years. The year-by-year

frequency distributions highlighting Venezuela’s relative position are presented in Appendix III.

Out of the eighteen years in our sample (1984-2011) where Venezuela had exchange rate

controls, in thirteen (72%) the miss-invoicing estimate was significantly higher than the world

average, in all cases at the 1% significance level. In four out of the ten (40%) years where

exchange controls did not prevail the Venezuelan error turned significantly higher than the

world´s average.

       Lastly, we calculated a broad measure of capital flight, adding to the balance of payments

measure our estimates on over-invoicing of imports. Results are reported in Appendix IV for the

various measures, while Figure 8 highlights the composite capital flight measure as a percent of

GDP at the parallel market exchange rate as well as its trend over the sample. Perhaps the most

salient feature of Figure 8 is that it reveals consistently large leakages that average around 10% of

GDP over the full sample but increasing markedly in the past 10 years, as the trend highlights.

                                               VI. Conclusions


            Excepting two short-lived liberalization episodes, the financial system in Venezuela since

the early 1980s has been characterized by a wide array of exchange controls and interest rate

ceilings coupled with a heavy reliance by the government on inflationary finance. The result has

been consistently negative real interest rates on domestic government bonds and bank deposits.

The “haircut” on depositors and bondholders via negative ex post real interest has, on several

occasions, exceeded 30% on an annual basis.27 We find evidence suggesting a systematic link

between significant distortions in the domestic financial system and a weakening of external

accounts via capital flight. The nature of the domestic-external interaction can give rise to self-

27
  The cumulative calculation would be much higher. Thus, the magnitude of the haircut on domestic debt is at par
with some of the highest calculated during episodes of external debt restructuring, as shown in Cruces and Trebesch
(2013).

                                                          35
reinforcing vicious circles. A chronically high inflation tax arising from deficit monetization

coupled with financial repression spurs capital flight and weakens the country’s external position.

Capital flight, in turn, weakens the government’s revenue base inducing greater reliance on

inflation/financial repression taxes. This connection between large haircuts on domestic debt and

a weakening in the balance of payments can also help explain why emerging markets sovereign

defaults often occur at seemingly low levels of external debt, even when domestic debt levels are

modest, as is the case of Venezuela.28

        Severe and/or chronic financial repression can help explain the dearth, limited nature, or

disappearance of domestic debt markets contributing to the “original sin” problem in many

emerging markets.29 While there are other definitions, Eichengreen and Hausmann (1999)

described original sin as a situation "in which the domestic currency cannot be used to borrow

abroad or to borrow long term even domestically." Pursuing this line of reasoning, one could

infer that the ability of many emerging government to tilt their financing inwards in recent years

is connected to the trends towards more liberalized domestic financial markets and lower

inflation rates-trends that have, thus far, eluded Venezuela.




28
   Reinhart, Rogoff, and Savastano (2003) show that more than 1/2 of the post-1970 defaults on external debt,
occurred at debt-to-GDP levels that would have satisfied the Maastricht criteria of 60% (for public debt).
29
   Reinhart and Rogoff (2009 and 2011) present evidence that in several emerging markets (Venezuela was not
among these) domestic debt played a bigger role prior to the widespread rise in inflation during the 1970s.
