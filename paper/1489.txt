              Using the Longitudinal Structure of Earnings
                       to Estimate the Effect of
                           Training Programs


                                ABSTRACT

     In this paper we set out some methods that utilize the longitudinal
structure of earnings of trainees and a comparison group to estimate the
effectiveness of training for the 1976 cohort of CETA trainees. By
fitting a components—of—variance model of earnings to the control group,
and posing a simple model of program participation, we are able to pre-
dict the entire earnings histories of the trainees. The fit of these
predictions to the pre—training earnings of the CETA participants provides
    a test of the model of earnings generation and program participation
and simple check on the corresponding estimate of the effectiveness of
training.
     Two factors appear to have a critical influence on the size of the
estimated training effects: the time of the decision to participate in
training and the presence or absence of individual—specific trends in
earnings. We find considerable evidence that trainee earnings contain
permanent, transitory,and trend—like components of selection bias. We
are less successful in distinguishing empirically between alternative
assumptions on the timing of the participation decision. If earnings in
the year prior to training are the appropriate selection criterion,
however, our estimate of the training effect for adult male CETA par-
ticipants is about 300 dollars per year. Our estimates for female CETA
participants are larger, and less sensitive to alternative models of
program participation.

    Passage of the Manpower Development and Training Act (MDTA) of 1962 inaugu-

rated a new series of subsidized training programs designed to raise the earnings

of unemployed and low—income workers. Ten years later, despite the absence of

any clear experimental test of the effectiveness of the MDTA programs, Congress

implemented the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), to the accom-

paniment of broad claims that the new programs would be more effective than the

old. Once again without any clear experimental evidence, Congress replaced CETA

with the Job Partnership Training Act (JPTA) in 1982. If history progresses as

it has during the last two decades, however, it will not be long before the

recent claims of success for the JPTA are replaced by proposals for still

another government training program.

    The rise and fall of subsequent federal training programs underscores the

need for credible and continuous evaluation of these programs. Yet, apart from

the results of one genuine experiment,' these training programs must still be

analyzed by non—experimental nthods, even some two decades after they were

first initiated. Any evaluation must therefore bring to bear statistical

methods for untangling the actual effect of these programs from other factors

that would have influenced trainee earnings even if no training had taken place.

    In order to make any progress a comparison group of workers must be gener-

ated so as to control for economy—wide movements in earnings during and after

the training period. In addition, it is by now clear that participants in

training programs are far from a random sample of the eligible population.

Trainees have typically experienced a decline in their earnings, both absolutely

and relative to any comparison group selected, in the period immediately prior

to training. These declines are hardly surprising since program operators are
                                      —2—


instructed to enroll workers who have recently faced difficulties in the labor

market, and it is precisely such workers who may be most anxious to participate.

Nevertheless, this peculiar aspect of trainee earnings introduces considerable

ambiguity into the determination of whether observed post—training earnings

increases are a result of training or merely of the way in which workers are

selected into the program.

     In this paper we set out some methods that utilize the longitudinal struc-

ture of earnings of the trainee group and a comparison group to estimate the

effect of training. The basic idea is to first estimate a time—series model of

earnings determination from data on the comparison group. Then, using a very

simple statistical hypothesis about program participation we generate a complete

time series of earnings predictions for the trainees. The difference between

predicted and actual post—training earnings serves as a natural estimate of

the training effect. By the same token, differences between predicted and

actual earnings in the pre—training periods provide a built—in test of the model

of earnings generation and program participation, and a simple check on the

credibility of the estimated training effect.

     As we shall see, this method is no substitute for a properly designed

experimental test of the effectiveness of training, but it does provide some

evidence on the empirical consistency of the estimated program effects. In the

absence of experimental methods, there seems no alternative to the adoption of

this or similar methods of program evaluation, since we find that small dif-

ferences in model specification can lead to remarkable differences in the esti-

mated impact of training. Hopefully, the accuracy of these methods may

eventually be the subject of experimental testing.'

    The paper begins with a discussion of the earnings histories of 1976
                                      —3—


enrollees in the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) training

programs. Earnings histories of a comparable group of non—trainees drawn from

the March 1976 Current Population Survey are presented as a benchmark against

which to judge the impact of training. We go on to analyze a number of alter-

native estimators of program effectiveness——starting from simple estimators and

proceeding to those based on more complete models of earnings generation and

program participation. For the nest part, our analysis is confined to male

trainees over 21 years of age in the training year. In the latter part of the

paper, however, we give a brief summary of estimated training effects for female

trainees In the same age group.


I. Earnings Determination and Prqram Participation.

    The demographic characteristics and earnings histories of adult male

trainees from the 1976 cohort of CETA participants are reported in Table 1.

Also recorded in t:is table are similar data for adult males from a sample of

the March 1976 Current Population Survey.' In order to control for age dif-

ferences between the trainee sample and the population as a whole, we have re—

sampled the Current Population Survey to generate a control sample with the same

age distribution as the trainees. This age adjustment does not fully eliminate

the difference between the two samples in race or marital status characteristics.

Our approach below is to handle these differences by a time—series model of the

earnings process that contains a separate fixed effect for each individual.

    Since the earnings data are drawn from Social Security records, some indivi-

duals are recorded with only partial earnings information. In addition, indivi-

duals whose earnings exceed the maximum taxable earnings level are recorded as

having earnings at the maximum. For each year we report the mean and standard
                                          —4—




deviation   of deflated social security earnings, as well as the fraction of

workers who are at the taxable maximum (which varies over the years) or who

report no taxable earnings whatever. Workers with no taxable earnings may be

earning income outside of the Social Security Tax system, or may be unemployed,

although there is no way to determine which of these phenomenon is the more

important. The Table does indicate the very high fraction of comparison group

workers who are at the taxable maximum in each of the sample years.

    The trainee earnings in Table 1 display the characteristic pattern of a

decline in real earnings in the year immediately prior to training. Indeed, the

real earnings of the trainees are 200 dollars less in 1975 than in 1970, while

the earnings of the comparison group increased by some 1700 dollars over that

period. Also as expected, the level of real earnings of the trainees Is always

lower than the level of real earnings of the comparison group. Moreover, the

difference between the earnings of these two groups widens over the nine year

period, and this widening begins several years before the onset of training.

Table 1 also contains data for the subset of trainees who finished training

during 1976. The table reveals few differences between this group and the

entire trainee sample.

    It should be clear, however, that the temporal pattern of trainee earnings

in Table 1 is very different from the temporal pattern of comparison group

earnings. We turn next to the simplest models of time—series earnings and

program selection that might be consistent with both trainee and comparison

group earnings histories.


A. Simple Models
                                     th
    Suppose that earnings of the i        individual in period t ,     ,   follow
a simple components of variance scheme:
                                               —5—


        (1)            y =
                       it   I
                                +d t   +Dit +c it
where         is a permanent component, d is an economy—wide component, D.                  is

a dummy variable for participation in training during period T ,             taking   the

value of unity for trainees in the post—training periods          (t > T),     represents

the effect of training, and              is a serially uncorrelated transitory com-

ponent of earnings. It is obvious from (1) that if assignment to training is

independent of w and ,                 then a simple post—training difference in

earnings between trainees and controls will estimate the training effect 3.

    The data in Table 1 reveal that this difference in earnings is surely inade-

quate as an estimate of the training effect, however. At a minimum we must

allow for the fact that the trainee and comparison groups have different per-

manent components of earnings.

    To accommodate this fact, suppose that participation in training in period

r is governed by the magnitude of the permanent component of earnings, with


               D.t =   1    for t > i if and only if w < y


In this case, a simple estimate of the training effect is obtained from a com-

parison of the change in earnings for the trainees between some pre—training

period (t'-j) and the post—training period (T+l) with the change in earnings

for the control group over the same period. This "difference—in—differences"

estimator provides an unbiased estimate of the training effect because


        (2)         E T÷1 —
                                 iTj       Di1÷1 = 1)

                                        —6—

for all   j > 0, where p is the fraction of the total population that partici-

pates in training. If p is small, as is the case for virtually all training

programs, then the difference—in—differences of earnings between trainees and

controls provides a straightforward estimate of the training effect.

    The important point to observe about this method for estimating the training

effect is that as many estimates may be calculated as there are pre—training

observations on earnings. Moreover, these estimates should be similar if the

model is correctly specified. Calculating all of the possible estimates and

comparing their values therefore provides a test of the specification of the

earnings function (1) and/or of the selection rule based on permanent components

of earnings.

    The first column of Table 2 contains estimates of the training effect for

1978 earnings based on this simple difference—in—differences method using the

years 1970—1975 as base years. It is immediately apparent that these alter-

native estimates of the training effect are all different from one another. The

third column contains the estimates of the training effect for 1977 earnings

using only those trainees from the 1976 cohort who had completed training prior

to 1977. These estimates of the training effect also differ from each other.

The variability in the estimates makes it clear that the specification of

equation (1) and the selection rule based on permanent earnings components are

not capturing some important elements of the data.

    It should be clear that minor changes in the selection rule still lead to

the prediction that many of the estimated training effects in Table 2 should be

similar, so long as equation (1) is maintained. Suppose, for example, that

selection is based on the rule


                D.
                 1T+l
                        =1 if      y.
                                    it—k

                        = 0   if
                                   iT—k>y.
                                      —7—


Here, selection into training is based on actual earnings in the kth period

prior to the advent of training. Provided that the transitory error in earnings

       is taken to be serially uncorrelated however, it remains the case that

equation (2) continues to hold for j > k .   That is, the difference—in—

differences estimator is still reasonable so long as the difference is taken

from a period prior to those used by program operators or potential participants

as a basis for selection into training. Again, all the training effect esti-

mates based on the pre—training base years prior to the selection year should be

similar. This selection scheme may nonetheless account for differences in the

training program estimates calculated from base years near to and far from the

date of entrance to training.

    Table 2 indicates, however, that the simple difference—in—differences esti—

mates vary substantially over all the base years listed in the table. The dif-

ference between the calculations based on the 1975 base year and the other base

years is most dramatic, but it is clear that a simple selection bias analysis

using equation (1) and assignment to training on the basis of observed pre—

training earnings is inadequate to explain the data in Table 2.

    One possible explanation for the apparent variability in the training effect

estimates in Table 2 has been advanced by Heckman (1978) and Heckman and Robb

(1982). They observe that if selection is based on earnings in period t—k

then the transitory component of earnings of trainees will be abnormally low in

that period. They also observe that if the transitory component cj is

serially correlated, then trainee earnings will be abnormally low in periods

adjacent to i—k ,   only returning to their permanent level as the transitory
                                                    —8—


shock wears off, To the extent that transitory earnings components in alter-

native basis years are more or less correlated with the negative transitory

earnings component in the selection year, then, difference—in--difference esti-

mates based on different pre—training years can be expected to yield different

estimates of the effect of training.

    Heckman (1978) and Heckinan and Robb (1982) also suggest an ingenious gener-

alization of the simple difference—In—differences estimator to cope wIth the

autocorrelation in the transitory component of trainee earnings. Suppose that

the conditional expectation of y.1 , earnings subsequent to training, given

earnings in the selection period, jk ,                    is   linear in the latter. Then, it Is

easy to establish that

where b(z2 ,       z)     indicates the population regression coefficient of z2 on

             +     b(yi    2kl '   i—k                         'it—k <        E(yjk)}.
By choosing to calculate (4) for the same number of periods "behind" the selec-

tion period i—k as -r+l is "ahead" of the selection period, we can guarantee

equality of the regression coefficients b(y.1 '                             and
                                                                                  b(yi2kl
          so long as the earnings process is covariance stationary. It follows

immediately that the symmetric difference—in—differences

              —                   1) —          —
                  ii-2k—l D1 =           E(y1       iT—2k—l

is a straightforward estimator of the training effect that handles the auto—

correlation in the transitory component of earnings.

   Before it is possible to implement this procedure, however, it is necessary

to decide which period to take for i—k ;    that is, which period's earnings to

use as the basis for selection into training. One logical possibility is to use

k1 ,   and assume that the selection is based on earnings in the period imn—

diately preceding the training period. This is the information that will cer-

tainly be available to the potential participants and program operators.

Alternatively, we may consider taking k=O and using the period of training as

the selection period. Although earnings in the training period are never fully

realized, the worker or program operator may have information on several months

of data from which an excellent forecast may be made.

   For the full cohort of trainees, only one symmetric difference—in—difference

estimate of effect of training is available, based on the difference between

1978 earnings and 1974 earnings, if 1976 is taken as the selection year, or the

difference between 1978 earnings and 1972 earnings, if 1975 is taken as the

selection year. As can be seen from Table 2, however, these two estimates of

the effectiveness of training are dramatically different, ranging from zero to a

statistically significant —700 dollars.

    For CETA trainees whose program termination dates were in 1976, two sym-

metric difference estimates of the training effect are available for each selec-

tion year; one based on 1977 earnings, and one based on 1978 earnings. If the

true training effect were the same the two years then a simple specification

test for the symmetric difference estimator would be to compare the training
                                      —10-


effect estimates for these two years, as they should be similar. Taking 1976

earnings as the basis for selection into training, the two symmetric difference—

in—difference estimates of the training effect are 9 and 439 dollars, based on

earnings growth from 1974 to 1978 and 1975 to 1977, respectively. Using 1975

earnings as the basis for selection into training, on the other hand, the two

estimates are —736 dollars, based on earnings growth from 1972 to 1978, and —873

dollars, based on earnings growth from 1973 to 1977. Neither pair of estimates

is identical, although the estimates using 1975 as the selection year are closer

together. Again, the estimates are positive when 1976 earnings are taken as the

basis for selection into training, and negative and statistically significant

when 1975 is used as the selection year.

     In our opinion, simple difference-in—differences techniques give uncon-

vincing estimates of the value of training for adult male CETA participants.

One one hand, while a convenient specification test of the simple (nonsymntric)

difference—in—difference estimator is available from the long span of pre—

training data, the underlying assumptions for this estimator are clearly vio—
      5/
lated.—    On the other hand, in the absence of several years of post—training

data, no similar specification check is available for the symmetric difference—

in—difference estimator. It is clear that arbitrary and largely unverifiable

maintained hypotheses are necessary to select a symmetric difference estimator,

and that different maintained hypotheses lead to very different conclusions on

the value of training.

    One way to provide for a test of specification is to focus more explicitly

on the considerable amount of additional data available in the period prior to

training for both the trainee and comparison groups. The symmetric difference—

in—differences estimator makes very little use of this information. Our ap—
                                         —1 1—



proach is to use equation (3), but to recognize explicitly that the regression

coefficient in this expression will vary systematically as different comparisons

are made. Given a particular assumption about the structure of the earnings

equation (1), the regression coefficient in (3) may be calculated explicitly

from data on the comparison group alone. Since most conventional components—

of—variance models of earnings contain very few parameters, this model will be

highly over—identfed and readily susceptIble to specification tests. In

effect, we will continue to use equation (3) to adjust the earnings of trainees

for sample selection, but we discipline the process by which the adjustment fac-

tor is obtained by requiring its consistency with a components—of—variance

explanation for the comparison group's earnings and the pre—training earnings of

the program participants.


B. Components—of—Variance and Selection Bias.

    We begin by setting out a simple model of earnings determination and program par-

ticipation. Suppose, as before, that earnings are described by an additive com-

ponents of variance scheme, with a person—specific fixed effect, a year effect,

and a person and year specific transitory earnings component c. .         Suppose

also that       is first order autoregressive with variance           and first order

autocorrelation coefficient   c& .   Finally,    assume that training occurs during

period t if and only if


                               + v. < y,


where y is a constant based on potential trainees' discount rates, time hori-

zons, and tastes for training, and v.      is a random variable, assumed to be

independent of any earnings components. Substituting for ik from equation

(1), training occurs if and only if
    (5)         z. = (iu.—w)
                 1      1
                               + c.iT—k   + V. < y — w — d

where w represents the mean of the permanent earnings component

        Our procedure is to use the earnings function (1) and the selection rule

(5) to describe the means and covariances of the time series of earnings for

both program participants and controls. These predicted moments are directly

comparable to the observed moments of the data, and standard method of moments

estimation techniques can be used to obtain estimates of the parameters of the

earnings process, including the training effect associated with program
    •            6/
participation.

        Assuming that the control sample is approximately a random sample of the

population as a whole, the means and covariances of controls' earnings are

described by the unconditional moments:Zi


                               E          = w
                                              + dt

        For the participant sample, on the other hand, the means and covariances of

earnings correspond to conditional moments, given that the selection criterion

ditional expectation of participant earnings in any period is a linear function

of the selection variable z.1 .            (This will be the case, for instance, if w.,

differs from the mean of control earnings by a training effect plus the sum of

two components, each of which is proportional to the number X*. These two com-

ponents reflect the covariance of the selection variable with the underlying

components of earnings. Using the definition of the selection variable z. we

can calculate these covariances and obtain the following expression for the mean

of trainee earnings in period t

In   pre— and post—training periods, the discrepancy between trainees' and

controls' earnings consists of a permanent component —— a2                                   X , and   a

geometrically declining component, centered around the selection period ——

aItT+a2         X .       The relative magnitude of these two selection bias com-

ponents, however, is completely determined by the parameters of the earnings

process, and can be estimated directly from information on the controls'

earnings. The model imposes the restriction that in both pre— and post—

training periods, earnings of the trainees and controls diverge in a systematic

pattern with only one free parameter: the number X*.
                                        —14—


     The first column of Table 3 presents the results of fitting the simple com-

ponents of variance scheme represented by equation (1) to the means and

covariances of control earnings from 1970 to 1978. The estimation method mini-

mizes a quadratic form in the deviations of the actual from the fitted moments,

with the deviations weighted by the inverse matrix of third and fourth moments

of the data. On the basis of the earnings data for the control sample, much of

the observed cross—sectional variation in earnings represents the effect of

transitory shocks. The estimated cross—sectional variance of the permanent com-

ponent w.   is less than half the estimated variance of the transitory earnings

component. The estimate of a is around .8, however, implying that transitory

earnings shocks are quite persistent.

     Once we have estimated the parameters of the earnings process and selected

the period T—k to be used for the selection year, it is a straightforward

matter to calculate an estimate of trainee earnings in any period, using

equation (6). The only unknown parameter is the selection bias parameter A*,

which must be inferred from a comparison with actual trainee earnings. The

estimated differences between trainee and control earnings, based on the parame-

ters from the first column of Table 3, are presented in the first two columns of

Table 4 for the case of selection into training on the basis of 1976 (k0) and

1975 (k=1) earnings, respectively. To assist in the interpretation of these

predicted differences we have arbitrarily scaled the number X* so that 1975

earnings are predicted exactly. It should be clear, however, that alternative

methods of scaling X* lead to essentially the same qualitative conclusions.

     The structure of the model implies that the permanent component of earnings

accounts for a fixed difference between the earnings of trainees and the com-

parison group of $928 or $1158, depending on whether 1975 or 1976 is used as
                                       —15—

the selection year. The transitory component is symmetric around the selection

year and is considerably larger than the permanent component of the predicted

earnings difference around the period of training. The strong persistence in

the transitory component of earnings implies that the predicted transitory com-

ponent of the earnings difference will eventually decay, but that it lasts many

years. The implicit training effect estimate in Table 4 is nothing more than

the shortfall of the predicted control/trainee earnings difference from the

actual control/trainee earnings difference. For 1978 this is $339, if selection

is based on training period (1976) earnings, and —$382, if selection is based on

pre—training period (1975) earnings.

     The specification of this simple model may be examined by comparing the

predicted and actual comparison group/trainee earnings differences prior to

training. These should, of course, be similar. As can be seen from Table 4,

the predicted and actual earnings differences are dissimilar in 1974, and they

increasingly diverge as we move back in time. However, the predicted differ-

ences are somewhat closer to the actual differences when selection is based on

pre—training (1975) earnings than when selection is based on 1976 earnings.

     The problem with the predictions in Table 4 appears to be that they fail to

capture a systematically weaker trend in the trainees' earnings than exists in

the comparison group's earning even prior to training. This suggests the possi-

bility that the components of variance model (1) should be augmented to include

a person—specific growth rate of earnings          ,   which is distributed across the

population with mean g and variance      .    In       this case

                                i it +c it
with c.t taken to be first order autoregressive as before. The same methods
                                            —16—


may be used to estimate trainee earnings, as before, but now the covariance of

earnings in any year with the selection variable will depend on the time period

and the number of periods from the selection year for which earnings are being

predicted.

     There are two additional findings that suggest the usefulness of the random

growth component in (7). First, the dissimilarity between the symmetric dif-

ference—in—differences estimators in Table 2 suggests the empirical possibility

that the extent of selection bias in pre— and post—training earnings may be un—

equal, even between symnEtric years around the selection period. This prediction

is consistent with the hypothesis that mean earnings of the trainees and the

controls are permanently diverging. Secondly, an examination of the variances

and covariances of earnings for the comparison group indicates increasing

dispersion in earnings over time. This is consistent with cross—sectional

dispersion in individual—specific growth rates in earnings, and inconsistent

with the simple components of variance scheme given by equation (1).

     Assuming that earnings are generated by equation (7), and selection into

training is based on a combination of earnings in period i—k plus a random

selection error, training occurs if and only if


               z. = (w. — w) +            — g)(T—k) +
     (8)                            (g1                 Cik + v.   < z


Under this selection criterion, trainees will be those for whom permanent

earnings are low, transitory earnings are low, and the accumulated growth in

earnings is low. Trainee earnings will therefore differ from the comparison

group's earnings because of a permanent component, a symmetric transitory com-

ponent, and a trend component. Specifically, the expectation of trainee ear-

nings in period t   is   given by

where, as before, X =           —E   [zz. < z] /         var   [z.] represents the ratio

of the truncated mean of the selection variable to its variance. In

this expression we have accounted for both the cross—sectional variance

in earnings growth (a2) and any covariance between individual—specific

growth rates and individual—specific permanent earnings components

(ag)• If, for example, earnings growth is approximately proportional,

then this covariance will be large and positive. On the other hand, if

more rapid earnings growth is associated with lower permanent earnings,

then this covariance will be negative.

      As before, the variance components a2, a2                        a         and a2, and
                                                         w         g       tug        c
the autoregressive parameter a are all identified by the structure

of control group earnings. In particular, the variances and covariances of

control earnings are given by

Therefore, given the parameters of control group earnings, the predicted

earnings differentials between trainees and controls depend solely on the number

       The selection bias model yields a simple one parameter description of the

means of trainee earnings, given the means and covariances of control earnings.

      Column (2) of Table 6 contains the results of fitting equation (7) to the

means and covariances of control group earnings. The cross—sectional variance

of the individual—specific trend in earnings (normalizing to t0 in 1970) is
                                        —18—


very precisely estimated, as is the cross—sectional covariance of the permanent

and trend components of earnings. The addition of random trend components of

earnings greatly improves the fit of the model to the control group earnings, as

the goodness of fit statistics in the bottom row of the table indicate. This

better fit reflects mainly the ability of the growth components to explain the

increasing cross—sectional dispersion in control group earnings observed in the

data.

        Columns (3) and (4) of Table 4 contain estimates of the predicted control!

trainee earnings difference using the parameter estimates from column (2) of

Table 3, and assuming that selection into training is based on either pre—

training period (1975) or training period (1976) earnings. Again, in each case

we have scaled the selection bias parameter X in equation (9) so as to pre-

dict the 1975 gap in earnings exactly, given the estimates of the variance com-

ponents for the controls. The addition of a growth component changes

considerably the interpretation of trainee!control earnings differences and the

estimated training effect. In particular, a large share of the post—training

gap in earnings is now attributed to the permanently lower growth rates of

earnings for the trainees, and the implied training effect is correspondingly

larger than when growth components are ignored. The addition of a random growth

component also improves the fit of the model to the pre—training earnings. Not

only then does the addition of a random growth component improve the fit of the

model to the comparison group, as our results in Table 3 confirm, but it is also

true that it improves the fit of the predicted trainee—comparison group earnings

gap.     It seems reasonable, therefore, to prefer the estimates based on the

components—of—variance model that contains a growth effect.

        The issue remains, however, of whether 1975 or 1976 is the more appropriate
                                      —19—


selection year on which to base the estimates. A comparison of columns (3) and

(4) of Table 4 indicates that applying the same components—of—variance model

with two different selection rules leads to estimated training effects of $191

and $877. It is natural to inquire whether the goodness of fit of one of these

models justifies greater confidence in its estimated training effect. A com-

parison indicates that the pre—training fit to the data in column (3) is the

better, but the difference involved is very small. In our view these data are

simply not sufficient to distinguish between selection rules based on 1976 or

1975 (k=O, k=l) earnings.

     Up to this point we have estimated the components of variance model on the

control sample and then estimated the training effect and the selection bias

parameter X using the gap between trainee and control earnings. Columns

(3)—(6) of Table 3 contain estimates of the components—of—variance model of

earnings that pool the data on the trainee and comparison groups. In Columns

(3) and (4) we have modelled selection into training on the basis of 1976

earnings. In columns (5) and (6), we model selection as based on 1976 earnings.

In each case we have reported the parameter estimates for equation (7) fitted to

the means and covariances of control group earnings, and the means of trainee

earnings, with and without the addition of random growth components. It should

be made clear that the models fitted in Table 3 represent an extraordinarily

economical parameterization of the means and variances of control earnings and

the mean earnings of the trainee group. It should not be surprising that these

restrictions do considerable violence to the data in a statistical sense, as

reflected by the very large chi—squared statistics associated with the restric-

tions. In our view, however, these models do a reasonably good job of pre-

dicting the mean earnings of the trainees prior to training, and also the
                                           —20—


covariances of the comparison group. The difficulty that remains is the con-

siderable variability in the estimated training effects associated with dif-

ferent model specifications.

    These difficulties are highlighted by the different estimated training

effects in the fourth row of the table. On one hand, assuming selection into

training on the basis of 1975 earnings and ignoring random growth components in

earnings, the estimated training effect is —1160 in 1967 dollars. On the other

hand, assuming selection into training on the basis of 1976 earnings, and

allowing for random growth components in earnings, the estimated training effect

is $747. While we have fairly strong evidence from the control group to suggest

the importance of random growth components in earnings, there is no such basis

to choose between 1975 (kl) and 1976 (k0) as the selection year.        The chi—

squared statistics are somewhat more favorable for 1975, as is the informal evi-

dence from the two—step procedures in Table 4 In view of the remarkable

difference between the estimated training effects, however, further research is

clearly required to distinguish confidently between the estimates.

     Finally, we also estimated the components of variance model of earnings

represented by equation (7) on the means and covariances of control group

earnings and the means and covariances of trainee earnings. Our parameteriza—

tion of the covariance matrix of trainee earnings is based explicitly on the

hypothesis of joint normality of the random variables w., g.,         and V1.

Under that maintained assumption, the formula for the (truncated) covariance of
earnings in period t   and period s is given by

covariances of trainee earnings are less than the corresponding covariances of

control earnings, since earnings in each period are positively correlated with

the selection variable z (which is just a linear combination of earnings in

period ik and the random variable v.) .                    Comparing these estimates with the

corresponding estimates that do not restrict the trainee covariances, the

training effects and the estimated components of variance are generally similar.

In a qualitative sense, the model represented by equation (10) appears to fit

the covariances of trainee earnings rather well, although again the formal chi—

squared statistics are unfavorable. The only major difference between the

training effects summarized in Table 3, with unrestricted trainee covariances,

and those with restricted trainee covariances, concerns the relative fit of the

1975 and 1976 selection models. Fitting only the means of trainee earnings, the

selection nidel based on 1975 earnings fits better. Fitting both means and

covariances, however, the selection model based on the 1976 earnings fits

better. This fact reinforces our hesitancy in choosing between the estimates.


C. Estimates for Females

    Table 6 summarizes our estimated training effects for adult females in the

1976 cohort of CETA participants. These estimates are based on fitting equation

(7) simultaneously to the means and covariances of control group earnings and

the means of trainee earnings. The general pattern of the parameter estimates

for males and females is very similar. The share of variance attributed to per—

manent earnings components is generally lower for females, however. For both

groups, the estimated covariance of permanent and trend components of earnings
                                     —22—


is large, and for the females in fact, the implied correlation coefficient

between permanent and trend components (a Iai a )   is   greater than one in three
                                               g
out of four cases. This inconsistency illustrates the difficulty of obtaining a

parsimonious model of earnings that nonetheless captures the non—stationarity

evident in the data. The estimated training effects for females display a simi-

lar pattern to the estimated effects for adult males. The lowest program esti-

mates are associated with the assumptions that selection is based on 1975

earnings, and that there are no individual—specific trends in earnings. The

highest estimates are associated with the assumptions that participation in

training is based on 1976 earnings, and that average growth rates of earnings

differ as between the trainee and comparison groups. An important distinction

between the program estimates for males and females, however, is the wider

dispersion in the male estimates across methods. Estimates for females, by com-

parison, are uniformly positive and lie in the interval between 300 and 700

dollars per year (in 1967 dollars). Perhaps the greater dispersion in estimates

for the males reflects the larger magnitude of the apparent selection bias in

male trainee earnings, and the correspondingly greater ambiguities in recon-

ciling trainee earnings with comparison group earnings.         it happens, the

estimated training effects for females are not as sensitive to the inclusion or

exclusion of individual—specific trend components of earnings as the estimates

for males. The differences between estimated training effects using 1975 or

1976 as the basis for selection into training are still significant for females,

although the goodness of fit statistics for the alternative choices are very

nearly identical. The overall fit of either model to the female earnings data,

however, is considerably better than the corresponding fit to the male   data.

II. Concluding Remarks

     The main advantage of the procedure we have used to estimate training

effects is that it generates over—identifying restrictions that can be readily

tested against the data. In the absence of such testable restrictions it is

unclear how one can distinguish among diverse estimates from alternative, and

equally plausible, specifications. At an empirical level we find that different

models lead to very different estimates of training effects This underscores

our belief in the importance of the ability to test alternative specifications

of the earnings and selection model.

     For the simple selection rule/components—of—variance models we have applied

to the 1976 cohort of CETA trainees, two factors appear to have a critical

influence on the size of the estimated training effects. One is our assumption

about the timing of the decision to participate in training, and the other is

our assumption about the presence or absence of selection bias in the trend

component of earnings. It seems clear that the highest priority for future

research is to find a way to test whether models using different specifications

for these factors can be distinguished empirically in the data. We have pro-

vided son formal and informal tests of alternative model specifications, but it

appears that additional tests of model specification will be necessary for a

confident assessment of the magnitude of training effects.

     The informal evidence we have presented suggests that CETA participant

earnings may contain permanent, transitory, and trend—like components of selec-

tion bias. The informal evidence, however, simply does not allow us to discri-

minate effectively between assumptions about the year of selection into

training. Formal testing, moreover, gives contradictory evidence on the

appropriate assumption about the selection year. If earnings in the year prior
                                         —24--



to   training are the appropriate selection criterion, then our findings suggest

that the training effect for adult males who participated in CETA in 1976 is

small: at most on the order of 300 current dollars per year. If earnings in

the training period are the appropriate selection criterion, then the training

effect is surely larger. For adult females, on the other hand, the effect of

program participation in unambiguously positive, and on the order of 800—1500

current   dollars per year.   Further computational experience with the models used

1.   We are referring here to the Supported Work Program administered by the

     Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation that used random   assignment

     of individuals to treatment and control groups. The results of this

     experimental program evaluation are summarized in t{anpower Demonstration

     Research Corporation (1980).

2.   This was first documented by Ashenfelter (1975, 1978) for trainees from

     the cohort of 1964. It has also been documented by Kiefer (1979) for

     trainees from cohorts in the late 1960's, by Bassi (1983) for the 1976

     cohort of CETA trainees, and by LaLonde (1984) for the trainees in MDRC's

     Supported Work experiment of the l970's.

3.   LaLonde (1984) has produced such an experimental evaluation of several

     other evaluation methods using the Supported Work Program experimental

     data.

4.   Members of the Current Population Survey (CPS) sample satisfy the following

     restrictions:   (1) they had to report 1975 earnings less than $20,000, and

     1975 household income less than $30,000. (2) they had to report themselves

     in the labor market (either with a job or unemployed and looking for a job)

     in March 1976. The trainee and CPS samples were provided to us by SRI

     International. Restrictions (1) and (2) eliminate some 21 percent of the

     overall CPS population. Details on the construction of the trainee and CPS

     samples are provided in Dickinson, Johnson and West (1984) pp. 37—45.

5.   It is worth noting that the variability in estimated program effects

     clearly observed in Table 2 was not observed in Ashenfelter's (1978)

     study of the 1964 cohort of MDTA trainees. Apparently the earnings struc—
                                      —26--



     ture and/or the selection mechanism for trainees has changed so much that

     the evaluation task is considerably more difficult with the later group.

6.   See in particular Chamberlain (1982) on the application of method of

     moments estimation to panel data. This strategy for joint estimation of

     the earnings process and selection equation was proposed by Abowd (1983),

7.   Formally, in post—training periods the means and covariances of earnings

     for a random sample of the population include a weighted training effect.

     We assume that the proportion of the population that participated in

     training is negligible.

8.   The implied correlation between the trend and permanent components of

     earnings in .52.

9.   Bassi (1984) reaches a similar conclusion. Her analysis of the 1976 cohort

     of CETA trainees by sex and race indicates that selection bias and asso-

     ciated ambiguities in program evaluation are most pronounced for white

     males.
