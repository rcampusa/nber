                                             ABSTRACT

In this paper, we define “The Chinese Saving Puzzle” as the persistently high national saving rate
at 34–53 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the past three decades and a surge in the saving
rate by 11 percentage points from 2000–2008. Using data from the Flow of Funds Accounts (FFA)
and Urban Household Surveys (UHS) supplemented by the findings from existing studies, we analyze
the sources and causes of China’s high and rising saving rates in the government, corporate, and household
sectors. Although the causes of China’s high saving are complex, we suggest that the evolving economic,
demographic, and policy trends in the internal and external environments of the Chinese economy
will likely lead to a decline in national saving in the foreseeable future.

                        Why Are Saving Rates So High in China?

I. Introduction

The spectacular economic growth of China in the past three decades has been

associated with an equally remarkable high rate of saving. While the gross national

saving as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) hovered just a little above 35

percent in the 1980s, the average yearly rate climbed to 41 percent in the 1990s

(Figure 1). Since China’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), the growth

in aggregate saving accelerated, surging from just below 38 percent in 2000 to an

unprecedented 53 percent in 2007. China’s national saving rates since 2000 have been

one of the highest worldwide, far surpassing the rates prevailing in Japan, South

Korea, and other East Asian economies during the years of their miracle growth.1

     The high and rising aggregate saving and thus the low and declining share of

consumption in the GDP constitute a central feature of the Chinese economy. High

saving is not only closely related to domestic liquidity, investment, economic growth,

and income distributions among firms, households, and the government but also to

China’s international trade and capital flows. With the government’s concerted efforts

to stimulate consumption and economic growth amid the recent financial crisis,

increasing attention has been given on the issue of saving. Despite the bourgeoning

literature on the subject, debates continue among economists regarding the underlying

causes of China’s high rate of saving. Although some progress has been made to

  These saving figures are based on information from the World Development Indicators (WDI). In
2008, the gross national saving rate of China ranked the 9th highest among 228 countries recorded in
the WDI database. The eight economies with higher saving rates than China are all very small. Saudi
Arabia and Singapore are the two economies of significant size with saving rates below that of China
but were nonetheless above 50 percent.

understand household saving behaviors, a significant void in research on corporate

and government saving still remains. The main objectives of this paper are to

document historical trends in Chinese aggregate saving using multiple data sources,

analyze the forces that contributed to the recent rise in government, corporate, and

household saving, and assess the prospects for Chinese national savings in the near

future.

     We start with an overview of the major patterns in Chinese national saving in the

past three decades. Drawing data from the World Development Indicators (WDI),

China’s Flow of Funds Accounts (FFA), and other sources of aggregate statistics, we

analyze and compare the aggregate saving in China with that of representative

economies and major country groups. A breakdown of aggregate saving into the

components of corporate, household, and government reveals major changes and

sources of national saving over time. These analyses help define “The Chinese Saving

Puzzle,” a set of unique features still not well understood in the existing literature of

aggregate saving in the historical context of China and in light of international

comparisons.

     We then proceed to examine the sources and causes of the rising saving of the

government, corporate, and household sectors in China, focusing on the period of

1999–2007. The sharp rise in government taxes on production and the collection of

social security fees and income taxes were the dominant factors that increased the

disposable income of the government. As the growth of income outpaced that of

government consumption, the saving rate rose rapidly. The analysis of enterprise


                                           2
behavior opens the discussion on data-related issues pertaining to the FFA, the main

source of data for documenting aggregate saving in China. We examine the role of

firm profitability, labor compensation and dividend, imperfect capital markets, and

government policies in shaping corporate saving. Our analysis of household behavior

relies on data from the Urban Household Survey (UHS) from six provinces, covering

the period of 1992–2006. We summarize stylized facts on household saving and

explore the factors we believe have driven the recent upward trend in household

saving. The role played by unique institutions, policies, and reform processes in China

is assessed.

    Lastly, based on the foregoing analysis of saving determinants, we argue that

systematic forces, such as slower economic growth, moderate export expansion, and

government plans to strengthen social welfare and population aging, are already set in

to induce a decline in aggregate saving. A saving rate of above 50 percent of the GDP

could already be a phenomenon of the past, and China would likely enter an era of a

more balanced growth.



II. Long-term Trends in Aggregate Saving


International Comparison

To document the special features of Chinese saving in light of international

experience, we make a cross-country comparison of national saving rates using the

WDI (World Bank, 2010). The WDI defines gross domestic saving as GDP less the

aggregate consumption expenditures based on data from national income accounts.

                                          3
Using this standard definition, we compare China’s saving rates for the period of

1978–2008 with those of countries from different income groups, BRIC economies of

Brazil, Russia and India, and selected developed economies.

     Figure 1A shows that the rate of aggregate saving in China has remained

persistently above 34 percent of the GDP since 1978, the year when systematic

economic reforms began. Therefore, high saving in China has been a long-term

phenomenon. Since 2000, there has been a surge in the saving rate, reaching a

startling 53.1 percent of the GDP in 2007. The saving rates of middle-income and

low-income groups have also increased but at a rate much slower than that of China.

In 2006, the latest year with available data on the saving rates of all country groups,

the saving rate of China (52.4%) was about 3.3 times higher than that of the low

income group (16.1%) and 2.4 times higher than the world average (22.1%).

     China’s high saving also stands out among those of the BRIC economies, as

shown in Figure 1B. In 2008, the national saving rate in China was 49.2 percent,

whereas the rate for Russia was 36.3 percent, India 32.9 percent, and Brazil 19.1

percent. Despite two erratic spikes in Russia’s saving series, there has been a recent

upward trend in saving for all three countries. Between 1998 and 2008, the saving rate

of Brazil increased by 4.1percentage points, Russia by 14.6 percentage points, and

India by 11.9 percentage points

     In contrast to the rising saving observed in the large and fast-growing developing

countries, the overall saving rates of industrialized economies have experienced a

gradual decline, as seen in Figure 1C. In the early 1990s, the level of saving in China


                                          4
was comparable with that of its rich East Asian neighbors, Japan and South Korea.

However, the saving rate of Japan continually declined after reaching a peak of 34.4

percent in 1991 until it dropped to a three-decade low of 25.2 percent in 2006. The

saving rates of the US, France, and the UK have either stagnated or experienced

chronic decline in the past three decades. Since 2000, the disparity in gross domestic

saving rates between China and the major developed countries has widened. By 2006,

the saving rate of China was 27.2 percentage points higher than that of Japan and 38.6

percentage points higher than that of the US. By 2007, the gap in gross saving

between China and South Korea grew to 22.1 percentage points, whereas the gaps in

France and the UK increased to 29 and 35 percentage points, respectively.



Components of Aggregate Saving

The high and rising aggregate saving in China can be analyzed by source through the

three components: households, enterprises, and the government. Earlier studies that

analyzed by-sector saving include Qian (1988) for the period of 1978–1984, Kraay

(2000) for 1978–1995, Kujis (2005, 2006) for 1990–2005, and Chamon and Prasad

(2010) for 1990–2005.

     At the inception of reforms in China in 1978, total household saving only

accounted for 6–7 percent of the GDP, whereas the government saving hovered

around 15–18 percent of the GDP (Qian, 1988; Kraay, 2000). Between 1978 and 1984,

the household saving continued to rise, and the government saving fell dramatically,

maintaining the aggregate saving rate at a stable level. The decline in government

savings persisted through the early 1990s.
                                             5
     In 1995, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) began to publish the FFA based

on the physical transitions of the national income accounting in the Statistical

Yearbook of China. With a three-year lag policy, the most recent data available for

this paper cover the period of 1992–2007.2 Whereas the WDI data cover a much

longer period, the FFA data have the advantage of reporting the composition of gross

domestic saving by household, business, and government, as well as information on

incomes and expenditures within each of the sectors. Figure 2 presents three

interesting observations.3 First, aggregate saving in China remained at a high level of

above 34.9 percent of the GDP for the entire period. Second, there was a recent surge

in saving rate by almost 17 percent from 1999 to 2007. Finally, all three sectors

contributed significantly to the upsurge of the gross national saving. Between 1999

and 2007, the share of corporate saving rose from 14.6–18.8 percent of the GDP, the

household saving from 16.7–22.2 percent, and the government from 2.6–10.8 percent.

Overall, the largest percentage increase, by 8.2 percent of the GDP, was the saving of

the FFA data.
3
   Yearly saving rates based on the FFA data have noticeable differences from the rates based on the
WDI data as reported in Figure 1, although the long-term trends are generally consistent. Comparing
these two data series, we find that from 1992 to 1999, the WDI measure was 2.8–6 percentage points
higher than the FFA measure. In 1999, their difference amounted to 5 percentage points. Since 2000,
however, the difference has become much smaller, except for 2006 when the FFA measure exceeded
the WDI measure by 2.9 percentage points. Note that these two measures of domestic saving rates have
the same definition, that is, (1- final consumption expenditure/GDP), and the final consumption
includes household consumption and general government consumption expenditures. Although there is
little difference in the ratio of government consumption to the GDP in the two data sets, the FFA data
report a higher ratio of household consumption to GDP especially for the periods 1992–1999 and
2005–2006. Therefore, the disparity in domestic saving rates comes mainly from the differences in
household consumption expenditures to the GDP. This disparity reflects in part the content of
household consumption in the two datasets. According to FFA statistics, household final consumption
expenditure includes not only monetary spending but also in-kind consumption, which could result in
higher ratios of household consumption to GDP in the FFA data. In addition, the WDI measure of the
final consumption in the GDP also includes any statistical discrepancy in the use of resources relative
to the supply of resources, which could contribute to the disparity in domestic saving rates between
FFA and WDI data.

the government.


The Chinese Saving Puzzle

In light of the historical trends and international comparisons, we consider the

Chinese saving puzzle to have four interrelated aspects: (a) persistently high saving

rates between 34 and 53 percent of the GDP in the past 30 years; (b) an outlier in

international comparisons, that is, having one of the highest saving rates among all

nations since 2000, and an outlier in cross-country regressions of saving

determination;4 (c) surge in gross domestic saving by 11 percentage points between

2000 and 2008 based on the WDI data;5 and (d) household saving as a share of GDP

experiencing the highest growth among the three sectors since the inception of

reforms in 1978.6 These observations jointly define the Chinese saving puzzle. We

consider it a puzzle because the fundamental forces shaping these special saving

patterns are still not well understood.

     In what follows, we use the FFA data to investigate the sources and causes of the

high and rising government and corporate saving in the period of 1992–2007 and use

UHS data to examine household saving in the period of 1988–2007. The time

coverage reflects data availability.


III. Corporate Saving
4
  Kraay (2000) uses a large sample of countries to investigate the cross-country determinants of saving
and finds that economy-wide saving in China is nearly 10 percentage points higher than what would be
expected based on standard determinants of national savings.
5
  Note that the FFA data reveal a generally consistent trend, although its data coverage ends in 2007.
6
  According to Qian (1988) and Kraay (2000), household saving accounted for only 6–7 percent of the
GDP in the late 1970s. As Figure 2 shows, however, household saving as a share of the GDP climbed to
22.2 percent in 2007, implying an increase of about 16 percent. In contrast, the combined savings by
the government and enterprises stayed roughly the same at about 30 percent of the GDP in the
beginning and ending years of the analysis.

                                                  7
The high corporate and government saving during the earlier years of reform reflects

the high-investment and heavy industry-oriented development strategy adopted in the

central planning period. Between 1965 and 1977, the gross national saving of China

averaged 27 percent of the GDP and had a small component of household saving

(Kraay, 2000). As the state influence of enterprise accumulation diminished with the

introduction of reforms, aggregate corporate saving declined to only about 13 percent

of the GDP in the late 1990s. What forces drove up corporate saving by about 6

percentage points of the GDP in the period of 1999–2007?

     The trend of rising enterprise saving is most commonly documented using the

FFA data from the national income accounts of China.7 As defined by FFA, enterprise

saving equals the value-added of both financial and non-financial companies minus

labor compensation, production taxes, net asset payments, and net transfer payments.8

In China, total enterprise saving is equivalent to the “total disposable income” of the

business sectors, but the concept is different from either net income or free cash flow

in the standard corporate finance literature. It is a concept very close to net income

plus depreciation and amortization. Thus, the formation of fixed capital, capital

transfers, changes in inventory, and equity investments are not included in the

calculation of enterprise saving.

     Using this definition of corporate saving in Chinese statistics, the legacy of the

high-accumulation strategy from the central planning and incomplete institutional

level data.

  More specifically, asset payments include interest payments, dividends, and land rentals, whereas
transfers include corporate income tax, social insurance fees, social subsidies, and social welfare
payments.

                                                    8
reforms can partially explain the high enterprise saving in the past three decades. For

instance, the suppression of wages, low interest payments on loans, and low land

rentals all tended to raise the disposable income of the enterprises, thus giving them

more opportunities to save.9 These forces of economic planning continued into the

reform era despite a gradual decline in the magnitude of the distortions over time.

However, aside from these institutional factors that influence the general level of

business saving, we argue that several factors have helped elevate enterprise saving in

the past decade.


Rising Profitability of Enterprises

The saving capacity of enterprises reflects their profitability. As shown in Figure 3,

the profitability of enterprises has generally improved since the early 1990s. While

the nominal firm profits increased more than 15 folds from 1992 to 2007, the ratio of

profits to industrial value added also improved remarkably from about 21 percent in

the late 1990s to close to 30 percent in 2007. Figure 4 provides corroborative

evidence that the share of enterprise income in the GDP rose from 13 percent in the

late 1990s to above 18 percent in 2007.

     The rise in corporate profitability is an outcome of a series of socioeconomic and

institutional changes implemented in China throughout the reform period. For

instance, the privatization of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the growth of private

enterprises are found to have induced more innovative efforts and raised the labor and

total factor productivity of the corporate sector (Jefferson and Su, 2006; Bai et al.,
9
  We are grateful to Leslie Young for making constructive suggestions on these arguments as well as
referring us to the related literature.

                                                9
2009). Labor market reforms involving the use of labor-incentive schemes, the

relaxation of worker mobility restrictions, and especially the massive rural-urban

migration have all contributed to the efficient functioning of firms. In particular, the

large flow of rural labor to cities, which was estimated at around 135 million in 2007

(Meng et al., 2010), has helped maintain low labor costs for business, a major factor

behind China’s emergence as the workshop of the world (Yang et al., 2010). Moreover,

China began implementing a large-scale privatization of SOEs in 1998 with the

objectives of improving corporate governance and maintaining the competitiveness of

the state sector in the national economy. From 1997 to 2003, the share of SOE

workers in urban employment dropped from 54.6–26.8 percent as the result of

enterprise restructuring (NBS, 1998, 2004). The productivity of the state sector rose,

and the competitive pressure also spread to raise the productivity of the non-state

sector.

     The rise in corporate saving, that is, 14.6–18.8 percent of the GDP from

1999–2007, was also attributable to China’s remarkable expansion in export

associated with its accession to the WTO. Beginning in the late 1990s, with the

anticipation of joining the WTO, China’s export growth accelerated. The momentum

of trade expansion continued after China’s accession to the WTO in 2001 as trade

barriers and tariffs continued to fall. Between 1999 and 2007, the export growth

reached an unprecedented 26 percent per annum (NBS, 2008). This expansion in

external demand handed China an opportunity to realize its potential comparative

advantage in trade. When exports were combined with equally remarkable FDI


                                          10
inflows as well as the imports of sophisticated intermediate inputs, these factors

jointly created a powerful force to increase firm productivity and profits.

     Trade expansion, and thus increases in corporate revenue, was facilitated by

trade policies in China. Since 1998, after the Asian financial crisis, China has initiated

a trade-promoting policy of rewarding tax rebates for exports (TRE). Since then, TRE

has become an important macroeconomic management policy. The value of the rebate

increased substantially after China’s accession to the WTO. Figure 5 shows that the

total volume of TRE increased from 115 billion Yuan in 2002 to 586.6 billion in 2008.

The size of these tax rebates was highly significant: in 2006, the total TRE received

by exporting firms was equivalent to 10 percent of aggregate corporate saving and

about 14 percent of government tax revenue in the same year. The TRE remained at

high levels throughout 2004–2008. Therefore, the expanded external demand and

favorable trade policies both helped raise the corporate earnings of Chinese firms with

the accession of China to the WTO.


Costs of Financing, Dividend Payments, and Labor Compensations

While export expansion and tax rebate added directly to the revenue of firms,

maintaining the low cost of production also contributed to the rise in the disposable

incomes of enterprises. Ma and Wang (2010) find that net interest payments as share

of the GDP by the non-financial corporate sector dropped by 50 percent between 1992

and 2007. In particular, SOEs financed their loans and paid their debts at interest rates

much lower than the prevailing market rates. If SOEs actually paid at market interest

rates, their existing profits, and thus their saving, would have been greatly reduced

                                           11
(Ferri and Liu, 2009). Moreover, enterprises managed to control labor compensation

during the same period. As shown in Figure 6, the share of labor compensation of

employees in the total value added of enterprises declined from an average of 41.2

percent in the 1990s to 37.5 percent in the 2000s, helping raise the enterprise saving

capacity. Although some stockholders earn dividends, total dividend payments only

accounted for a small proportion of the enterprise value added. Despite an upward

trend in dividend payments, the ratio of dividend to value added was still less than 0.5

percent by 2007 (Figure 6). Part of the story is that the Chinese government did not

ask SOEs to pay dividends until 2008 even though they had enjoyed improved profits

since the state-sector restructuring in the late 1990s. These aggregate statistics appear

to be consistent with firm-level data reported in Zhang (2008) that for a large sample

of Chinese firms in the period of 1999–2003, the average and median dividends to

earnings ratios were 0.35 and 0.16, respectively. Lower dividends translate directly to

more retained corporate earnings based on the FFA statistics.


Imperfect Capital Markets

Weaknesses in China’s financial sector motivated the enterprises, especially small and

medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to rely on their own saving to finance fixed-asset

investments. Despite the systematic financial reforms since the middle 1990s,

including the reconstruction of non-performance loans, banks in China still play a

limited role in channeling saving from frugal households to the enterprise sector (e.g.,

Hofman and Kuijs, 2006).

     Table 1 reports the sources of funding for fixed-asset investments in the period of

                                           12
1995–2007. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that bank credits are the main source

of financing, the share of domestic loans remained below 21 percent of the total

investments throughout the period. Instead, self-raised funds always accounted for the

largest share of contribution to investment. It is worth pointing out that the share of

self-raised funds in the total investment increased over time, rising from just below 50

percent in the middle 1990s to 64.8 percent in 2008. In other words, enterprise

investment relied more on self-retained earnings, whereas the importance of domestic

loans generally declined in the last decade. Therefore, the high saving of enterprises,

particularly among SMEs, can be interpreted as reflecting the difficulties in obtaining

financing from state banks because of the lack of collaterals required to secure loans.

     By 2008, the state budget and FDI contributed to about 7 percent of the total

fixed-asset investment. Informal and private financing channels, as represented by the

“others” category, accounted for 13.5 percent of the total financing; this share is

comparable in size with domestic loans. Therefore, despite the development and

commercialization of capital markets in China, formal financing through bank loans is

still limited. The weak financial sector creates the incentives for enterprise saving.


IV. Government Saving

Government in the FFA data refers to all levels of administrative units and non-profit

institutions affiliated with the state and local governments. Table 2 presents the data

series on consumption, saving, and detailed components of government disposable

income. The figures are expressed in nominal terms because selecting price deflators

for different variables is prone to arbitrariness, and our primary interest is the changes

                                            13
in yearly saving rates based on current prices. The share of government saving in

GDP fluctuated at a level below 4.4 percent in the period of 1992–1999, reaching the

lowest point at 2.6 percent in 1999. However, the figure had climbed since then,

reaching 10.8 percent in 2007.

    The government’s disposable income, which mainly consists of value added from

government production, incomes from properties, taxes on all production, income

taxes, and social insurance revenue but minus labor compensations, rose from 1608.9

billion Yuan in 1999 to 6308.4 billion Yuan in 2007, as indicated in column (6) of

Table 1. The rise in tax revenues on production, as reported in column (3), was the

largest contributor to the growth in government income during this period. The net tax

increased by 3058.5 billion Yuan, accounting for 65 percent of the increase in the

disposable income of government. The institutional foundation behind the rise in tax

revenues can be traced back to the famous 1994 Fiscal Reform in China that managed

to reverse a declining trend in state revenues beginning in the mid-1980s. The reform

aimed to boost revenue collections and reclaim the majority of the total revenue by

the central government (Bahl, 1999; Wong and Bird, 2008). From having a low share

of net revenue in the GDP in the earlier 1990s, the effective tax system, when

combined with an average annual GDP growth of about 10 percent, resulted in

continued rise in government revenue from 1999 to 2007.

    The second largest contributing factor to government disposable income is net

current transfers. According to more detailed FFA sources not reported in Table 1, the

government collected 1195.5 billion Yuan of income taxes and 1081.2 billion Yuan of


                                         14
social insurance fees in 2007, but only spent 1028 billion Yuan on social welfare

payments, social insurance provisions, and other transfers. As a result, the government

had a net gain of 1248.9 billion Yuan in net transfers in 2007, which is an increase of

1157.1 billion Yuan from the 1992 level, accounting for 25 percent of the growth in

government disposable income during the same period. Overall, the combined

increase in taxes on production and transfers added to about 90 percent of the growth

in disposable income from 1992 to 2007.

     Compared with the sharp increase in state income, the total growth of 2147.4

billion Yuan in consumption is still modest. As a result, government saving increased

by 2147.4 billion Yuan, translating to an 8.2 percentage-point increase in its share in

the GDP. This tally is consistent with the popular view of “Nation Rich, People Poor,”

which is now widely discussed in the public media in China. A piece of corroborative

evidence is that the share of household income in the GDP declined from 68.6 percent

in 1996 to 57.5 percent in 2007 (Figure 4). Although this view correctly describes the

changes in income positions of the government in the past two decades, China’s tax

revenue as a percentage of the GDP is still lower than that of major developed

economies, such as Japan, Germany, and the US.


V. Household Saving

Household saving in China rose substantially in the past three decades along with

economic reforms and fast income growth. As noted earlier, household saving only

accounted for 6–7 percent of the GDP in the late 1970s but grew to about 22 percent

in 2007 based on the FFA data (Figure 2). In what follows, we use more detailed UHS

                                          15
data to document the major features of the Chinese household saving in the period of

1988–2007. In light of these stylized facts, we provide a critical overview of the

existing literature and present our views on the main factors behind the rise in

household saving in China.


Data and Stylized Facts

The data we use come from 20 consecutive years of the UHS conducted by China's

NBS. The computer usable form of data began in 1988; the latest data are from 2007

due to the NBS one-year-lag policy for releasing household surveys. The UHS data

record basic conditions of urban households and detailed information on income,

employment, demographic characteristics of all household members, and detailed

consumption information in each calendar year. Our sample comes from five large

provinces (i.e., Liaoning, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Shannxi) and one

municipality (i.e., Beijing). These provinces are representatives of China both in

terms of income dispersions and geographical coverage.

    Household saving is computed as the difference between disposable income and

consumption expenditures on food, clothing, housing services, transportation,

communication, entertainment, education, medical care, and other miscellaneous

items. We also make use of demographic variables, such as young dependency (i.e.,

the ratio of children below 16 to adults aged between 16 and 55 for women and 60 for

men) and old dependency (i.e., the ratio of the elderly above 55 for women and above

60 for men to the working age population), to determine whether saving varies with

demographic structures. We limit our analysis to households whose heads are aged

                                        16
between 25 and 70, and exclude self-employed families due to difficulties in

computing family incomes.

     Table 3 reports the basic summary of statistics on the urban household sample.

The average household income grew from 14,918 Yuan in 1988 to 49,061 Yuan in

2007, increasing by more than three folds during the 20-year period. Likewise, the

average household consumption increased substantially, although at a rate slower than

income growth. As a result, the rate of urban household saving increased from 5.6

percent in 1988 to 26.9 percent in 2007. These trends are generally consistent with the

documented rise in household saving based on aggregate data.


Household Saving by Region and Income Level

Figure 7 shows that the Chinese household saving is positively related to household

incomes. More specifically, the four lines in the graph indicate the saving rates of four

income groups defined by their income quantiles. The saving rates of the lowest

income group (0–25 percent) fluctuated between 5 and 10 percent in most years,

ending at 7 percent in 2007. In contrast, the saving rate of the highest income quantile

(75–100 percent) began at 10 percent in 1988 and increased steadily and rapidly to

above 34 percent in 2007, a level that is 27 percentage points higher than that of the

lowest income group in that year. This pattern of higher saving among richer families

appears to be consistent with the observations in developed economies (e.g., Dynan et

al., 2004). Therefore, for China, the rise in household saving appears to be related to

the growing income inequality during the process of economic transition. These

patterns imply that income transfers from the rich to the poor can raise the propensity

                                           17
to consume in China today. We will revisit this point when discussing the effects of

proposed government policies on household saving in the concluding section of the

paper.

     Saving rates by region are presented in Figure 8, where we take a three-year

moving average saving rate for each region to mitigate fluctuations in the measure

because of the small size of the sample. The figure reveals that richer provinces, such

as Zhejiang and Beijing, have much higher average saving rates than the poor

provinces of Liaoning, Sichuan, and Shannxi. The gap in saving rate was initially

small in the late 1980s and early 1990s but grew significantly to about 10 percentage

points across regions in 2007. Overall, these patterns are consistent with the

documented saving rates by income.


Demographic Structures and Life Cycle Saving Profiles

Household saving decisions are pertinently related to their demographic structures.

As revealed in Table 4, family structures in urban China experienced substantial

changes in the past two decades. The average size of the household dropped from 3.5

in 1988 to 2.9 in 2007,10 whereas the average age of the household head increased

from 43.2 to 47.3, suggesting the advent of an aging society. The most striking pattern

in the table is the sharp decline in child dependency, which is defined as the

percentage of households with children below 16, from 68 percent in 1988 to 37

percent in 2007. The decline in child dependency is an outcome of the strict


10
   A household is defined as a residential unit where family members live and have meals together for an extended
period of time during the year of the survey. Therefore, family members who live outside the residential unit are
not counted as members of a household.

                                                       18
implementation of China’s one-child policy that began in earnest in 1979.

     We plot the saving rates for households of different demographic structures in

Figure 9. Persistent increases in saving rates are shown across different types of

households, rising by about 21 percentage points in the 20-year period on average.

Since the late 1990s, households with elderly experienced faster growth in saving than

the whole sample. Later on, we will discuss that this trend is consistent with the

decline in pension incomes for the retired; thus, families with elderly tend to save

more to insure smooth consumption. In contrast, households with children tend to

save less. This observation is consistent with the fact that costs of children have risen

rapidly in recent years. Therefore, for households with middle-aged heads, the

increase in their expenditures on raising children appears to have more than offset

their higher earnings, thus dragging down their household saving relative to those of

other households.

    Figure 10 presents the age-saving profiles by age of the household head for the

periods of 1988–1990 and 2005–2007. These profiles are perhaps the most important

empirical patterns we have documented for the household sector that shed light on the

changes in their saving over the two decades. As some age cells contain limited

number of observations, we deploy three-age and three-year moving average saving

rates to smooth the data series. The 1988–1990 age-saving profile reveals a relatively

flat “hump-shape,” which resembles the typical life cycle saving profiles observed in

other economies (e.g., Modigliani, 1970). However, the saving profile for 2007

exhibits a dramatic change: (a) saving rates for households of all ages increased


                                           19
substantially, and (b) the profile turns into a “U-shape” over the life cycle; that is, the

young and the old saved relatively more than the middle aged. These patterns are

consistent with the observations made by Chamon and Prasad (2010) for selected

Chinese provinces in the period of 1995–2005 and those documented in Song and

Yang (2010) and Ge, Yang and Zhang (2010) using the national sample of UHS data

covering the period 1992–2007. The two features of increasing household saving and

the “U-shaped” age-earning profiles present a challenge for understanding the

determination of household saving in China.



Understanding China’s High Household Saving

Given the size of the Chinese economy and the importance of the household sector,

considerable research has been devoted to understanding family saving decisions. A

number of early studies applied classical models of saving, which originated from the

studies of saving behavior in the developed market economies, to the case of China.

Among the well-known models are the Keynesian absolute-income hypothesis,

Modigliani-Brumberg’s      life-cycle   theory,   and   Friedman’s     permanent-income

hypothesis. These studies, including Chow (1985), Qian (1998), Wang (1995), and

Modigliani and Cao (2004), tested alternative hypotheses but ended with inconclusive

findings for the saving behavior of the Chinese. One challenging fact that hardly

reconciles with theory is that, instead of consuming more to smoothen lifetime

consumption, Chinese households continued to save more in anticipation of higher

future incomes. Moreover, the age-saving profiles of Chinese households gradually


                                            20
turned into a U-shaped pattern (Figure 10), which is inconsistent with the

hump-shaped profile implied by the life cycle hypothesis.

     Habit formation is an alternative theory that can explain the rise in household

saving during a period of rapid income growth (Carroll and Weil, 1994). The notion of

consumption inertia is related to a culture-based explanation to saving behavior. As

the Chinese are known to be thrifty, their consumption growth could have lagged

behind their income growth during the reform period, thus leading to higher

household saving. This argument is supported by the empirical finding that

provincial-level variations in household saving over time and space are influenced by

the lagged saving rates, a result consistent with the existence of inertia or persistence

(Horioka and Wan, 2007). However, the empirical evidence is inconclusive. As

Modigliani and Cao (2004) argue, the traditional and commonsensical explanation

(e.g., why Chinese households are thrifty) counts little, if at all. Indeed, from the

1950s to the mid-1970s, household saving rates in China were below 5 percent, and

the sudden spurt occurred during the reform period. Studies based on household data

also could not find evidence showing that the current consumption growth is

positively correlated with the past consumption growth (Chamon and Prasad, 2010).

Given that older cohorts usually carry more cultural tradition than younger cohorts,

Zhou (2007) rejects the thrifty factor as an important determinant of Chinese

household saving. Using the 1988–2003 China Health and Nutrition Surveys, he finds

that younger Chinese cohorts actually have a higher propensity to save than older

cohorts after controlling for other saving determinants.


                                           21
    Demographic changes induced by China’s population-control policies could have

an effect on household saving through two channels. First, as the nonworking

population consisting of the young and the old consumes without producing an

income, a rise in their share in the population tends to reduce national household

saving. Second, in a developing country without a mature social security system,

children often provide old-age support to their parents, and thus children act as an

effective substitute for life-cycle saving. Motivated by these factors, Modigliani and

Cao (2004) use the ratio of employed population to the number of minors up to age 15

to approximate demographic change. They find that the decline in the young

population dependency for the period of 1953–2000 increased Chinese household

saving through both effects of “less mouths to feed” and old-age security. However,

this time series evidence is not confirmed by panel data studies. Neither aggregate

dependency ratio (e.g., Kraay, 2000) nor separate accounts of the young and the old

dependency ratios (Horioka and Wan, 2007) are found to have a significant effect on

the household saving rates across Chinese provinces. Applying cohort analysis to data

from the UHS, Chamon and Prasad (2010) reach a similar conclusion that

demographic structural shifts do not go very far in explaining saving behavior in

China.

    Competitive saving motive is yet another demographic factor related to the

imbalanced sex ratio in China (Wei and Zhang, 2010). As the two authors argue, the

traditional preference for a son is widespread in China. With restrictive population

control policies, many families use the inexpensive type-B ultrasonic technology to


                                         22
detect the gender of fetuses and engage in sex-selective abortion, leading to a severe

imbalance in the sex ratio. The intensified competition among men for potential wives

stimulates households with a son to spend thriftily to accumulate wealth in order to

gain a competitive edge in the marriage market. Building on this idea, Wei and Zhang

use provincial panel data (1978–2006) to test the effect of sex ratio imbalance on

household saving. They show that the imbalanced sex ratio significantly increases

household savings, with approximately 68 percent of the increase in rural saving rate

and 18 percent of that in the urban rate being attributed to the rise in the sex ratio.

    Economic transitions in China not only involved a decline in the size of the state

sector but also made a transition from public provision of education, health care, and

housing services to private expenditures on these lumpy purchases. The uncertainty

associated with the transition could trigger precautionary motives to save. In

particular, by the mid-1990s, the Chinese government realized that its gradualist

reform policy could no longer manage the mounting losses of SOEs and decided to

take more aggressive steps, first allowing the privatization of small and medium SOEs

and then, beginning in 1997, moving forward with more aggressive restructuring. The

objective was to shut down losing SOEs, establish modern forms of corporate

governance, and de-link the provision of social services from individual employers.

This would be accomplished through the privatization of housing and the shifting of

the federal responsibility of health insurance, unemployment insurance, and pension

provisions to the local governments, employers, and employees themselves. These

aggressive reforms led to mass layoffs in SOEs. From 1996 to 2002, about 32 million


                                            23
workers were laid off from the state sector. Based on the 2001 China Urban Labor

Survey and the 2000 Population Census, Giles et al. (2005) estimate that the

unemployment rate of urban permanent residents increased from 6.1 percent in 1996

to 11.1 percent in 2002. Using independent population data sources, Knight and Xue

(2006) arrive at almost similar estimates, showing that China’s urban unemployment

rate increased gradually from 7.7 percent in 1995 to 11.5 percent in 2000.

    Given the earnings uncertainty and unemployment risk combined with liquidity

constraints and incomplete unemployment insurance, Chinese urban households that

experienced past income uncertainty appeared to have increased their propensity to

save in the period of 1995–1999 (Meng, 2003). Moreover, the predicted probability of

displacement had an even stronger effect on saving for households without

unemployed members. Although these findings are robust for the household sample

drawn from the specific period, reconciling the findings with the macroeconomic facts

is difficult. The reason is that, when the employment uncertainty associated with

state-sector restructuring continued to rise and reached its peak in the late 1990s,

household saving rate did not increase accordingly but rather fluctuated within a

narrow range of 16.2–18.1 percent during the second half of the 1990s (Table 3).

Therefore, the precautionary saving motive stemming from employment uncertainty

does not seem to explain well the surge in household saving since 2000.

    Accompanied with the state sector reforms, budget allocations for education,

health care, and housing services declined substantially. For instance, expenditures on

health and education only accounted for 2 percent of household consumptions in 1995,


                                          24
but this share rose to 14 percent by 2005. Chamon and Prasad (2010) argue that these

rising private financial burdens could induce higher household saving, as younger

families accumulate assets for future education spending, older families prepare for

uncertain health expenditures, and most people save to prepare for mortgage

payments or housing upgrades. Although these are plausible factors, their quantitative

effects on savings are difficult to assess. Conceptually, as most of the young adults

have already finished their own education, there is no need to save for that purpose;

they might have incentives to accumulate assets for their children’s education.

However, the increase in their saving could be offset by the reduced saving of older

families who have to incur higher education costs for their children who are already in

school. Similar compositional effects exist for health care and housing expenditures,

as higher costs tend to reduce the saving rates of those households that incur higher

expenditures in specific years. So far, existing studies have not yet systematically

assessed the combined effects on saving across different population groups.

    The changes in age-saving profiles between the periods of 1988–1990 and

2005–2007 shown in Figure 10 reveal several key features of the saving behavior of

the Chinese households. A successful model that resolves the Chinese household

saving puzzle should explain not only the rise in household saving but also the

U-shaped age-saving profiles over the life cycle in recent years. Two recent studies,

Song and Yang (2010), and Ge, Yang, and Zhang (2010), are particularly motivated to

explain the stylized patterns of Chinese household savings as shown in Figure 10.

Using the comprehensive data from Chinese UHS covering the period of 1992–2007,


                                          25
Song and Yang document three dramatic changes in the life cycle earnings in China’s

fast-growing environment that are new to the existing literature: (a) there are large

upward shifts in the earnings of successive younger worker cohorts, (b) individual

age-earning profiles have become flattened during the past two decades, and (c) the

aggregate pension replacement rate, which is defined as the ratio of average pension

per retiree to average wages per worker in specific years, declined from about 80

percent in the early 1990s to a range of 52–58 percent in 2007. Incorporating these

features of the Chinese economy into a dynamic optimization model of heterogeneous

agents, they show that an otherwise standard intertemporal choice model can account

well for the recent surge in household saving as well as the U-shaped age-saving

profiles over the life cycle.

    Ge, Yang, and Zhang (2010) emphasize the interplay between China’s population

control policies and saving behavior based on an overlapping generation model. They

find that, among several intergenerational linkages, reduced fertility resulting from the

implementation of the one-child policy contributed significantly to the recent rise in

household saving. Their arguments, complementing the findings of Song and Yang

(2010), help explain several special features of household saving in China.




VI. Prospects of China’s High National Saving

The high and rising national saving is a critical component of China’s macroeconomic

imbalances and is believed by some to be an important contributor to the global

saving glut. Indeed, the high aggregate saving rate of about 50 percent of the GDP in


                                           26
recent years not only surpassed the peak saving levels of Japan, Korea, and other East

Asian economies during the years of their miracle growth rates but also has been the

highest in the world among economies of significant size. This remarkably high

national saving has supported China’s high-investment, export-led growth model. As

national saving has exceeded the total investment in recent years, and exports have

exceeded imports, China’s large current account surplus has become an important part

of the global imbalances. We show in this paper that corporate, household, and

government sectors have all contributed significantly to the upsurge in national saving

in the past decade. The key causes include China’s fast economic growth, accession to

the WTO accession, rising corporate profits, changes in life cycle earnings, pension

system, other provisions of social services, and the demographic transition.

    In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the Chinese economy is facing a

series of challenges; responses to these challenges will likely evolve into systematic

structural adjustments. After more than a decade of heavy public investments in basic

infrastructure, the diminishing returns on similar projects will likely set in, and due to

external pressure, China is likely to experience relatively moderate export growth in

the future and has no choice but to pursue a more balanced current account. These

broad projections imply that China will have to rely increasingly on vigorous

domestic demands to assure sustained growth, structurally reforming the previous

high-investment, export-led growth strategy. Hence, the transition from a high-saving

to a high-consumption regime will be at the center of public attention and policy.

    Based on the previous analysis of saving determinants and imminent


                                           27
macroeconomic, demographic, and policy trends into the future, we assert that the

Chinese national saving may have already peaked at around 2007. A main reason

behind this judgment is the likely slowdown in China’s future growth, which is

projected at an average annual rate of 8.1 percent for 2011–2015 by the World Bank

(World Bank, 2010) and an even lower range of 5.37–7.27 percent for 2010–2020 by

the Asian Development Bank (Lee and Hong, 2010). The national saving is positively

correlated with economic growth (e.g., Carroll and Summers, 1991; Deaton and

Paxson, 2000). Using 2.52 as the growth elasticity of national saving for China for

1978–2000 (Modigliani and Cao, 2004), the decline in average GDP growth from 9.8

percent in the past decade to 8.1 percent as forecast by the World Bank for the next

five years would reduce China’s aggregate saving rate by about 4.3 percentage points.

Our previous analysis is suggestive of the channels of the effect. Slower GDP growth

will mean reduced growth in value-added production tax and reduced income tax for

the government, and therefore a lower saving rate if the government’s consumption

growth is held stable. Our foregoing analysis of corporate earnings suggests that

slower GDP growth will also imply reduced capacity for corporate saving.

    The corporate sector will likely have a lower saving/GDP ratio in the foreseeable

future because of the gradual decline over time in China’s gains resulting from its

accession to the WTO, the initiation of dividend payments for the state sector, and the

pending increase in labor costs. As the largest shareholder, the state did not require

SOEs to pay dividends in the past. However, with rising profits after the state-sector

restructuring in the late 1990s, the Chinese government started to require dividend


                                          28
payments in 2008. This policy could squeeze corporate saving.

    Moreover, reports of labor unrest in China are increasing, including news on

labor strikes in Toyota and Honda joint-venture plants and the string of worker

suicides at the Foxconn facilities in early 2010. Sentiments favoring the protection of

the rights of workers have grown in China as revealed by both media and government

sources. By July 2010, 18 provinces had announced increases in minimum wages by

an average of 20 percent. Nationwide increases in the minimum wage will likely

spread to nine more provinces by the end of the year. Given the decline in the share of

labor income in the GDP (Figure 4), there have been reports that the Chinese

government plans to raise the wages of production workers systematically as a way to

boost domestic production and move the economy away from the reliance on exports

for growth (Ho, 2010). The National Development and Reform Commission, which

formulates and coordinates national economic policies, have been developing an

income redistribution reform plan that is likely to be incorporated into the 12th

five-year plan for the period of 2011–2015. Although we do not intend to analyze the

efficiency loss and welfare consequences of implementing such policies, transferring

income from high-income to low-income groups under Chinese conditions, ceteris

paribus, may indeed lower the average household saving rate because low-income

families have higher propensity to consume (Figure 7). In addition, higher labor costs

may suppress the profits of enterprises, thus reducing the capacity of corporate

entities to save.

    Other evolving forces are also likely to reduce household saving in the


                                          29
foreseeable future. The inevitable slowdown in the growth of labor earnings will

likely occur across all age groups in conjunction with a gradual steepening of

age-earning profiles, a reversal of what is observed during the period of extraordinary

income growth (Song and Yang, 2010). Over time, the life cycle earnings in China

will converge gradually to the typical earnings profiles observed in more advanced

economies. The combined effects of slower earnings growth and the steepening of

age-earnings profiles will reduce household saving. As Song and Yang point out, the

existing pension contributions under the three-pillared system have fallen far behind

the targeted levels. However, in the coming years, the pension system is likely to be

improved to meet the targeted provisions better. A more robust retirement system will

lead to two consequences. First, with a higher level of pension replacement and thus

less retirement risk, individuals will have less pressure to save during their working

time. Second, a more complete implementation of the three-pillared pension system

will gradually raise the contribution of employers from the current 5 percent of

average wages to the policy target of 17 percent wage taxes. This change will again

reduce the capacity of enterprises to save.

    Population aging in the next several decades will have an effect on aggregate

saving as well. According to projections made by the United Nations Population

Council, China’s dependency ratio, which is defined as the sum of the young aged 14

or below and the old aged 65 or above divided by the working population aged

between 15 and 64, has reached the lowest level at 38.5 percent in 2010 (Figure 11).

However, this ratio will rise dramatically to 64.7 percent in 2050, a level comparable


                                              30
to the US figure of 67.7 percent in that year. What drives this rising trend is age

dependency: the percentage of population aged 65 or above will increase from the

current 11.5 percent to an astounding 38.9 percent in 2050, a level higher than that of

Japan (37.8 percent) and the US (21.6 percent) projected for that year. Rising

dependency ratio, especially for the old, will likely reduce aggregate household

saving through not only the more mouths to feed effects but also the fact that old

dependency is generally associated with lower personal saving in high-income

economies. This demographic trend has already set in to influence saving, labor

markets, and other aspects of the Chinese economy.

     The reasons behind the high and rising national saving in China in the last

decade are complex. Our medium-term outlook suggests a declining trend in Chinese

saving that will help facilitate the transition from an investment-driven growth model

to a growth paradigm that increasingly relies on the role of domestic consumption.

Radical policy interventions that aim to stimulate consumption, such as the proposed

dramatic increases in minimum wage and income-doubling plan for production

workers in five years, would be risky and unwise. Our view is that reliance on the

momentum of market and demographic forces, when combined with policies such as

building a robust social security system, can help China achieve a successful
