Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) have been shown to increase human capital investments, but their
standard features make them expensive. We use a large randomized experiment in Morocco to estimate
an alternative government-run program, a “labeled cash transfer” (LCT): a small cash transfer made
to fathers of school-aged children in poor rural communities, not conditional on school attendance
but explicitly labeled as an education support program. We document large gains in school participation.
Adding conditionality and targeting mothers make almost no difference. The program increased parents’
belief that education was a worthwhile investment, a likely pathway for the results.

1. Introduction

This paper evaluates the impact of a “labeled cash transfer” (LCT), as an alternative to conditional
cash transfers for education. Ever since the pioneer PROGRESA program in Mexico in the late
nineties, conditional cash transfers, or CCTs, are large in amount, targeted at poor households
within a community, conditional on regular school attendance, and paid out to mothers. The
program we evaluate features small transfers, targeted to poor communities (with all households
eligible in those communities), and paid out to fathers. 2 The program is unconditional but retains an
implicit endorsement of education through its school-based enrollment procedure. This program
was designed and implemented on a (randomized) pilot basis by Morocco’s Ministry of Education.
Within the same experiment, conducted over 600 communities, we estimate the value added by
typical CCT features, namely: (1) making the transfer explicitly conditional on regular attendance,
(2) making payments to mothers instead of fathers, and (3) doing both at the same time.

A large body of rigorous evidence, based on CCT programs implemented around the world over the
last 15 years, demonstrates their ability to affect households’ investments in education and health
(see Fizbein, Schady et al. (2009) for a review and Saavedra and Garcia (2012) for a recent meta-
analysis). A potential drawback of CCTs as currently designed, however, is that two of their standard
features, targeting (typically, individual level proxy-means testing) and conditionality, make them
expensive to administer. These two features have been estimated to account for 60% of the
administrative costs of PROGRESA (Caldes, Coady and Maluccio, 2006) 49% of the costs for RPS in
Nicaragua, and 31% for PRAF in Honduras.

A further drawback of both targeting and conditionality is that they have the potential to lead to the
exclusion of the people that policymakers would most like to aid. In Indonesia, Alatas et al. (2012a)
find that a proxy-means test mimicking the government’s standard practice incorrectly excluded
52% of truly poor households (based on their consumption level) from the list of beneficiaries for a
large cash assistance program, while it incorrectly included 18% of non-poor households. In Malawi,
under a program whose ultimate goal was to improve female adolescent health, girls who dropped
out of school and lost their cash transfer eligibility transitioned into marriage and childbearing
faster than comparable girls sampled for unconditional transfers (Baird et al., 2011). Furthermore,
conditionality can reduce the effectiveness of transfer programs by discouraging some households
to even apply for them.

2In our context, paying out to father is much less constraining than paying out to mothers and is seen as the
“normal” way to proceed.

                                                       2
Yet, both targeting and conditionality play important roles in existing CCT programs. Transfers are
in part redistributive, and it would not be feasible within the budgets of developing countries to
provide all citizens with unconditional transfers worth 20% of a poor household’s consumption (to
take the example of PROGRESA). Targeting is therefore critical. Regarding conditionality, several
recent studies have shown that the incentives that conditionality (or at least perceived
conditionality) give to parents may have an additional impact on educational investments, beyond
the pure income effect that comes about from unrestricted cash transfers. De Brauw and Hoddinott
(2011) exploit the fact that PROGRESA, due to administrative issues, made unconditional transfers
to a set of beneficiaries to compare educational outcomes of both groups. They find no effect of
conditionality on the likelihood that children attend primary school, but a significant difference
among those making the transition from primary to secondary school. Barrera-Osorio et al. (2011)
find that making transfers conditional on secondary school graduation significantly improves
educational achievement. Baird et al. (2011) run an experiment to compare a CCT to a UCT
(Unconditional Cash Transfer) in Malawi between 2007 and 2009. They find that conditioning cash
transfers on school attendance increases the effectiveness of the program at keeping adolescent
girls in school, but, as mentioned above, decreases its effectiveness at averting teen pregnancy and
marriage. Also in an experiment, Akresh et al. (2013) compare a UCT to a CCT conditional on
enrollment in Burkina Faso. They argue that CCTs lead to larger impacts than UCTs among girls, and
initially out-of-school children, though not for boys and children already enrolled. 3

Given this tension between, on the one hand, the administrative and human costs of targeting and
incentives, and, on the other hand, the fact that they do play a role given the scale of existing CCTs, a
natural question is whether it is possible to retain at least some of the human capital benefits of
CCTs through a much more limited program. Under the standard economic theory underlying CCTs,
conditionality provides economic incentives for households, but those should only have bite if the
programs are sufficiently large that the households stand to lose something if they do not comply. At
the same time, there is evidence that even small conditional transfers have positive effects on
human capital investment (see Banerjee et al. (2010) on incentives for vaccinations, and Filmer and
Schady (2008) on the impact of a small CCT in Cambodia). This suggests that economic incentives
may not be the only factor at play in CCT. In other words, a “nudge” may be sufficient to significantly
increase human capital investment, while CCTs as currently designed provide a big shove. By

3 Conditionality has also been shown to matter for health behavior outcomes. Attanasio, Oppedisano and Vera-

Hernández (2013) estimate that, in the Colombian program Familias en Acción, children would receive 86%
less preventive care visits if the program was not conditional on these visits.


                                                     3
offering a small cash transfer and tying it loosely to the goal of education, a government may be able
to make the importance of education salient and increase the demand for it even without formal
incentives. A small cash transfer would not need to be targeted at the household level, since the
budgetary implications of inclusion errors (giving it to less poor people) would not be large, and if
the explicit incentives are replaced by an implicit endorsement, this removes the need for
monitoring.

We evaluate such a program in Morocco, and test the added benefits of attaching more strings to it
(conditionality and gender of the recipient), keeping the main features (small size and community
targeting only) constant. We were contacted by the government of Morocco who wanted our help in
conducting an evaluation of a new CCT program, Tayssir, aimed at increasing the rural primary
school completion rate, which stood below 60% as of 2008. They had in mind a small transfer to
households with children aged 6-15, conditional on enrollment and attendance, paid out to fathers,
and targeted at the community level (meaning all households with eligible children in targeted
communities could receive the transfer). The transfer amount increased with age/grade but
remained modest: the average annual transfer per household equaled about 5% of their annual
expenditures, compared to 20% in the PROGRESA program. We proposed to add two components to
the planned evaluation: compare it to an unconditional component, and compare it to a more
standard version where transfers are given to mothers. The Ministry of Education (the Ministère de
l'Education Nationale, or MEN), which was administering the program, was very keen that even an
unconditional form of the program should be framed as an education intervention. Thus, even for
children who were not enrolled in school, the enrollment for Tayssir was done through schools, by
headmasters.

Over 320 school sectors (with at least two communities each) were randomly assigned to either a
control group or one of four variants of the program: LCT to fathers, LCT to mothers, CCT to fathers
and CCT to mothers. Using objective measures of school participation (collected through surprise
school visits by the research team) for over 44,000 children, and detailed survey data for over 4,000
households, we find large impacts of cash transfers on school participation under all versions of the
program, with larger impacts for the LCTs. Over two years, the LCTs reduced the dropout rate by
around 70% among those enrolled at baseline; increased re-entry by 85% among those who had
dropped out before the baseline; and cut the share of never-schooled by 43%. The LCTs had
modestly positive, though insignificant, impacts on math scores. While the CCTs also had a large
positive effect on school participation, explicitly conditioning transfers on attendance significantly


                                                  4
decreased their impact in the context of this program. In particular, relative to LCTs, CCTs lowered
the impact on re-enrollment of children who had dropped out, perhaps because conditionality
discouraged some households (or some teachers) from enrolling weaker children in the program.
Correspondingly, CCTs also had a significantly lower impact than LCTs on math scores (CCTs had no
impact whatsoever, with negative point estimates). We find very little difference in impacts between
transfers made to mothers and those made to fathers.

Note that the comparison between LCTs and CCTs tells us little about the question that other papers
in the literature have addressed, namely how an unconditional and unlabeled cash transfer program
would compare to a CCT. Instead, we study a program where transfers are not conditioned on
school participation but school enrollment is strongly encouraged. Indeed, because registration for
both LCTs and CCTs was done by school headmasters on the school compound, one reason behind
the large impacts of LCTs seems to be that they increased the salience of education as much as CCTs.
By the end of the second year, parents’ beliefs about the returns to education had increased in all
groups, and so had their beliefs about the quality of the local school, even though neither of these
two dimensions was affected by the cash transfers. This is consistent with parents interpreting the
introduction of a pro-education government program, whether it formally requires regular school
participation or not, as a signal that education is important. In line with this, in all groups, there was
a large reduction in dropouts reported due to “child not wanting to attend school” and to “poor
school quality.”

Our results also bring attention to the fact that complex government programs may not always be
understood easily, and therefore some of the expected benefits of imposing rules (e.g.
conditionality) can be lost in implementation. We took care in our data collection to elicit beliefs
from teachers and parents regarding the rules governing the cash transfer program in their
community. While teachers had a relatively good understanding of the program in their specific
community, among parents we see only minor differences between CCT and LCT communities, in
both years 1 and 2, in how the programs were perceived. In the first year, in both groups about 50%
of the parents thought the transfers were conditional on attendance. This means that half of the
parents in the LCT group wrongly believed the transfers were conditional on attendance, and half of
the parents in the CCT group did not know they were. We thus cannot reject that parents in either
group had no idea and just guessed when asked about conditionality. By the second year over 80%
of parents in the LCT communities had understood that the program was unconditional, but most
parents in the CCT communities also perceived transfers as unconditional, most likely because


                                                    5
absence rates are low in Morocco, and few children saw their transfers docked. Thus the gap in
perceived conditionality between LCT and CCT, while significant statistically at the end of year 2,
was less than 5 percentage points. This could explain why we see little impact of adding
conditionality above and beyond labeling. Importantly, however, the fact that school participation
impacts stayed large for both LCT and CCT programs in year 2, when a great majority of parents
believed transfers were not conditional on attendance, implies that the confusion regarding the
rules is not the reason behind the success of the LCT.

Overall, our results suggest that cash transfer programs may work in part by changing how parents
perceive education. Of course, much larger transfers may have even larger effects on education,
particularly if they are conditional and stringent (as the previous studies looking at the impact of
conditionality have found). But just changing perceptions seems to be getting a long part of the way.
This is consistent with the recent literature showing that the perceived returns to education are an
important determinant of the demand for education, but in developing countries, information about
these returns is often imperfect (Jensen, 2010; Jensen, 2012; Kaufmann, 2012; Nguyen, 2008).

To summarize, the LCT program was as effective at increasing education as traditional CCTs have
been in other contexts, and cost much less. First, the transfers were small: the average household
transfer represented around 5% of household consumption, compared to a range of 6% to 27% for
existing CCTs in middle-income countries. 4 What’s more, despite the small transfer amounts, the
ratio of administrative costs to transfers was favorable to the Tayssir program: 10% compared to a
range of 10% to 50% in other programs for which costs are documented. 5 Overall we estimate that
the cost per extra year of education in the Tayssir program was at least 40% cheaper than it was in
the education arm of the PROGRESA program. Of course, PROGRESA and other CCTs had other
objectives besides increasing education, and, as such, a cost-benefit analysis focusing on
education does not account for the entire value of such programs. But the comparison suggests
that, for a government focused on increasing education, a LCT could be a viable option from a
cost perspective.

only amounting to 3% of household consumption.

cost-transfer ratio is reported for a shorter period than the rest of the programs. For example, Progresa
reached a cumulative cost-transfer of 10% after 4 years of implementation and 2,600,00 beneficiaries by the
end of the period. During the first two years of Progresa pilot, the cost-transfer ratio represented 1.22 and
0.28 (vs 0.11 and 0.08 for Tayssir).

2. Background and Experimental Design

2.1. Background
Morocco is a lower middle income country, with a GDP per capita estimated at $3,000 in 2011
($5,100 in PPP terms). Education levels in the general population are still relatively low, with only
about 56% of the population literate. As of 2006, the Ministry of Education estimated that while
over 87% of rural children started primary school, 40% dropped out before completing the full 6
years of primary education.

How much children learn may be limited, even if they are in school. Morocco ranked 59 out of 69
countries in the math scale for eighth-graders of the TIMMS international tests, and 64 out of 70 on
the science scale. This may be due to relatively poor schooling infrastructure in rural areas, and to
relatively low motivation levels among teachers, who may resent being posted in remote locations.

Despite this, “Mincerian” estimates of the returns to schooling appear large even among rural
households. We present some evidence on this (based on our baseline survey data) in Appendix
Table A1. Primary school completion for either the male or the female head of the household is
correlated with 20% higher consumption at the household level, and these effects are additive. Of
course, part or all of these correlations could be driven by selection effects.


2.2. Experimental Design
Tayssir was targeted at the geographic level. The pilot took place in the five poorest regions of
Morocco (out of sixteen administrative regions), and within those regions, in the poorest rural
municipalities (administrative units called “communes” in Morocco) with high dropout rates at the
primary school level. 6 A total of 320 rural primary school sectors (close to 65% of all school sectors
in the selected regions) were sampled for the study in those municipalities. Each rural school sector
has a well-identified catchment area validated by the Delegation de l’Education Nationale, the
provincial-level authority for education policy. A school sector includes a “main” primary school unit
and several “satellite” school units (four on average). Satellite units fall under the authority of the
headmaster of the main unit, and sometimes offer only lower grade classes.

Figure A1 summarizes the experimental design. Out of the 320 school sectors in the study, 260 were
randomly selected to participate in the Tayssir pilot program. These school sectors constitute the

treatment group. The other 60 sectors in the sample were selected to constitute the comparison
group. 7 The 260 school sectors in the treatment group were subdivided randomly into four
subgroups, with a two-by-two design: conditional on attendance or simply labeled as designed to
facilitate educational investments (“Tayssir” means facilitation in Arabic); and father-beneficiary vs.
mother-beneficiary. The groups were not even in size: while the father vs. mother split was 50%-
50%, the conditional vs. labeled only split was 69%-31%. 8

Two school sectors (one in the control group and one in the treatment group) had to be dropped
after the randomization because floods rendered them completely inaccessible to the research team
during baseline, leaving us with a final sample of 318 school sectors. Thus, we ultimately have 59
schools in the control group, 40 school sectors in the LCT-to-fathers group, 40 school sectors in the
LCT-to-mothers group, 90 schools sectors in the CCT-to-fathers group and 89 school sectors in the
traditional-style CCT-to-mothers group.

School sectors participating in the pilot program were selected such that they would be relatively
far from each other, which limited the risk that parents transferred their children from control to
treatment schools or from CCT to LCT schools, as well as other forms of externalities. 9

Table 1 presents summary statistics for schools in the control sample (column 1), differences
between the control group and the LCT-to-fathers group (column 2), as well as differences between
the LCT-to-fathers group and the three variants with added components (columns 3-5). 10 Schools in



7 The randomization was stratified by region, school size, dropout rate and by whether the government was

planning to make improvements to school infrastructure within the two-year time frame of the evaluation.
8
 The reason why there was more CCT than LCT schools is that, in an attempt to estimate the intensity with
which conditionality needs to be monitored if it ends up mattering, each of the two CCT groups was randomly
subdivided in three more subgroups of equal size. In one group, teachers were in charge of recording absences
in a register that was then passed on to the central Tayssir administration determining payment amounts
(“light monitoring”). In the second group, the same system was used, but to encourage accurate reporting,
teachers were informed that their registers would be audited through unannounced school visits by school
inspectors (“moderate monitoring”). In the third group, in addition to the teachers filling registers, biometric
machines were installed in the classrooms to record child attendance daily through fingerprint recognition
(“full monitoring”). In practice, neither the moderate nor the full monitoring arms could be implemented.
School inspectors were reluctant to perform audits and the biometric machines proved too fragile or error-
prone to be reliable. As a result, the “light monitoring” system was used to enforce conditionality in all schools
in the CCT groups and we therefore lump all three subgroups for the analysis.
9 The median distance between any two school sectors in the regions of study is six kilometers, which is quite

large considering that 99.5% of children in our sample report walking to school. The median distance between
any two school sectors in the experimental sample is even larger by design.
10 This table follows the same format as the main regression tables below. As explained in more details in

section 4, column 2 presents estimates on the differential characteristics for schools sampled in the LCT-to-
fathers group compared to control group schools. Columns 3 to 5 present estimates on the differential effect of

the sample are relatively small, with an average enrollment in grades 1 to 5 of only 77 pupils. Over
60% of classes are taught in multi-grade groups. Only 42% of the students are girls, suggesting that
girls are less likely to be enrolled than boys. Schools are quite poor, with only 19% of the classrooms
equipped with electricity and just about half equipped with latrines/toilets. Overall, the control and
LCT-to-fathers groups appear relatively well balanced with respect to observable characteristics:
one out of 12 of differences estimated are significant at the 10% level. There are, however, some
differences between the CCT and LCT groups, and some differences between father and mother
groups. In the analysis, we control for the two baseline school characteristics that are imbalanced at
baseline (remoteness and electricity) as well as student characteristics (age and gender). The
control variables do not affect the results.



2.3. The Tayssir Cash Transfer Program
The Tayssir program consisted of cash payments made to parents of primary school age children (6
to 15). The cash allowance was increasing with age, starting from 60 Moroccan dirhams (MAD) per
month (~$8 in 2008 USD) per child old enough for grades 1 or 2 (6-7 years old), to 80 MAD per
month (~10 USD) per child old enough for grades 3 and 4 (8-9 years old), to 100 MAD per month
(~13 USD) per child old enough for grades 5 and 6 (10-11 years old). Thus for young children the
cash allowance for a year (10 school months) was up to 600 MAD, and for the older children it was
up to 1,000 MAD. This compares favorably to (very modest) yearly schooling expenditures, reported
at 180 MAD on average per child in primary school in our control group, suggesting that the
transfers were ample enough to compensate for at least the direct costs of schooling. But the
transfers are very small compared to most CCTs: the monthly transfer for a child in grade 3 to 4, for
example, represents 2.7% (3%) of the mean (median) monthly household consumption level in our
sample (and still only 6.3% of the monthly consumption level of households at the bottom 5th
percentile). The transfer that the average household was eligible for represented 5% of the average
monthly consumption. In contrast, the range for traditional CCTs is between 6% and 27% of mean
monthly household consumption (World Bank, 2009). In PROGRESA, the average transfer for grade
3 to grade 6 was $14 and the total monthly average transfer received by households was $43, which
corresponds to 20% of household consumption. 11

Parents had to formally enroll each of their children into the program. Headmasters, who had been
trained through group-specific province-level meetings just before the start of the academic year,
were responsible for disseminating information to parents of school-age children about the program
and its rules, and for enrolling them. For all groups, unconditional and conditional, this enrollment
took place at the primary school, and required the presence of the designated beneficiary (the father
or the mother, depending on which experimental group the school sector was in). In both years, the
open enrollment period started at the beginning of the school year (early September) and lasted for
approximately three months. Children who had been enrolled into the program in year 1 were
automatically re-enrolled in year 2 provided the school headmaster forwarded their names to the
provincial authorities.

In the LCT groups, the transfer was fixed and not conditional on attendance or continued
enrollment, but parents still had to enroll their child in the Tayssir program yearly in order to
receive the money. While in the original design enrolling in school at the beginning of the year was
not a condition for enrolling in Tayssir, in practice the two turned out to be linked: enrollment in the
Tayssir program was done at school by the headmaster, and de facto children were systematically
registered and enrolled in a grade by the headmaster at the same time they were registered for
Tayssir (if not yet enrolled). (School registration is free in rural areas of Morocco). The fact that
Tayssir enrollment took place at the school, even when continued school enrollment was not
required to receive the transfers, is an important feature, because drawing applicants into that
environment served to link the program to education. Indeed, it made it very clear and salient to
households that the transfers were coming from and overseen by the Ministry of Education, and
were part of an effort to promote education. The flyers that schools were given to advertise the
program showed schoolchildren sitting at their school desk and studying. This is why we call this a
Labeled Cash Transfer (LCT).

In the CCT groups, the transfer was formally conditional on enrollment and regular attendance. The
rule was that the allowance for a given month and a given child would be cancelled if the child
missed school more than four times over that month. Absences from school caused by the teacher’s
absence were excluded from this count. Headmasters, teachers and school committees received
guidelines from the Ministry of Education on how to monitor and record attendance and how to
submit reports every two months to the provincial-level program manager at the Ministry. The
reports included, for each month, the total number of absences for each child enrolled in the
program. These reports were then digitized by the provincial-level program managers, and shared,


                                                  10
through an integrated information system, with the central management team at Ministry of
Education. The central management team determined whether the conditionality had been
respected and estimated the amounts that each household should receive for any given month. This
process was time-consuming and created important delays, especially early on, as described below.

Headmasters were instructed to enroll only mothers or only fathers, depending on which variant of
the program the school was in. There was however an exception policy: households with a written
authorization from the Moqadem (the local representative of the Moroccan administration) could
enroll another adult in the household. Exceptions were typically granted when the sampled
recipient did not live at home (for example, if the father worked in the city and came home only a
few times a year, the mother was allowed to enroll instead). Overall, as we discuss below,
compliance with the gender assignment was above 80%.

The cash transfers were disbursed to the assigned recipients (upon presentation of a national ID
card) at the local post office. Areas that did not have a post office (about a third of the sample)
received the visit of a “mobile cashier” in charge of distributing the transfers. On average, the cost of
a round trip to the nearest pick-up point was around 20 MAD or 8% of the average transfer.
However, if they wanted to save on transportation costs, recipients could wait and withdraw all
their transfers at once.

Overall, program take-up is very high: 97% of households in our household sample had at least one
child enrolled in Tayssir by the end of year 2, and the take-up rate at the household level was almost
identical across all four treatment groups. Households had on average two children enrolled in the
program. This is much higher than the take-up of a CCT program in Indonesia, for which poor
households had to register by showing up on a specific registration day: Alatas et al. (2012b) find
that only 61% of the very poorest households (those guaranteed eligibility) signed up (and the sign-
up rate is lower among all income groups). The take-up rate in our household sample may be an
overestimate of the overall take-up rate, however, since our household sample excludes households
with no prior contact with the local school (given our sampling strategy, discussed in section 3.2).
Our household sample also over-represents households living relatively close to the school. To the
extent that headmasters played an important role in contacting households they knew or who lived
nearby, take-up in our sample is an upper bound of overall take-up. Contrasting the administrative
records on Tayssir enrollment at the municipality level with the (very noisy) data on total number
of households in a given municipality as reported by the local chief (the Moqadem) confirms the



                                                   11
take-up rate was quite high, however, with the ratio between the two at 88% on average (with a
very large standard deviation, however).

Three payments were made to enrolled households over the course of the first year. Due to delays in
setting up the system for collecting and managing school attendance data, the Ministry of Education
decided in December 2008 that the first transfer, corresponding to the first two months
(September-October 2008), would be given to all households enrolled in the program without
conditionality. For the conditional groups, the next two transfers in year 1 were conditional on
attendance. 12 In year 2, five transfers were made to households, and each transfer covered a two-
month period, as per the program protocol. For the conditional groups, all those payments were
conditional on attendance. To maintain comparability, each payment was made simultaneously to
conditional and unconditional groups. Across groups, households qualified for just around 3,000
MAD (~ 350 USD) on average in total transfers through the first 18 months of the pilot.




3. Data

To estimate the impacts of the Tayssir Program, we collected detailed data on schooling
achievement in two school units (the main school unit and one randomly chosen satellite unit) for
each of the 318 sectors included in the study.

Four types of data were collected. (1) We measured school participation through school visits
spread over the two years of the program, for all students enrolled in the study schools at the
beginning of “year 0” (the academic year 2007-2008). We call this the “school sample” and it
comprises over 47,000 students. (2) We conducted a comprehensive survey at both baseline and
endline with close to 4,400 households – we call this the “household sample.” (3) We administered a
basic arithmetic test (ASER test) to one child per household during the endline household survey;
and (4) We conducted “awareness” surveys at and around schools to measure teachers’ and
households’ understanding of the program. Figure A2 summarizes the timeline of the data collection
and we provide below the details for each of these datasets.



12
  See Figure A2 for the timeline of the program implementation. The first transfer took place in late January
and early February, 2009. The second transfer took place in late May/early June 2009, and it covered four
months, November 2008 to February 2009. The third and last payment for year 1 covered the rest of the
school year, and took place late August 2009/early September 2009.

                                                     12
3.1. School Participation
Through school visits, the research team (which had no relationship with the Tayssir team or the
Ministry of Education and was blind to the assignment to the different groups) collected data on
school participation. We conducted a total of seven visits per school. The first visit was announced,
and conducted at baseline, in June 2008, just before the end of the pre-program school year (we call
this “year 0”). During that first visit, we copied school registers for all grades 1 to 5. This register
data provides the universe of children that were enrolled in school at the beginning of year 0, and
whether they had dropped out or where still enrolled by the end of year 0 (June 2008, when we
conducted our baseline). This constitutes our “school sample.” Appendix Table A2 provides
summary statistics at the child level for this school sample, broken down by treatment group. The
second visit was also announced, and conducted at the beginning of the first program year. Two
additional (unannounced) visits were conducted during the first year of the program (in
March/April and May 2009). The fifth visit was announced, and conducted at the beginning of the
second academic year. Two unannounced visits were conducted later on that year (in February and
April 2010).

During each visit, we updated the schooling status of all children in the initial lists, recording who
had dropped out of school and when, which grade each pupil was in (if still attending regularly),
whether the teacher was present in class, and, whether the pupil was present. Names of newly
enrolled students were also recorded. To analyze the impact of the program on school participation
and dropout, we use data from all seven visits. However, to analyze the impact of the program on
attendance, we use only data from the four surprise visits.

Attrition in this dataset (shown in Appendix Table A2) is very low since we did not need to
individually track each child in the sample to obtain their schooling status, but instead relied on
whether the child was found in the classroom on the day of the visit, and if not, checked registers
and interviewed teachers and other students/siblings to determine whether the child had dropped
out. We consider a student as a dropout if he or she was absent from school on the surprise visit, and
was considered as dropped out by the teachers and other students. We consider a student as
attending school if he was present on the visit day, or absent but listed on the register as enrolled for
that month and having attended school at least some time in the previous 30 days. 13



13School attendance registers were very well kept and updated. Teachers are supposed to update the list of
enrolled students every month (when they have to write the names of all currently active students on a new
page) and to record their presence on a daily basis. Teachers typically do not copy the name of students that

                                                      13
3.2. Household Surveys
For each school unit, eight households were sampled for a baseline survey (administered in June
2008, before Tayssir was announced and before school sectors had been randomly assigned to
either treatment or control) and an endline survey (administered in June 2010). The sampling frame
used to select these households was the following. Enumerators visited each school (again, these
were two per school sectors, the main unit and one satellite unit) in spring 2008, and used the
2007/2008 school register, as well as the registers of the previous three academic years, to draw
two lists: (1) the list of all households in the school’s vicinity that had at least one child enrolled in
school, and (2) the list of households with no child currently enrolled in school but at least one child
of school-age who had enrolled at some point but dropped out within the previous three years. A
total of six households were randomly selected from list 1, and two households were randomly
selected from list 2, using a random number generator spreadsheet. This sampling method means
that our sampling frame does not include households who never enrolled any school-age children in
school, but such households appear very rare. (We attempted to get lists of such households from
the Moqadem, but they could rarely come up with any household fitting that description, which is
why systematically enrolling a few such households in the study at each location was not possible.)

Overall, a total of 5,032 households were sampled. Of them, 4832 (96%) could be interviewed at
baseline. Of those interviewed at baseline, 91% were interviewed at endline. An additional 111
households that were sampled but not surveyed at baseline were found and surveyed at endline.
Table A3 presents analyses of attrition at both baseline and endline. Attrition was more pronounced
in the control group than Tayssir groups. To check whether this differential attrition yields
imbalance in household characteristics, Table 2 presents summary statistics by group for the final,
post-attrition endline sample of 4,385 households. The groups appear relatively well balanced with
respect to observable characteristics. Fewer than 10% of all possible pair-wise comparisons yield
differences that are significant at the 10% level. There appears to be some differences in baseline
schooling rates, however. In the control group, 7 percent of children 6-15 had never enrolled and
14% had enrolled but dropped out, with the remainder (79%) enrolled. The share out of school at
baseline for the LCT-to-fathers group is significantly lower, with 3.2 percentage points fewer never-
enrolled and 2.7 percentage points fewer dropouts. Schooling rates for the other treatment groups



they consider as dropouts when they move on to a new page (i.e. a new month). The fact that we find a very
high attendance rate of 95% (objectively measured through surprise spot checks) for those officially enrolled
(on the register for that visit’s month), while at the same time observing a high dropout rate, confirms that
teachers truthfully report the de facto dropouts as dropouts.

                                                      14
fall somewhere in between the control and the LCT-to-fathers group. In all analyses below we
condition on baseline schooling status so these baseline differences do not drive our results.

Households in the sample are relatively large, with an average of 6.8 members across all groups,
including 3.1 children under 16 years old and 2.4 children in the 6-15 age group, the target group for
Tayssir. Literacy rates are quite low, with only 23% of household heads knowing how to read and
write. Financial access is also very low, with only 3% of households holding a bank account.



3.3. ASER Arithmetic Tests
As part of the endline survey administered to study households, one child between six and 12 years
old at baseline was randomly selected to take a short arithmetic test based on the ASER test
developed by Pratham. 14 This test does not evaluate children for age- or-grade specific competency.
Instead, it tests the ability of children to perform basic arithmetic, such as recognizing one-digit or
two-digit number, performing a subtraction, and performing a division. Of the 4,682 children
sampled, only about 3,316 (71%) were available for the arithmetic test during the endline survey.
Table A4 presents analysis of attrition, which was equally high across all five groups. Observable
household characteristics for children who took the test are overall balanced.



3.4. Program Awareness Surveys
In order to estimate how much communities knew about Tayssir and its rules by the end of the first
program year, a survey on “program awareness” was conducted in 387 schools in April 2009. The
survey included only a few questions such as: “Have you heard of a program called Tayssir?”; “Have
you been receiving transfers from the government related to your children?”; “Do you know what
the transfers depend on?”; etc. The survey was administered to teachers (for each school, we
attempted to survey the headmaster or deputy headmaster, as well as one grade 4 Arabic language
teacher) as well as parents (for each school, we attempted to survey two households from the
household sample).
A similar awareness survey was administered at the end of the second year (May/June 2010) to
headmasters and teachers in all schools. We also included a module on Tayssir in the endline survey
administered to study households.

4. Empirical Strategy and Results

4.1. Empirical Strategy
The random assignment of cash transfers, their conditionality and their designated beneficiary
across school sectors means that, in expectation, students in the control and various treatment
groups have, conditional on baseline schooling status, comparable background characteristics and
abilities. Thus, they likely would have, on average, comparable outcomes in the absence of any cash
transfer program. By comparing outcomes between the LCT-to-fathers group and the control group,
we can thus estimate the effect of the small unconditional cash transfer program we are testing. By
comparing outcomes across treatment groups, we can estimate the relative importance of the
various program components – conditioning on attendance and beneficiary’s gender. The sample
size was large enough that we are able to detect even small differences in impact across groups.

We estimate the effect of being assigned to each of the treatment groups, on the outcomes of
interest, using the following specification:

                                                                                      ′

                                                                  𝑗

where Yi,j is the outcome for student i in school j
        TAYSSIRj is a dummy equal to 1 if school j is selected for TAYSSIR in any form (i.e., in any of
        the cash transfer groups)

        𝐿𝐶𝑇𝑚𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑗 is a dummy equal to 1 if school j is in the LCT-to-mothers group

        𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑓𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 is a dummy equal to 1 if school j is in the CCT-to-fathers group
                  𝑗

        𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑚𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑗 is a dummy equal to 1 if school j is in the CCT-to-mothers group

        Xi,j is a vector of strata dummies, school-level controls (access to electricity and remoteness)
        and child-level controls (age, gender, schooling status and grade at baseline)

them to the mother. Strata dummies take account of stratification variables used in the
randomization. We adjust the standard errors for clustering at the school sector level. Finally,
because our sampling procedure at the household level oversampled households with dropout
children, we use sampling weights in all analyses using the household survey data. 15

Most tables we present estimates of equation (1) with the same format. Each row corresponds to a
given dependent variable. Column 1 presents the mean of that variable in the control group (with its
standard deviation in bracket underneath). Columns 2-5 present the β coefficient estimates and
standard errors (in parentheses) from equation (1). Columns 7 and 8 present the p-values for the
hypotheses that CCT has no differential impact compared to LCT and that transfers to fathers have
no differential impacts compared to transfers to mothers. 16 We only present results that include
controls for the key school and child characteristics mentioned above (Xi,j), but results remain
essentially unchanged when we omit those controls.


4.2 Compliance with, and understanding of, the experimental design
To interpret the results, it is important to check that the experimental design was actually
implemented as planned. Table 3 presents summary statistics on program implementation in the
four Tayssir groups.

Enrollment in the Tayssir program was high. In the LCT-to-fathers group, 97% of the households in
our survey had at least one child enrolled, and 73% of the children ages 6-15 at baseline were
enrolled. There is no systematic pattern by gender or by conditionality: at the child level, enrollment
was a little higher in the LCT-to-mothers group and in the CCT-to-mothers group than in the other
two. Compliance with the gender assignment was very high: it was close to 89% on average in
schools where mothers had been designated as recipients, and around 80% in schools where fathers
had been. This lower compliance rate for fathers is primarily due to the fact that men in rural
Morocco sometimes out-migrate for work for part of the year. Overall, though, fathers were over
75% more likely to be Tayssir recipients in the father groups than in the mother groups; therefore
our study is powered to detect even small impacts of the designated gender of the recipient. 17



15 Our final household sample includes 17% of households with dropout children, while those households
represent only 9% of the population.
16
   Note that the test in column 8 weights the impact of gender on CCTs three times as much as the impact of
gender for LCTs, since in our experiment the CCT group was three times larger than the LCT group.
17 One could be concerned that the money, while handed to the mothers, was directly appropriated by the

father. To test this, Table 3 also checks whether the designated recipient picked up the cash transfer alone. We

                                                      17
Compliance by the Tayssir staff with the transfer rules was high as well. Administrative data shows
that, after the first transfer that all households got unconditionally, all subsequent transfers made to
parents in the CCT groups were a function of attendance records, while none of the transfers in the
LCT groups were. As a result, households in the LCT groups received more money over the lifetime
of the program (though the difference is not very large, given that overall compliance with the
conditionality was extremely high in the CCT groups).

Among local communities, conditionality appears to have been poorly understood, however. In
Table 4, we present data on understanding of the program in both years. While teachers were quite
well informed on the exact amounts of the transfers for various age groups, there is at most a 20
percentage point difference in the beliefs that transfers are conditional on attendance between
teachers in the CCT and those in the LCT groups (Panel A). While this difference is highly significant,
it is quite far from the 100 percentage point difference we would have expected under perfect
understanding. Over the course of the program, understanding improved among teachers. By the
end of year 2, close to 75% of teachers in CCT schools believed transfers were conditional on
attendance, against only 40% in LCT schools.

Our measure of understanding of parents is, unfortunately, not perfect (it is very difficult to ask
parents neutral (non-leading) questions about their understanding of the rules, and be sure that
they have actually understood the questions), but the data we have suggests that parents were
confused. There was no apparent difference in beliefs about the conditionality between CCT and LCT
groups at the end of year 1 (Panel C), with just about 50% of parents in all groups thinking that the
transfers were conditional on attendance (so parents may just have been taking a guess when
answering the survey). By the end of year 2, confusion had cleared in the LCT communities, with
over 80% of parents knowing the transfers were not conditional. 18 But the dominant belief in the
CCT groups was also that transfer amounts were not conditional on attendance. This could be
because, as we will see, school attendance happens to be very high in Morocco, conditional on
enrollment. Most households in the CCT groups therefore ended up getting the full transfers, and
had no experience of what would happen if the children were absent a lot. What’s more, as shown in
Figure A2, government delays meant that transfers arrived in lumps of different sizes (from 2 to 4



find that 33% of designated mothers picked up the transfer alone (compared to 70% of designated fathers).
14% of designated mothers were accompanied by their husband when they picked up the transfers, and 40%
were accompanied by another household member.
18 In the LCT group, program officers visited individual households at the end of year 1 to re-iterate that they

only needed to enroll their children in Tayssir at the school to get the transfer every month.

                                                      18
months worth) with a delay of at least 3 months – making it difficult for parents to infer the rules by
themselves.

The relatively poor understanding of the CCT rules among intended beneficiaries is an important
outcome in and of itself. Indeed, at the beginning of each school year, a real effort was made to try to
make communities (who were the ones in charge of enrolling parents) understand the rules of the
program. Each school director received instructions and handouts explaining the rules specific to
their school sector. If, despite this, parents only have a dim sense of what the program rules are and
the extent to which they’re enforced, the role conditionality plays in providing incentives is
necessarily blunted. This relates to a recent paper by Kaufmann et al. (2012): studying a CCT
program in Brazil in which conditionality is strictly enforced, they find that child attendance
increases once households get formal warnings that their child’s absenteeism threatens their
standing in the program, and increases even more after the households start being punished. This
highlights the role of perceptions in the role that incentives can play in CCT. This is an important
point since timely enforcement of conditionality, and therefore their proper understanding, is likely
to be difficult to achieve in many settings. 19



4.3 Results: Impacts on School Participation
Table 5 shows the main results on school participation. We present the results obtained from two
separate sources: the household surveys (Panel A) and the school visits (Panel B), finding very
consistent results across the two sources.

Starting with the household sample, the first row of the table shows the main result: the impact of
the program on school participation at the end of year 2 among all primary-school aged children in
the household sample, irrespective of status at baseline (but controlling for schooling status at
baseline). School participation is a dummy equal to 1 if the child was reported as having attended
school at least once in the last month of program year 2. The effect is very large. We find that school
participation is 7.3 percentage points higher in the LCT-to-fathers group than in the control group.


19  Evaluations of cash transfer programs so far have not systematically collected data on program
comprehension, so comparing the level of understanding in our setting with that in others is difficult. In
particular, Akresh et al. (2013) do not report perception of conditionality by parents in their program. Baird et
al. (2011) look at the perception of the conditionality among adolescent girls receiving a UCT by conducting
qualitative interviews. They report a good understanding of the program rules (i.e. of the fact that no
condition is required to receive the transfer), but they also provide evidence that girls in the UCT arm had
friends in the CCT arm and knew the school attendance of these friends was monitored, putting the UCT in the
broader context of an education program.

                                                       19
This corresponds to a decrease in non-participation of around 30 percent. It is much larger than the
impact of the first CCT, PROGRESA, at the primary level, at least in part because attrition from
primary school is a larger problem to start with in Morocco than in Mexico. The effect is similar
regardless of the gender of the recipient (father/mother) but 2 percentage points higher
(significantly so) under the LCT than under the CCT program.

The next rows provide a breakdown of the school participation effect by baseline school
participation status. We find that both the dropout and the re-enrollment margins are affected. In
the household sample, the dropout rate diminishes by 75% under the Tayssir program, no matter
how it is implemented (a drop of 7.5 percentage points, off of a base rate of 10% in the control
group). In the much larger school sample (Panel B), the results are very similar: dropout declines
from 7.6% in the control group to about 2.5% in all the Tayssir groups. The consistency between the
self-reported participation data in the household survey and the school sample results (which are
based on direct observations in classrooms during spot checks) is important and implies that
parental reports of child participation were truthful.

The household data also shows that re-entry almost doubles in the LCT groups (from 14.7% in the
control group to 27.2% in the LCT-to-fathers group). In the CCT group, the effect is still large, but
significantly smaller. The re-entry difference is the source of the greater overall impact on school
participation of the LCT compared to the CCT.

Since CCT is conditional on attendance, while LCT is not, it is important to check the impact on
attendance. The results of surprise attendance checks are presented in row 4 of Panel B (for the
school sample). Note that attendance conditional on enrollment is a selected outcome, since the
program affects dropout, and this would bias us against finding positive impact on attendance.
Attendance of enrolled children is very high overall during the periods covered by our unannounced
spot checks (February, March and May). The mean attendance rate of 95.5% in the control group
corresponds to an average of 1.1 days of absence per month, well below the threshold of four
absences imposed on students in the CCT arm. Attendance in the LCT group is, if anything, higher
than in the control group, though not significantly so. The LCT impact on school participation that
we found in the household survey data thus translates into effective participation in school, and it is
definitely not the case that parents enrolled their children in school just to get enrolled with Tayssir
and did not bother to send them to school very regularly afterwards.




                                                  20
If children spent more time in school, what did school participation crowd out? We collected hour-
level time-use data for the day preceding the endline survey for every child aged 6-15 at baseline.
Table 6 presents results from this data, restricting the sample to the 25% of households interviewed
before the summer school break started. 20 (We don’t present the four versions of the Tayssir
program separately, as the sample size is too small to detect small differences between them, but we
find no systematic patterns.) Looking first on the extensive margin of school participation, we find a
large impact of the Tayssir transfers, with children of program households over 50% more likely to
have attended school the day before the survey. This is a much larger effect than that observed in
Table 5, and suggests that the program has much more bite in the very last weeks of school before
the summer break – a period during which both pupils and teacher attendance appears much
spottier than the rest of the year.

Correspondingly, we see a large increase in the time children spent in school-related activities in
the day before the survey (this includes the time spent in school as well as time doing homework
and participating in extracurricular activities organized by the school). In Tayssir groups, children
spent about an extra hour and a half on average in school-related activities in the day preceding the
survey compared to 2.5 hours spent by children in the control group. Overall, the magnitude of the
time use results in Table 6, when compared to those in Table 5, suggests an important intensive
margin effect in addition to the extensive margin effect: children in the Tayssir groups spend more
time studying and more time physically at the school, as well as more time traveling to and from
school, conditional on being enrolled. This extra time spent on learning did not come at the expense
of time spent on chores, but in a small part at the expense of household farming or business
activities and in a larger part at the expense of what we call leisure: play and social activities. This
suggests that children had time to spare invest in education and thus, in this environment, the
barrier to schooling may have had more to do with lack of interest than with severe constraints.


4.4 Results: Impacts on Basic Math Skills
Few studies of conditional cash transfers have measured learning outcome among school-age
children, but when they have, they found no effects, despite increases in participation (Behrman et
al., 2005; Filmer and Schady, 2009). This is line with many other studies that have been effective at
increasing school participation but have found little impact on learning (see Glewwe and Kremer,


20 The initial plan was to interview all households before the school break, but the start of the endline survey

was delayed due to logistical constraints. We have the same proportion of households surveyed before the
school break in all groups.

                                                      21
2006, and Glewwe et al., 2012, for reviews), which raises some questions on the value of promoting
school participation without some improvements in school quality. To be able to test the underlying
premise behind the Ministry of Education’s plan for a cash transfer program, we collected a simple
measure of learning achievement, the ASER arithmetic test, that could be administered at home, and
thus does not suffer from sample selection due to differential school participation rates across
groups. Table 7 shows the impact on performance on the test, which as administered to one
randomly selected child per household during the endline survey. Panel A show the results question
by question for all children, as well as results on a standardized measure of achievement on the test,
and Panel B presents the standardized measures by gender, school type and baseline enrollment
status. There is a modest positive impact of LCT-to-fathers on standardized test scores (0.075, which
rescaled amounts to 0.075/0.694=0.11 or 11% of a standard deviation in the control group), which
is not quite significant in the overall sample (although it is larger and significant for students
enrolled at baseline and those from satellite school units).

Interestingly however, here again we can rule out equality of the LCT and the CCT impacts: the CCT
had significantly smaller impacts than the LCT. In fact, even a small positive effect of the CCT
program (over the control group) can be ruled out. The difference between CCT and LCT is
significant at 5%. This is consistent with the participation results, and suggests that LCTs are, if
anything, more effective than the CCT in this context.


4.5 Results: Who did the program affect most?
Akresh et al. (2013), who compare a purely unconditional cash transfer and a CCT program in
Burkina Faso, fond insignificant differences on average between the programs, but argued that the
UCT had smaller effects than the CCT on more “marginal” children: girls, out-of-school children, and
children of lower ability. To investigate this question in our context, Table 8 shows the main impact
of LCT-to-fathers and the effect of all the other versions of the program for these different
subgroups (and Panel B of Table 7 presents the subgroup results on learning).

Possibly because we consider a labeled unconditional cash transfer program rather than a pure UCT,
our results differ from those found by Akresh et al. (2013). First, as mentioned earlier, the impact of
the Tayssir LCT on re-enrollment rate for children who had dropped out is significantly larger than
the impact of the CCT. Second, although girls have a lower education level than boys (67% of girls
aged 6-15 were in school at the end of year 2, against 80% of boys), the LCT does not have a smaller
effect on girls than boys. In fact, if anything it appears that girls are driving the larger impact of LCT


                                                   22
than CCT on re-enrollment: for girls initially dropped out school, the increase in re-enrollment in the
LCT-to-fathers group is 12 percentage points and is significant, in the LCT-to-mothers it is 12.8
percentage points and significant, but it is zero in the CCT-to-fathers groups and only 4 percentage
points) in the CCT-to-mothers group. The difference between LCT and CCT for these girls initially
out of school is significant at 1%.

In the last two columns of Panel A, Table 8, we break down the children in the household sample
based on their predicted probability of school participation. This predicted probability is
constructed using coefficient estimates of enrollment status on school-level, household-level and
child-level characteristics in the control group (these coefficient estimates are shown in Table A5).
Not surprisingly, we find that all the program effects on school participation are concentrated
among those with a predicted likelihood of school participation below the median. And for those, the
effect of the CCT is significantly smaller (3.6 percentage points, or 23% lower) than that of the LCT.
This result, while important in itself, also confirms that despite poor understanding by parents of
the specific rules of the programs, it is not the case that the LCT and CCT programs were completely
equivalent in practice – if they were, we would not see any difference in impacts.




5 Mechanisms

The main findings so far are that the Tayssir program, which provided small transfers to parents to
help with the education of their children, had a large impact on school participation, both through
reducing dropout and through encouraging re-enrollment. Further, attendance is very high for all
children who are enrolled, so this increase in enrollment translated into real gains in schooling,
although we do not find large impacts on learning. The second important finding is that there is
essentially no difference between transfers to fathers and mothers (and there was very good
enforcement of the gender of the recipient). The third finding is that the LCT has a significantly
larger impact on school participation (mostly through higher re-enrollment). In this section we
provide some additional evidence to shed light on the mechanisms behind these results.


5.1 Making Education Salient
Figure 1 shows the dropout rates by cause in the control group, and how they were affected by the
program (we only show all the Tayssir groups together for brevity, but there was no significant
difference across any of the groups). In the control group, the three main reasons for dropping out of

                                                  23
school are accessibility of the school (“school is too far”), financial reasons, and the fact that the child
did not like school (“child’s choice”). Tayssir was not designed to affect distance to school and, not
surprisingly, did not reduce dropout rates due to distance. In contrast, it reduced the incidence of
dropouts due to financial difficulties, though this effect is not quite significant at conventional levels
(the p-value is 0.123). Interestingly, Tayssir had an even larger impact on dropouts due to children
simply not wanting to be in school. Also, dropouts due to the belief that school is of poor quality
were also considerably reduced by Tayssir. This is surprising, since Tayssir was not accompanied by
improvements in school quality and did not include any transfers to schools, therefore leaving
school infrastructure quality unchanged. 21 If anything, the increase in school participation in those
schools may have lowered quality, to the extent that class size matters. 22

One conjecture is that the program, which gave teachers the crucial role of enrolling households,
was perceived as an implicit endorsement of the local schools by the Ministry of Education. Table 9
provides further evidence for this. Parents in schools sampled for the Tayssir program, irrespective
of which variant of the program they are in, rank the school quality significantly higher.

Parents may also have interpreted the introduction of a program sponsored by the Ministry of
Education as a positive signal about the value of education more generally. Consistent with this, the
evidence in Table 9 shows that parental beliefs regarding the returns to education dramatically
increased, especially for girls. For girls, the cash transfer programs led to very large positive changes
in the perceived returns to education. 23 In the control group, parents point estimate of the returns to
primary school for girls is actually negative. There is a large increase in the Tayssir group, and it
becomes positive. The perceived returns to secondary school are more than twice as large in the
Tayssir group as in the control group. This is driven by changes on the extensive margin – parents in
the Tayssir group believe the likelihood of getting employed is higher with primary or junior high
school education than parents in the control group. For boys, the effect is small at primary school,
and large but not significant at the secondary school level.

21 Within the two-year time frame of the Tayssir pilot, there were improvements in school infrastructure
through an emergency plan put in place by the Ministry of Education, but, as explained in Section 2.2, we were
able to stratify by whether a school was scheduled to receive infrastructure support when randomly assigning
school sectors to experimental arms.
22 We can also rule out the possibility that the Tayssir program increased teacher effort or motivation. Overall,

we find no program effect on teacher absenteeism. Teachers miss about 10% of school days in control schools,
which corresponds to an average of 2.5 days in a given month. Teacher attendance was unaffected by the
introduction of Tayssir in any form.
23 We observe this increase in perceived returns among both types of households in our sample (those

sampled from the list of enrolled children and those sampled from the list of recent dropouts). The increases
are similar in all versions of the programs, so we pool here for precision.

                                                       24
Did Tayssir make parents over-optimistic about education? As mentioned earlier, Appendix Table
A1 reports estimate of the “Mincerian” returns to education in our sample. The increase in
household consumption when a female has completed primary education is actually much larger
than what even household in the Tayssir groups estimate (parents underestimate the returns to
primary education), though this may in part due to selection bias, of course.

Several studies (Jensen, 2010, 2012; Nguyen, 2008) have shown that parents respond to
interventions that increase the perceived returns to education by increasing participation and effort
in school. Although the Tayssir program was not focused on persuading parents of the returns to
education, the impact on the perceived value of education was actually larger in our intervention
than in those ones and, as in those, we find an increase in school enrollment.


5.2 Is a nudge all that is needed?
To the extent that conditionality had any impact, it was a negative one: the LCT impacts on overall
school participation and learning were slightly stronger than the impacts of the CCT. As mentioned
in the introduction, this result differs from those of previous studies, which tend to find positive
impacts of conditionality, at least for some subgroups (see Baird et al. (2011) and Akresh et al.
(2013) for two experiments). This is likely because, while the transfers were not conditional on
attendance, Tayssir was quite explicitly framed as an education program: headmasters were
conducting the enrollment into the program, and the enrollment took place in schools. Thus, while
unlabeled unconditional transfers may be less effective at increasing school participation than
transfers tied to education, and while strict enforcement of conditionality seems to have additional
impact on attendance (Kaufmann et al., 2012), unconditional but labeled transfers such as the one
piloted in Morocco may well provide the nudge that is sufficient to convince parents to send their
children to school. While we have not experimented with larger transfers or with finer targeting, it
seems that a small transfer targeted only through at the community level was sufficient to achieve a
large impact. Thus, the big shove that is provided by the CCT may not be necessary to substantially
raise school participation.

In the Moroccan context at least, the nudge has a number of advantages over the shove. First, it is
substantially cheaper, both because the transfers per child are smaller and because the
administrative costs are lower. If one considers that transfers are not costs (only the deadweight
loss of raising the funds for them is a cost), the point is even stronger, because the administrative
costs of Tayssir are a fraction of those of the traditional CCT. Table 10 presents a cost-effectiveness


                                                  25
analysis of the program. The overall cost of the LCT was $99 per child per year (in 2008 US dollars,
$89 in transfers and $10 (7%) in administrative costs). Compared to the three earlier CCT programs
presented in Table 10, Tayssir LCT has the smallest cost-transfer ratio, even relative to PRAF II in
Honduras which had mainly a geographical targeting and small transfers (of 4% of household
consumption). The cost-effectiveness comparison also favors Tayssir: for the Tayssir LCT program,
$1,000 led to an increase of 0.24 years of education at the primary level -- in other words, the cost of
an extra year of education is $4,228 in the Tayssir LCT program. For PROGRESA, the cost of an extra
year of primary education induced by the CCT is at least 70% higher. 24

The second advantage of the nudge over the shove in our context is that the LCT had actually larger
impacts on enrollment and days spent in school than the CCT. This comes from the marginal
children – those with a lower propensity to be in school absent any transfers. One likely explanation
for this result is that, for people who understand it, the conditionality on attendance may be
discouraging: someone who feels like they will not manage to have less than four absences a month
may either not enroll or give up under a CCT, but continue under the LCT. Parents in our study
context seemed relatively confused about the rules governing the CCT, but this effect could also have
come about through the teachers themselves. Indeed, teachers were much more likely to have
understood the conditionality, and it is possible that in conditional schools they did not bother to
actively seek and enroll into Tayssir the parents of students whom they feel would not regularly
attend. Since pupil absenteeism is not a big problem, the incentives based on attendance may thus
have discouraged students to enroll without having much bite for those enrolled anyway, making
the LCT a better alternative in this context.


Finally, while we did not explicitly compare different ways of targeting households, the very large
take-up of Tayssir points to a very important advantage of the geographical targeting used in this
study. Indeed, in Indonesia, Alatas et al (2012b) find that in a proxy-means tested program where
eligible households must sign-up on their own to enroll and receive benefits, many poor eligible
households do not actually sign-up. By removing any ambiguity on eligibility, and putting the
responsibility of enrolling households on the teachers, the geographical targeting in the Tayssir
program was able to eliminate this problem to a large extent (although as we just discussed not all
children enrolled, and some vulnerable children may have been left out in the CCT).


24Coady (2000) estimates the cost of an extra year of primary education, for Progresa, at 55,000 pesos (in
2000 pesos), which is equivalent to around $7,300 (in 2008 USD). Dhaliwal et al (2013) estimate an even
higher cost per year of education for Progresa.

                                                   26
6 Conclusion

Through a large-scale randomized experiment conducted jointly with the Moroccan Government,
we show that a cash transfer labeled for education and made to households of primary school age
children in rural areas had a very large impact on school participation –despite the fact that the
transfer was not conditional on attendance, was given to fathers rather than mothers, and was
relatively small – enough to cover the direct costs of education but very small relative to most
earlier CCTs as a share of household consumption, even for the poorest households in our sample.
These strong results are due in part to an endorsement effect: parents update upwards their beliefs
about the value of education when a large pro-education government program enters their
community. The cash transfer was labeled for education purposes, since it was coming from the
Ministry of Education, and enrollment for the program was administered by school headmasters. In
this context, adding formal conditions on attendance tends to decrease the overall impact on
participation and learning, and targeting the program to mothers makes no difference.

In a context where pupil absenteeism (conditional on teacher’s presence) is negligible for most of
the school year, this labeled unconditional cash transfer (LCT) is more cost effective than the
standard CCT, both because it requires transfers of lower amounts (which may not be counted as
costs anyway) and, more importantly, because the administrative costs are much lower. Even in our
setting, the administrative costs are reduced by more than one fourth in the LCT version compared
to the CCT, and the conditionality slightly lowers the effect and worsens the targeting. We note that
our context is not unique: in Burkina Faso, Akresh et al. (2013) find similarly low rates of
absenteeism among enrolled students. In Kenya, Duflo et al. (2012) also find very low rates of
absenteeism among lower grade students conditional on teacher’s presence.

A key question is whether LCT impacts would persist in the long run. To the extent the impacts are
due to an increased estimate of the returns to education, long-run impacts will be hampered if the
program leads parents to temporarily overestimate those returns. Overoptimistic parents should
revert back to their previous levels of investment once they realize that their child’s education has
not delivered what they had hoped it would. In our survey data, however, parents appear to still
underestimate the returns to education, even after the introduction of the program, suggesting that
this disappointment effect will be unlikely.

Notes: Data sources: Panels A-C: Knowledge surveys administered to a subset of school teachers (including school
directors) and households. Panel D: Endline survey administered to all households sampled for the study.
Weights are included in Panel C to get a sample representative of households surveyed at baseline. Sampling weights
are used in Panel D since households with dropout children were over-sampled.
Column 1: Standard deviations presented in brackets. Column 2: coefficients and Standard errors (in parentheses)
from an OLS regression of the left-hand side variable on a dummy for the Conditional Treatment dummy, controlling
for strata dummies and variables specified below. Standard errors are clustered at the school-sector level. ***, **, *
indicate significance at 1, 5 and 10%.
Panels A and B controls include: respondent gender, respondent status (teacher or headmaster) and school-level
controls for access to electricity and remoteness. Panel C controls include: school-level controls for access to
electricity and remoteness, and household level controls for share of children enrolled in school at baseline and

Notes: Data source: Panel A: Household survey collected from study households; unit of observation: child; average of 2.5 children per
household; sampling weights are used since households with dropout children were over-sampled. Panel B: School visits data; unit of
observation: child (rows 1,2,3, 5 of Panel B) and child-day (row 4 of Panel B).
Each row presents the results of a separate regression. Column 1: Standard deviations presented in brackets. Columns 2-5: coefficients
and standard errors (in parentheses) from a LPM regression of the left-hand side variable on treatment dummies, controlling for strata
dummies and variables specified below. Standard errors are clustered at the school-sector level. ***, **, * indicate significance at 1, 5
and 10%.
Panel A: School-level controls include: access to electricity and remoteness. Household controls include: share of children enrolled in
school at baseline and household owns a cellphone. Individual controls include: age, gender and schooling status at baseline (end of
year 0).
Panel B: Individual controls include: age, gender, schooling status and grade the child attended at the end of year 0; school-level
controls include access to electricity and remoteness. The regression on attendance also control for the day of the visit.

Child controls include: age, gender, schooling status and grade in year 0 (if any) and day of the week the survey was
administered. All regressions also include household- and school-level controls as in Table 5 Panel A. Sampling weights
are used since households with dropout children were over-sampled.

Notes: Data sources: ASER test administered to (at most one) child aged 6-12 at baseline per household during endline household survey visit.
Sampling weights are used since households with dropout children were over-sampled. Unit of observation: Child.
Column 1: Standard deviations presented in brackets. Columns 2-5: coefficients and Standard errors (in parentheses) from an OLS regression of the
left-hand side variable on treatment dummies, controlling for strata dummies and variables specified below. Standard errors are clustered at the
school-sector level. ***, **, * indicate significance at 1, 5 and 10%. Controls included: child age and gender, dummies for child schooling status by June
2008, school was in session at the time of the survey, and same school-level and household-level controls as in Table 5 Panel A.

† Average across 3 school quality indicators. Coded so that 4 reflects highly satisfied, 3 satisfied, 2 disatisfied and 1 highly disatisfied.
The 3 indicators are: infrastructure quality, headmaster availability and teacher quality.
 ‡ Respondents were not asked for a probability between 0 and 1. They were asked to choose between five categories (no chance, few
chances, 50% chance, lots of chances, and certain chance). We impute probabilities of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 to these categories,

                                                   For each school sector:
                            - Main school unit + 1 satellite school unit sampled for school visits
       -16 households sampled for baseline and endline survey (12 with currently enrolled and 4 with dropout children)


Notes: Sample size X (Y) indicates the initial (realized) sample size. The realized sample size is slightly smaller than the initial sample size
due to 2 school sectors that couldn't be reached at baseline due to floods.
CCT stands for Conditional Cash Transfer. The condition was "no more than 4 absences in the month". LCT stands for Labeled
(unconditional) Cash Transfer. See section 2.3 of paper for details on the amounts of the transfers.
