I.     Introduction

       Policymakers widely accept that Social Security faces a long-run solvency problem. The

Social Security Trustees publish a 75-year forecast of the OASDI system’s finances every year.

Since the 1983 amendments the forecast has gotten consistently more ominous. Figure 1 shows

the intermediate-assumptions forecast for the Trust Fund balances in 1983, 1985 and 1998.

The 1998 Trustees Report has the OASDI Trust Fund completely depleted in 2032 (when the

youngest babyboomer, born in 1964, will be 68) rather than the forecast of the depletion date that

immediately followed the 1983 Social Security amendments of 2063 (when the same individual

will be 99 years old). The 1998 OASDI Trustees Report has as the intermediate or “best guess”

forecast that the system’s income (not counting net interest income on the special issue bonds



                                                         1
held in the trust fund) would fall short of its costs beginning in 2013. In 1999, the surplus is

expected to be 1.52 percent of covered payroll, but this turns negative in 2013 and by the end of

the Trustee’s forecasting period (2075) the annual shortfall under the intermediate set of

assumptions is forecast to be 6.43 percent of covered payroll. That means that if we operated the

system on a strictly pay-as-you-go basis, the payroll tax rate would have to be increased by 6.43

percentage points to achieve balance in 2075. The 2075 OASDI deficit (with the intermediate

assumptions forecast) amounts to 4.26 percent of GDP. One way to look at the financial

solvency problem of Social Security is that the intermediate forecast is for fourteen years of

modest and declining surpluses followed by ever growing deficits as far as the eye can see.

Against that we have a relatively small Trust Fund (currently $760 billion) which generates

roughly $40 billion of interest income but which is now forecast to be completely depleted by

2032 as shown in Figure 1. Naturally, the financial situation for OASDI is much worse under

the Trustees’ high-cost set of assumptions. With them, the date of the OASDI Trust Fund

exhaustion is 2022. The date when payroll tax receipts first fall short of benefit payments is

2006 and the eventual shortfall of income to costs in 2075 is 16.04 percent of taxable payroll.

       The Social Security Trustees summarize the 75-year outlook for OASDI by computing

the long-run actuarial balance. In 1998 the 75-year actuarial balance was in deficit by 2.19

percent of covered payroll with the Trustees’ intermediate assumptions. What that means is that

if the payroll tax had been immediately increased in 1998 by 2.19 percentage points and the

increase was maintained for the next 75 years, then the life of the Trust Fund would have been

extended to the 75 year horizon under the intermediate set of economic and demographic

assumptions. Even under this hypothetical scenario, the payroll tax proceeds would be less than

benefit payments under the currently legislated benefit structure beginning in roughly 2020.




                                                  2
Further, the 75-year actuarial balance would last for exactly one year; with every passing year

one fewer surplus year would be in the 75-year window and one more deficit one would be

included. The immediate payroll tax increase to permanently fix the solvency problem of the

current OASDI system would be significantly greater than 2.19 percent. Steven Goss of the

Office of the Actuary of the Social Security Administration has estimated that the permanent or

open-ended actuarial deficit is 4.7 percent of covered payroll under the intermediate set of

assumptions (Goss (1999)).

       All of this illustrates the dimensions of the problem of returning the existing OASDI

system to long-run solvency. Operating within the existing structure of Social Security, there are

only two obvious paths: (1) raise taxes and/or (2) cut benefits. If we take Steven Goss’s 4.7

percent of covered payroll figure for the perpetual actuarial deficit, then permanently fixing the

finances of the system (under the intermediate set of economic and demographic assumptions)

would require immediate tax increases or benefit cuts totaling 38 percent. If these steps are

delayed in their implementation, as they almost certainly would be, then the benefit cuts and tax

increases would need to be larger. Neither tax increases nor benefit cuts of this magnitude are

economically or politically attractive. Naturally, people are looking for a more palatable way out

of the Social Security solvency problem.

       One natural place to look is the investment returns earned on the trust fund. Currently,

the trust fund is exclusively invested in special nonmarketable U.S. government bonds. When

these bonds are issued their interest rate is set at the average interest rate of marketable Treasury

bonds with a maturity of four years or more. The bonds have one special feature, which offsets

their nonmarketability: they are redeemable at par at any time. This feature is not generally

available on publicly held bonds and notes with the exception of U.S. Government Savings




                                                  3
Bonds. The special issue bonds are certainly safe with no price risk and with the principal and

interest fully backed by the U.S. government, but Treasury interest rates are somewhat less than

what is offered on AAA corporate bonds and trail the average total return earned on common

stocks by a wide margin.

       The question we address in this paper is whether a significant fraction of the whole

solvency problem could reliably be solved by having the Social Security Administration invest

the OASDI trust fund in higher yielding private securities. The analysis of MaCurdy and

Shoven(1992) suggests such a strategy might yield an improvement in Social Security’s

finances.1 Of course, there is a more fundamental question regarding whether society as a whole

would benefit from this new asset allocation. Another question we address is how risky such a

change in the trust fund asset allocation would be and who would bear that risk. Related to this

question, we will discuss the feasibility of Social Security delivering a true defined benefit

pension program to its participants.

II.    The Proposals

       We focus on two of the reform proposals that rely on investing the central trust fund in

higher yielding private securities in order to maintain the general benefit structure of Social

Security. However, our analysis is applicable to any plan that attempts to make progress on the

solvency of the system by simply reallocating portfolios towards higher yielding securities

including the plan outlined by President Clinton in his 1999 State of the Union Address. The

two plans of this type that we describe in detail are the “Maintain Benefits” proposal of the 1994-

96 Advisory Council (often referred to as the Bob Ball plan) and the plan offered in the recently

published book by Henry Aaron and Robert Reischauer (Aaron & Reischauer (1998)). Among




                                                  4
the measures that both of them advocate, the asset reallocation is credited with the largest impact

on reducing or eliminating the 75-year actuarial deficit.

       The details of the two plans are shown in Table 1. There are many similarities between

them. The numbers in the tables come directly from the Aaron and Reischauer book (Table 6-1)

and from Volume I of the Report of the 1994-96 Advisory Council on Social Security (Table 1,

Appendix II). The figures are based on estimates of the Office of the Actuary of the Social

Security Administration assuming the intermediate alternative II economic and demographic

conditions. The numbers for the same action may differ slightly for the two plans since the

estimates for the Aaron/Reischauer plan were made roughly two years later than those

for the Maintain Benefits plan. Further, the plans differ slightly in how they implement each

measure.   Even with that said, both proposals have the same goal – to deal with the 75-year

actuarial deficit within the context of the current structure of benefits. They both assume that the

measurement of the CPI will be changed in ways that lower official inflation and cause the

program’s costs to grow more slowly.2 They both advocate covering all newly hired state and

local workers, increasing the number of years included in the AIME formula from 35 to 38, and

taxing all Social Security benefits received over and above the employees own actual

contributions. Both proposals characterize their changes in the personal income taxation of

Social Security benefits as putting them on the same basis as private pension income. However,

their plans involve significantly higher taxes than the Schieber-Shoven PSA-2000 plan, which

also claims to put Social Security and private pension benefits on the same tax footing (Schieber-

Shoven (1999)). The PSA-2000 plan taxes half of Social Security benefits on the argument that

half of Social Security contributions were made with before-tax money (the employer

contribution) and half with after-tax dollars (the employee contribution). Essentially, Schieber-

Shoven’s plan would have half of the contributions treated like a Roth IRA (after-tax

contributions with tax-free withdrawals) and half like a regular IRA (before-tax contributions

with taxable withdrawals). In contrast, the Aaron-Reischauer and Ball plans tax 85 percent or

more of Social Security benefits.




                                                 6
       The Maintain Benefits plan contains two features that Aaron-Reischauer did not choose

to copy. One is a 1.6 percentage point payroll tax increase in 2045 and the other is a redirection

of money currently scheduled to go to Medicare to OASDI. The later feature of the MB plan

seems ill advised as the long-run finances of Medicare are in worse shape than those of OASDI.

Similarly, the A-R plan contains several features not in the MB plan. These include accelerating

and extending the increase in the age of normal retirement, advancing the age of early retirement,

and readjusting the spousal and surviving spouse benefits. The Office of the Actuary of Social

Security estimates that both plans, if enacted immediately and completely, would more than

eliminate the 75-year actuarial deficit of the system.

       The common feature of the two plans shown in Table 1 is that the biggest contributor to

eliminating the long-run solvency problem is investing part of the OASDI Trust Fund in private

securities. The two plans differ in the details of how they would do that. In fact, the Maintain

Benefits plan in the 1994-96 Advisory Council Report suggests further study be given to the idea

before implementation. Nonetheless, when the Advisory Council scored the plan to see whether

it achieved the goal of eliminating the 75-year actuarial deficit, they included the provision that

the Trust Fund would begin investing in stocks in the year 2000 and that the proportion of the

Trust Fund assets in stocks would gradually rise until it reached 40 percent in 2015. The

assumed real rate of return on the stock portion of the portfolio in the Maintain Benefits plan is

7.0 percent. The Aaron-Reischauer plan is to have the trust fund balances that exceed 150

percent of one year’s benefits gradually invested in common stocks and corporate bonds. Since

the OASDI trust fund balances currently exceed the 150 percent of annual payout criteria, the

switch to private securities would begin immediately under the A-R program. Remarkably,

Aaron and Reischauer estimate that 55 percent of the whole actuarial deficit of 2.19 percent of




                                                  7
payroll would be eliminated by this asset reallocation alone. They also estimate that the

combination of the asset reallocation and the effect of the changes that BLS is making in the

construction of the CPI eliminates over 75 percent of Social Security’s projected long-term

deficit. Any 75 percent cure that is this painless deserves careful scrutiny.

III.   The Net Transaction

       The net transaction involved in having the central OASDI trust fund invest a portion of

its assets in common stocks is an asset swap. Social Security or the federal government sells

additional government bonds to the public and uses the proceeds to acquire common stock from

the public. In the Social Security context, the system is selling one set of assets (U.S.

government bonds) in order to acquire another set of assets (a diversified portfolio of common

stocks) of equal value. Of course, this transaction can be examined without reference to Social

Security’s financial problems at all. The real issue is whether the government can improve the

welfare of taxpayers (or Social Security participants) by issuing and selling bonds and using the

proceeds to buy common stocks.

       There are at least two reasons to be skeptical about the advantages of the net transaction

being discussed. First, the total capital stock and wealth in the economy (at least to a first

approximation) is unaffected by the asset swap. Therefore the level of GDP and National

Income is unchanged. If Social Security or the government can systematically improve its

financial position by making this exchange, the private sector, which presumably is on the other

side of the transaction, is systematically losing. It is hard to imagine that the politicians and

bureaucrats running Social Security are systematically getting the better of the pension fund

managers and institutional investors who are buying the bonds from the government in exchange

for common stocks. It is possible, of course, that the exchange could be played out on




                                                  8
international capital markets so that Americans as a whole could conceivably end up as net

winners (or losers) in the transaction. Second, there is the matter of risk. While stocks have a

much higher expected return than government bonds, they also involve much higher risks

(particularly given the fact that the current special issue bonds have the feature that they can be

redeemed at par at any time). The two plans discussed above are very vague as to how much

additional risk the system would be assuming and how that risk would be shared among

taxpayers and Social Security participants. As we will discuss in Section VI below, there is a

real question about whether it is feasible to maintain a universal coverage defined benefit

pension plan funded with risky securities.

       Having the government exchange bonds for stocks in the hope of relieving the solvency

problems of Social Security is a form of financial engineering. The recent history of such

schemes is not promising. Savings and loans sell short-term liabilities (certificates of deposit

and demand deposits) and acquire higher-yielding long-term mortgages. The S&L crisis of the

1980s was brought about when short-term interest rates peaked in 1980 in the mid-teens when

the S&L mortgage portfolio yielded six to eight percentage points less. The usual yield

relationship did not hold and the resulting bankruptcies and bailouts cost the taxpayers massive

sums of money. The Orange County debacle resulted from a similar failed attempt to exploit the

shape of the yield curve. The recent massive losses of hedge funds resulted from asset swaps

that failed to perform as expected. Before the U.S. government engages in exchanging bonds for

stocks, careful analysis is clearly warranted.

IV.    Analyzing the Stocks for Bonds Swap

       To gauge the riskiness of the net transaction of selling government bonds and buying

corporate stocks, we use market returns from 1954 to 1997 and simulate what would have




                                                  9
happened if the government had completed the transaction. We separately look at what would

have happened with the government selling 10 year and 20 year bonds. We assume that market

returns would have been unaffected by the government transaction. This almost certainly favors

the exchange strategy that in reality might very well drive up interest rates and depress equity

returns. The counterfactual simulations have the government selling bonds in the past, buying

the S&P 500 stock portfolio with the proceeds, and then paying all of the bond payments

(interest and principal) from the resulting stock portfolio. The strategy is deemed successful if

all of the payments on the bonds can be made with the stock funds with money left over. The

strategy is deemed to have been a failure if the stock portfolio is unable to generate sufficient

cash to make the required bond payments. In the discussion below, we initially explore how the

strategy would have worked with the actual time series of returns generated by the stock market

(and the actual historical interest rates on government bonds). The interest rates are those

published in the Economic Report of the President (1998) and computed by the Board of

Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The stock market returns are the “Large Company

Stocks” (i.e. S&P 500) total return series in Ibbotson (1998). The problem with this historical

1954-97 approach is that there are not many independent ten or twenty year periods in our data

set. In fact, there are only four completely independent ten-year runs of data and two of twenty

years. We could add more data by examining pre-1954 information and we will do so in some of

the analyses in this section. There is a serious question about whether adding data before 1954

helps or hurts in assessing the viability of a proposed strategy for the 21st Century. The problem

is that the additional data are likely drawn from a different regime and, therefore, may do more

harm than good to the analysis. After examining the actual performance of the stock market in

the 1954-97 period, we report on extensive bootstrap simulations of what could have happened




                                                 10
using the same annual return data, but now with the order of the returns randomly scrambled

according to a bootstrap statistical approach.

       First, we examine the case of the government borrowing money for ten years at the actual

historical interest rates on U.S. government bonds and investing in the S&P 500. Figure 2 shows

the money left over at the maturity of the bonds (per dollar borrowed) after all bond payments

had been made out of the stock account. The net cost of the original asset swap is zero, so any

residual money is a pure profit and any residual shortfall is a loss. Given our definition of

success and failure, the asset swap strategy would have failed 7 times out of the 34

counterfactual experiments. The limitations of the actual historical record are very apparent in

the results, however. Basically, the strategy of the government issuing ten-year bonds and

buying the S&P500 would have worked from 1954 through 1964 and again from 1975 through

1987. However, it would have failed in 7 of the 10 years 1965 through 1974. This reflects the

limitations of only observing four completely independent ten-year sets of data. On an annual

basis the failure rate is 7 out of 34 or 20.6 percent, but a more informative way of reporting it is

that the failure rate is roughly 1 in 4 (from the fact that we had four non-overlapping stretches of

data and the strategy worked in 3 of the 4). It should also be noted that our criterion for success

is very modest. We are not requiring that stocks match the 7 percent real yield assumed in

scoring the Maintain Benefits plan. Rather, we are simply requiring that the stock returns were

sufficient to pay off the bonds, which had low or even negative ex-post-real returns (especially in

the 1970s).

       While we have been focusing on the non-trivial chance of failure of the asset swap

strategy, it should also be noted that Figure 2 indicates that it indeed would have worked 27 out

of 34 times. Further, when it works, the average gain is quite substantial. The numbers in the

figure are the amount of money left in the stock account (per dollar borrowed) at the maturity of

the bonds. The overall average amount left over for the 34 experiments is 78.5 cents per dollar

borrowed; the average over the 27 years with positive outcomes is almost $1.05. Of course, it is

well known that on average stocks outperform bonds by a wide margin. What is less well known

is that borrowing money for ten years (even with the favorable interest rates available to the

government) to buy stocks is very risky.

       To acquire a better sense of how such a government asset swap policy might work in the

future, we have used the same set of 1954-97 stock returns as the basis for generating simulated

sequences of returns using a moving-block bootstrap method to allow for autocorrelation. For

each year, 1954 through 1997, we calculate what would have happened if the government had




                                                 12
borrowed additional money with ten-year bonds (at the actual prevailing interest rate). The stock

market return in the year of the borrowing is taken as the actual return in that year. However, the

succeeding real returns for the next nine years are randomly chosen in blocks of three-year

sequences or “blocks” (with replacement) from the set of all realized real returns. For example,

in order to calculate how this strategy would have worked in 1971, we compute the terms on the

borrowed money according to the prevailing nominal interest rates in 1971. Further, we assume

that the return on the stock market for the first year was the actually observed 1971 return. For

the returns for the next nine years we randomly choose three dates (with replacement, meaning

that the same date could be chosen more than once) between 1954 and 1995. If we choose 1958,

1988, and 1956, for instance, then the ten year string of real returns under this simulation would

be (R71,R58, R59, R60, R88, R89, R90, R56, R57, R58), where Rt is the total real return of the S&P 500

for year t. The fact that we are choosing three-year blocks of data should be apparent in this

sample vector of returns. The real returns chosen via the bootstrap technique are converted into

nominal returns using actual historical inflation rates. For instance, in the counter factual

experiment of borrowing money in 1971, we use the actual inflation rates for 1971-80 to

generate the nominal returns resulting from the real returns chosen by the bootstrap process. For

each asset swap year, we examine 1,000 such random sequences of returns.3 The failure rate for

the strategy differs by the year of the swap because of different interest rates and because of

different first-year stock market returns. The results of this bootstrap simulation are shown in

Figure 3.

       Implicitly we have assumed stability in the underlying probability distribution

determining real stock returns during the 1954-97 period and that each observation was equally

likely. Of course, it is certain that these assumptions are not entirely correct; it is also certain

that many low probability events never occurred in the observation period. Finally, we are

assuming that the same underlying probability distributions that generated the 1954-97

observations will generate stock market returns in the future. In total, this is a strong set of

assumptions. Nonetheless, the implied results provide important insights. According to Figure

3, the overall failure rate is predicted to be 22.1 percent, meaning that the asset swap policy

failed 9,723 times in the 44,000 simulations we did for the combined 44 years of analysis. The

expected failure rate for the most recent ten-year period was 44.7 percent due to the higher real

interest rates of this period. Note that these failure rates are most likely conservative since they

still are based on the robust returns realized in U.S. equity markets in the 1954-97 period. These

failure rates may therefore form something of a lower bound on the riskiness of the asset swap

strategy going forward.4




                                                   14
       The pattern of failure probabilities in Figure 3 stand in sharp contrast to the success or

failure patterns in Figure 2 using the actual realized time series of returns. The reasons for the

divergence are easily explained. The accelerating inflation of the 1970s was not fully

incorporated into government interest rates until 1981 and 1982. The ex-ante analysis of Figure

3 shows that to be the period with the highest chance of failure for the ten-year bonds for stocks

swap (particularly with the poor performance of the stock market in 1981). However, ex-post

the stock market has performed extraordinarily well from 1982 to the present. As a result, the

asset swap strategy would have worked in 1981 and 1982, even though our bootstrap simulations

show that it had a relatively low probability of doing so. On the other hand, the ex-ante failure

probabilities in 1965-72 were not particularly high; nonetheless, in fact, the strategy would have

failed in six of those eight years as shown in Figure 2. The point is that the returns that were

actually experienced were just a single set of draws from an economic and financial system

generating risky returns.

       We perform the same analysis for twenty-year bonds. In this case, the limitations of the

data are even more severe since there are only two completely independent sets of twenty-year

observations in the 1954-97 data set. Therefore, it is difficult to know how to interpret the fact

that the asset swap strategy would have worked for every year 1954-77 using actual interest rates

and the actual time series of stock market returns. This says very little about the underlying

chance of failure with a future policy of swapping twenty-year government bonds for a

diversified portfolio of common stocks. The same bootstrap approach is used in this case as

with the ten-year bonds. Now, instead of a single historical set of stock market returns, we can

generate thousands of simulated sequences of returns generated from a random selection of the

actual annual observations. The results of doing that are shown in Figure 4.

       The pattern of failure probabilities is primarily determined by the actual pattern of

nominal interest rates on government bonds and by the actual first-year return on the stock

market. Therefore, it is not surprising that the general pattern of failure rates is similar in the

twenty-year bond case of Figure 4 and the ten-year bond case of Figure 3. The high failure

probability (47.3 percent) for the asset swap strategy in 1974 is due to the fact that the real return

on the S&P 500 in 1974 was –34.5 percent. If stocks lose more than one-third of their value

immediately after you sell bonds to buy stocks, your chances of making the swap work are

greatly diminished.

         For twenty-year bonds, the overall predicted failure rate during 1954-78 is 6.24 percent.

In the most recent ten-year period (1969-78) the failure rate is predicted as 12.27 percent, which

we view as a considerable chance of failure. This suggests that if the government were to

borrow money by issuing twenty-year government bonds (assuming it could do so



                                                    16
without raising interest rates) and if the real returns on the stock market were generated by the

same process that produced the returns of 1954-97 (although with the ordering of the returns

randomly scrambled), the chance that the government would have to borrow additional money

when the bonds mature is about one in eight. The asset swap has a considerable chance of being

counter productive in terms of the finances of the federal government in general and Social

Security in particular.

       The historical record on interest rates also represents only a single set of realizations of

what might have happened. Future real (or nominal for that matter) interest rates may be higher

or lower than what we have observed in the past. To add some robustness to our results, we

examine what would have happened to the finances of the government if it issued inflation-

indexed bonds and bought stocks with the proceeds. In our first experiment, we set the real

interest rate on ten-year inflation-protected bonds at 3.5 percent. This is actually somewhat less

than the recently observed interest rate on this type of security. Each year the principal on the

bonds is marked up to reflect realized inflation. The bonds are assumed to pay 3.5 percent

interest each year on the revised (i.e. inflation adjusted) principal amount and at maturity return

the original investment marked up by cumulative inflation. The question we want to ask is how

likely is it that an S&P 500 stock portfolio can generate sufficient returns to pay off the claims of

such inflation-indexed bonds?

       Once again, we can look at how this asset swap would have fared historically if it could

have been accomplished without affecting the actually observed stock market returns. In this

case we have used the observed stock market returns and inflation rates for the period 1927-97

and examined counterfactual asset swaps for the 61 years 1927-87. Basically, we have six full




                                                 17
and completely independent (i.e. non-overlapping) runs of ten-year data. Figure 5 shows the

results for this case with ten-year inflation indexed bonds. The strategy would have failed 18

times out of the 61 years examined for a failure rate of 29.5 percent. The failures are strongly

autocorrelated, however, because of the overlapping returns. If the swap strategy fails in year t,

it is quite likely that it will also fail in year t + 1 since the two experiments involve nine common

years of stock market returns.   Not surprisingly, Figure 5 shows that the asset swap strategy

would have had mixed success in the 1927-40 period, followed by twenty-three years of

complete success, followed by eleven years in a row of failure and, finally, by thirteen years of

success. Some of the failures are quite substantial. In seven of the 1964-74 years the

government would have had to borrow a second time an amount roughly equal to its initial

issuance of bonds to be able to pay the principal of the maturing bonds.




                                                 18
       The autocorrelation in the success or failure of this strategy calls into question one aspect

of the Maintain Benefits and Aaron-Reischauer plans that we have not yet modeled – namely

that both plans advocate that the asset swaps take place continuously. Both plans would only

gradually phase in the private securities investments of the OASDI Trust Fund. One could hope

that some kind of “dollar-cost averaging” phenomenon would make this less risky than making

the asset reallocation all at once. However, the eleven failures in a row from 1964 through 1974

indicate that considerable risk remains even with such a gradual transition. If Social Security

had engaged in this particular asset swap (ten-year inflation-indexed bonds for a portfolio of the

S&P 500) from 1964 through 1974, the financial crises that the system faced in 1977 and again

in 1983 would have been considerably worsened.

       We have also simulated how the asset swap of ten-year inflation-indexed bonds for

common stocks would perform in the future if future returns and inflation rates were drawn from

the 1927-97 set of realizations drawn randomly with a bootstrap technique. The predicted

overall failure rate was 29 percent. That is, the stock portfolio failed to generate the necessary

3.5 percent real return required to pay-off the obligations of the inflation-indexed bonds 29

percent of the time. If we had defined failure as the stock investments falling short of the seven

percent real rate of return assumed in scoring the MB plan in Table 1, the failure rate would, of

course, be much higher.

       The results for twenty-year inflation-indexed bonds are similar. Figure 6 shows the

counterfactual history for asset swaps from 1927 through 1977. The strategy would have failed

18 times out of the 51 years for a failure rate of 35.3 percent. Even more telling is the fact that it

would have failed fifteen years in a row from 1959-73. The strategy is very successful from

1932 through 1954 and again in 1975-77. This is not surprising since we know that the average




                                                  19
real return on the stock market in 1927-97 has been well above 3.5 percent. The failure or

limited success of the strategy for twenty years in a row (1955-74), however, is a big problem for

its advocates. The overall failure rate when the 1927-97 inflation rates and stock market returns

are scrambled with a bootstrap technique of choosing the observations is 25.4 percent.

           Table 2 sums up what we have learned thus far. We have examined a total of four

different cases for asset swaps based on ten-year bonds and the same four cases for twenty-year

bonds. The bootstrap simulations are probably more informative regarding the future chances of

success for the exchange than the numbers based on the actual historical time series of returns.

That is because the future will not be a precise replay of the past. The bootstrap simulation

technique gives us a better handle on the probability of future success. If real stock market

returns are generated in the future from the same distribution which generated the actual 1954-97

returns and if real interest rates on bonds approximate 3.5 percent, then the failure rate of a

strategy of swapping bonds for stocks is about 29 percent for ten-year bonds and 25 percent for

twenty-year bonds. These figures refer to the final column of results in Table 2. It is important

to note, however, that all variations of the asset swap simulations that we have done imply a

considerable risk of failure.



V.     Tax Considerations

       We have ignored personal income tax issues thus far, but they deserve some

consideration. The federal government collects taxes on the returns of stocks held in private

hands and would recapture some of the interest payments on the bonds through tax proceeds. If

the average marginal tax rate on the returns is the same for the stocks and bonds, then it is a

fairly minor correction to the above results. For instance, assume that on the “other side” of the

transaction are defined contribution pension funds. Further, assume that as people see that the

Social Security Trust Fund is moving out of bonds and into stocks they are willing to move in the

opposite direction in their own IRA, 401(k), or other DC accounts (without a change in interest

rates). If the average marginal tax rate of the pension plan holders will be 25 percent when the

money is drawn out, then the government effectively owns one-fourth of the assets in the plan.

If the government makes money on the swap on its own account, it loses one-fourth of its profits

due to its participation in the DC accounts (which took the other side of the asset swap) via the

tax system. The failure rate analysis of the previous section need not be modified, although the




                                                 21
absolute size of the gains and losses is reduced by 25 percent. If the other side of the transaction

consisted of corporate accounts backing DB pension promises, then the gain or loss in the

funding of the pension plan presumably would be reflected in the stock of the corporation

offering the DB plan. Stockholders will eventually pay capital gains taxes on their stock (sooner

rather than later if the stocks are held by an actively managed mutual fund), and once again the

government will find itself with roughly a twenty or twenty-five percent position on the opposite

side of the swap that it thought it was engaged in. Also, once again, the failure rate analysis of

the previous section is unaffected.

       We think that pensions are the most likely “other side” of the asset swap transaction. We

have also examined the case where privately held assets are exchanged with the government. If

the average marginal tax rate on the interest payments of the government exceeds the blended

average marginal tax rate faced by dividends, and short and long-term capital gains from the

stock returns, then the failure probabilities are slightly improved by tax considerations. The

government recaptures a higher percentage of its interest payments through the tax system than it

did on the return on common stocks. The effect is fairly minor, however. We probably were

exploring the upper limit of the effect in assuming that the average marginal income tax rate on

interest on the bonds was 33 percent whereas the average marginal tax rate on long-term capital

gains was 20 percent. Both numbers are almost certainly on the high side, but the difference

may be reasonable. With such parameters the projected failure rate of issuing fixed interest rate

ten-year bonds turns out to be 25.1 percent. The twenty-year bond failure rate falls from 6.2

percent to 5.4 percent. The failure rate for ten-year bonds remains 21.1 percent even if somehow

the stocks had paid zero taxes and the bonds faced an average marginal tax rate of 33 percent.

The worst case for the government is the opposite of that, of course. If the bonds are somehow




                                                 22
held in completely tax-free accounts whereas the stocks had been fully taxable (33 percent on

dividends and short-term capital gains and 20 percent on long-term capital gains), then the

predicted failure rate with ten-year fixed interest bonds jumps to 37.9 percent.

        Our conclusion regarding taxes is that they are an important second-order consideration,

but that the results of the previous section – that the government issuing bonds and using the

proceeds to buy stocks – is very risky is not materially altered by including the effects of taxes.



VI.     Interpretation of Failure Results

        We feel that the most appropriate of our asset swap simulations in terms of predicting the

likelihood of future failure of such a policy are those which use the 3.5 percent real interest rate

inflation-protected bonds and generate real stock returns with the bootstrap procedure. These

results are relevant even if the government actually swaps nominal bonds for stocks, because the

real interest cost of such bonds is far more likely to approximate 3.5 percent than the negative

real interest rates which prevailed in the 1970s. The result is that the asset swap strategy has

about a 25 percent chance of failure with twenty-year bonds. This means that there is a 25

percent chance that the switch into stocks will make the solvency problems of Social Security

worse rather than better after twenty years. Of course, there is about a 50 percent chance that the

strategy will not work as well as assumed by its proponents (and listed in Table 1). That is

because the 7 percent real rate of return assumed in that table is roughly the median long-run real

rate of return for stocks.

        Someone might take the view that if stocks are behind after twenty years, the government

can simply borrow the shortfall (or more) and buy yet more stocks. With a long enough time

horizon, stocks are bound to beat out bonds, right? First, this is not quite right. It is true that the




                                                  23
probability of a shortfall is lower the longer the time horizon. Of course, the magnitude of the

shortfall in the unlikely event that stocks have a bad forty or fifty year run can be enormous if

each intermediate shortfall is covered with more borrowed money. Second, and probably more

importantly, the balance sheet position of Social Security is economically and politically

important. The Social Security crises of 1977 and 1983 were caused by the fact the impending

exhaustion of the OASI Trust Fund. Of course, the government could have bailed out the fund

by borrowing money and handing it over to Social Security. But that action was not seriously

considered. Our point is that the Trust Fund would have been in even worse shape in the late

1970s and early 1980s if it had been investing in stocks in the 1960s instead of the special issue

Treasury Bonds. In that case, the benefit cuts and tax increases would have been even more

severe than they were. One would not have been able to get through that period with the

argument that we can just borrow more money and buy more stocks and sooner or later the

strategy will pay off. The extra risks of stocks translate directly into riskier future benefits and

taxes.

         The failure probabilities that we have estimated are only as good as the modeling of the

underlying process generating real stock market returns. In a number of respects we have erred

on the side of favoring the strategy. First, we have assumed that the government could engage in

the swap without changing interest rates and stock market rates of return. Second, we have

assumed that future stock market returns will be generated from the observed returns from 1954-

97 (1927-97 in some cases). The average real rate of return on stocks from 1954-97 was 9.7

percent. The average from 1927-97 was 9.6 percent. Still, relative to either international

comparisons or longer historical returns (Siegel(1994)), these average returns are quite high.




                                                  24
       For most of the results that we have presented, we have worked with three-year blocks of

stock market returns. We have assumed that each of the three-year blocks observed from 1954-

97 is equally likely to be repeated, independent of the previous returns drawn. There is a

literature on long-run mean reversion which indicates that high returns are more likely to follow

low returns (and vice versa)(see, for example, Poterba and Summers(1988), Fama and

French(1988), and chapter 2 of Campbell, Lo and MacKinlay(1997)). If this were true, then long

horizon investing would be safer than if returns were drawn independently from previous

realizations. The statistical evidence on long-run mean reversion is not very powerful for the

same reason that we have had to downplay our actual counterfactual results – there simply are

not many long runs to observe in order to investigate such long-run phenomena. The empirical

studies that have been done cannot rule out that returns are actually serially independent. With

that said, all we can say is that if returns were generated by a process exhibiting long-run mean

reversion, then the asset swap strategy would fail less often than we have estimated. Our

simulations of the asset swap strategy using one, two, three and five year blocks of data showed

roughly the same failure probabilities. This indicates that mean reversion, to the extent it

operates in less than five years, is at most a relatively weak phenomenon.

       Our overall conclusion is that the simplifications in this study have not biased the results

against the asset swap policy. The relatively high mean return that we assume for equities must

be at least as important an assumption as the lack of mean reversion in returns over periods

greater than three years. If asked the likelihood that investing some of the central trust fund of

Social Security in equities would worsen its finances in ten or twenty years, our best guess

answer would be that there is a 25 to 30 percent chance.




                                                 25
VII.   Is a Universal Defined Benefit Retirement Plan Feasible?

       Our conclusion thus far has the usual “no-free-lunch” ring to it. Unfortunately, one

cannot eliminate the actuarial deficit of Social Security by swapping bonds for stocks. If it were

possible, then we would also do well to eliminate the cost of the defense budget with the same

maneuver. This raises the question of who bears the risks in the current Social Security system

and who would bear the additional risks if the trust fund were to invest in private securities as

advocated by the Maintain Benefits plan and the Aaron-Reischauer plan. Even more

fundamentally, it raises the issue of whether it is feasible for the government to offer a defined

benefit plan with universal coverage.

       At one extreme, consider a defined benefit plan offered by a financially strong company

such as General Motors. The company can promise its workers a particular or “defined” benefit

in retirement and fund that obligation with private stocks and bonds. The worker can accumulate

a vested, safe retirement benefit (although not safe from the effects of inflation) while the firm,

or more accurately its stockholders, bear the investment risks of the underlying portfolio. The

point is that it is quite transparent how a safe benefit was created from risky investments – the

risky residual claim is borne by the General Motors stockholders.

       At the other extreme, consider what would happen if a self-employed person decided that

he would like to provide himself a defined benefit pension funded with stocks and bonds. Is it

feasible? Can a person invest, say, $30,000 in stocks and bonds and promise himself or herself a

safe retirement benefit of $3,000 per year? The answer is “no” since the employer bears the risk

of the assets not being adequate to fund the benefits. But a self-employed person is both

employee and employer. The investment risks have not been transferred at all and, therefore, the

do-it-yourself DB strategy cannot work. The only way for a self-employed person to end up with




                                                 26
a defined benefit-like retirement claim is for them to contract with an insurance company or

other third party which will provide the benefit and assume the investment risks.

       Now consider a universal coverage defined benefit Social Security retirement pension

system funded with risky private securities. Is it possible to provide safe retirement benefits as

in the General Motors example or is it more like the example of the self-employed person who

cannot make meaningful retirement benefit promises without the help of a third party? If

everyone is in the Social Security system, then collectively everyone bears the investment risk

and it makes little sense to call the program a defined benefit scheme. There are only two ways

that we can think of to maintain the defined benefit nature of the system. One is to divide the

population by age cohort. Conceivably the elderly can be promised safe benefits with the young

playing the role of the insurance company and bearing the investment risks of the underlying

portfolio. The future payroll taxes or the future benefits of the young will be more risky if the

Trust Fund engages in the kind of asset swap we have been analyzing. One of the drawbacks of

a defined benefit structure is that the risks imposed upon the young are not very transparent. If

we maintain the defined benefits for both the old and the young, then the taxes faced by the

young will be even more volatile. The point is simply that the considerable risks involved in

investing in private securities, which we have documented above, have to be borne by someone.

The defined benefit nature of the system does not work very well if the investment risks are

borne by personal income taxpayers. The reason is that there is nearly a complete overlap

between Social Security participants and personal income taxpayers. In order to create a safe

asset from a risky portfolio, the risks have to be shifted to someone other than the holder of the

supposedly safe claim. Shifting the risks from Social Security participants to taxpayers is not

enough of a shift to accomplish this.




                                                 27
       At least conceptually, the investment risks could be shifted internationally. Shiller (1998)

makes this point in his theoretical paper on risks and Social Security. The Europeans, for

instance, could play the role of the insurance company and offer Americans a safe defined

benefit pension system by assuming the investment risks themselves. There is a question of what

terms they would demand to hold all of the risks. Further, while it is clear that there are

advantages of the young and old and the Europeans and Americans all sharing in the risks of

global financial markets, it is not at all clear why one group (the young or the Europeans) should

hold all of the risk so that another group (the elderly Americans) can enjoy a safe, defined benefit

retirement program. The optimal risk-sharing arrangement would have everyone bearing some

risk and, thus, any optimal universal pension plan would not be strictly of a defined benefit type.

       One problem with investing the central OASDI Trust Fund in private securities that we

have not emphasized is the danger that the investment decisions would be subject to political

pressures and, therefore, would not manage risk efficiently. There would undoubtedly be

pressure to invest in only American companies or only unionized companies or to allocate the

investments evenly across the fifty states or not to invest in tobacco companies or those doing

business in Burma. Aaron and Reischauer are confident that certain organizational structures

that they propose (including the creation of a “Social Security Reserve Board”) could insulate

fund management from political control by elected officials. We are not so sure. It is quite

possible that capital would be less efficiently allocated with government ownership of equities

meaning that the asset swap could reduce aggregate future GDP.

VIII. Conclusions

       In this paper we have examined the risk of having the central OASDI Trust Fund invest

in private securities. We have noted that net transaction is an asset swap with the government

selling bonds to the public and using the proceeds to buy a portfolio of common stocks of equal

value. The asset reallocation does not increase saving, wealth, or GDP. We examine whether it

actually would improve the finances of the Social Security system. We adopt a convention that

the asset swap is deemed successful if the stock portfolio generates sufficient cash to pay off the

interest and principal of the bonds and still have money left over. The swap is a failure if the

stock portfolio is insufficient to do that and the bond repayments require another round of

borrowing. We have looked at several cases including ten-year and twenty-year fixed interest

rate bonds and ten and twenty-year inflation-indexed debt. The predicted failure rate from the

bootstrap simulations of future returns range from 6 to 29 percent. Further, failure would be

autocorrelated with long strings of annual failures possible. For instance, when we examined the

counterfactual issuance of twenty-year inflation indexed bonds we found that the asset swap

strategy failed fifteen years in a row between 1959 and 1973. Clearly, this policy cannot reliably

reduce the actuarial deficit of Social Security.

       Individual accounts and defined contribution pension plans certainly involve significant

risks. An individual who shifts from bonds to stocks runs the same or greater risk that the move

will be counterproductive after ten or twenty years. However, the defined contribution plans

have the advantage that their risks are rather straightforward. Further, people who want to

minimize risks can invest in safe assets such as inflation-indexed bonds. The analysis of this

paper has shown that an OASDI Trust Fund invested in private securities would generate risk for

Americans, but the precise incidence of that risk would likely remain ambiguous.

 Our paper investigated the effects of defined contribution accumulators consistently acquiring stocks or bonds for
careers between 1926 and 1989. We showed that stock accumulators consistently ended up with more money than

bond accumulators for all careers longer than twenty years in the 1926-89 period. The result is weakened by the fact
that we only used the actual historical pattern of financial returns and that there are only three completely
independent twenty year runs of data in the 1926-89 period. We extended the data to 1876-1990 in an unpublished
manuscript. There we found that the career length had to be forty years before stock accumulators always ended up
ahead of bond accumulators. Once again, the data limitations do not allow one to confidently predict the likelihood
of stocks outperforming bonds for long careers. In the present paper, we try to get around the data limitations by
using the bootstrap statistical procedures.

  Many wage contracts are officially or unofficially tied to the CPI. It is not clear that the Office of the Actuary took
the feedback of changing the official CPI on wages into account. If not, the gain from the restructuring of the CPI
may be exaggerated.

  Once again, we are concentrating on the failure probability as a measure of the riskiness of the asset swap. The
asset swap does work more than fifty percent of the time and often generates large profits.
