                                           ABSTRACT

        This paper presents the first attempt to estimate the benefits of reducing crime using the
contingent-valuation (CV) method. We focus on gun violence, a crime of growing policy concern
in America. Our data come from a national survey in which we ask respondents referendum-type
questions that elicit their willingness-to-pay (WTP) to reduce gun violence by 30 percent. We
estimate that the public's WTP to reduce gun violence by 30 percent equals $23.8 billion, or
$750,000 per injury. Our estimate implies a statistical value of life ($4.05 to $6.25 million) that is
quite consistent with those derived from other methods.

I. INTRODUCTION

         In 1996 a total of 14,037 people were killed as the result of gun assaults in the United

States, and perhaps another 70,000 or so were non-fatally wounded (CDC, 1999, Cook et a!.,

1999). Concern about gun violence has prompted a substantial policy response. For example, in

New York City, the elite Street Crimes Unit employs aggressive stop-and-search tactics to reduce

illegal gun carrying in high-crime neighborhoods (Bratton and Kobler, 1998). In St. Louis the

police seek parental consent to search homes and seize illegal firearms kept by teens (Rosenfeld

and Decker, 1996), while the Boston Gun Project targets illegal gun trafficking and gang

shootings (Kennedy, Piehl and Braga, 1996, Piehl, Kennedy and Braga, 1998). At the national

level, policies ranging from background checks for gun-show sales to an outright ban on

handguns are being actively considered.'

        While at least some of these programs may be effective in reducing gun violence

(Blumstein and Rosenfeld, 1998), each imposes some cost on society in the form of additional

government expenditures and inconvenience to citizens. Identifying the optimal amount of

enforcement and regulatory activity to reduce gun violence requires cost-benefit analysis

(Becker, 1968, Stigler, 1970, Rottenberg, 1970), which in turn requires estimates for the benefits

of reducing gun injuries. Such estimates are also relevant for the lawsuits that a growing number

of cities have filed against the gun industry, and for proposals to increase the tax on firearms.

       The present paper represents the first attempt to estimate the benefits of reducing crime

using the contingent-valuation (CV) method. Our focus on gun violence in particular is

motivated by the growing policy concern about this issue. We adopt the standard approach of

public economics and define the benefit of a public good as what society is willing to pay (WTP)

to achieve some change in the level of the good (Viscusi, 1992). The public good in question

here is freedom from the ex ante risk of victimization, with the attendant reduction in fear and

self-protection effort. This ex ante approach is appropriate for the decision problem facing

policymakers, who must decide whether to fund crime-control programs that reduce future

crimes to anonymous victims.

       In contrast, previous studies of the benefits of reducing gun violence have adopted an cx

post approach that begins with a count of the annual number of gunshot injuries and then

multiplies this figure by some estimate of the costs per injury.2 The primary limitation with this

framework is that it is incomplete, and ignores the costs that the risk of gun violence imposes on

even citizens who are not victimized. Much of this research has been conducted within the

public health 'cost-of-illness" (COT) tradition, which understates the cost per injury by focusing

only on the costs of medical treatment for gunshot injuries and other direct costs plus an

incomplete measure of lost productivity (Max and Rice, 1 993).3 More recent studies improve on

the COT approach by adding measures for the value of life and health obtained from the



        2 Only a handful of studies have adopted an cx ante approach to evaluating the benefits of
reducing crime. All of these studies rely on hedonic-pricing methods to relate crime rates and
housing prices (Thaler, 1978, Hellman and Naroff, 1978, Rizzo, 1979). These estimates rely on
data from a single city, may confound the price effects of crime with other factors, and are
incomplete. None of these studies focuses on gun violence specifically.

        The COT approach defines lost productivity as foregone earnings plus the lost value of
household work, which ignores all other forms of non-market production.

workplace-risk or jury-award literatures (Miller and Cohen, 1996, 1997, Miller Cohen and

Wiersema, 1996, Anderson, forthcoming), though even these studies still adopt an expost

framework.

        The estimates presented in the current paper are obtained from a nationally representative

CV survey of 1,204 adults conducted in 1998. The survey elicits respondents' WTP to finance a

30 percent reduction in gun violence using a referendum-type CV question. The advantages of

our CV approach are that it yields comprehensive estimates for societal WTP, utilizes nationally

representative data, and allows a focus on a specific type of crime that is the subject of

considerable public-policy concern.

        Our results suggest that a 30 percent reduction in gun violence is worth $23.8 billion to

the American public. Dividing this figure by the number of gunshot injuries in 1996 implies a

WTP per injury equal to around $750,000. Despite some limitations of the CV data used to

derive our estimates, these figures imply a value for one statistical life that is quite consistent

with those derived in other contexts (Viscusi, 1992, 1993).

       The paper is organized as follows. The second section reviews the willingness-to-pay

approach and discusses the application of this method to the case of gunshot injuries. The third

section describes our data and the fourth presents the empirical results. The fifth section

discusses the implications of these findings.

II.    THE WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY APPROACH

       In this section we discuss the willingness-to-pay approach within the context of gun

violence, and then discuss different methods for estimating WTP.



                                                 -3-
A. Defining Willingness-to-Pay

        Under the traditional benefit-cost framework of public economics, the benefits of a

violence-reduction program consists of the sum of the values that citizens are willing to pay

(WTP) to fund some program or policy that reduces the risk of injury. We assume that

individual WTP to support a program to reduce gun violence is motivated by three factors.

        First, the individual may attach some value to the reduction in risk of being shot.

       Second, she may value the reduction in risk to other members of her household. Because
       we assume that individuals value the well-being of others in the household and because
       households pool income, we follow Manning et al. (1991) and treat households as the
       economic unit of interest.

       Finally, she may receive some financial gain from reductions in the number of gunshot
       injuries to strangers, since some of the relevant costs are shared across members of the
       community through government programs and private insurance. Further, she may
       benefit from a general improvement in the quality of life in the community, as a reduced
       threat of being caught in the cross fire engenders more socializing.

       Total social WTP is defined as the sum of what each individual household is willing to

pay. As a practical matter, whether financial and other externalities are actually reflected in

people's survey responses or market behaviors is not clear. Consumers may have imperfect

information about the external costs associated with injuries to others, or may simply not

consider these costs. While analysts could in principle directly measure the financial

externalities associated with gunshot injuries and add this to the results of a CV survey, the net

effect of financial and other externalities is unlikely to be a simple addition of these factors.

B. Measuring WTP

        One way to measure societal WTP for programs that reduce health risks is to examine

marketplace behavior. For example, a widely used approach is to examine the extra wage


                                                 -4-
compensation that workers require in order to take risky jobs; these wage premiums reflect the

price of some health risk in the labor market.4 Another possibility is to examine variations in the

prices of housing5 or other consumer goods6 related to health risks to estimate the value that

people attach to risk reduction. These measures are in principle incomplete and in practice

difficult to implement due to the possibility of unobservables correlated with both prices and

risks.

         When market behavior cannot be directly examined to estimate societal WTP for a public

good, the preferred method, known as "contingent valuation (CV)," is to survey a representative

group of respondents about how much they would be willing to pay. A 1992 panel sponsored by

the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) outlined the key components of

a CV study that would maximize the likelihood of producing reliable results (Arrow et a!., 1993),

which include the use of referendum formats that ask respondents to vote on a hypothetical

government program. The referendum format is deemed preferable to open-ended questions

because citizens have experience in casting such votes, and because the referendum format

minimizes incentives to free ride (Mitchell and Carson, 1989).

         Whether even high-quality CV studies produce reliable estimates of WTP remains the

topic of ongoing debate. One concern stems from the tendency of survey respondents to present

themselves favorably to interviewers (Sudman and Bradburn, 1974), which produces social



         See for example Smith and Gilbert (1985), Moore and Viscusi (1988a,b, 1990a,b), and
Viscusi and Moore (1989).

          See for example Gayer, Hamilton and Viscusi (1998).

                                                -5-
desirability bias or yea-saying. A related concern is the possibility that CV responses are

motivated more by the respondent's desire to "purchase moral satisfaction" rather than support

the provision of a defined quantity of some public good (Kahneman and Knetsch, 1992). Both

problems may manifest themselves in what is known as the "embedding effect," where the

respondent's WTP is independent of the quantity of the public good that is being provided.

       The empirical evidence on the existence of embedding effects is mixed (see, for example,

Desvousges et a!., 1993 versus Balson et a!., 1990). Other studies provide support for the CV

method using experimental designs that compare reported with actual WTP, or by comparing CV

responses to estimated travel times to use parks and other public goods or to wage premiums

associated with health risks (Brookshire et a!., 1982, Viscusi and O'Conner, 1984, Brookshire

and Coursey, 1987, Smith, 1992, Hanemann, 1994). Yet the evidence on the CV method is not

unequivocal (Hausman, 1993, Diamond and Hausman, 1994).

III. CONTINGENT VALUATION SURVEY DATA

       The 1998 National Gun Policy Survey (NGPS) is a nationally representative telephone

survey of 1,204 American adults conducted during the Fall of 1998 by the National Opinion

Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago. Interviews were conducted with one

adult per sampled household, with the adult chosen randomly via the most-recent-birthday

method. The response rate for the NGPS was 61 percent (see Kuby, Imhof and Shin, 1999).

       After a series of questions asking about their attitudes towards government and various

current or proposed gun regulations, respondents are asked the following questions: "Suppose

that you were asked to vote for or against a new program in your state to reduce gun thefts and

illegal gun dealers. This program would make it more difficult for criminals and delinquents to

                                                -6-
obtain guns. It would reduce gun injuries by about 30 percent, but taxes would have to be

increased to pay for it. If it would cost you an extra [$50 / $100! $200] in annual taxes would

you vote for or against this new program?' The amount of the tax increase that the respondent is

asked about, either $50, $100 or $200, is randomly determined by the survey software.

Respondents are then asked a follow-up where the dollar amount asked about in the initial

referendum question is either doubled or halved, depending on whether the respondent's initial

answer was positive or negative, respectively.

       As noted earlier, we assume that respondents are reporting on the total dollar value that

their household would be willing to pay to fund this program, rather than reporting strictly on the

value that they themselves would pay. Our assumption is conservative in that if respondents are

in fact reporting on personal rather than household WTP, our estimates will understate total

societal WTP to fund the hypothetical reduction in gun crime.7

       The empirical work presented below provides some support for the credibility of these

CV responses. For example, WTP is positively related to household income. We also find that

WTP increases with household size; since the reduction in risk the household experiences is

related to the number of members, this finding suggests that the responses are not driven entirely

by social desirability bias or moral satisfaction.




         One implication of this assumption is that our analysis should convert the NGPS
sampling weights from person weights into household weights. The NGPS respondent weights
calculated by NORC equal one divided by the probability of the household's selection into the
sample. The weights are then divided by the adult's probability of selection from within the
household, equal to (1/A) where A is the number of adults in the home. To convert these into
household weights we multiply by (1/A).
                                                     -7-
IV. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

       We begin by presenting a non-parametric estimate for WTP to reduce gun violence by 30

percent. This estimate does not impose any assumptions on the population distribution of WTP,

and suggests a WTP equal to $21.2 billion. We then present a more elaborate set of maximum-

likelihood estimates that are derived under alternative assumptions about the distribution of

WTP. Our preferred estimates suggest a societal WTP equal to $23.8 billion, equal to around

$750,000 per gunshot injury avoided.

A. Non-parametric Estimates

       Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics from the NGPS data. The proportion of

respondents who vote to support the violence-reduction program decreases as the amount

required to fund the program increases, ranging from 76 percent at a cost of $50 more in annual

taxes to 38 percent at a cost of $400. Figure 1 provides a graphical representation of the

cumulative distribution function implied by these descriptive statistics.

       If we integrate under the area shown in Figure 1 and multiply by the total number of

households in the U.S. — equal to 99.6 million in 1996 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1997) — we

obtain an estimated total WTP of $21.2 billion to reduce assault-related gunshot injuries by 30

percent. In these calculations we assign a WTP of $0 to those respondents who answer no to

both the first and follow-up CV questions, under the assumption that each individual's WTP to

reduce gunshot injuries must be non-negative. While some people may object to the specific

mechanism used to reduce gun injuries, presumably few people would be willing to pay to see

more Americans shot, and in any case it is not clear that such preferences should be given

standing in benefit-cost analyses. In order to convert this estimate into WTP per gunshot injury

                                                -8-
avoided, we can divide total WTP by the estimated annual incidence of assault-related gunshot

woundings (106,000)8 multiplied by 30 percent. This suggests WTP per injury equal to

$667,000.

B. Parametric Estimates

       The non-parametric estimate understates societal WTP because it does not interpolate the

underlying distribution between the CV bid values or extrapolate beyond the highest value used

in the survey. The non-parametric approach is also limited in that it only uses a fraction of the

information available with the CV data. In this section we develop refined estimates that use

maximum-likelihood methods to estimate societal WTP under a number of different

assumptions.

       Our empirical strategy is based on the framework outlined by Cameron and James (1987)

and Cameron (1988). Let Y1 equal the (unobserved) WTP value that respondent (i) has in mind

when answering the first and second referendum questions in the NGPS. The respondent will

answer in the affirmative to the first referendum question (I=1) if the "price" of the program in

the form of higher taxes (t11) is not greater than the respondent's WTP (Yt11). Similarly, the

respondent will support the program in the follow-up CV question (121=1) if the new price t2, is

less than WTP (Y1t2), where t21 is equal to double t1 if 111=1 and half oft11 if I=0. We initially

assume that Y is log-normally distributed (equation 1), which constrains WTP to be positive.


        8 The estimate is obtained by adding the 14,037 fatal gunshot assaults in 1996 to the
estimated 73,096 non-fatal gun assaults that receive treatment in the ED (Cook et al., 1999). To
account for nonfatal gunshot injuries treated outside of the ED we estimate the ratio of nonfatal
doctor's office- to ED-treated gunshot injuries (0.19) from the 1995-1996 National Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey and the ratio of untreated to ED-treated gunshot injuries (0.07) from the
1987-1994 National Crime Victimization Survey.

(1)     logY1=13+u1.               u1N(O,2)

        From this setup we can estimate household WTP using the "interval-data" or "double-

bounded" model from Hanemann, Loomis and Kanninen (1991). The probabilities for the four

possible joint outcomes for the first (I) and second ('21) referendum questions are given in

equations (2) through (5). (Recall that t2, =2t11 if I=1, and t21=0.5t11 if 11=0).

        We obtain estimates for the parameters of this model by applying maximum-likelihood

estimation (MLE) to the log-likelihood function in equation (6).

                           (l-I1)(I2){F[(t11-13)/c]- F[(t21-13)/G]}
        The coefficient estimate for the variables t1 and t21 is an estimate for hG, which in turn

allows us to identify an estimate b for the parameter 13. Calculating the standard errors for mean

and median household WTP is complicated by the fact that our estimate for b is really the ratio of

two estimates — the estimated value for 13I divided by an estimate for l/. Our method for

calculating standard errors is provided in the technical appendix. If w represents the NGPS

sampling weight for household (i), which equals the number of households in the population that

each sampled household represents, then estimated societal WTP is given by equation (7). While

b provides an unbiased estimate for the expected value of log WTP, for a log-normal variable the

mean of WTP itself will be given by exp(b)xexp(0.5o) as in equation (7) (Manning, 1998).

(7)    Societal WTP = w xexp(b)xexp(0.5c2)

       In Figure 2, we compare the cumulative distribution function for WTP implied by the

parametric estimates presented in Table 3 with the non-parametric function from Figure 1. The

MLE estimates imply mean and median household WTP equal to $203 and aggregate WTP equal

to $20.2 billion, or $635,000 per injury (Table 4). The parametric estimate does not exceed the

non-parametric figure as might be expected because the former uses data from both the first and

second CV questions, while the latter is based largely on responses to the first CV question.

       We further refine our parametric estimates by calculating mean household WTP

conditional on a vector of household characteristics X1 that may affect the risk of gunshot injury,

attitudes towards risk, or ability to pay. In our empirical analysis the vector of household

variables includes income, household composition (the number of children under 6 or 6 to 17,

and the number of adults), household gun ownership, and race.9

       As seen in Table 3, the coefficient estimates for these covariates provides some evidence



         Since only 2.2 percent of all marriages were inter-racial in 1992, the last year for which
such data are available (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1999), we infer "household race" from the
respondent's race.
                                                —11—
on the credibility of our WTP responses. Income has a strong positive effect on support for the

violence program. We also find that households with guns have lower WTP than other

households to support gun-violence reduction, consistent with previous findings that gun owners

are less supportive of gun control than non-owners (Teret et al., 1998). Table 3 also provides

some support for the assumption that respondents are reporting on household (rather than

individual) WTP, since WTP has a strong correlation with the number of children in the home.

       Including the household covariates serves to increase our estimated mean WTP per

household from $203 to $239 (Table 4). Total WTP to reduce gun violence by 30 percent equals

$23.8 billion, or $748,000 per injury. We use household-level covariates because we interpret

the CV responses as reflections of household (rather than individual) WTP. If different

individuals within the home would report different WTP values, then our estimates should still

be unbiased (since adults are randomly selected from households) but may be inefficient,10

C. Sensitivity Analyses

       We find that our estimates are fairly robust to assumptions about the distribution of WTP.

Re-estimating equation (7) with covariates under the assumption that WTP has a log-logistic

(rather than log-normal) distribution produces an estimated mean WTP of $206. Using a normal

distribution, which allows WTP to be negative, produces an estimate of $213.

       One concern with these CV data is the possibility that responses to the follow-up CV



          To explore this possibility, we re-estimated our preferred MLE model after restricting
the sample to married respondents and including an indicator for the respondent's gender. While
the coefficient estimate for an indicator variable for husbands is negative and statistically
significant, inclusion of this variable serves to reduce estimated mean WTP by less than 7
percent.
                                               -12-
question are influenced by the initial question. As Cameron and Quiggin (1994) note,

respondents may become more certain about their response to the second rather than first

question because they have had more time to reflect on the public good in question.

Alternatively, respondents may believe that the first question provides information about the

actual average cost of the public good, and may then react negatively to the second question that

asks the respondent to pay "more than it costs." The descriptive statistics presented in Table 1

provides some evidence to support this second effect. For example, Table 1 shows that 69

percent of respondents who are asked about a $100 tax increase in the first question will pay this

much to support the program, though only 51 percent of those who are asked about a $50

increase in the first question will support a $100 tax increase (76 percent >< 67 percent).

       To address the possibility that the respondent is sensitized by the first CV question, and

thus that the first and second questions produce draws from slightly different WTP distributions,

we follow Cameron and Quiggin (1994) and re-estimate WTP using a bivariate probit model.

The bivariate probit model allows for different means for the first and second WTP values

         as well   as separate error processes that have different variances         and are   only

imperfectly correlated (Corr[u11,u21]=p<1). While the bivariate probit model affords greater

flexibility than the MLE model given by equation (6), this strategy comes at the cost of less

precise estimates (Alberini, 1995) and makes interpretation of the results somewhat complicated.

Our bivariate probit estimates suggest a mean WTP of $309 for the first referendum question and

$209 for the second. If responses to the first CV question are more accurate, then the estimates

presented in Table 4 may somewhat understate societal WTP.

        Another concern that commonly arises with CV studies is that of "protest zeroes," defined

                                                  -13-
as cases in which the respondent rejects the hypothetical market scenario even though her true

WTP exceeds the stated "price" of the referendum (Mitchell and Carson, 1989). The proper

definition of protest zeroes is complicated in our application. Fairly uncontroversial is the case

of tax protestors — those respondents who object to financing the program out of tax revenues,

but who would be willing to pay the stated amount to achieve a 30 percent reduction in gun

violence if the program were financed by some other means. One possibility is to identify as tax

protesters the 24 percent of respondents who "strongly agree" with the survey question that

"taxes are too high." When we re-estimate our model without these respondents in the sample —

which is the preferred method for dealing with protesters (Freeman, 1993) —
                                                                      our estimate is only

13 percent higher than the $239 figure reported in Table 4.

       More complicated are cases where the respondent objects to the mechanism for reducing

gun violence, rather than the mechanism for financing the program. The NGPS asks about

programs that target the illegal use or transmission of firearms, which in turn should reduce gun

violence holding the overall crime rate constant. Respondents who object to these interventions

should only be counted as protest zeroes if alternative interventions exist that could plausibly

reduce gun crime without reducing the overall crime rate, which is a debatable proposition. In

any case, we classify as intervention-protesters those who "strongly disagree" that "the

government should do everything it can to keep handguns out of the hands of criminals, even if it

means that it will be harder for law-abiding citizens to purchase handguns." Excluding these

respondents produces only a 7 percent increase in WTP compared with Table 4.

V. DISCUSSION

       This paper presents the first attempt to estimate the demand for reductions in crime using

                                                -14-
contingent-valuation (CV) methods. Our estimates suggest that a 30 percent reduction in gun

violence is worth $23.8 billion to the American public in 1998 dollars, around $750,000 per

injury. These findings are generally quite robust to our decisions about the estimation procedure

—
    even the descriptive statistics imply a societal WTP of $21.2 billion.

         The most fundamental issue is whether the NGPS survey responses reflect respondents'

preferences about a given quantity of violence reduction rather than social desirability bias,

moral satisfaction or some other motivation. CV responses that are motivated by something

other than the public's demand for a public good may be insensitive to the quantity of the public

good that is offered (the embedding effect), and thus not useful for benefit-cost analysis.

         Our crude test for an embedding effect with the NGPS data suggests that WTP is in fact

sensitive to the amount of risk reduction provided. Table 4 shows that WTP increases with the

number of children in the home, which in turn is related to the total amount of risk reduction that

the household gains from a violence-reduction program. Since these findings could be explained

by taste or other differences between households with and without children, we re-estimated our

models using only those households with children. We find that each additional child in the

home under the age of 6 increases the respondent's WTP by 50 percent, and each additional child

between 6 and 17 increases WTP by 25 percent. While these findings provide some evidence

against an embedding effect, for some reason additional adults within the home do not appear to

increase household WTP.

         Our estimates are based on CV questions that are limited in length and level of detail by

the constraints of telephone survey methods, and are thus necessarily imperfect. The CV

questions used in the gun survey described here can be criticized for excluding important

                                                  -15-
information about the hypothetical interventions that respondents are asked to support, a problem

that plagues all CV studies to some degree. The NGPS questions do not specify the change in

risk to the respondent, although there is substantial heterogeneity in the risk of gunshot injury

within the population and a 30 percent reduction in gun injuries will imply somewhat different

changes for respondents according to their community's baseline risks. A related concern is that

the questions do not specify where the interventions will be targeted, and thus who will benefit

from the program, For example, what society will pay to reduce gun injuries to downtown office

workers may be different from what society will pay to reduce the number of gang shootings.

       Despite the limitations of these CV survey data, our estimates for society's WTP to

reduce gun violence are remarkably consistent with previous estimates from wage-risk tradeoffs.

Deriving a value of statistical life from our CV results is complicated somewhat by the fact that

our question reflects WTP for both fatal and nonfatal gunshot injuries. If we start with the

extreme assumption that WTP is driven entirely by concern about fatal gunshot injuries, then

since we have shown that around 12 percent of assault-related gunshot injuries are fatal, our

preferred estimate of $750,000 per gunshot injury avoided implies a value per statistical life

equal to $6.25 million. But presumably part of WTP to reduce gun injuries is motivated by

concern about non-fatal gunshot injuries. If we assume that non-fatal gunshot injuries are twice

as undesirable as the average workplace injury, our estimates imply a value per statistical life of

$4.05 million." By way of comparison, studies of wage-risk tradeoffs produce estimates for the


          This comes from multiplying twice the highest estimate for workplace injuries reported
in Viscusi (1993), around $300,000 in 1998 dollars, by the number of nonfatal gun injuries for
every fatality (7.33), and subtracting this figure ($2.2 million) from the estimated value of 8.33
gun injuries ($6.25 million).
                                                -16-
value of life (also in 1998 dollars) between $3.7 and $8.6 million (Viscusi, 1993).

       We would expect societal WTP to be far smaller if citizens were concerned only about

reducing the risk of gun injury to themselves and members of their families. The reason is that

gunshot injuries in the U.S. are highly concentrated among a group of people who on average are

far less risk averse than are members of the general population. Two-thirds of all firearm

homicides in 1996 were to males between the ages of 15 and 39 (CDC, 1999), and three-quarters

of gun homicide victims under 21 in Boston in 1990-1994 had criminal records (Kennedy, Piehi

and Braga, 1996). Levitt and Venkatesh (1998) studied the records documenting the

opportunities and violence-victimization risks for members of a crack-dealing street gang:

Comparing the risk to the reward suggests that they placed a value on a statistical life ofjust

$55,000 on average. Our WTP estimates thus suggest that the benefits from reducing gun

violence in America are substantial, and accrue primarily to citizens at low personal risk of injury

through reductions in risk to others in the home, lower tax bills, or improvements to the overall

quality of community life.

NOTES: Figures are in 1998 dollars. a. Obtained by multiplying mean WTP per household by
number of households in U.S. in 1996, which is equal to 99.6 million (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1997). b. Covariates included in model are household income, household composition
(the number of children under 6 or 6 to 17, and the number of adults), household gun ownership
status, and race.

                   Calculating Standard Errors for Mean and Median WTP

       The usual standard error formula for a linear predictor evaluated at some value of the
regressors x0 is given by equation (Al).

(Al) SE(x0b) =          (xoVxo!)l2

        Estimation of the log likelihood given in equation (7) is simplified somewhat because b is
a scalar rather than a vector, so V is also a scalar equal to the variance of b, x0=l, and equation
(Al) simplifies to (A2).

(A2) SE(b) =            (V)112


       The complication in our case comes from the fact that b is actually the ratio of two
estimates b'/s', where b' is an estimate for (13/op) and s' is an estimate for (11cr). In this case the
variance for b=b'/s' can be approximated by the formula given in equation (A3) (Yates, 1981, p.
190).

(A3) V = Var(b) = Var(b'Is') (b'/s')2 [ (Var(b'))/(b')2 + (Var(s'))I(s')2 ]
        The final complication is that (A3) gives us the variance for the estimated mean of the
natural log of Y (WTP), while ultimately we are interested in the variance of predicted mean of
the untransformed WTP. With E[ln Y]=b and Var( E[ln Y])=V then the variance of E[Y1 is
given by equation (A4) (Maddala, 1977, p. 33).

(A4) Var( E[Y1 ) = exp(2b + V)*(e\' - 1)
