                                             ABSTRACT

This paper uses data from the Health and Retirement Study to explore the mechanism that underlies
the robust relation found in the literature between cognitive ability, and in particular numeracy, and
wealth, income constant. We have a number of findings. First, the more valuable the pension, the more
knowledgeable are covered workers about their pensions. We suggest that causality is more likely
to run from pension wealth to pension knowledge, rather than the other way around. Second, most
measures of cognitive ability, including numeracy, are not significant determinants of pension and
Social Security knowledge. Third, standardizing for incomes and other factors, a pension of higher
value does not substitute for other forms of wealth. Rather, counting pensions in total wealth, those
with more valuable pensions save more for retirement, other things the same. Fourth, there is no evidence
that wealth held outside of pensions is influenced by knowledge of pensions.

In sum, numeracy does not influence wealth in whole or in part by affecting financial knowledge of
one's pension plan, where financial knowledge of the pension then influences other decisions about
retirement saving.

These findings raise questions about the mechanism that underlies the relation between cognition,
especially numeracy, and wealth. From a policy perspective, they suggest that the numeracy-wealth
relation should not be taken as evidence that increasing financial literacy will increase the wealth of
households as they enter into retirement.

I. Introduction

             Pensions and Social Security together account for half the wealth of those approaching

retirement age. Thus one would expect knowledge of pensions and Social Security to play a central

role in shaping the financial decisions made by those in their early to mid-fifties. In addition, recent

studies confirm a link between numeracy and household wealth (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2006; Banks

and Oldfield, 2007). Indeed, measures of numeracy, based on simple questions testing the ability to

calculate fractions, percentages and compounding, seem to dominate more elaborate measures of

cognition in explaining the wealth of those approaching retirement age (McArdle, Smith and Willis,

2009)2. Thus one would suspect there is a link between numeracy and knowledge of pensions and

Social Security, so that, holding the influence of cognition on earnings constant, each plays a role in

shaping the accumulation of retirement wealth.

             To learn more about these potential relationships, we use the Health and Retirement Study

to create a number of measures of knowledge of pensions and Social Security. We then demonstrate

that knowledge of pensions is higher where the value of the pension is higher. Next we consider the

relation of cognition to pension knowledge, with special emphasis on the role played by numeracy.

Following that, we relate wealth held outside of pensions and Social Security to measures of

         2
           McArdle, Smith and Willis describe a set of measures of the various dimensions of cognitive ability being
developed as part of an ongoing survey that is complementary to the Health and Retirement Study. Their research
focuses on measures of cognition taken directly from the psychology literature, including measures of the stock of
accumulated knowledge (crystallized intelligence) and the dimensions of cognitive ability associated with processing
decisions (fluid intelligence).
          The measures of cognition from their new survey are not yet available in a sample that also includes detailed
measures of pension and Social Security wealth from respondents and employers, allowing development of an array of
measures of pension and Social Security knowledge. Both sets of measures will eventually be available for the HRS
once the 2010 wave is returned from the field and the respondent information from that wave is supplemented by
administrative data. The 2010 wave includes the new set of cognition questions, detailed questions about pensions and
Social Security, and eventually will have matched employer produced pension plan descriptions and Social Security
earnings histories. Right now, however, detailed measures of cognition are only available for a small share of the HRS
population in an experimental module.
          Therefore, we proceed by using the less elaborate measures of numeracy and other dimensions of cognition
that are currently available in the HRS. These same measures are used by McArdle, Smith and Willis (2009) in a
portion of their paper. (Also see Ofstedal, Fisher and Herzog, 2005). Supporting this decision, their work suggests that
in explaining wealth, the more elaborate measures of cognition are dominated by simple measures of numeracy, which
are available to us.

                                                                                                                           1
cognition, including numeracy, to measures of knowledge of pensions and Social Security, and to

wealth accumulated in the form of pensions. We consider the relationship to total wealth as well.

        In some respects, our analysis conforms to our expectations. In other respects, it generates

surprises, and more disturbing, inconsistencies that are difficult to square with simple stories of the

demand for and effects of knowledge on economic decision making. To be more specific:

        We are able to generate a number of measures of pension and Social Security knowledge

indicating knowledge of plan type, age of eligibility for retirement benefits and benefit amounts.

        Some of the measures of pension knowledge are directly related to pension wealth; the

more valuable the pension, the more knowledgeable the covered worker. Apparently, those whose

pensions are valuable enough to make it worthwhile to understand them are more likely to be

knowledgeable about their pensions. Moreover, most pension wealth held by those in their early and

mid-fifties is in defined benefit plans. Given the wage premium paid on these jobs and the history of

changes in these plans, causality is more likely to run from pension wealth to pension knowledge,

rather than the other way around. So far, so good.

        A first puzzle is that most measures of cognitive ability, including numeracy, are not

significant determinants of pension and Social Security knowledge.

        A second puzzle is related to findings by previous researchers and confirmed in our earlier

work with HRS data (Cagan, 1965; Katona, 1965; Gustman and Steinmeier, 1999). The amount of

wealth a household accumulates outside of pensions and Social Security does not decline as the

value of the household's pension wealth increases, income constant. That is, standardizing for

individual differences such as time preference, pensions do not seem to be a substitute for other

forms of wealth. As a result, counting pensions in total wealth, those with pensions save more for

retirement. The hypothesis set forth by earlier researchers is that pensions lead to greater

understanding of the mechanics of saving and a greater appreciation of the need for retirement


                                                                                                          2
saving. This suggests that wealth held outside of pensions should be related to knowledge of

pensions. But we can find no evidence in support of that relationship.

        A third and related puzzle is that knowledge of pensions has no effect on the relation of

cognition to wealth. We duplicate results from McArdle, Smith and Willis (2009) indicating that

there is a relation between cognition, and in particular numeracy, and wealth held outside of

pensions and Social Security. However, once we find that knowledge of pensions and Social

Security is not strongly related to the wealth accumulated by the retirement age population, and

knowledge of pensions and Social Security is not related to cognition, it follows, and we find, that

inclusion of pension knowledge in wealth equations does not affect the estimated relation between

numeracy and wealth. So we must conclude that numeracy does not influence wealth in whole or in

part by affecting financial knowledge of one's pension plan, where financial knowledge of the

pension then influences other decisions about retirement saving.

        These findings not only raise questions about the role of knowledge of pensions and Social

Security in shaping retirement saving, but they also raise questions about the linkage between

numeracy and wealth. Not whether there is one -- the evidence supports the existence of such a link.

The question is how it works. We had thought that one avenue through which numeracy influences

wealth is through an effect on understanding of financial instruments. But no financial instrument is

more crucial to retirement saving than pensions and Social Security. So we are left with the

question, what is the channel through which numeracy affects wealth accumulated by the age of

retirement?

        To set the stage for the empirical analysis, Section II provides further discussion of the role

that knowledge of pensions and Social Security may play in influencing the relation of cognition to

wealth. In Section III we discuss the construction of the measures of pension knowledge, cognition

and wealth used in the analysis. Section IV analyzes the relation of measures of knowledge of


                                                                                                       3
pensions and Social Security to measures of cognition. Section V analyzes first individually, and

then jointly, the relation of measures of knowledge of pensions and Social Security, and cognition,

to retirement wealth. Section VI concludes.

        II. An Intermediary Role for Knowledge of Pensions and Social Security?

        A. Cognition and Knowledge of Pensions and Social Security

        If higher cognitive ability leads to a greater appreciation of the need for retirement saving,

or to more effective saving for retirement, one might also expect higher cognitive ability to be

accompanied by greater knowledge of the instruments used in saving for retirement. Pensions and

Social Security account for half of the wealth of U.S. households nearing retirement age.

        One possibility is that those with higher cognitive ability have greater knowledge of

pensions and of Social Security, which may contribute to their accumulating greater wealth. Even if

there is no direct causality running from cognition through knowledge of pensions and Social

Security to wealth, one would expect at least an indirect association where, holding measures of

income constant, those with highest levels of cognition accumulate greater wealth because they

recognize the need for retirement saving, and at the same time accrue greater knowledge of

financial instruments.

        An indirect linkage might also arise if numeracy leads to increased planning activities,

which in turn affect wealth (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007). Once again, through this route one might

also expect to find numeracy linked to knowledge of the two most important sources of financial

wealth at retirement age, pensions and Social Security.

        B. Knowledge of Pensions and the Level of Non-Pension, Non-Social Security Wealth.

        In Gustman and Steinmeier (1999) we found support for earlier findings by Cagan (1965)

and Katona (1965) regarding the relation of pensions to saving. Contrary to the view that pensions

are a simple, tax favored substitute for other forms of saving, data from the 1992 HRS suggested


                                                                                                         4
that pension coverage and pension values bear very little relation to saving outside of pensions. That

is, those with pensions save roughly the same amount outside of their plans as do those without

pensions who have comparable lifetime incomes. Where there is some substitution between

pensions and other forms of wealth, it is only for those with higher levels of income and education.

For the rest, there is little apparent substitution of pensions for other wealth, even holding constant a

number of factors that might reflect differences in taste for saving. Partly, this is because an

important fraction of the population does not save for retirement outside of pensions and Social

Security. But of greater interest, even for those who do save in other forms, in many cases there is

little substitution. So those with pensions typically have higher total wealth than those without

pensions, income and other factors the same.

        It is important to standardize for incomes when investigating the pension-wealth relation.

Jobs offering a pension also offer higher wages (Gustman and Steinmeier, 1993.) But even when we

did standardize for lifetime incomes, the positive link between pensions and wealth continued.

        Another possible reason for a pension-wealth relation has been suggested by Cagan (1965)

and Katona (1965). Their idea is that those with pensions may have been made more aware of the

need for retirement saving, and so saved more. It certainly is in the interest of employers to insure

that covered workers appreciate the contributions they are making to the workers' pensions. But if

the linkage between pensions and other wealth stemmed from the greater understanding of the need

for retirement saving by those with pensions, one would also expect to find a relationship between

knowledge of pension plans and saving in other forms. This will lead to one of the major

hypotheses we will be testing. If Cagan and Katona were right, we should find that greater

knowledge of pensions is associated with higher wealth accumulated outside of the pension, income

constant.




                                                                                                        5
        Still another possibility is that those with higher values of time preference may find

pensions an imperfect substitute for wealth in hand. But in our earlier work, we could find no

evidence that time preference was driving the relation between pensions and other forms of wealth.

        C. Pension Knowledge and Total Wealth

        What might account for the lack of a relationship between knowledge of pensions and

Social Security on the one hand, and retirement wealth on the other? There is evidence that many of

those with pensions are disengaged from the management of their plans. Most pensions held by

those in their fifties are defined benefit plans. Even among those with substantial balances in

defined contribution plans, many never rebalance their portfolios. Others rebalance infrequently,

even during the course of a recession. Many are not aware of the details of their plans. Many do not

focus until they are very near their retirement ages. Thus the lack of a relation between pension

knowledge and total wealth, earnings constant, may simply reflect the disengagement of those with

pensions from the management of their plans. But why then would they be so aware of the need to

accumulate wealth held in other forms than pensions and Social Security? People handle other

forms of wealth more frequently. Thus cognition, and in particular numeracy, may affect the value

of other forms of wealth as long as people are paying more attention to, and are engaged in

transactions involving these other forms of wealth. But would this attention to other wealth be the

same for those with and without pensions?

        In trying to understand the relationship between pension knowledge and total wealth, there

is another puzzle. In exploring measures of pension knowledge similar to those reported here,

Gustman and Steinmeier (2001) found that respondents to the Health and Retirement Study who

overestimated the values of their pensions and Social Security in a base year, 1992, did not

eventually change their saving or retirement behavior in future years, by saving more or delaying

their retirement relative to their initial plans. Nor did those who had understated their plan values


                                                                                                        6
change their behavior, taking advantage of the unexpected excess in assets to save less in

subsequent years, or to retire earlier than previously planned.

        D. The Relation of Cognition to Wealth

        In attempting to understand the relation of cognitive ability to wealth, it is important to

realize that there need not be a statistical relationship. Additional cognitive ability might raise

earnings, but holding earnings constant, greater cognitive ability may or may not be associated with

the accumulation of additional wealth. Higher cognitive ability may reduce mistakes people make in

choosing how much to save for retirement, but those mistakes might have resulted in either over

saving or under saving. Moreover, higher cognitive ability might reduce uncertainty, but greater

uncertainty about needs in retirement might increase precautionary saving, or it may lead to a lower

valuation of the effect of current saving on utility gained by additional consumption in retirement

and thereby reduce saving.

        Or basic numeracy might lead directly to the accumulation of additional wealth for

retirement. Most obviously, more able individuals may gain higher returns on their retirement

assets, allocating their assets to tax favored instruments, to investments with a higher payoff and

lower fees, or they may make fewer mistakes adjusting their portfolios over time. More able

individuals may also realize the need to save for retirement, while the issue may either escape the

attention of those who have difficulties making financial calculations, or who may simply be

overwhelmed by the task. Some with lower cognitive ability may be unable to understand the need

for substantial retirement saving so they eventually will be able to support their current

consumption in retirement, let alone to determine the amount of wealth required to meet their

consumption needs in retirement.

        If numeracy reduces financial errors, this would create a direct link between numeracy and

wealth that would not necessarily involve greater specific knowledge of pensions and Social


                                                                                                      7
Security. One such linkage has been investigated by Zinman and Stango (2009). They find evidence

relating misunderstanding of how compound interest works to financial wealth. Their argument is

that the tendency to linearize the exponential growth of interest leads to greater borrowing and

lower levels of wealth. In a similar vein, Gerardi, Goette and Meier (2010) find that lower numeracy

is associated with greater chance of delinquency and default in the subprime housing market.



            III. Sample and Construction of Variables

            The sample used in our analysis is based on respondents to the Health and Retirement

Study from couple households. The sample is restricted to the early boomer cohort, those from

households with at least one member age 51 to 56 in 2004. We restrict the sample to the early

boomer cohort because it is the first HRS cohort for which we have measures of numeracy at the

time they entered the survey. We focus on those 51 to 56 because most measures of pension

knowledge in the HRS are derived from questions asking about pensions on the respondent’s

current job.3 Typically, those jobs offering pensions to respondents over the age of fifty are the

same jobs they held at prime working age. Thus we do not want to select an older population where

those remaining on their long term job are not representative of workers who were ever covered by

a pension.

            A. Measures of Pension Variables

            Using HRS data, it is possible to construct a number of measures of pension and Social

Security knowledge. A basic measure distinguishes between respondents who answer “don’t know”

(dk) to questions about pension and Social Security characteristics or values and those who do

answer the relevant questions. Another measure compares respondent answers with values

        3
           In the HRS, those who have already retired are not asked about their expected benefits. Those who are older
than the early retirement age are not asked about their early retirement benefits. Those who are older than the normal
retirement age are not asked about their normal retirement benefits.


                                                                                                                         8
calculated by evaluating employer plan descriptions using the relevant respondent's work histories.

Questions about pensions include plan type, age of eligibility for early and normal retirement

benefits, benefit amounts to be paid to holders of defined benefit plans at early or normal retirement

ages, account balances in defined contribution plans, and related questions. Knowledge of Social

Security benefits is measured by the frequency of don’t know responses to questions about benefits

at early and normal retirement ages. When analyzing the frequency of don’t know responses, we use

two different measures. One measure is a simple don’t know response to the question. The second

indicator classifies the respondent as not knowing the answer only if the respondent responds “don’t

know” to the initial question, and when presented with a series of bracketed values for the variable

in question continues to respond “don’t know”.

        The subsamples of the early boomer population used for analysis varies with the measure of

pension or Social Security knowledge being analyzed. For example, if we are investigating

knowledge of the account balance in a defined contribution plan, the sample is limited to the subset

of the population with a defined contribution pension. Similarly, if we are investigating knowledge

of annual benefits to be paid at expected retirement age for those with a defined benefit plan, the

sample is limited to those with a defined benefit plan. Empirical work reported in the appendices

demonstrates that the main findings are not affected by the differences in population base created by

the use of different measures of pension and Social Security knowledge.

        Descriptive data for some of the measures of knowledge of pensions and Social Security

used in our analysis are reported in Appendix Table 2, Part B. Some measures will be more useful

than others. For example, only 3 percent of those with a pension indicate they do not know their

plan type. This will limit the usefulness of the dk plan type measure in our later analysis. On the

other hand, when we use indicators of whether the respondent and firm agree, there is much more

variation in the knowledge measures. For example, the measure of agreement as to plan type is


                                                                                                       9
based on a broad measure of agreement. There we say the respondent and firm reported the same

plan type either when there is exact agreement, or when one reported one plan type, say DB, while

the other reported coverage by both plan types. When the broad measure of agreement is used, the

level of agreement is very high, at 88 percent. The frequency of agreement is much lower when we

use a narrower definition of plan type. For example, to say the respondent and firm both agree the

plan type is DB only, as in row 6 of Appendix Table 2, Part B, or DC only, as in row 7, they both

must respond the plan type is DB only or DC only. If either responds both, there is no match. The

frequency of agreement is much lower when narrow agreement is required, with 10 percent of

respondents agreeing the plan is DB only, and 16 percent agreeing the plan is DC only.

            The measure of whether respondents know the value of their Social Security benefits, either

at the early or normal age of eligibility, exhibits considerable variability. In Part C of Appendix

Table 2, 37 percent of respondents say they do not know what their Social Security benefits would

be at the Social Security early age of benefit eligibility, and 32 percent say they don't know their

benefits at the normal Social Security entitlement age.

B. Measures of Cognition

        Our analysis uses three indicators of cognition from the Health and Retirement Study

(HRS), TICS questions, word recall and numeracy. These are available in the core of the HRS for

the early boomer cohort, and as noted in the previous section have been shown in earlier studies to

be significantly correlated with wealth.

        Two “TICS” (Telephone Interview of Intact Cognitive Status) questions are used here. They

rate a person’s ability to serially subtract 7 from 100, and to count backward (from 20 to 1)4.

        4
           McArdle, Smith and Willis (2009) investigate the relation of cognition to wealth for all HRS respondents
over the age of fifty. They include additional TICS measures beside the two included in our analysis. The additional
measures help to discriminate levels of cognition among those over 65. One such measure evaluates a second try at
backward counting for those who failed the first try. Others of the additional TICS questions ask about knowledge of
the date of the interview, names of the President and Vice President, the name of the device for cutting paper, and the
name for a prickly plant that grows in the desert. We do not include these additional measures in this paper because we

                                                                                                                     10
Backward counting equals 2 if the respondent could correctly count at the first try. Otherwise it

equals zero. The Series 7 value is the sum of correct answers to any of the questions in the series.

The range for TICS is from 0 to 7.

        Word recall refers to an individual’s recall of a list of words, using the average of the sum of

correct answers to the immediate and delayed word recalls. It ranges between 0 and 10.

        The measure of numeracy is the sum of the number of correct answers to three questions,

asking for calculations involving compound interest, fractions and probability. One question asks

for the calculation of how many people out of 1000 would be sick if there were a ten percent chance

of contracting a disease. Second, if there were five winners of a lottery offering a $2 million prize,

what will each receive? Third, with $200 in a saving account earning 10 percent interest per year,

what will be in the account at the end of two years? Numeracy ranges from 0 to 3.

        Descriptive statistics for the cognition variables for various subsamples of the Early Boomer

cohort used in our analysis are reported in Appendix Table 1.

C. Measures of Wealth

        When relating knowledge to wealth, two measures of wealth are used alternatively as

dependent variables. The first is total wealth excluding pensions and Social Security wealth. This

measure includes stocks and other financial instruments, the value of the home, real estate, business

wealth, ownership of autos, and other sources of wealth. The second measure is total wealth

including the wealth equivalent of pensions and Social Security. Given the findings that we

discussed from earlier studies, where pensions seemed to increase saving in other forms, when

analyzing the relation between wealth and financial knowledge we include pension wealth on the

right hand side of the relevant regressions. Our findings regarding the relation of cognition and/or



focus on the population ages 51 to 56, where these measures are not very helpful in determining differences in
cognition.

                                                                                                                 11
pension knowledge to wealth are not, however, sensitive to whether pension wealth is included as a

covariate.



IV. Relation of Knowledge of Pensions and Social Security to Numeracy

        Table 1 reports the results of a series of probit equations relating various measures of

respondent knowledge of their pensions and Social Security to the level of current pension wealth

(or DB or DC wealth where appropriate), and to measures of cognition, including the score from

two elements of the TICS variables (backward counting and serial sevens), word recall and

numeracy.5 A number of covariates listed below the table are also included. The cells in the table

are dprobits, reporting the effect of a one unit change in the independent variable on the probability

of observing the knowledge measure.

        The table is divided into three sections according to whether the dependent variable pertains

to plan type, retirement age, or to the value of the pension.

        We first consider evidence supporting a partial, but important, underlying economic

explanation for knowledge of pensions. Knowledge of pensions is greater if the plan is more

valuable. Pension wealth measures are significant at conventional levels in explaining the following

measures of pension knowledge. Those with higher pension wealth are more likely to agree with

their employer as to plan type, are less likely to say they do not know the early retirement age for

their defined contribution plan, are more likely to agree with their firm about the age they will be

eligible for early retirement benefits, are less likely to say they do not know the value of their



        5
           Gustman and Steinmeier (2005a) related these knowledge measures to the HRS indicator of word recall, but
found no significant results. Other studies that include measures of cognitive ability, using very simple measures of
knowledge of pensions, find that numeracy is related to pension knowledge (e.g., see Banks and Oldfield, 2007). Their
measure of pension knowledge is an indicator of whether or not the respondent says they know the benefit accrual rate,
or the level of pension benefits. That is, they focus on dk responses. The relation of numeracy to these outcomes
remains significant even when there are controls for other dimensions of cognitive ability and education.


                                                                                                                    12
defined benefit pensions at normal retirement age, and are more likely to agree with their firm on

the amount of benefits their DB plan is expected to pay.

         We do not believe there is strong reverse causality, with greater knowledge of pensions

leading to higher pension wealth. To be sure, greater knowledge may lead to higher contribution

rates to DC plans, and more effective investment strategies. But it is harder to make the case that a

relationship between knowledge of defined benefit plans and pension wealth is due to reverse

causality. Yet for the population approaching retirement age examined in this paper, DB plans

represent two thirds of pension wealth. The value of a defined benefit plan depends only on the

earnings and experience of the covered worker, not on any additional activity that may be

disproportionately undertaken by better informed individuals. Nor do we believe that selection into

pension jobs is an important issue. Jobs with pensions carry much higher wages, which are likely to

have driven the choice of employment when the worker was younger.6

         The results describing how respondents' knowledge of their pensions or Social Security

varies with the respondent's level of cognition are not nearly so straight forward to understand.

Indeed, taken together, these findings contribute to a major puzzle.

         Consider the coefficient on numeracy in row 1, column 4 of Table 1. A one unit increase in

numeracy, which means the individual answered an additional one of the three numeracy questions,

increases the probability of a respondent reporting he or she does not know the plan type by 2.6

percent. Of course, here the sign is in the "wrong" direction.

         To be sure, taken by itself this result is not so surprising. Ninety seven percent of

respondents claim they know their plan type. So there is little variation in the dependent variable to



6
  At the time they joined their firms, those approaching retirement age in 2004 faced plan provisions that were quite
different from those found in later years. Moreover, pension jobs, especially those offering defined benefit plans, were
typically in unionized firms and large firms that paid premium wages, making the jobs attractive irrespective of the
pension offer. For further discussion, see Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai (2010), chapter 2.

                                                                                                                       13
be explained, and the perverse sign can be treated as an anomaly. It makes no sense that increased

numeracy would increase the number saying they don’t know their plan type.

        Yet a similar relation is found between numeracy and other measures of knowledge of plan

type. For example, as seen in row 2, column 4, the probability that the respondent and firm agree on

the type of pension plan is lower by 3.9 percent for those who have greater numeracy. That is,

greater numeracy leads to a reduction in agreement between respondent and firm reports of plan

type.

        Nor do the measures of cognition help in explaining other measures of plan type, whether

don’t know responses, or indicators that the respondent’s answer is the same as that from the

matched employer plan description. Although some coefficients are significant, there are no

systematic relations between measures of cognition and plan type that are consistent and plausible.

Nor do the coefficients change when pension wealth is no longer included as a covariate. Thus it is

not that one set of results or another is ignoring some indirect path from cognition to knowledge of

plan type.

        One might argue that knowledge of plan type is not an appropriate indicator of knowledge of

one’s pension. That is why we have tried such a wide range of other indicators of pension

knowledge. Yet we find no plausibly consistent effect of any of the indicators of cognition on

knowledge of pensions and Social Security.

        Thus Section B of Table 1 presents analogous results on the relation of cognition to

knowledge of retirement age. Once again, there are no consistent and plausible relations between

measures of cognition and an indicator of knowledge of a respondent’s pension.

        Section C of Table 1 takes us to indicators of the relation of numeracy to knowledge of

benefit values. When covariates are included, there is no effect of numeracy on knowledge of plan

values. Especially telling here, numeracy is not related to knowledge of DC plan values.


                                                                                                     14
       We also include in the last two rows of the table indicators of the respondents' knowledge of

their Social Security benefits. Counter intuitively, the result in the last row of column 4, which

approaches significance, suggests that greater numeracy increases the likelihood of saying one

doesn't know Social Security benefits at normal retirement age.

       So to this point, it would appear that, although earlier studies have shown that cognition, and

numeracy in particular, significantly affect wealth held outside of defined benefit pensions and

Social Security, they have no effect on knowledge of pensions. This result may create some doubt

about the efficacy of the many cognition variables we have examined. Given an expectation that

these measures of cognition improve wealth by increasing basic knowledge of financial instruments,

one would expect each of these measures, TICS (serial 7 and backward counting), word recall and

numeracy, to bear a systematic and consistent relation to measures of knowledge of pensions and

Social Security. But they do not.

       So we are left wondering why the measures of knowledge of pensions are influenced so

strongly by pension values, but are virtually unaffected by measures of cognition. This mystery will

deepen as we examine the joint relation between knowledge of pensions and Social Security,

cognition, and the value of wealth.

V. Relation of Household Wealth to Each Spouse’s Knowledge of Their Pension and Social

Security, to Cognitive Ability, and to Other Key Covariates.

       So far we have not been able to find a relation of cognition to knowledge of pensions and

Social Security. We have, however, found a relation between knowledge of pensions and Social

Security and the level of pension wealth. There also are the findings of a strong relationship

between cognition and wealth from McArdle, Smith and Willis (2009). We put these findings

together by estimating the relation of total wealth to pension and Social Security knowledge,

including pension wealth as a covariate. Next, using a sample comparable to the one we use to

analyze pension knowledge, we reestimate the results from McArdle, Smith and Willis (2009),

linking wealth to cognition. Third, we include all three elements in the same regression. This will

allow us to answer three questions: Does knowledge of pensions and Social Security bear any

systematic relation to non-pension, non-Social Security wealth? What is the role of pension wealth

in influencing the relation of pension knowledge to other forms of wealth? Does knowledge of

pensions and Social Security affect the measured relation between cognition and wealth?

       To begin, estimates in Table 2 relate the wealth of a respondent's household to that person's

knowledge of their pensions and Social Security. Observations are respondent based, with one

observation for each individual member of couple households with at least one of them aged 51 to

56 in 2004 and having a pension. Three different measures of wealth alternate as dependent

variables. Results for total household wealth (in thousands of dollars) are reported in columns 1 and

2. Findings for the ratio of household wealth to household income are reported in columns 3 and 4.

Regressions with total household wealth excluding pensions and Social Security as the dependent

variable are reported in columns 5 and 6. Measures of knowledge of the respondent's pension and

Social Security are the same as those discussed earlier.




                                                                                                      18
          The results in Table 2 provide little support for a view that greater knowledge of pensions is

a sign of the kind of greater financial sophistication that would increase retirement wealth. Columns

1, 3 and 5 of the table report the coefficients of the measure of pension or Social Security

knowledge in the regressions for wealth. Only four out of thirty of these measures of knowledge

exhibit coefficients that are significant at or near conventional levels. The coefficient in row 1,

column 1, suggests that if a person reports not knowing what type of plan their pension is, that

person will have $127,300 less wealth than persons who say they know their plan type. In row 3,

column 1, when a respondent and firm agree the plan is defined benefit, the total wealth is $93,510

higher.

          However, among the four statistically significant results, there are also two counter intuitive

findings. Specifically, in column 5, rows 4 and 5, if a person indicates not knowing the early or

normal retirement ages for a DB plan, household wealth outside of the pension is higher by $67,620

and $48,570 respectively.

          Columns 2, 4 and 6 report the coefficients estimated for the measures of pension wealth,

where this variable is entered into the right hand side of the alternative wealth regressions. Looking

down columns 2 and 4, allowing for considerable variation in the coefficient estimates, and the fact

that some coefficients differ significantly from 1.0, each dollar of pension wealth is associated with

roughly another dollar in total wealth. This suggests little substitution of pension wealth for other

forms of wealth. Respondents do not save less outside of their pension because they have access to

more pension wealth. The last column relates total wealth excluding pensions and Social Security to

pension wealth. Here the coefficients are significantly greater than zero, and suggest that those with

pensions save slightly more in other forms for each dollar of additional pension wealth. Again, there

is no suggestion of substantial substitution between pensions and other forms of wealth.




                                                                                                        19
       To reconcile the coefficients in columns 2 and 6, note that column 6 tells us how a $1

increase in pension wealth is related to wealth outside of both the pension and Social Security.

Column 2 indicates how a $1 increase in pension wealth is related to the sum of pension wealth,

Social Security wealth, and wealth held outside of pensions and Social Security. Thus taking the

result in row 4, it is perfectly consistent to find on the one hand that an additional dollar of pension

wealth raises wealth outside of pensions and Social Security by 11.6 cents, while increasing total

wealth by 83.9 cents. The difference reflects the correlation between pensions and Social Security.

One final note. Although it might seem that a very limited effect of pension knowledge on total

wealth is the result of holding pension wealth constant, the findings are similar when pension

wealth is not included in the equations reported in Table 2.

       Before presenting wealth equations that include measures of pension knowledge together

with measures of cognition, Table 3 provides a second baseline for the wealth regressions by

including only cognition measures and other covariates, but not measures of pension knowledge as

explanatory variables. The table presents estimates of marginal effects of the three key measures of

cognition on wealth, TICS, word recall and numeracy. In alternative specifications, wealth is

measured by non-pension, non-Social Security wealth and total wealth. The format of the equations

is the same as in McArdle, Smith and Willis (2009), except that pension wealth is also included as a

covariate. The population underlying the regressions in Table 3 is different from the one used in

their analysis, which includes the entire HRS population for 2006. As noted previously, to enable us

eventually to include measures of knowledge of pensions and Social Security, which are available

for 2004, our sample for all tables is confined to couple households with at least one member 51 to

56 in 2004. In addition, so the estimates of the equations used to analyze the relation of cognition to

wealth will be comparable to the samples used to analyze the effects of knowledge of pension plan

type, retirement age and plan values, the results in Table 3 are confined in one set of regressions to

those who report they are covered by a pension, and in another to those HRS respondents for whom

there is a matched employer provided pension plan description.

       Otherwise, these wealth equations are specified as in McArdle, Smith and Willis (2009).

Specifically, cognition measures are reported separately for the financially knowledgeable

respondent and the spouse. Note, however, that the financially knowledgeable respondent may not

be the member of the household who has a pension. What the wealth regressions show is how the

cognition of each spouse is related to the household’s wealth, not how the cognition of the spouse

with a pension is related to household wealth.




                                                                                                     22
        None of our major findings are affected by differences between the populations used in the

two studies. As in McArdle, Smith and Willis (2009), numeracy of the financially knowledgeable

respondent is the dominant determinant of wealth among the six cognition measures shown.7

        From row 3, columns 1 and 2 of Table 3, a one unit increase in the numeracy score for a

financially knowledgeable respondent is associated with an additional $26,000 in wealth

accumulated outside of the pension and Social Security. From columns 3 and 4, among the

population with a pension, higher numeracy for the financial R also increases the total wealth of the

household. But it does not have a significant effect on total wealth within the population of those

who have a matched employer pension.

  Although not reported here, we built a bridge between the wealth equations in McArdle Smith and Willis (2009) and
those in this paper. Given the number of differences in the underlying samples, this bridge involves changing the
specification of the wealth equation one difference at a time. We are grateful to Jim Smith, who provided the
information required to duplicate the initial results from McArdle, Smith and Willis (2009).

       The next step is to enter measures of cognition and pension and Social Security knowledge

in the same regressions for wealth. Table 4 relates wealth excluding pensions and Social Security to

these measures. Table 5 relates total wealth, including pensions and Social Security, to cognition

and measures of pension knowledge. Given the effect of pension value on pension knowledge, and

the relation of pension value to nonpension, non-Social Security wealth, the level of pension wealth

is included as a covariate in each equation. Other covariates are listed below the table.

       The results are divided into three sections: coefficients for the cognition measures for the

financially knowledgeable respondent; coefficients for the cognition measures for the spouse who is

not the financially knowledgeable respondent; and under the title "Covered Worker", measures of

pension knowledge exhibited by the worker who is covered by a pension. Once again, there are

three different sets of measures of pension knowledge – those pertaining to plan type, those

pertaining to retirement age, and those pertaining to plan value.

       There are three clear conclusions from the results in both tables. First, as seen in rows 3 and

6 of each table, numeracy of the financially knowledgeable respondent, followed by numeracy of

the nonfinancial respondent, are the major cognitive determinants of wealth. Second, from Table 4,

row 7, pension wealth is associated with a higher level of non-pension, non-Social Security wealth.

Third, in a few cases, greater pension knowledge is associated with higher wealth, with some

variables bordering on significance. But for the most part, pension knowledge is not a major

determinant of either wealth held outside of the pension plan, or of total wealth.

       Given the weak relation between measures of knowledge of pensions to measures of

cognition, it is not surprising that the coefficients on knowledge variables are not affected when

measures of cognition are added to wealth regressions, and coefficients on measures of cognition

are not affected when measures of pension and Social Security knowledge are added to wealth

regressions. It is not just that the insignificant variables measuring the effects of pension knowledge


                                                                                                      25
on wealth, in say, Table 2, column 5, remain insignificant when measures of cognition are added to

the regression. It is that the coefficients on the cognition variables remain unchanged when

measures of pension knowledge are added to the regression. This can be seen by comparing Table

3, column 2 with Table 4, column 1.

       Notice that within Tables 4 and 5, the coefficients on numeracy and on pension wealth

bounce around among regressions. Further examination suggests it is not the differences in

covariates among regressions that is responsible. Rather, it is differences in samples that are

responsible. The samples are restricted by the definition of the pension knowledge variable. Column

1 includes those with a pension and matched employer pension plan description. The sample in

columns 2 and 3 include those with a pension who report having a defined benefit plan. In column

4, respondents have a matched employer plan description and a defined benefit plan. Column 5

includes those with a defined contribution plan. The sample for column 6 requires that the

respondent report expecting Social Security benefits.

       To summarize, although the specifications relating pension knowledge to wealth outside of

pensions and Social Security do not suggest a relation between measures of pension knowledge and

other forms of wealth, they all suggest that numeracy bears a significant relation to wealth outside

of pensions and Social Security. As a consequence, including measures of pension knowledge has

little or no effect on the estimated relation between measures of numeracy and wealth.

VI. Conclusions and Policy Implications

       Our initial hope in undertaking this paper was to shed further light on the role of

cognition, and in particular of numeracy, in shaping wealth accumulated for retirement.

We thought that a part of the link between cognition and wealth reflected the fact that

higher cognition leads to increased knowledge of retirement finances, which in turn leads

to higher wealth. This idea was strengthened not only by findings in the literature on the

relation of cognition, and especially numeracy to wealth, but also by earlier findings

linking pension knowledge to pension wealth, and a failure to find a reduction in non-

pension saving to correspond with higher pension wealth.

       We have not succeeded in establishing these linkages. Although we confirm the

finding in the literature that higher cognition, and in particular greater numeracy, is

associated with the accumulation of additional retirement wealth, we also find the initial

evidence that more numerate individuals better understand their pensions or Social

Security to be very fragile. Nor do we find evidence linking cognition or numeracy to

wealth accumulation in association with increased knowledge of pensions and Social

Security. Moreover, we do not find that the substitution of pensions for other forms of

wealth varies with knowledge of pensions.

       Instead we find that many of the questions as to the avenues through which

cognition and numeracy increase retirement wealth remain unanswered. As a result, we

remain unsure of how best to use the apparently robust numeracy-wealth relation in

designing policies that are aimed at increasing retirement saving.

       To be sure, many people do not have an incentive to understand their pensions

and Social Security, even when reaching their early or mid-fifties. For some their plans




                                                                                           29
are not sufficiently valuable to pay much attention. For others, their retirement is assured

due to a generous pension that does not require monitoring. Perhaps most importantly, for

those currently approaching retirement age, the largest share of their pension wealth

remains in defined benefit plans where typically there is little for an individual to do in

order to increase retirement benefits.

       But shouldn’t greater numeracy that leads to greater wealth accumulation also

have created greater financial acumen, which is then reflected indirectly as increased

knowledge of pensions? When the finding that those with pensions are motivated to

accumulate higher balances outside of their pensions and Social Security was uncovered

in the literature, it was argued that those with pensions learn from their providers about

the need for retirement saving and perhaps increased their understanding of how wealth

accumulation works. Yet knowledge of pensions and Social Security does not affect

saving behavior.

       Why does numeracy play an important role in influencing saving, even holding

income constant, while knowledge of pensions plays none?

       When combined with findings from our earlier studies, many puzzles remain. In

previous work (Gustman and Steinmeier, 2001) we found that those who overestimate the

values of their pensions and Social Security in the years before retirement nevertheless do

not eventually change their saving or retirement behavior by saving more over the next

eight years, or retiring later. Nor do those who understate their plan values change their

behavior. Accordingly, they must eventually adjust their consumption.

       It is not that people are totally clueless about the incentives created by their

retirement plans. An extensive retirement literature is characterized by a strong response




                                                                                              30
of retirement to incentives from pensions and Social Security (e.g., Gustman and

Steinmeier, 2005b). Moreover, changes in Social Security rules designed to encourage

delayed retirement have clearly had predicted effects on retirement (Gustman and

Steinmeier, 2009). One would certainly expect that it is easier for those with higher

cognition to understand these complex rules. But we have been unable to find a direct

link empirically from cognition through measures of knowledge of pensions and Social

Security to accumulated wealth.

        We have tried a variety of specifications to ensure that the absence of a link

between knowledge of pensions and Social Security and numeracy, and the knowledge

variables and wealth, is not due to a particular specification we have adopted. We have

tried specifications with and without pension wealth included as a covariate. If there is no

link, we are left with a list of questions. Accepting the relation between numeracy and

wealth, what exactly is the mechanism by which numeracy affects wealth? What

calculations or behavior does numeracy affect that are not ultimately reflected in pension

or Social Security knowledge?

        Policy Implications:

        Our findings raise questions about the avenues through which cognition and

numeracy increase retirement wealth. Accordingly, our analysis raises questions about

whether the apparently robust numeracy-wealth relation provides a basis for designing

policies that are aimed at increasing retirement saving by increasing numeracy or

financial literacy.

        Financial education would seem to be a basic policy that would allow those with

lower levels of numeracy to nevertheless save adequately for their retirement. The




                                                                                          31
numeracy-wealth relation, which remains even after standardizing for the differences in

earnings that result from higher numeracy, seems to suggest that those with higher

numeracy have an easier time accumulating knowledge of financial instruments,

understanding risk, and appreciating the need for, and the best ways to accumulate,

retirement saving. But our findings suggest the numeracy-wealth relation may reflect

something else. Perhaps numeracy reflects an unmeasured characteristic of the individual

that cannot be learned but does generate higher wealth. If nothing else, these findings

suggest a good deal of caution is warranted before assuming that classes in financial

basics, tutorials or other efforts to convey financial knowledge will induce appropriate

saving habits, choices in the face of risk, or a proper approach to spending down assets

after retiring. Although these policy initiatives may well ultimately encourage additional

saving, they should be carefully and rigorously evaluated on an individual basis before

financial education and training programs are adopted on a significant scale.

Appendix 1. Measures of Cognition, Demographic Characteristics, Income and Wealth

in Different HRS Subsamples

       Appendix Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for indicators of cognition,

demographic characteristics, income, wealth and other variables used in our analyses.

Column 1 shows the means and standard deviations for the full sample of couple

households with at least one member aged 51 to 56 in 2004. The columns that follow

restrict the sample to those with a pension, those with a matched employer pension plan

description, those with a defined benefit plan, those with a defined contribution plan, and

those expecting Social Security benefits at the early or normal retirement age.

       As can be seen by selecting a row and comparing means across the columns of

Appendix Table 1, there is not much variation in the independent variables as the sample

is restricted to those with a pension, those with a pension who also have a matched

employer plan, those with a DB plan, and those with a DC plan. To be sure, as seen in the

first six rows of the table, cognition measures are slightly higher for those with pensions

than for the general population of couple households. However, restricting the

populations to those with a matched employer plan, those claiming a DB pension, or

those with a DC pension, does not have a systematic effect on the cognition variables.

       The means of some demographic measures do differ across populations. For

example, because Hispanics have lower pension coverage than whites or blacks, they are

a smaller share of the pension covered population than of the overall population. Income

also varies with sample composition. Those with a pension have higher incomes than

those without a pension, and those with a defined benefit (DB) pension have higher

incomes than those whose pension is not DB. Also importantly, total wealth is higher




                                                                                          34
among households with a pension, and total wealth is lower among those households with

a DB pension. On the whole, the various sample restrictions have relatively modest

effects on the means of listed variables.

       Appendix Table 2 has three sections. Part A describes the underlying populations

according to employment, pension and Social Security coverage, availability of matched

pension plan descriptions from employers or Social Security records, and reported

outcomes. Part B reports means of measures of knowledge of pensions. Part C does the

same for measures of knowledge of Social Security. Given interest in the roles played in

households by the spouse who is financially knowledgeable (as identified by the

household), and important remaining differences between outcomes for men and women,

the table separates the results both according to whether the household labels the

respondent as the financially knowledgeable respondent (labeled as Financial R), or the

other member of the household (Non-Financial R). The table also reports each of these

outcomes by the sex of the respondent. Note also that in Appendix Table 2, the sample

sizes differ as we move down the rows. These differences in sample composition should

be borne in mind.

       As can be seen in Appendix Table 2, Section A, row 3, seventy eight percent of

men from couple households and 69 percent of women held a job in 2004. From row 5,

60 percent of employed men and 61 percent of employed women from couple households

reported coverage by a pension. From row 7, thirty five percent of men reporting a

pension, and fifty percent of women, had a matched employer pension plan in 2004.

About half of respondents with a pension on their current job report they have a defined

benefit plan. Around 73 percent of men and 68 percent of women reported having a

defined contribution (DC) plan. Because many individuals have both a defined benefit

and a defined contribution pension, the total of the share of those with pensions holding a




                                                                                          38
defined benefit plan, and the share of those with pensions holding a defined contribution

plan, exceeds 1.0. Moving toward the bottom of Section A of the table, in couple

households, 60 percent of men and 61 percent of women have a matched Social Security

record.

                                                                                                                            42
       Next we turn to the many measures of knowledge of pensions in Part B of

Appendix Table 2. Together these measures confirm our findings from earlier work – the

glass is half full, half empty. If we look at the fraction of the relevant populations who

can call their plan type, ages of retirement or plan value, on average they do not do too

badly. But if we look at measures of agreement between individual reports and relevant

values obtained from employer plan descriptions, typically less than half fall on a

diagonal indicating the respondent report and value obtained from the employer plan

description agree. More specifically, plan values are reported in the following ranges, all

in thousands of dollars: 20-40; 40-60; 60 to 80; 80-110; 110-150; 150 to 190; 190-240;

240-300; >300. Plan values from respondents and firms are said to agree if both reports

fall within the same range.

       We begin with indicators of knowledge of plan type. A simple “don’t know”

report is not a helpful place to start. As seen in Part B, row 1, only 3 percent of

respondents report they do not know their plan type. As a result, it is unlikely that this

measure is a very interesting dependent variable. Nor is it very helpful in explaining

variation in wealth.

       Other measures of pension knowledge are more interesting, however. If the

measure of correctly identifying plan type is whether, when the firm reports a defined

benefit plan, so does the respondent, as seen in row 3 of part B, agreement is obtained in

roughly 90 percent of the cases. That is, according to this broad definition of a match, if

either the worker or firm reports "both" (DB and DC) plan types, while the other reports

only one plan type, we consider this to be a match. However, using a narrower definition

of plan type, where a match requires that both the respondent and firm record indicate the




                                                                                             43
plan is DB only, DC only, or both only, 24 percent of men and 28 percent of women in

couple households agree with their employer report of plan type. Regarding the specifics,

if the respondent reports a pension that is defined benefit or combo, the matched plan

description is defined benefit or combo in 58 percent of the cases. The comparable match

rate is 49 percent when the respondent reports the plan is DC or combo. In the case of

reported plan type, there is little difference between financially knowledgeable

respondents or those who are not labeled as financially knowledgeable respondents.

However, note that each person is talking about their own pension, not their spouse’s

pension.

       Age of eligibility for benefits is another key characteristic of pensions. Of those

reporting a defined benefit or combination pension, 7 percent of males from couple

households, and 12 percent of females from couple households, report they do not know

at what age they will become eligible for early retirement benefits. Yet for those

reporting a defined benefit pension whose employer agrees the plan is DB, there is

agreement between early retirement age reported by respondents and early retirement

calculated from matched firm plan descriptions for 45 percent of males from couple

households, and 37 percent of females. Turning to normal retirement ages, among those

reporting coverage by a defined benefit pension, 5 percent of males from couple

households and 10 percent of females report they do not know their normal retirement

age. There is agreement on normal retirement age for those with a DB plan between the

respondent report and the value computed from plan description for 37 percent of males

from couple households and 32 percent of women. Among financially knowledgeable

respondents, women (28 percent agreement with plan descriptions) know less than men




                                                                                             44
(41 percent agreement) about the normal retirement age of their defined benefit pension.

Among those who are not the financially knowledgeable respondent, women (35 percent

agreement with plan description) know more than men (28 percent) about the normal

retirement age from their defined benefit plans.

       Skipping to the third row from last in Part B of Appendix Table 2, when those

with defined contribution plans are asked about the age at which they will become

eligible for early retirement benefits, ten percent of men and eighteen percent of women

report they do not know.

       Respondents exhibit similar limitations in their knowledge of benefit amounts as

they did in their knowledge of age of retirement. Of those reporting they were covered by

a defined benefit pension, 34 percent of men and 52 percent of women from couple

households report they do not know the value of the benefits they will receive from their

plan at normal retirement age. In a small minority of cases, the benefit at expected

retirement age matches the benefit obtained from employer plan descriptions. The match

rates are 20 percent for males from couple households, and 16 percent for females from

couple households.

       For males and females from couple households and females reporting coverage by

a defined contribution pension, 30 percent of men and 39 percent of women answer they

do not know what the balance is in their defined contribution pension. However, most of

these are willing to report their account balance in the form of a bracket, which does not

require them to report an exact amount. Among those reporting a DC plan, 10 percent of

males from couple households, and 12 percent of females from couple households report




                                                                                         45
they do not know their plan balances even after presented with ranges of account

balances as an alternative to having to report exact amounts.

        Having received a report from the Social Security Administration increases the

information available to the respondent. Today, benefit reports are mailed annually to

respondents. Nevertheless, some respondents still report they do not know what their

Social Security benefits will be at early retirement age. More specifically, from Part C of

Table 3, 28 percent of men from couple households, and 45 percent of women from

couple households report not knowing their Social Security benefits at early retirement

even when given the opportunity to provide an answer in the form of brackets. 8

        There are similar results concerning benefits at normal retirement age. For men

and women from couple households, the percent reporting DK are 23 percent and 40

respectively.

 In examining knowledge of Social Security benefits, Rohwedder and Kleinjans (2006) consider the
changes in knowledge over time. They find that HRS respondents do better in reporting Social Security
wealth as they approach retirement. They conclude that respondents who retired when they planned do a
good job of reporting Social Security wealth. However, a minority misreports their wealth, with 17 percent
of their sample over or understating their future benefits by 20 percent or more.
