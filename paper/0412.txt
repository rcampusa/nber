          The Roles of Monetary, Financial and Fiscal Policy
                     Under Rational Expectations



                              ABSTRACT



     The implications for the effectiveness of monetary, fiscal and financial

policy of the "rational expectations revolution" are evaluated.     The general

conclusion is that to anticipate policy is not to neutralize it.    This is

obviously the case for structural policies that alter the level and composition

of full employment output.   It also holds for stabilization policies that in-

fluence deviations of real variables from their "natural" values.     Substitution

of bond financing for tax financing of a given real spending program reduces

saving and lowers the capital-labor ratio, even when allowance is made for

private intergenerational gifts.   Anticipated monetary policy affects the

cyclical and equilibrium behavior of real variables except in implausible special

cases.

                      The Roles of Monetary, Financial and
                    Fiscal Policy under Rational Expectations

Summary

     The paper evaluates the implications for the conduct of monetary, fiscal
and financial policy of the "rational expectations revolution" in macroeconomics.
The general conclusion is that most of the policy conclusions derived from
conventional eclectic Neo-Keynesian models remain valid when rational expectations
are introduced: to anticipate policy is not to neutralize it. Both structural
policies aimed at altering the level and composition of full employment output
in the short run and in the long run and stabilization policies aimed at
influencing the cyclical departures of output and employment from their full
employment levels are considered.
     The consequences of structural fiscal policy--changes in non-lump-sum tax
rates and in public spending--for full employment output and    e~ployment   are
non-controversial. The confirmation of familiar Neo-Keynesian results about
financial and monetary policy may be more surprising. Here the I'lajor policy
conclusions are the following:
     1) ~~_!!~~~~!~~_~!_~~~~~~~~!_~E~~~!~~.For a given level and composition
of real government spending on goods and services, the substitution of bond
financing for current (lump-sum) taxes reduces saving in the short run and
lowers the capital-labor ratio in the long run. This crowding out result
persists even if each economic agent allows fully for the future taxes
"required" to service the stocy: of privately held interest-bearing public
debt. It even holds when allowance is made for the possibility of   bequ~sts

and other private intergenerational gifts. In a situation of Keynesian
unemployment the crowding out of saving in the short run may be an appropriate
policy to achieve a higher degree of resource utilization. The substitution
of money financing for tax financing is also not a matter of indifference.
The "inflation tax" is not equivalent to explicit current taxes. In the
simple models considered in the paper, the substitution of money financing
for tax financing "crowds in" saving and raises the capital-labor ratio in
the long run.

     2) ~~~~!~E¥_E~!!~~_~~~_~!~~!!!~~!!~~'Anticipated. as well as unanticipated
monetary policy will affect the cyclical behavior of    re~al   economic variables.
To obtain the result that anticipated monetary policy aeoes not matter for the
behavior of real output, employment etc., it is necessa=ry to assume that all
prices always and instantaneously assume their    competit~ive   market-clearing values,
in addition to having rational expectations based on    th~e    same information as is
available to the monetary authorities. Even then   antici~pated    monetary policy will
not be neutral unless thellstructural" channel through WI-L-hich monetary policy can
operate is also assumed to be ineffective. This    structu~al     channel is the effect
of changes in the money supply process on the    anticipat~ed    rate of inflation and
thus on the rate of return to holding money balances    an~d    other nominal financial
claims. Anticipated monetary policy therefore affects    r~ealvariables     through
three channels.l) Sticky nominal prices. 2) Non-identic=al information available
to the public and private sectors. 3) The effect of    mon~etary    growth on inflation
and thus on the portfolio choice between real and nomin=al assets.
     There are no grounds, in view of these   conclusions~,     for believing that
constraining the conduct of fiscal, monetary and financ=ial policy by very simple,
inflexible rules such as a constant growth rate for    the~   money supply, a balanced
budget or a constant share of public spending in GNP    ~vi~l   be optimal or even
sensible.

               The Roles of Monetary) Financial· and
             Fiscal Po1icyurtdet Rational Expectations

                            T.   Irttroduc~ion




     Neo~eynesian   accounts of the roles of monetary, financia1,and fiscal

policy have recently been challenged by a revival of classical macroeconomic

thinking--an approach to theory and policy that many had considered forever

buried under the economic ruins of the Great Depression.     This New Classical

Macroeconomics is associated originally with Milton Friedman (1968) and more

recently with Phelps (1970), Lucas (1972a, b, 1975, 1976) Sargent and

Wallace (1975, 1976) Barro (1974, 1976,1979), and a host of others.       The

main implications of this approach for macroeconomic policy can be summa-

rized in two"rieutra1ity or worselt propositions.

         Deterministic (and known) monetary policy rules can have no effect

on the joint probability distribution functions of real economic variab1es--

neutrality--but stochastic monetary policy behavior can increase the vari-

ability of real variables relative to their full information va1ues--or

worse.   This proposition has at times been extended to encompass not only

monetary policy but stabilization policy in general.     (McCallum, 1977.)

         Debt neutrality:   the full real impact of the government sector is

measured by the magnitude and composition of its real    spend~~g_   program.

The financing mode chosen, current taxes, borrowing or currency creation,

is of no consequence.   This proposition, first analyzed by Ricardo, has

recently been restated by Barro (1974).

     In a recent paper, "The Macroeconomics of Dr. Pang1oss" (Buiter, 1980

forthcoming), I have presented a nontechnical survey of the two theoretical
                                   - 2 -



cornerstones of the New Classical Macroeconomics.    These are rational

expectations in the sense of Muth and what I have called the "surprise"

supply function--the proposition that only unanticipated policy changes

(or other unanticipated, exogenous disturbances) can cause the real

economic system to depart from an otherwise policy-invariant equilibrium

trajectory.    In this paper I shall say nothing further about the rational

expectations assumption.    It, or its deterministic counterpart, perfect

foresight, will be incorporated in every model considered below.     My

purpose is to provide a more formal statement of the propositions

advanced in my "Pangloss" paper concerning the scope for monetary policy,

debt management policy, and fiscal policy under rational expectations.

The setup is as follows.    Section II presents a fairly standard, small

deterministic macromodel with a number of classical features.    All markets

clear instantaneously, there is no money illusion and perfect foresight

rules.   The effects of monetary, financial, and fiscal policy in this

model are analyzed.    A number of non-neutrality propositions are stated.

The drawback of this model is that it is ad hoc in the sense that private

behavioral relationships have not been derived from explicit optimizing

behavior.     Section III therefore studies debt neutrality and monetary super-

neutrality in a "fully rational" overlapping generations    model.   This leads

to the conclusion that the ad hoc model of Section II is not a bad parable

for such fully rational models.     Section IV abandons the assumption of

universal instantaneous Walrasian equilibrium and considers the consequences

of price arid wage stickiness. for the scope for ·stabilization policy; -

stochastic models are analyzed here, which also permits the consideration

of some of the interesting issues associated with incomplete information.

     There are two major limitations on the scope of this critique of the

New Classical Macroeconomics:    it is mainly theoretical and it is limited

to models of a closed econOmy.

Desctiptionofthe model

     The model represented in equations (1) through (17) is the full

employment version of the textbook closed economy IS-1M model.    The

nominal interest rate, the price level and the money wage rate always

instantaneously assume the values required to equilibrate the asset

market, the output market and the labor market.

          Equation 11.1 is the IS equation equating effective demand for output

to full employment production.                     l/    Full employment production is given by

a linear homogenous production function, f, in capital and labor with

positive and diminishing marginal products.                            Equation 11.2 is the LM or

portfolio balance equation.                      Private consumption depends on the real

interest rate, real income and real private net worth.                            It also may depend

directly on government consumption.                      ~/       This will be the case, e.g., if

government consumption is a substitute for private consumption (free school

milk, etc.).            Private capital formation is an increasing function of the

price of installed capital goods relative to the cost of producing new

investment goods.                  The current price of capital equals the discounted value

of current after-tax cash flow plus next period's expected price of s-apital

(equation 11.5).                  Due aliowance has to be made for profits taxes (at rate

t ) and capital gains taxation (at rate t ) .                           The required rate of return

on capital, r , equals the real rate of return on bonds (equation 11.6), a
             K
reflection of the Keynesian assumption that bonds and claims on existing

capital are perfect substitutes in private portfolios.                            Interest income is
taxed at a rate t •        Inflationary capital gains or losses on money and bonds are
                 R
not taxed.       The demand for money depends on the real after-tax rate of return

differential between bonds-cum-capita1 and money, on real income and real non-

human wealth.         Real income, equation 11.8, consists of disposable private
                 RB
income, f       +~p
                    -   T, adjusted in a number of ways.   First, expected capital

gains (or losses) due to expected inflation and expected changes in q are

added (-x p (~, + ex~) + xqqK).     Then we allow for the fact that a fraction
                  p
1 - ex    of the stock of government bonds held by the private sector may

not be viewed as private net worth because they are offset by the present

value of the future taxes "required" to service this debt.          The "flow"

counterpart of this wealth adjustment is the subtraction of a fraction

1   ~   ex of the bond-financed part of the government deficit in 11.8.     That

part of the deficit is viewed as equivalent to current taxes.          Finally,

if government spending on real goods and services is perceived as income-

in-kind, this has to be added in. Equation II.9.defines total taxes in

terms of its constituent components.         Equation 11.10 is the public sector

deficit.        Real non-human wealth, in equation 11.11, includes the adjustment

for bonds discussed earlier.         Equations 11.12 and 11.13 give the real

demand price and real supply price of labor, respectively.          The demand

price equals the marginal product of labor net of payroll taxes.          Labor

supply depends on the real interest rate, real net worth and goverrtment

spending.        Labor market equilibrium is assumed in equation 11.14.

Equations II.15a and II.15b impose rational expectations for the general

price level and the price of capital.         Equations 11.16, I1.17a and IL17b

are the dynamic equations describing the behavior over time of the capital

stock,     2J    of the stock of real money balances and of the real stock of

bonds.

Effects of 'structural' fiscal artdtilortetary policy

       Fiscal and monetary policy will have important effects in this equilibrium

model.        The level and composition of real full employment output can be influenced

in the short run (identified with the unit period of analysis), in the long

run (the steady-state equilibrium) and in the real-time intermediate run in

which policy decisions are actually made.         These real output effects are not

due to the elimination of involuntary Keynesian excess supply but to policy-

induced changes in important relative prices.         This alters the labor-leisure

trade-off, the intertemporal consumption trade-off, the marginal cost of

labor, etc.        Standard comparative statics yield the following policy

conclusions:

         a.     Taxation.   The non lump-sum tax changes are constant revenue changes with

T    adjusting endogenously.      Consider the special case of the labor supply function
where it is independent of the real interest rate and of net worth.           If the

 labor supply schedule is upward-sloping, an increase in the tax rate on
 labor income, t , will shift it to the left, reducing full employment output
                     w
 and employment for a given stock of capital.         An increase in the payroll
 tax, or in employers· national insurance
                                     .    contributions, t e , reduces employ-

 ment and output by shifting the labor demand schedule to the left, for a

 given stock of capital.        An increase in t 1T , the profit tax, will affect--
 presumably lower--the rate of private capital formation in the short run

 and the steady-state capital-labor ratio in the long run.          An increase in
 capital gains taxation, t , will have similar effects in the short run. In
                          c
 steady-state equilibrium there are no real capital gains so changes in

    capital gains taxation will not affect the long-run real equilibrium.       An
    increase in the tax rate on interest income, t , will lower the required
                                                  R
    rate of return on capital.     This will tend to stimulate capital formation

    in the short run and raise the capital-labor ratio in the long run.       An

increase in lump-sum taxes, L, will reduce real income unless, 'given the

government's real spending program, money- and bond-financed deficits are

exactly equivalent to explicit lump-sum taxation.                                  For this to be the

case,    i~   is necessary that government bonds do not constitute net private

sector wealth to any extent, i.e., that a                             o.       With exclusively bond-

financed deficits, 0 =           0,   the appropriate real income concept then becomes,

using II.8
                                                 G
(11.8')       Y = f(K, N) + (13 -1) C                 -~~+~qK

A substitution of lump-sum tax financing for borrowing will have no real

effects.       With money-financed deficits, 0                     = 1,        equation 11.8 can be

written as:
                                                 G
(II.8") Y = f(K, N) + (13 - l)C                      + b: -   ~(~)         +   ~   qK

A once-and-for all increase in the level of the stock of money will be strictly
                                                                                       bM   bn M

is zero when such a level shift in the money stock path occurs, and

that ~ is independent of such a level shift.                                   Thus a one-period unexpected
         q
shift from money financing to lump-sum tax financing will not have any

real effects.

        b.     Government spending.               In this classical equilibrium model, changes

in government spending on real goods and services will have powerful short-

run and long-run effects.               All tax rates are assumed constant.                       Any changes in

the public sector deficit or surplus are financed according to II.17a and

ILI7b.        If there is no direct crowding out (Buiter, 1977, 1979), Le., if

government consumption is not a substitute or complement for private consumption

and leisure (C l     =   0, 13   =    0, h
                                             2
                                                 =   0), government spending will "crowd out"

private consumption and investment spending on a one-for-one basis by raising

the price level and the interest rate.                        ~/      In the long run, a higher level

of public spending is likely to "crowd out"
                                            ..-.10 ....



real capital, although this need not be the case.                 If higher public spending

leads to steady state deficits, these could be associated with higher rates

of inflation.          This would make real capital a more attractive asset              compared

to money and creates the possibility of long..,..run "crowding in."                  Getting

rid of all real effects of government spending requires some very strong

assumptions.           (i)   No direct effect of public consumption on the supply of

labor: h
            2
                = o.     (ii)    Public consumption is a perfect substitute for private

consumption and thus constitutes income in kind on a one-for-one basis:

C
 1
     = -1 and B = 1.            (iii)   Debt neutrality prevails: a   = o.    (iv)    If the

higher level of public spending is associated with increased deficits, these

either are financed by borrowing, or, to the extent that they are financed

by money creation, only involve a once-and-for all step increase in the

money supply.           Since most of these assumptions are rather silly, the real

trajectory of the economy will certainly not be invariant under alternative

paths for real government spending.

       c.       Money neutrality.        A once-and-for all step increase in the nominal

stock of money will be neutral, i.e., have no real effects                   only if a    = 0:
            debt neutrality prevails.            A given percentage change in M, if it

were associated with an equal percentage change in p and W, would reduce

the real value of a given nominal stock of bonds.                 This will only fail to

have real consequences if bonds do not matter, i.e., if a                = o. Debt
neutrality is discussed at length in Section III.

       d.       Monetary superneutrality.           This is the property that the real

trajectory of the economic system is invariant under alternative proportional

rates of growth of the nominal money supply.       It is easily seen that if
                                                  monetary
Bf    0,    debt neutrality is a necessary condition for/superneutrality. As can be
seen from equations II.19a and II.19b, only a common proportional rate of

growth. of the nominal stocks of money and bonds is consistent with steady

state equilibrium   if a   f o.   Even if debt neutrality prevails, super-

neutrality will be negated by the fact that no market-determined interest

rate is paid on money balances.      The real rate of return on money is minus

the expected rate of   inf1ation~    Higher proportional rates of money growth

are, across steady states, associated with higher proportional rates of

inflation.   These lower' real returns from holding money will lead to a

portfolio shift from money to real capital, thus destroying superneutrality,

unless the demand for money is completely interest-inelastic.      Any change

in fiscal parameters that changes the rate of inf1ation(because it leads

to changesin the growth path of the money supply)wil1 therefore have real

effects, even if it were to have no direct      structural effects or displace-

ment effects.   The next section considers debt neutrality and monetary

superneutrality in an utterly classical overlapping generations world.


         III.   Debt Neutrality and Monetary Superneutra1ity in
                          FullyOptimiiing Models

a.Debt neutrality in anoptimizingmacromode1

     In two recent studies· (Buiter and Tobin,:'l980,    Tobin and Buiter, 1980) ~

James Tobin and I concluded that debt neutra1ity--the property           the real

trajectory of the economic system is invariant under changes in           inancing

mix, for a given level and composition of real government spending--is a

theoretical curiosum.      The assumptions required for it to be valid can easily

be shown to be contradicted by practical experience.      In this section of the

paper, I shall restate the case against debt neutrality in the context of a

model constructed expressly to be as favorable as possible to classical
                                    - 12 -



invariance theorems.     The model is a generalization of Diamond's over-

lapping generations model (Diamond, 1965), and allows for voluntary inter-

 generational gifts and bequests.     (See Barro, 1974, and Buiter; 1980a).

A comprehensive treatment of the subject can be found in Carmichael (1979).

Except for some minor changes, the treatment of the case of agents with

"two-sided intergenerational caring"     replicates the original work of

Carmichael.

     The overlapping generations model used to develop the non-neutrality

 theories is "classical" in the sense that private actions are derived

 from explicit optimizing behavior, perfect foresight prevails and all

markets are in equilibrium all of the time.      All private agents act as

 price takers.      I shall study the behavior of this decentralized, com-

 petitive economy when a given government opending program is      financ~d


 by different combinations of lump-sum taxation or current borrowing.         With-

 out loss of generality the level of government spending is assumed to equal

 zero, which allows us to rephrase the argument in terms of the real effects

 of alternative debt issue-taxation programs.     The restriction to lump-sum

 taxes is necessary to give the neutrality proposition a chance.      Non-lump-

 sum taxes on labor income, profits, wealth or any other base, will introduce

       ·stortions, impose excess burdens and, except in uninteresting special

 c       ave real    effects.~rivate, voluntary   intergenerational gifts--from

 parents to children (bequests) or from children to parents--are essential

 for the debt neutrality property to prevail.     Briefly, the argument for

 neutrality goes as follows.     The stock of real government interest-bearing

 debt has no effect on private behavior because    correspo~ding   to every

 dollar's worth of income on these bonds is a dollar's worth of tax payments
                                  - 13 -



to finance the bond income.    The value of the government bonds on the

asset side of private portfolios is the present discounted value of these

future income payments.     The value of these bonds is therefore exactly

matched by the present discounted value of the future tax payments

required to service them.     Even if we grant that the future payments stream

and the future tax payments stream are identical and that both are dis-

counted in the same manner? a shift from tax financing to borrowing could

cause non-neutrality because of an intergenerational redistribution of

resources.   If the bonds are one-period bonds and each individual is

supposed to live for two periods, the intergenerational redistribution that can

be associated with such issues is iffiQediately apparent.   Let an extra Pound's

worth of bonds be issued in period t.      It is bought by the then young

members of generation t.     Next period interest and repayment of principal

occur.   The tax revenue required for the debt servicing could be levied on the

then young members of 3eneration t + 1.      In that case, real resources have been

redistributed from the young to the old.      Consumption and capital formation

will be affected.   An unfunded social security program will have broadly

similar effects.    Longer maturity bonds can be incorporated in the analysis

without materially altering it.     Voluntary intergenerational gifts can

remove   the real consequences of involuntary intergenerational redistribution

through the borrowing-taxation mechanism.      Provided the taxes are lump-sum,

such private intergenerational transfers will restore the original con-

sumption-investment equilibrium as long as such private actions do not violate the

non-negativity constraints on these voluntary intergenerational transfers.        If,

before the extra Pound's worth of public debt is issued the members of the older

generation   were all leaving positive bequests to their descendants? the
                                   - 14 -


option of redistributing resources from the young to the old through a

cut in bequests was already open to the older generation.        Their decision

not to exercise this option reflects that, at the margin, they receive

greater utility from the well-being of their heirs     than from their own

consumption.    The government's attempt to redistribute "gross resources"

from the young to the old will in that case by met by increased bequests

from the old to the young, leaving the "net resources" available to each

generation unchanged.    If, on the other hand, the older generations were

initially at a "zero bequest corner," -i. e., if in order to increase their

own life-time resources they would gladly have left their children a

negative legacy, had this not been ruled out by law, the involuntary

intergenerational redistribution would not have been neutralized by an

exactly matching voluntary transfer in the opposite direction.

     Within the bounds set by the non-negativity constraints on gifts and

bequests, lump-sum redistribution through borrowing or unfunded social

security schemes will be neutralized by voluntary intergenerational

transfers, if bequest or gift motives are present.     Private non-market

transactions are required to neutralize public non-market transactions.

A formal analysis follows below.

b.       Government financing in an overlapping generations model without
         gifts or bequests

         Each generation'consists of identical households that live for two

periods.        During the first period of their lives each household works

a fixed amount, 1.        Income earned in the first period is either consumed

or saved.        These savings, plus accumulated interest, are the only source

of income in the second period of a household's life when it is retired.

Households are also identical across generations.         Initially there is no

government borrowing or lending and no taxation.         On the output side, the

model has a single commodity that can either be consumed or used as a

capital good.         Until government bonds are introduced, real capital is the

only store of value.        The model is "real":   there are no money balances.

The dual role to be performed by durable output--that of being an input

in the production function and of being the only store of value may lead

to inefficiencies in a decentralized, competitive economy.         (See Diamond,

1965; Buiter,1980a; and Carmichael, 1979.)

c.    A competitive economy without government debt

      In the absence of government borrowing and lending, the utility

maximization program faced by a representative household of generation

     t is given by:

                              t    +   1




       Equation 111.1 states that the present discounted value of life-

time consumption cannot exceed that of labor income.                         Given our

assumptions about the utility function, u, the budget constraint will

hold with equality and all solutions for                     c~ and c~ will be interior.
Utility is a function of own lifetime consumption only.                           There is no

gift or bequest motive.                    The model is completed by adding the economy-

wide constraints, 111.2, 111.3, and 111.4.

       Output is produced by a well-behaved neoclassical production function

which is linear homogenous in capital and labor.                       In intensive form it can

states that the labor market clears and is competitive.                           The real wage
                                                     - 17 -



equals the marginal product of labor.                            Equation 111.3 states that the

capital rental market clears and is competitive with the rental rate

(which in the one-commodity model also equals the interest rate)

equal to the marginal product of capital.                             Equation 111.4 is the economy-

wide capital market equilibrium condition.                             The stock of capital in

existence at the beginning of period t, K , is equal to the savings of
                                         t
the previous period.                  Only the young save in this model without bequests,

In what follows we shall aSsume existence, uniqueness and stability and

proceed to analyze steady-state equilibria only.

     In steady-state equilibrium, the capital-labor ratio anq through

that all real stock-stock and stock-flow ratios are constant.                       We solve

for it by setting k

                                     = kt +   1 in equations 111.1 through 111.5.     By sub-

stituting the marginal productivity conditions 111.2 and 111.3 into 111.1

and 111.4 we obtain equations 111.7 and 111.8, the stationary private

budget constraint and aggregate capital market equilibrium condition.

From 111.7 and 111.8 we can solve for the stationary decentralized con-

sumption possibility locus,                    as in III.9a and III.9b.

this is not more likely than any other point on the locus.                                      A competitive

stationary equilibrium satisfies two criteria:                                  it lies on the stationary

consumption possibility locus and it has a tangency between an indifference

curve and a private budget constraint with slope                                 -(1   + r) =   -(1   + f'(k»).
The private budget constraint will always cut the stationary consumption

possibility locus in the manner indicated at E and E •                                     Only at the golden

rule (E ) will the private budget constraint be tangent to the locus.

        It is instructive to contrast the private decentralized solution with

the solution achieved by an omnipotent social planner.                                    The latter is only

subject to the aggregate resource constraint:

              C~Lt      +   c~   _ 1Lt _ 1         =    Ltf(k t ) -   Lt(~t   + 1(1 + n) ..,.   k~    or

In order to maximize the stationary per capita amount of resources available

for consumption, the social planner selects the golden rule capital-labor

ratio k*.      The stationary social consumption possibility locus is the

straight line yy with slope -(1 + n).          By distribution through administrative

fiat, any point on this yy locus is available to the social planner.         A

decentralized competitive equilibrium with a capital-labor ratio below k*,

as at E ,is not inefficient.        During any transition from E to E , say,
       3                                                        3    1
capital deepening has to occur, requiring the sacrifice of consumption during

the transition in exchange for a permanently higher consumption path after

E has been achieved.       A capital-labor ratio in excess of the golden rule is
 1
inefficient because it is possible to reduce the capital-labor ratio and

thus to have a temporary consumption binge while enjoying a permanently

higher path of consumption after k* has been achieved.          This inefficiency is

due to capital's dual role as a store of value and a factor of production.

In an attempt to shift consumption towards retirement, private agents save

by accumulating capital.       This depresses the rate of interest.     By making

available a store of value that has no additional intrinsic use, either as

a consumption good or a capital good, government borrowing can alleviate

and even eliminate any such inefficiency due to overaccumulation.

d.   A competitive economy with government debt

     Now consider the case in which the government issues real-valued one-

period bonds.       Bonds floated during period t are repaid with interest at a

rate r
         t
             + 1 in period t + 1.   Government bonds and real capital are perfect

substitutes in private sector portfolios.          D can be negative, in which case
                                                    t
the public sector lends to the private sector.          Such public sector lending

to the public sector consists of public purchases of private sector bonds

Tt is the total lump-sum tax bill paid by the younger generation in period t.

It can be negative in which case it constitutes transfer payments to the

young.       With government debt and taxes the economy we are considering can

be represented as follows;

     By substituting III. 20 into III. 22 we can derive the steady state

effect of an increase in the per capita stock of public debt on the

capital-labor ratio:

     If the model is stable (equation 111.19) and if

nator of III. 24 is negative.         The denominator is positive.       We therefore

obtain the familiar result that, comparing steady states, government debt

issues reduce the capital-labor ratio, i.e., crowd out real capital.              This

"crowding out" result also obtains in the short run, as can be checked

from equation III. 18.     Given k t , the effect on k t + l of an increase in d

       Note that the steady-state value of d can be chosen to be negative

or positive.        Irrespective of d, if the economy is at the golden rule, no

net taxes or transfers are required (111.23).             The growth in the total demand

for          debt required to keep the per capita stock of debt constant

just suffices to repay the debt held by the old generation, plus interest

at the rate of population growth.             Positive d requires positive   T   at

capital labor ratios below the golden rule ratio k* (at interest rates

above n), negative         T    in the inefficient region when f'(k) < n.

       The steady-state effect of government debt issue can be illustrated

                      using a generalization of the stationary competitive

consumption possibility locus of Figure 1.             The effect of an increase

in d on the stationary competitive consumption possibility locus is to

shift it up at a rate -(l+n).             From III. 21 and 22 it is easily seen that,

at any given k, ac l           = _(l+f') while ac 2 = l+f ' • Thus the rate at which,
                ad                (l+n)         ad

for any given k, c 2 is traded off for c l when d increases is -(l+n).

Figure 2 shows the general nature of the shift in the locus while Figure 3

focuses on a particular capital-labor ratio, k below the golden rule

     Bequests

     With bequests, the utility function, the budget constraint and the

capital market equilibrium condition are altered.       Bt is the bequest

left in the second period of his life by a member of generation t to

the members of generation t+l.      The bequests are received by members of

generation t+l at the end of the first period of their lives.             The value

of the bequest to members of generation t+l at the beginning of their

second period is Bt (l+r t +2)'   When the rate of population growth is nonzero

bequests shared equally among all descendants.       Note that bequests must

be non-negative, a useful institutional constraint.

     111.26       Bt ~ 0   for all t.

     The utility function of a member of generation t is W
                                                          t
                                                                     =v   (c~,c~,W*t+I)'
The utility of a member of generation t depends on his       O,Tn   life-time

consumption, c~' c~ and on the·::~~:i.inum utili ty level attainable by a member

of the next generation.     For simplicity I shall consider the additively

the "generational" discount rate; it is not to be confused with the indivi-

dual's pure rate of time preference.      Convergence, i.e., boundedness of Wt

requires 6 > O.     The optimization problem solved by a representative member

of generation t is given in equations     111~28   and 111.29.      The new economy-

wide capital market equilibrium condition is given in equation 111.30.

       The individual's budget constraint now contains the bequest he

receives and the bequest he leaves.        The capital market equilibrium

conditivn recognizes that now both the young and the old generation can



       The first order conditions for an optimum are:

       III. 3la


       III. 3lb

       If Bt > 0, i.e., if there is an interior solution for bequests, III.3Ib

holds with equality.       If there is a corner solution for bequests, i.e.,

if B = 0 is a binding constraint, III.3lb holds with strict inequality.

The interpretation of these first order conditions is straightforward.

III.3Ia says that the discounted marginal utility of consumption in the

second period of one's life should equal the marginal utility of consumption

in t!1e first period of one's life.        III.3Ib states that if bequests are

positive, the marginal utility of own consumption should equal the marginal

utility of leaving a bequest.        A marginal unit of income saved by an old

member of generation t yields resources (l+r t +2) times larger to generation

t+l.    The marginal utility to a member of generation t of bequests can

be expressed as the discounted value of the marginal utility of consumption

of a member of generation t+1.            The appropriate discount rate is the

generational discount rate o.            Finally, since it is the utility of a

representative member of generation t+1 that was assumed to enter into

the utility function of generation t, rather than the utility of all l+n

descendants, the population growth factor l+n also discounts the marginal

utility of consumption of generation t+1.                 If the marginal utility of own

consumption exceeds the marginal utility of bequests, there will be a

corner solution with B=O.

     The steady state equilibrium of the model with bequests is given

in equations 111.32.

ratios so high     that (l+n)(l+o) > l+f'(k), B=O and the no-bequest locus

Since 0 > 0, k ~k*, the golden rule capital-labor ratio.                  Considering

equations III.32c and III.32d, we can draw a consumption possibility

locus for each value of B.           A higher value of B shifts the locus down
                                     - Z8 -



       and to the right at a rate -(l+n).     Thus all steady_state equilibria

with interior (positive) solutions for bequests lie on the line segment

AZA3A4~   All interior bequest solutions have the same capital-labor ratio,

defined by f'(k)    =   (l+n)(l+o) which is below the golden rule capital-labor

ratio.    One such interior solution for bequests is drawn at A3 , where an

indifference curve is tangent to a budget constraint with slope -(l+f'(k»

on the line segment AZA3A4 •     The stationary consumption possibility locus

for the appropriate positive value of B is represented by the dashed curve

through A3 •   The complete stationary locus with bequests is given by the

no-bequest locus above AZ and the line segment AZA3A4 •      If the stationary

competitive equilibrium is on AlA Z ' i.e., if there is a corner solution

for bequests, the effect of government lending and borrowing is as in the

no-bequest model.       If the model is stable, the introduction of government

borrowing (d > 0) will reduce the equilibrium capital labor-ratio, while

the introduction of government lending (d < 0) will increase it.       However,

government borrowing can never reduce the capital-labor ratio below k.

Once k falls to k, any further increase in government borrowing (which

represents an involuntary redistribution of income from the young to

the old) will be matched by exactly offsetting bequests, voluntary

transfers from the old to the young.       This is most easily appreciated

if we consider the effect of government lending.       Start from an initial

equilibrium, without government lending, with positive bequests as at

A3 •   With bequests, bonds and taxes the private budget constraint

111.Z9 and the capital market equilibrium condition 111.30 are replaced

by 111.Z9' and 111.30' respectively.

     If, with d=O, a stationary solution obtains with B=B o > 0, a negative

value of d=d o will still permit the same consumption-capital stock equili-

brium to obtain as long as BO >            I   dO(I+r)I , i.e., as long as bequests can

be reduced by an amount equal, in present value, to the amount of

government lending.      Then the involuntary government redistribution from

the old to the young will be neutralized as regards its effect on the life-

time resources of the two generations alive at anyone moment, by the

reduction in voluntary private redistribution from the old to the young.

Given any initial value of bequests, however, there always exists a

volume of government lending large enough to put private agents in a

zero-bequest corner.      Thus, with bequests, the government can always

raise the capital-labor ratio above                 k.    It can never bring it down

below   k.

Gifts from the Young to the Old

        With gifts from the young to the old, the utility function is

Wt   = V(c~,C~,W~_I). W~~l        is the maximum level of utility attained by

a member of generation t-l.          We again adopt the additively separable

form:



We note that unlike standard time discounting, the utility of a member of

the earlier generation is not compounded, but discounted.          Convergence

requires .that the discount rate applied to parents' utility be positive,

p > O.     Gifts of course cannot be negative.       Gt~.   The behavior of the

competitive economy with gifts is summarized below

The private budget constraint allows for gifts handed out and received.            The

capital    mark~t       equilibrium condition reflects the fact that resources   giy~n   b3

the young to the old, who do not save, are no longer available for capital

formation.

     The first order conditions of the private optimization problem are:

     IlL37 a



     III.37b




     If Gt > 0, i.e., if there is an interi~r solution for gifts, III.37b

holds with equality.   If there is a corner solution for gifts, i.e., if

G=O is a binding constraint, III37b holds with strict inequality.

Equation III.37a is the condition for the optimal allocation of consump-

tion for a member of generation t between the two periods of his life.

     III.37b states that if gifts are given from generation t to gener-

ation t-l, the marginal utility of own consumption should equal the

marginal utility of gifts.    The marginal utility of gifts is then

expressed in terms of the marginal utility of own consumption of a

member of generation t-l.    This marginal utility of own consumption of

generation t-l is discounted at the generational discount factor (l+p).

Second-period consumption of members of generation t-l takes place one

period before second-period consumption of members of generation t,

so interest    is foregune and further discounting by (l+rt+l) is required.

Finally, there are more members of generation t than of generation t-I. . A

member of generation t-l therefore receives Gt(l+n) for Gt given up by a

member of generation t.     If the marginal utility of own consumption exceeds

the marginal utility of gifts, Gt=O.

       G > Oimplies that III.38b holds with equality.             A corner solution

with G=O binding implies that III.38b holds with strict inequality.
S~ationary   equilibrium is given by:
       III.38c    G(r-n) = (w_c l ) (l+r)         - c
                                                        2

                   r = f' (k)
                   w = f(k)-kf'(k)

The interesting equation is III.38b.               Since p is posi tive, G > 0 implies

r < n.     An interior solution for gifts implies that the economy is dynami-

cally inefficient, at a capital-labor ratio ~ above the golden rule

capital-labor ratio k*.           In models with inifite-lived households with a

constant pure rate of time preference 0, such an inefficiency can never

arise.     Steady state equilibrium is characterized by (l+n)(l+O) = l+r.

With 0 > 0 this implies r > n. Earlier consumption is cet. par. valued

more than later consumption.             This is not true when we have a child-parent

gift motive.      Own earlier consumption may well be valued more than own

later consumption.          The pure rate of time preference for own consumption,

O(c)   ul(c,c) -1,. may well be positive. Earlier consumption by parents,
       =

however, is cet. par. valued less than later consumption by oneself.

Parental utility is discounted, even though it "accrues" earlier.               Thus

child-parent gifts do not make a private decentralized economy with

finite-lived agents equivalent to an economy with infinite-lived agents.

It also does not rule out the possibility of dynamic inefficiency through

overaccumulation.   Quite the contrary, if gifts are positive in the steady

state, the steady state is necessarily inefficient.     An operative gift

motive is indeed a reflection of a very strong desire to shift resources

away from early consumption towards later consumption.

     The effect of gifts on the steady state consumption possibility locus

is indicated in Figure 5.     OA 2Al is the locus without gifts.   For capital-

'labor ratios below i, defined by f'(i) = l+n, the locus with gifts is
                                             Hp

identical with the locus without gifts because the equilibrium solution

for G is zero.    The stationary capital-labor ratio can never be above i

when there is a gift motive.     All solutions with G > 0 lie on the line segment

A4 A3 A2 with slope -(l+n).      Starting at A2 where G=O and k=i, an increase

in G shifts the stationary consumption possibility locus up and to the left

at a rate -(l+n).    A typical interior solution for G is drawn at A3 •     An

indifference curve is tangent to a budget constraint with slope -(l+f'(i»

on the line segment A4 A3 A2 •    The stationary consumption possibility locus

for the appropriate positive value of G is represented by the dashed curve

through    A3 •   The entire stationary consumption possibility locus with

gifts is given by the segment of the no-gift locus 0 A2 and the straight

       The effect of government borrowing and lending in the presence of

a gift motive is easily analyzed.       As long as the economy stays in the

range of capital-labor ratios below      i,    government lending and borrowing

will have the same effect as in the model without gifts and bequests.

If k=~ initially (with d=O), government lending (d < 0) will not have any

effect on the steady-state consumption path and capital-labor ratio.

Involuntary government redistribution from the old to the young will be

neutralized immediately by matching voluntary gifts from the young to the

old.     Government borrowing, d > 0, will also be neutralized by matching

reductions in gifts from the young to the old, up to the point that the

constraint G > 0 becomes binding.       The private budget constraint, capital

market equilibrium condition and government budget constraint with gifts,

borrowing and taxes are

the size of the real per capita government bond issue, the private sector

can and will undo the effects of the government action on consumption and

the capital-labor ratio by reducing voluntary gifts from the young to the

old.     For any initial G, however, there always exists a government borrow-

ing program large enough to make G > 0 a binding constraint.                            Such actions

will move the economy from A4 A3 AZ onto AZ 0, lowering the capital-labor

ratio.     In view of the inefficiency of the private, decentralized compe-

titive solution with positive gifts, such borrowing will                         ~lways   constitute a

Pareto improvement as long as it does not lower k below k*.

Gifts and bequests

        I now consider the case of "two-sided caring".                   Each generation cares

about the welfare of its immediate ancestors and its immediate descendants.

The utility function is:

         Wt        1 Z' W*_ , Wt+l)o
              = v(ct,C         *
                       t t l
The special case of the additively separable function is again .considered:

         W
                   1 Z
              = u(ct'C                -1    *               -1    *
          t            t)   + (1+0)        Wt + l + (l+p)        Wt_lo

Convergence now requires not only                <5   > 0 and p > 0 but   <5 p   > 1.

       It might be thought that the solution to the problem with both gifts

and bequests is in some way a simple combination of the solutions to the

cases with just gifts and just bequests.                    This is not so.        With "one-sided

caring" (either gift or bequest motives but not both) the private agent's

optimization problem is a standard problem in dynamic programming.                            With

a bequest     motiv~   each agent in generation t cares potentially for all his
                                    - 36 -



descendants.   Directly as regards his immediate heir, indirectly through

the dependence of the utility of his immediate descendant on the utility

of generation t+2, etc.    In the same way, with a gift motive, each agent

potentially cares for all his ancestors.      In either case utility chains

stretch out in one direction only.     With both gift and bequest motives,

this unidirectional simplicity no longer applies.        An agent in generation

t cares directly about generations t-l and t+l.      These generations both

care directly about generation t.     Generation   t~l   also cares directly

about t-2 and generation t+l about t+2.      Immediately, utility chains can

be seen to be running in both directions.      These issues were discussed

for the first time in Carmichael (1979).      A particularly simple solution

emerges when the following assumptions are made about the "game" played

by a member of generation t with past and future generations:

     1.    A member of generation t acts competitively in his       labor and

capital markets, i.e. he takes w and r + as parametric.          He also assumes
                                t     t l
that all past and future generations have acted or will act competitively

in their factor markets.

     2.    A member of generation t, in formulating his consumption gift-

bequest plan, knows the utility levels and actions of all past generations and

correctly anticipates utility levels and actions of all future generations

 (rational expectations or perfect foresight).

      3.   A member of generation t plays a non-cooperative gift and bequest

game with past and future generations.       He rationally believes that all past

and future generations play the same game.       This strategy is closed-loop as
                                             - 36a -



regards "the utility and actions of the two generations with which he overlaps

(generations t-1 and t+1).      This means that when evaluating the alternative

actions open to him at the beginning of period t, he believes that he can

affect the total utility and the actions of his immediate descendants and his

immediate forebears.

     His stre.tegy is open-loop as regards the utility and actions of all other

generations (t-i,   i~2   and t+j,   j~2).   Thus, when evaluating the effects of

marginal changes in his actions, he ignores the impact on the actions and

utility of generations that are already dead when he is born or that are born

after his 1ifetime. 9 /

     4.   When formulating his closed-loop strategy vis-a-vis generations t-1

and t+1, he believes that he can alter the behavior_of these generations (i.e.

their consumption, gift and bequest choices) only by altering the total resources

available to them, i.e., only through direct transfers.

     5.   Each generations acts so as to maximize its utility.

     6.   Each generation views the w"or1d and plays the game in the same way as

the member of generation t just described.

     The resulting equilibrium in this differential game is a Nash equilibrium.

                          (l+p) (1+0)-1
[(l+p )(l+cS)-l] (l+n) , the stationary consumption possibility locus is the

same as it is without gifts and bequests. On the curve segment A2 AS'

there are corner solutions for gifts and bequests: G             = B = O.     When there

is an interior solution for gifts the equilibrium is on the line segment

Al A2 with slope -(l+n).         A2 is defined by-(l+f'(k»        =   (l+cS)(l+n)      As

in the gifts only case, larger positive values of G shift               the locus up

and to the left at a rate -(l+n).            Note that the degree of overaccumu1ation

relative to the golden rule is less when G > 0, if there is both a gift and

a bequest motive than if there only is a gift motive. 121              The tende~cyto

"oversave", represented by the gift motive is partly, but not completely,

neutralized by the presence of a bequest motive.               A3 A4 would be the locus

of interior soutions for G if there were only a gift motive.                If the bequest

motive is operative, i.e., if B > 0, all stationary solutions lie on the

line segment AS A6 with slope -(l+n).               AS is defined by (l+f'(k»     =
[(l+p)(l+o)-l] (l+n). As in the case of bequests only, larger positive
     l+p
values of B shift the locus down and to the right at a rate -(l+n).

A7 AS would be the locus of interior solutions for B if there were just

a bequest motive.        The degree of underaccumu1ation, relative to the

golden ru1e,is less if there is both a bequest and a gift motive than if

     The effects of government lending and borrowing on the steady-state

capital-labor ratio are a straightforward combination of the effects of

such policies when there was either a gift or a bequest motive but not both.

Consider an initial equilibrium without government debt:               d   = O.   If

the initial equilibrium is in the range of k for which there is a corner

Al A2 , government borrowing will be offset by a reduction in gifts of

equal present value, thus leaving c 1 ,c 2 and k unchanged, unless the

increase in d is larger, in present value, than the original value of G.

In other words, there is always a positive value of d large enough to make

G ? 0 a binding constraint. If there is an interior solution for bequests, on
AS A6' government lending (d<O) will be offset by a reduction in bequests
of equal present value which leaves c 1 , c 2 and k unchanged. Again, if the

value of lending is larger, in present value, than the original bequest,

the constraint B ? 0 will become binding.

     Conclusions

     The policy conclusions of this theoretical investigation of debt neu-

trality are straightforward.    While operative intergenerational gift and

bequest motives turn finite-lived households into infinite-lived households

in a certain sense, there remain essential differences.           In particular,

if the child-parent gift motive is operative, the decentralized, competi-

tive equilibrium is socially inefficient because it is characterized by

a capital-Iab?r ratio above the golden rule.     There is therefore a prima

facie case for government intervention in the saving-investment process •
                                                             ..

child-parent gifts are operative, small increases in government borrowing

reductions in government borrowing (or increases in lending) are neutralized

by reductions in bequests.     There always exists an increase in lending or

borrowing that will make B=O, respectively G=O a binding constraint. There always

     Even in this most classical of models, the conclusion emerges inexor-

ably that the way in which the government finances its real spending program

will have major consequences for saving and capital formation.         Debt neutrality

b.   Monetary Superneutrality in a Fully Optimizing Macromodel

     The   overlappin~generations   model is also a convenient vehicle for

analyzing the issue of superneutrality of money in an explictly optimizing

and fully rational model.    Superneutrality is the invariance of the trajec-

tories of the real variables of the economy under different proportional

rates of growth of the nominal money stock.       Money is defined as a non-

 interest-bearing (nominally denominated) liability of the government that

has no "intrinsic value" in the sense that it is neither used as a consump-

 tion good, nor as an input in the productive process.       The two functions

 performed by this financial~laim are the medium of exchange function and

 the store of value   functio~    Carmichael (1979)   devel~~s    a model in which

 both functions are incorporated.     For simplicity, I shall limit the analysis

 to a consideration of the store of value function of money.        The anti-

 superneutrality result obtained in the simpler model carries over to the

"~?re complex model considered by Carmichael.      Consider the introduction of

 money in a""si?ple overlapping generations model without gifts, bequests or

 interest-bearing government debt, in which the only other store of value

 is real reproducible capital.      Since money balances are not desired for

 their own sake but only for their purchasing power over real output, the

 real rate of return on money balances is the negative of the expected

 proportional rate of change of the price level -lip/p.      In the certainty
                                                -44-


model under consideration, the actual and expected rates of inflation

are the same, if expectations are rational.               ~ =~.         Also, money and
                                                          p   p
real capital are perfect substitutes as stores of value.                   They will only

both be held if their rates of return are equal.                If the rate of return

on money balances were below that on real capital,                -~    < f'(k), no money
                                                                    p
would be held, if the rate of return on money balances were above that

on real capital,         -~    > f'(k), no capital would be held.         Considering only
                          p

Let   ~    denote the proportional rate of growth of the nominal money supply:

~   = lIM/M.   M is the nominal stock of money.           In steady-state equilibrium,

the rate of change of the price level is the rate of growth of the money

supply minus the natural rate of growth of the economy:

n-~        f'(k),an increase in the rate of growth of the money supply will

lower the      ~teady-state      rate of return on money balances by raising the

steady-state rate of inflation.            Portfolio balance       requires an equal

reduction in the rate of return on capital.               This is accomplished by a

higher capital-labor ratio.            Models such-as ~Si~]='i~_~.ld's(:1,967) Y?h:i-ch. exhibit..-

invariance of steady-state k under different va1~es for ~ are only super-

ficia11y rational, optimizing models.              By including real money balances as

an argument in the direct utility function, on a par with consumption and

leisure, the       Sid~~u~~~     model violates the principle that money is only

wanted for what it can buy.            It is therefore not an interesting framework

for analysing monetary policy.

     The overlapping generations model with money is summarized in 111.53.

Money is introduced into the economy via lump-sum transfers.                                   There is no

relation between the stock of money held by an economic agent and the size of

the transfer.   If there were, the monetary injections would be akin to pay-

ment of interest on money balances.                                   This would result in superneutrality.

        The conclusion that "equilibrium" and "rationality" do not imply "neutrality"

again emerges forcefully, as it did when debt neutrality was considered.                      The

detailed consideration of the fully rational, optimizing models of this section

also leads to the conclusion that the ad hoc model of Section II is in many

ways an acceptable parable for the "purer" ~odels of Section III.


             IV.    Stabilization Policy in Stochastic Non-Walrasian Models

        A Walrasian economy has two essential features.            The first is the existence

of a comp1eteset of contingent forward markets.              This permits the interpreta-

tion of such an economy as a "one shot," static economy.                At the beginning of

time, t      =   t o , . equilibrium prices are
                                            - .. established for the current and contingent
future delivery of all goods·-and.services.            The rest of history then consists

solely of the unfolding execution of the contingent forward contracts established

at the initial market date.          The second essential feature is that prices are

competitive, market-clearing prices.           This means that at the prevailing set of

market prices demand does not exceed supply for any good, when these demands
                                                                                          -         .   -
and supplies represent notional plans.             Households' notional demands and suppl_:!:e.§.. __ .

are derived from utility maximization subject only to the constraint of the house-

holds'end<?W1?ents e'vaiuatedat parametric market prices.               Firms' notional"demands-ancr-

supplies are derived from profit maximization subject only to the constraint of

the production possibility set, with all planned sales and purchases evaluated

at parametric market prices.          All economic agents act as if, at the prevailing

market prices, they can buy or sell any amount of any good or service.                   The

demands and supplies derived under these conditions are consistent.
                                     -47-


    A non-Walrasian economy, by contrast, is a sequence economy--one in which

transactions take place at different dates (see Hahn[1973]).       Prices for all

contingent future goods and services are not established once-and-for-all,

in some initial market period.   Markets are incomplete and "reopen," either

continuously or at discrete intervals.      The overlapping generations model of

Section III is therefore, according to this definition, a non-Walrasian economy.

Forward contracts between those living today and the unborn are not feasible.

Markets are therefore incomplete.   The factor markets that do exist reopen

each period.   In models with uncertainty and imperfect, asymmetric information

other "natural" reasons can be found for the nonexistence of certain markets,

such as moral hazard and adverse selection.     The overlapping generations model

maintains the second of the two essential Walrasian features.       The incomplete set

of markets is always in momentary competitive general equilibrium.       No 'potential

buyer or seller is rationed in any market or needs to consider any information

other than the known set of parametric market prices and his endowment or

technology set.

     In this section, I shall briefly review some of the issues surrounding

stabilization policy in sequence economies when information. is incomplete and

when market prices are not automatically and instantaneously established at

the values that balance notional demands and supplies.      For simplicity I shall

limit the analysis to the consideration      of monetary policy.   All sources of

monetary non-neutrality considered in Sections II and III are suppressed.       This

includes effects on capital formation via the real rate of return on money and

wealth effects due to the presence of nominally denominated interest-bearing

public debt.

Sticky nominal prices and real effects of deterministic monetary
feedback rules

     It is well-known that if a market is inefficient, in the sense that the

market price does not fully reflect all available information, pure nominal

shocks and disturbances, including anticipated changes in the money stock,

will have real effects.    The simple textbook IS-LMmode1 with its exogenously

fixed money wage and money price level is the best-known example.       With the

general price level given exogenously, an increase in the nominal stock of

money represents an equal proportional increase in the real stock of money

balances.   By lowering the   inter~st   rate and/or via the Pigou effect this

will alter real effective demand.     It may seem plausible to locate such inef-

ficiences primarily in the goods and factor markets, while treating the

financial markets as efficient, with financial asset prices or rates of return

always adjusting instantaneously to new information about current or anticipated

future events, so as to maintain equilibrium between demand and supply.          Interestingly,
                                                             -
someof the recent work by Stiglitz on non-market-c1earing equilibria and

the micro-foundations of price and wage-stickiness dealt with financial markets

(Stig1itz[1979]).   Imperfect, costly and asymmetric information characterize

personal and corporate credit markets and insurance markets as much as the

labor market, the housing market or the market in second-hand cars.       Work on

this subject by Arker10f [1970], Stiglitz [1979], Grossman [1976], Salop [1978],

Wilson [1979] and others shows how privately rational, optimizing behavior can

result in socially inefficient, quantity-constrained equilibria in which market

prices are "sticky" in the sense that they do not always respond to the existence of

excess demand or supply.      The simple linear stochastic model described below

imposes price rigidity, without explicitly deriving it, as Stiglitz has done,

as the [momentary] eaui1ibrium outcome of a process generated by optimizing

economic agents.          It is therefore ad hoc.     The assumption of instantaneous

and continuous competitive equilibrium, however, is equally ad hoc unless the

process is specified through which this miracle of coordination is achieved.

It is not enough to assert that all feasible trades that are to the perceived

mutual advantage of the exchanging parties must be exhausted.                 What :needs to

be explained is how the price vector always assumes a value that renders

feasible, in the aggregate, actions that appear feasible at the micro-level when

each agent acts competitively.             The micro-foundations of competitive market

clearing are not yet well developed.             Essential ingredients are large numbers

of potential buyers and sellers, specialized middlemen or brokers, easy

identification of the relevant economic characteristics of the commodity in

question and other fundamental components of market structure such as the laws,

rules and regulations governing the exchange of property rights over the

commodity.

Equation IV.1 is a version of the "Lucas supply function."                Deviations of out-

put from its natural level are possible if and only if the equilibrium price

level is different from the price level expected, last period, to prevail this

period.        Equation IV.2 models sluggish adjustment of the actual price level to

the equilibrium price level.              Only if 8=1, i.e., only if adjustment is instan-

taneous, do we have the strict "surprise supply function" according to which

the only source of departures of actual output from its natural level is a

price forecast error.l&/            Equation IV.3 models effective demand as an increasing

function of the stock of real money balances and a white noise demand dis-

turbance.       Equation IV.5 models capacity output as a constant plus a random

supply disturbance.            Equation IV.6 asserts that the current price level is

not observable.        Instead, private agents observe x ' which is the true price

          Two propositions emerge.              First, as long as the price level is not completely

inflexible (13)0), an unanticipated increase in the money supply will have a

 larger effect on real output than an anticipated increase in the money supply.17/
                                            -52-



Second, only if the price level is perfectly flexible (8=1), will anticipated

money supply changes have no effect on real output.              Even then, unanticipated

monetary disturbances will continue to have real effects.

     Except for the recent papers by Stiglitz et al. most of the theoretical

work on wage and price rigidity can be characterized as [implicit] contract

theory     (Azariadis [1975], Baily [1974], Grossman [1978], Fischer [1977],

Phelps and Taylor [1977]).       Multi-period employment contracts are viewed as

mutually privately rational arrangements for shifting risk from risk-averse

workers to risk-neutral or less risk-averse capitalists.               Similarly, multi-

period price contracts between well established suppliers and customers can be

viewed as transactions and search cost minimizing as well as risk-sharing arrange-

ments (Okun [1975]).     What is not clear is why optimal multi-period contracts

would set (i.e., predetermine) nominal wages or prices, thus assigning the role

of shock absorbers solely to quantities (employment and sales) (Barro [1979]).

A recent attempt to overcome some of the shortcomings of contract theory was made by

Hall [1979], who rationalizes wage and price stickiness by developing a theory

of the role of "prevailing prices and wages" in the efficient organization of

markets.

     If prices can adjust to clear markets with the same frequency with which

new information accrues and with the same speed with which the monetary

authority can respond to any new information, monetary policy will enter the
                                                           ex>     i

i.e., via a series of one-period ahead forecast errors.                With multi-period

nominal contracts monetary policy will enter the reduced form for real output

via a term like .L

and prices are determined by a series of overlapping multi-period nominal

contracts and if the nominal money stock can be adjusted freely each period,

the information set available at the time of the current money supply decision

will in general be larger than the information sets that were available when most of

the currently prevailing money prices and wages were contracted for.                The

public sector does not have an informational advantage over the private sector

at any moment of time, but only the public agent is able to change his control--

the money supply--in response to any new information.              Private agents are

"locked in" by past nominal contracts.             Given this differential ability to

respond to new information, monetary policy can be used to stabilize (or

destabilize) real output.

Differential information between the private
and public sectors

        Equations IV.8 and IV.9 make it clear that sluggishness in the adjustment

of prices can be a sufficient reason for anticipated money supply changes to

have real effects.       Asymmetric information          between the private sector and
                                                   .                                 .-
the monetary authorities can be another reason for effective               monetaryp~l~cy, gy~n


if the price level is market-clearing (Barro[1976]).              It is not necessary for

the public sector to have uniformly superior. information.                All that is required

is that different agents have differential access to (and ability to process

and assimilate) different kinds of information.             Let   Wt be   the information

set of the monetary authority in period t.             m will be some function, T , of
                                                        t                        t

        The response        of real output to monetary policy in the equilibrium model

depends on the monetary policy rule, T , on the monetary authority's informa-

tion set $t and on the private sector's information set $t-l' as well as ~n the

structural parameters ~ and y.            In period t-l, the private sector must fore-

cast the value of the money supply in period t.            To do so it must know, or

predict, both the policy rule, T and the public sector's information set $t·

If the policy rule next period is known, and if the public and private sector

information sets are identical, $t = $t' the problem is easily solved.              The

real effect of monetary policy will be an increasing function of Tt$t              -E(Tt<Ptl<p~_l)·
This expression will be orthogonal to (independent of) 't_l~The con-

ditional distribution function of Yt , given 't-l' is therefore independent

of the policy function Tt as long as this function is known and the infor-

mation sets of the private sector and the monetary authorities coincide.

function of Yt is of course not independent of T t , even if the public

and private information sets "'t and 't are otherwise the same.            Important

and unsettled issues arise when informational asymmetries occur.             Can the

public sector communicate its "privileged" information to the private

sector?       If so, are there lags and/or filtering problems as public sector

information is disseminated?             Is it better to reveal privileged information

 (assuming this is possible) than to usefthe informational advantage to

influence real private sector behavior?

            Changing the Structure of Private Sector Information

     In a set of recent papers, Laurence Weiss [1979 a,b] has provided

another ingeneous argument for a role for active (feedback) monetary

policy in rational expectations models.            This role exists even if the

information sets of the private and public sectors are identical.            Let    ~t


be the original private and public information set, expressed as a finite-

dimensional vector.          Let 0t be the set of all information that could

be relevant.        ~t   is some subset of at.   We will write it as a linear

transformation L of at:

     ~t =    LOt·

We can, without loss of generality, assume L to be of full rank, although

it will not in general be a square matrix.            Since the public sector does

not hold an informational advantage over the private sector, it cannot

add or create additional private information, i.e., it cannot change the

rank of the matrix L.          It can, however, through feedback policy, change

the matrix L to a matrix L' that has the same rank but conveys information

that has a different economic impact.            An example will illustrate this.

Consider a decentralized competitive economy with many separated markets.

In any given period a trader is randomly assigned to a given market.

His demand or supply decision will depend on the relationship between

the current price in his own market and the average price expected to

prevail in the next period when he will be reassigned randomly to another

market.     All he observes in the current period is the price in his market.

There are two disturbances, an aggregate nominal disturbance common to

all markets, nt' and a market-specific real -dis~~rb~~~;, u~ in the ith

market, i=l, •••• ,n.         The trader in market i only observes some linear

combination of those two disturbances:

                                            The L matrix of a trader in market i

is   [Ai,   0, •••• ,   Ai, .... O]'   and has rank one.   Only the relative, real

                The Insufficiency of Prices in Sequence Economies With
                     Incomplete Markets and rational Expectations

       There is an implication of the rational expectations approach that

seems to have been overlooked by its advocates.               One of the major virtues

of a market system is supposed to be the role played by prices determined

in efficient markets as effective aggregators of information.               Decentralized,

atomistic private agents need not worry about the myriad of other agents,

about their tastes, technologies and endowments.               All information necessary

for the optimal planning of consumption, production and sales is contained

in current market prices that are parametric to the individual agent.                  If
                                       -57-



markets are incomplete and expectations of future spot prices replace cur-

rently available prices established in forward markets, rational expecta-

tions are a strong reminder of the insufficiency of the price mechanism

for efficient resource allocation.    Rational expectations are optimal

forecasts based on the forecasting agent's knowledge of the true structure

of the economy.    They require knowledge of the underlying structural para-

meters of public and private sector preferences, technologies and endowments.

The local, partial nature of the knowledge provided by prices in a real-

world market economy with incomplete markets, means that additional global,

economy-wide informational demands are made on private agents with rational

expectations.     Such informational demands are often dismissed as unrealistic

when central planning is discussed.     The informational requirements of

central planning are no different from the informational requirements of

"decentralized" rational expectations models of sequence economies with

incomplete markets.


                          v.   Conclusion

     The "New Classical Macroeconomics" has           forced a thorough reval-

uation of the theoretical and empirical foundations of           Neo-Keynesian

conventional wisdom.    After the rhetoric    ~s   stripped away, how-

ever, the analytical implications of the New Classical Macroeconomics are

surprisingly familar to neo-Keynesians.       Substitution of debt financing

for tax financing crowds out saving in the short run and lowers the capital-

labor ratio in the long run.     A higher, fully anticipated rate of growth

of the money supply will not be super-neutral and is likely cet. par. to be
                                     -58-




associated with a higher steady state capital-labor ratio.   Monetary feed-

back rules will alter the trajectories of real economic variables.   This

confirmation of the importance of monetary, fiscal and financial policy

for the cyclical and the long-run behavior of the real economy is not neces-

sarily a source of comfort.   After all, "policy neutrality" would be most

welcome when the conduct of policy is erratic, confusing or incompetent.

No such easy escape is available to the policy maker; policy can stabilize

and it can destabilize, it can promote growth and prosperity or destroy it.

FOOTNOTES


  1/   Government capital formation is ignored for simplicity.

  2/ Since labor supply and consumption decisions are jointly determined
by-the household's intertemporal utility maximization program, the consump-
tion function and labor supply function should have the same arguments.
Choosing the more standard (ad hoc) specifications of equations 11.3 and
11.13 does not affect the argument.

  1/   Depreciation is ignored.

  4/ This neutrality proposition can be interpreted in one of the two
following ways. (a) Compare the solution trajectories for two economies,
identical in all respects except that the nominal stock of money in country
2 M2 (t) exceeds that in country 1, Ml(t) by a fixed fraction: M2 (t) =
M1(t)(1+a), a > O~ for all t. In economy 2 the equilibrium solutions for
the price level p (t) and the money wage, w2 (t), will ~xceed those in
c~untry 1, pl(tl and wl(t), by the same fraction a. p (t) = (l+a) pl(t);
w (t) = (l+a) w (t). All real variables are the same. (b) Consider the
solution trajectory of a given economy before and after an unanticipated
change in the money supply at t=T. Let the money supply up to T be Ml(t).
Until t=T, economic agents expect the money supply to follow Ml(t) inde-
fintely into the future. At T the actual and anticipated money supply
path becomes MZ(t) = Ml(t)(l+a), a > 0 for t ~ T. If there is this
unancipated chang at t = T in the money stock process, the price level
                  2
path after T is p (t) = (l+a)p!(t), t ~ T. Here p!(t) is the price level
path that would have prevailed at and beyond t=T, had no unanticipated
change in the money supply occurred at t=T.

  5/   I abstract for simplicity from the wealth effect   and real interest
rate   effect on the labor supply.

  6/    u is ~ssumed to be strictly quasiconcave and increasing in c l and
cZ~    ul(O,c ) = uz(cl,O) = +~, ul(~,c2) = uz(cl,~) = O.

  I/   We also assume fICO) = + m; f'(m) = 0

   8/ A solution will exist if c l and c Z are both normal goods and if
 l
c - does not increase when r t + l increases. It will be unique if the
utility function is homothetic. See Carmichael (1979).

  9/ TI1is is different from Carmichael (1979) who considers the case where
an-individual only ignores the impact of marginal changes in his actions on
generations that are already dead, i.e. Carmichael uses a closed-loop strategy
vis-a-vis all later generations. TI1e symmetry imposed in my specification
considerably simplifies _the--analys?-~-: -. -

 10/   From III.43a we have, in the steady state,               aw =   (l+r)   aw
                                                               -acl            -ac2
                                                               W = u(c l ,c 2 )
                                                                   l-(l+o)-l_(l+P)-l

 11/   We use the condition          po    >   1, for the stationary utility function to be
bounded.

 12/   We assume p to be the same in both cases.

 13/   We assume 0 to be the same in both cases.

 14/   Since f' (k) > 0, this means that ~>O is inconsistent with money being
held in equilibrium.                      p

 15/   We already make the assumption (explicit in III.53c) that both money and
capital are held and that the private saver will get the same rate of return on
his saving, no matter how he divides it between money and real capital.

 16/   Equation IV.2 is only reasonable in an economy without an inflationary or
deflationary trend. If there is a trend in the price level (but not in the rate
of inflation), IV.2 can be modified to:

       (Pt-Pt-l) - (Pt-l-Pt-2) = B(p*t-P t-l-(Pt-l- P t-2»
 17/   TI1is is not a general property of rational expectations models. Bailey
(1978) provides examples of anticipated fiscal policy having greater "bang per
buck" than unanticipated fiscal policy.
