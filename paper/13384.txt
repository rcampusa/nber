This paper estimates the effects of maternal malnutrition exploiting the 1959-1961 Chinese famine
as a natural experiment. In the 1% sample of the 2000 Chinese Census, we find that fetal exposure
to acute maternal malnutrition had compromised a range of socioeconomic outcomes, including: literacy,
labor market status, wealth and marriage market outcomes. Women married spouses with less education
and later, as did men, if at all. In addition, maternal malnutrition reduced the sex ratio (males to females)
in two generations -- those prenatally exposed and their children -- presumably through heightened
male mortality. This tendency toward female offspring is interpretable in light of the Trivers-Willard
(1973) hypothesis, according to which parents in poor condition should skew the offspring sex ratio
toward daughters. Hong Kong natality micro data from 1984-2004 further confirm this pattern of female
offspring among mainland-born residents exposed to malnutrition in utero.

1     Introduction

China’s Great Leap Forward caused the worst famine in recorded history,

with between 16.5 and 30 million deaths [Li and Yang, 2005]. Some 40

years on, the famine’s 1960 peak provides a natural experiment for evalu-

ating the long-term effects of fetal nutrition.

    Focus on the prenatal period is motivated by a growing literature sug-

gesting that health in adulthood may be “programmed” in utero, a linkage

popularized by Barker [1992]. The prevalence of maternal malnutrition in

developing countries (e.g., DeRose et al. [2000]) makes this a relation-

ship of continuing relevance. That socioeconomic outcomes respond to

fetal health – as our results will indicate – may help explain the strong

correlation between health and socioeconomic outcomes apparent at both

the individual and national levels [Case et al., 2002, Cutler et al., 2006].

Improvements in fetal nutrition, therefore, may offer the twin benefits of

improving future health and economic outcomes.

    Evidence on the causal effects of fetal nutrition, however, is surpris-

ingly scarce (see e.g., Rasmussen [2001], Walker et al. [2007]). The Chinese

famine (henceforth the Famine) reduces the scope for omitted factors (e.g.,

parental abilities) that might generate positive associations between mea-

sures of fetal health and adult socioeconomic outcomes in the absence of

a causal pathway.

    Observing cohorts born 1956-64 in the 2000 Chinese Population Cen-

sus, we find that men were 9% more likely to be illiterate, 6% less likely to

work, and 6.5% less likely to be married if exposed to the Famine in utero.

Women were 7.5% more likely to be illiterate and 3% less likely to work,

                                      3
and tended to marry men with less education. We also find fetal exposure

to the Famine substantially reduced the cohort’s sex ratio (fewer males),

suggesting greater male vulnerability to maternal malnutrition. Perhaps

most intriguing, we find an “echo effect” of the Famine on the next gen-

eration: children whose mothers were exposed prenatally also registered

Famine impacts. In particular, Famine-exposed mothers were more likely

to give birth to daughters. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to

trace the offspring sex ratio to the in utero environment of the parent.

   While comparisons within a narrow birth interval (1956-64) help re-

duce the potential for confounding, our “control” groups were not un-

touched by the Famine: the older cohorts experienced it directly as in-

fants and toddlers and the younger cohorts were the children of Famine

survivors. Moreover, both rural and urban residents experienced famine.

The difficulty in finding a suitable control group motivates two additional

approaches. First, we utilize variation in Famine severity by province

to generate comparisons within birth cohorts. Second, while the Famine

was endemic in mainland China, Hong Kong, then a British colony, was

spared. The Famine resulted in a large inflow of mainland Chinese into

Hong Kong. Since Hong Kong Natality data include information on the

birth place of the parents, we can compare mainland born and Hong Kong

born mothers in these data. Results from these two additional approaches

corroborate the findings in the Census data: damage to a broad spectrum

of outcomes persists 40 years after the Famine’s end.

   The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sections 1.1-1.3

describe the background of the Famine and review the previous Famine

literature. Section 2 describes the 2000 Chinese Population Census and

the 1984-2004 Hong Kong Natality files. Section 3 reports descriptive and

regression results, along with a discussion of potential biases. Section 4

concludes.



1.1       Famine background

The Famine began in the fall of 1959 and impacted all regions of China.

Grain output dropped 15% in 1959 and another 15% in 1960 [Li and Yang,

2005, page 846]. By 1962, birth and death rates had returned to normal

levels.

    While weather conditions contributed to the Famine, the radical eco-

nomic policies of the Great Leap Forward were chiefly to blame [Lin,

1990, Li and Yang, 2005]. In a breakneck attempt to overtake Britain

and eventually the U.S., labor was diverted from agriculture to industry

while grain procurement from rural areas was increased. At the same

time, collectivization of agricultural production resulted in shirking and

falling productivity [Lin, 1990]. The political climate encouraged provin-

cial leaders to overstate grain production. Despite widespread starvation,

China was a net exporter of grain throughout 1960 [Yao, 1999, Lin and

Yang, 2000].

    Famine intensity varied by region [Peng, 1987]. Rural death rates rose

to 2.5 times pre-Famine levels. Urban residents fared better but were not

spared, death rates in the peak year 1960 were 80% above pre-Famine

levels [China Statistical Press, 2000]. Central provinces such as Anhui,

Henan and Sichuan were the worst hit, while northeastern provinces such


                                    5
as Heilongjiang and Jilin were relatively spared. By 1961, death rates had

returned to normal in more than half of the provinces, but remained high

in, for instance, the southern provinces Guangxi and Guizhou (close to

Hong Kong).



1.2      Famine studies: Epidemiology

The best epidemiological evidence to date linking maternal nutritional

deprivation to subsequent adult outcomes derives from the cohort in utero

during the 1944-45 Dutch famine. While the seminal study found limited

effects at age 18 [Stein et al., 1975], at middle age, this cohort exhibited

a broad spectrum of damage including: self-reported health [Roseboom

et al., 2001b], coronary heart disease morbidity [Roseboom et al., 2001b,

Bleker et al., 2005], and adult antisocial personality disorders [Neugebauer

et al., 1999]. These, and studies of the 1866-1868 Finnish Famine and the

Nazi Seige of Leningrad, have focused exclusively on health outcomes.

Epidemiological findings from the Chinese Famine include heightened risk

of schizophrenia [Clair et al., 2005] and obesity among women [Luo et al.,

2006].



1.3      Famine studies: Economics

A number of recent studies evaluating the Famine’s impact on the socioe-

conomic outcomes of survivors have used the China Health and Nutrition

Surveys (CHNS) [Chen and Zhou, 2007, Meng and Qian, 2006, Gorgens

et al., 2005]. The CHNS is a panel dataset that began in 1989 of health and

economic outcomes of approximately 4,000 Chinese households from nine

                                     6
provinces (out of 31 provinces or province level administrative regions).

The small sample size combined with the collapse of fertility during the

Famine necessitates the inclusion of ages well after birth as “treated.”1

However, broad “early childhood” hypotheses makes it difficult to reject

alternative explanations. The possibility then that events at other ages –

for instance the subsequent Cultural Revolution and the forced “rustifica-

tion” of students in outlying areas – confounds results is a concern.

       Chen and Zhou [2007] considered those up to age 6 as treated. They

proxied Famine intensity by the province level death rate in 1960 and found

the Famine thus measured to have resulted in stunting of those born in

1955, 1957, 1959, 1960 and 1962, with the largest height reductions for the

1959, 1960, and 1962 birth cohorts. In an analogous specification, they

found reduced labor supply of those born in 1959 and 1960, and lower

wealth as measured by the size of residence for birth cohorts 1958 and

1959.

       Meng and Qian [2006] considered the following birth cohorts as po-

tentially affected: 1952-54, 1955-58, 1959-60, with cohorts born 1961-64

as the reference group. Using reductions in cohort size as a proxy for

Famine severity (assumed to occur through Famine mortality), their OLS

estimation returned mixed results, and little evidence for a particularly

strong effect for the 1959-60 cohort. Instrumenting for cohort size, using

per capita grain production in 1997, they found a small negative effects

on education, but a substantial (25%) reduction in hours worked for the
   1
       105 rural CHNS respondents and 62 urban CHNS respondents were born in 1960,

with 66 and 45 respectively in 1961 [Chen and Zhou, 2007] table 2.




                                         7
1959-60 cohort.

        Gorgens et al. [2005] studied adult heights of cohorts exposed to the

Famine in childhood using the CHNS data. They argued both that chil-

dren who survived the Famine did not show any stunting and that stunting

did occur. They reconcile these two arguments by a third: Famine mor-

tality was concentrated among shorter people. The net effect of stunting

and selection, the authors argued, made the height of survivors appear un-

changed. However, the claim that no stunting is observed among survivors

is controversial [Chen and Zhou, 2007, Yan, 1999, Morgan, 2006].



2         Data

Our primary data set is 2000 Population Census of China.2 The 1% sample

includes more than 11 million records and has not (to our knowledge)

been used to evaluate long-term effects of the Famine.3 Outcomes include

educational attainment, labor market status, and residence information

of respondents. Demographic information includes sex, birth year and

month, marriage and fertility information.

        Unlike preceding Census surveys and the CHNS data, the 2000 Census

records the province of birth, eliminating the potential for confounding due

to internal migration.4 The 2000 Census captures Famine cohorts near age

40, and therefore near the flat portion of their occupation and earnings
    2
      Conducted by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics for mainland China.
    3
      Shi [2006] used a 0.1% sub-sample of the 2000 Census.
    4
      6% of those born 1956-64 reported moving from another province since birth, with

another 10% relocating towns within the province of birth.

profile. Moreover, it is the first Census to capture near-complete fertility

histories of women born during the Famine.5 We restrict analysis to those

born 1956-1964, a sub-sample which includes three pre-Famine years and

three post-Famine years (Death rates peaked in 1960 but were elevated in

1959 and 1961 as well, see Figure 1). Our relatively narrow birth interval

is intended to increase the similarity of the unobserved, later-life factors

and their effects on Census outcomes.

      Our second data source is the natality microdata for Hong Kong (1984-

2004), derived from the universe of birth certificates. These data include

information on maternal country of birth. Restricting the sample to moth-

ers of singletons either born in mainland China or Hong Kong in the years

1957-1965 yields some 600,000 records, approximately one-third of whom

emigrated from the mainland. The Hong Kong data provide an important

control group since all of mainland China (rural and urban) was afflicted

by the Famine [Cai and Feng, 2005].



2.1      Measuring the Famine

We use two measures of famine intensity: death rates and average month

of birth.


Death rates We use the all-age death rate [China Statistical Press, 2000]

        by year and province to calculate two (mortality-based) proxies of

        Famine intensity. We have data for 29 out of the 31 provinces (or

        province level divisions).
  5
      .3% of women born in 1960 reported having a child between November 1999 and

October 2000, versus 14.8% for women born in 1976 (the maximum).


                                        9
           • First, for every person, we calculate the weighted average of

              the death rate in the province of birth for the duration of the

              fetal period, henceforth “weighted death rate” or wdrjt . For

              example, a person born in January 1960 in Beijing is assigned

              1/9th of Beijing’s 1960’s mortality rate and 8/9th of Beijing’s

              1959’s mortality rate. This weighted death rate ranged from

              0.005 to 0.069 (per person).

           • Second, we collapse this weighted death rate by month of birth,

              thus calculating a population weighted national average for

              each month and year, henceforth “aggregate weighted death

              rate” or awdrt . During the study period, this measure ranged

              from 0.010 (in 1963) to 0.022 (at the end of 1960), a difference

              of 0.012. Thus measured, those born towards the end of 1960,

              and early 1961, were exposed to the greatest Famine intensity

              in utero, Figure 1.


Average month of birth Famines tend to be most severe during the

        winter months. In the northern hemisphere, this reduces fertility

        disproportionately in the later half of the calendar year, thereby

        lowering the average month of birth [Stein et al., 1975].6 This proxy

        applied to the 2000 Census indicates 1960 was the worst year for

        mainland China, Figure 2 (i.e. consistent with the mortality data).

        Because emigrants to Hong Kong were a highly selected group, both

        geographically (the Famine hit bordering provinces later) and due

        to the particular migration policies in place (further described in
  6
      Authors’ tabulation of appendix table 4 data in Stein et al. [1975].


                                            10
      Section 3.5), we cannot rely on mainland mortality data in the Hong

      Kong analysis. To obtain a proxy for when the Famine peaked for

      this group of immigrants, we use average month of birth. This proxy

      indicates 1961 as the worst Famine year for Hong Kong mothers born

      on the mainland, Figure 3. As expected of the “control group,” there

      was no corresponding change for Hong Kong natives, Figure 4.



3     Results

3.1    Descriptive Results

We begin by presenting unadjusted outcomes by quarter of birth (for all

Chinese) in the four panels of Figure 5. These figures indicate that those

born around 1960 had worse socio-economic outcomes than the cohort

trend would predict. Recall that this cohort was in utero during the

period with the highest death rate, as measured by the weighted death

rate (Figure 1). In 2000, the 1960 birth cohort was more likely to be: (1)

not working at the time of the Census; (2) supported by other household

members; (3) living in a smaller home and; (4) parents of female children.

For some of these outcomes, departures from the cohort trend appear in

the flanking/adjacent cohorts as well. This corresponds to the 1959-1961

duration of the Famine, with a peak in 1960.




                                   11
3.2        Regression Results

To investigate systematically how adult outcomes vary with prenatal Famine

exposure, we focus on the cohorts born 1956-1964 and estimate by OLS:


 yit = β0 + θ · awdrt + β1 · YOB + β2 · YOB2 + β3 · YOB3 + λprovince + εit , (1)


where yit denotes the outcome for individual i born in period t, awdrt

denotes the aggregate weighted death rate by birth year and month of

birth t,7 and YOB denotes birth year. We enter YOB as a cubic to control

for the non-linear cohort/age effects apparent in the four panels of Figure

5. Finally, we include a vector of province dummies, λprovince . Thus (1)

allows for a flexible cohort profile within a narrowly-defined birth inter-

val, and assesses whether the prenatal death rate contributes additional

explanatory power, as reflected by θ̂. We estimate equation (1) separately

for men and women. We do not include dummies for the month of birth,

given its apparent endogeneity in Figure 2.8

       Results from estimating (1) for 2000 Census outcomes are reported in

Tables 1-3. Table 1 shows a consistent, negative effect of prenatal Famine

exposure on labor market outcomes. Greater famine intensity is associ-

ated with a higher likelihood of being illiterate and not working. Dur-

ing the Famine, awdr increased by 1.2 percentage points, implying, e.g.,

that the most Famine exposed cohorts were 7.5% (0.5052×0.012/0.081)

[women] and 9% (0.1585×0.012/0.021) [men] more likely to be illiterate;

3% (0.4714×0.012/0.189) [women] and 5.9% (0.4017×0.012/0.082) [men]
   7
       See Section 2.1.
   8
       Inclusions of month of birth dummies does not alter the basic results from esti-

mating (1) and (2).


                                           12
more likely to not work; and 13% (0.0448×0.012/0.004) [women] more

likely to be disabled. Men in utero during Famine were 9% more likely

to be supported financially by other household members (“Dependent”),

and women were 4% more likely to be supported.

      The census does not have any direct measure of earnings, but there

is information on housing, which may serve as a proxy for income and

wealth. Thus measured, greater fetal Famine exposure also reduced adult

economic status.

      We also estimate equation (1) using the marriage market variables as

outcomes (Table 2). While marriage was nearly universal for women, in-

spection of who they married reveals that Famine exposed women married

men with less education. For men, both the extensive and intensive mar-

gins were affected. Men were 6.5% (0.4902×0.012/0.09) more likely to be

unmarried and were 8.2% (0.2676×0.012/0.039) more likely to have never

married. Moreover, they married at older ages (1.5 months) and were 0.7

% (0.5145×0.012/0.87) less likely to head their households.

      The poor outcomes we find on the marriage market do not appear to

be driven by conventional supply and demand factors. As cohorts born

during the Famine were substantially smaller,9 the “marriage squeeze”

tended to work in their favor. Using the CHNS, 1982 survey, and 1982

Census data, Porter [2007] finds the “marriage market sex ratio” bottomed

out for the 1961 or 1962 birth cohorts (depending on the age-distribution of

potential spouses assumed) suggesting poor marital outcomes for women
  9
      For both men and women, the three smallest cohorts 1950-1970 were those born

1959-1961.




                                        13
born in these years. But in the 2000 Census, women born in 1960 were the

least likely to be married of any cohort born 1956 to 1970, timing more

consistent with “fetal origins”. For men, marriage rates were reduced for

the 1958 and 1960 birth cohorts (results available from authors). While

the low marriage rates for the 1958 cohort of men may be attributable

to the small number of girls born in the following years (see figure 4 in

Porter [2007]), the 1960 decrease in marriage rates is more consistent with

a “fetal origins” explanation.10

       Prenatal famine exposure also raised male (relative to female) mortal-

ity as evidenced by survival around age 40. The most exposed cohort was

1.5%-age points (1.3147×0.012) more female (Table 3, column 1). The

most striking finding, however, is that prenatally exposed women bore

more girls, the offspring of the most Famine exposed were 0.4%-age points

(0.3194×0.012) less male (column 2).11 To anticipate results, the Hong

Kong data (derived from birth certificates) will corroborate this pattern.



3.3        Geographic variation in Famine intensity

The second test of our hypothesis isolates the geographic variation in the

Famine and makes comparisons exclusively within annual birth cohorts.

This approach reduces the potential for confounding from later-life events

with age-specific effects (e.g. if the Cultural Revolution, launched in 1966,
  10
       Poor marriage outcomes for the 1960 birth cohort also correspond to regional

variation in Famine severity (see Section 3.3); adding cohort size as a control to equation

(2) does not substantially affect our estimates.
  11
     Similar results are obtained when the logit transform of the proportion of male

delayed school entry among six-year olds). Here, confounding by such

later-life events would require their geographic variation to mirror the

Famine (while also replicating the Famine’s cohort effects). We estimate

by OLS:



               yitj = β0 + θ · wdrtj + γyob + λprovince + εitj ,         (2)

where θ is the parameter of interest, t denotes year and month of birth

and j the province of birth. The mortality rate is the weighted death

rate (wdrjt ) previously described for the individual’s birth date (year and

month) and province of birth. As in equation (1), we include vectors

of province of birth dummies (λprovince ), and, as the goal is to isolate

the geographic variation in health induced by the Famine, we absorb the

average differences for each birth year by including a vector of year of

birth dummies (γyob ).

   Results from estimating (2) provide qualitatively distinct evidence that

regional differences in malnutrition impact outcomes in adulthood (Tables

4-6). Table 4 shows that local famine severity indeed corresponds to the

magnitude of damage in Census outcomes. Women born in high-Famine

areas had larger increases in disability rates and larger reductions in house

sizes. For men, differences in literacy, work status, disability, and house

size correspond to Famine severity in the expected direction.

   The magnitude of damage obtained from estimating (2) is generally ei-

ther similar to that found with (1), or somewhat smaller. Famine-exposed

women were again about 13% (0.049×0.012/0.004) more likely to be dis-

abled, and the corresponding figure for men was 12% (0.049×0.012/0.006).


                                      15
As for housing, the Famine is estimated to reduce the residence size by

slightly under 1 square meter (58.95×.012), with a similar effect for men.

For men, illiteracy increased 7% and the likelihood of not working in-

creased 2.4%.

   Again, men from high-Famine areas were less likely to be married

(3.5%), more likely to never have married (5%), married older (.8 months),

and were less likely to head their households (.7%) (Table 5). For women,

the point estimates have the expected signs, but are not statistically sig-

nificant. Finally, Table 6 shows that coefficients for the sex ratio are

significant in the expected direction, but roughly one-third the size of the

corresponding estimates in Table 3.


Rural versus urban We also estimate the above models separately for

those born in rural versus urban regions. We find a Famine effect on the

labor and marriage market outcomes for both areas, although the effects

for the rural sample were larger (presumably reflecting the greater severity

of the Famine in rural areas). For both rural and urban areas, we find

that the Famine reduced the sex ratio of the in utero cohort and again in

the next generation (results available from authors).


Province of residence Finally, we note that estimates reported in Ta-

bles 1-6 are essentially unchanged when fixed effects for the 2000 province

of residence are included along with the province of birth dummies.




                                    16
3.4    Potential Biases

As the Famine both raised mortality and reduced fertility, Famine co-

horts were approximately 25-50% smaller than neighboring cohorts in the

2000 Census. To the extent that Famine-induced mortality was nega-

tively selective, as would seem most plausible (especially insofar as health

is concerned), estimates of damage to survivors are downward biased.

   Negative selection into fertility is a greater potential concern, since this

could generate the appearance of effects absent any true damage (i.e., up-

ward bias). However, historical evidence suggests that the Famine, unlike

the subsequent Cultural Revolution, hit poorer individuals the hardest

(see, e.g., Cai and Feng [2005]). The Dutch Famine provides further ev-

idence: fathers of children conceived in the winter of 1944-45 were more

likely to have non-manual occupations [Stein et al., 1975].

   Direct evidence on selection into fertility is available from the China

Fertility surveys (conducted in 1985 and 1988), which include information

on the respondent’s mother’s educational attainment (further information

in the Appendix). Plotting the share of women whose mothers had no

education, primary or less, secondary or more, or who did not know their

mother’s education, the 1959-61 birth cohorts do not appear any worse

than adjacent cohorts (Figure 6). If anything, the 1959-61 birth cohorts

had mothers with more education than adjacent cohorts.

   Cohorts born during 1962 to 1964 did not directly experience the

Famine, and in this respect may constitute a better control group for the

Famine exposed cohorts than those born in the 1950s (who were exposed

to higher mortality rates and malnutrition in childhood). Re-estimating


                                     17
equations (1) and (2) on the sample restricted to birth cohorts 1959-1964,

we obtain similar, if not slightly stronger, results (available on request).

       Another possible source of bias is that those born during famines may

be born to inherently more fecund women or parents who have a stronger

desire for many offspring, and possibly, less interest in the quality of

each individual child. Whereas we cannot control for parental preferences

(other than note as above, that the maternal education of the Famine

cohorts was if anything better than that of adjacent cohorts), we can

investigate sibship size using a recent survey: The 2005 Urban Chinese

Education and Labor Survey conducted by the Ministry of Education in

12 cities in China, covering some 10,000 households.12 The 1959-61 co-

horts do not appear to have more siblings, as seen in Figure 7. Rather,

these birth cohorts are on a negative trend (linear and decreasing in year

of birth).13



3.5        Birth Outcomes in Hong Kong

A shortcoming of the analysis using the 2000 (mainland) Census is the

want of a truly unexposed control group. Hong Kong Natality data offer a

potential solution to this problem. Communist China severely restricted
  12
       The 2000 census does not have information on sibship size. Neither can it be

inferred from the relationship variable for a household, since most adult siblings live

in different households. Finally, the earliest publicly available Chinese census was

conducted in 1982, when the 1959-1961 cohorts were in their early 20s.
  13
     This is confirmed by a regression of sibsize on a dummy for birth cohorts 1959-61,

controlling for a linear trend in birth year. The coefficient on this dummy is about

zero, with a very large standard error (not reported).



                                          18
out-migration. This policy was, however, temporarily and dramatically

suspended during a six-week period in the spring of 1962 when a large

number of mainlanders entered Hong Kong [Burns, 1987]. Among the

refugees were mainland born children, who themselves show up as parents

in the 1984-2004 Hong Kong Natality files.

   The migration of mainland residents to Hong Kong, during and in the

years after the Famine, provides a common environment for those affected

by the Famine (mainland immigrants) and those who were not (Hong

Kong born).

   The Hong Kong Natality microdata allow us to focus on second gen-

eration birth outcomes, specifically low birth weight and sex of offspring.

Low birth weight may be a negative outcome because it is a correlate of

poor adult health and economic performance. As for sex of offspring, a

daughter may not be a poor outcome. Still, it may signal poor parental

condition; see Section 4.

   We estimate a modified version of equation (1) separately on the sub

samples of mainland born and Hong Kong born mothers giving birth in

Hong Kong 1984-2004. Based on the dramatically lower average month of

birth among mainland born mothers born in 1961 (Figures 3 and 4), we

substitute the dummy variable I(1961), which takes on the value 1/100

for those born in 1961, for the death rate (awdrt ).

   A dummy for the sex of the child is also included when the dependent

variable is birth weight since males are on average heavier than females.

The birth interval is shifted forward one year from the mainland Cen-

sus regressions, that is, we focus on births to parents themselves born


                                    19
1957-1965. Furthermore, we restrict the sample to singleton births. We

find that mothers born in 1961 were 8% (0.247/0.030) more likely to give

birth to a child of low birth weight (less than 2,500 grams) and 1.2%

(0.00629/0.52) less likely to give birth to a son than mothers born in ad-

jacent years (Table 7). No significant effects were detected for the Hong

Kong born mothers, despite their greater numbers.



4     Summary and Discussion

We have used the 1959-1961 Chinese famine as a natural experiment in

fetal nutrition. Higher Famine intensity – as indicated by time or place of

birth – was associated with greater risk of being illiterate, out of the labor

force, marrying later (men), and marrying spouses with less education

(women). To the extent that selection into childbearing during the Famine

was positive (as maternal education and previous research would suggest),

our estimates of long-term damage are conservative.

    Because the nutritional status of pregnant women continues to lag

other demographic groups in many developing countries, our findings re-

main relevant. In addition, historical nutritional deprivation may impede

adult outcomes today in developed countries. For example, Almond et al.

[2007] found improvements in birth outcomes (including birth weight) with

the introduction of the Food Stamps Program during the 1960s in the U.S.,

particularly among Black infants. These cohorts also manifested improved

outcomes in adulthood [Almond and Chay, 2006].

    Perhaps the most intriguing result is that Famine exposure lowered the



                                     20
sex ratio of not only the first but also the second generation. Prenatally

exposed women were themselves more likely to bear daughters. This pro-

female effect is all the more noteworthy given the well documented preva-

lence of son preference in mainland China. Famine-induced reductions in

the sex ratio are consistent with empirical work finding lower sex ratios

for unmarried or poorly educated mothers [Almond and Edlund]. While

the magnitude of the Famine’s effect on the sex ratio may appear small, it

is several times the larger than that associated with marital status in U.S.

natality data [Almond and Edlund] and is similar to differences between

mothers reporting living with a partner around the time of conception in

survey data and those who did not [Norberg, 2004]. Thus, small changes

in the sex ratio can reflect large differences in maternal circumstance.

   Trivers and Willard [1973] proposed that evolution would favor parental

ability to vary the sex ratio of offspring according to condition: parents in

poor condition would favor daughters and parents in good condition would

favor sons. Their argument was based on the observation that while the

average number of offspring to males and females equalizes (assuming bal-

anced sex ratios), the reproductive success of a male offspring tends to

be more resource-sensitive. Maternal malnutrition has been observed to

correlate with more female births, (see, e.g., Andersson and Bergström

[1998]). Pathways include heightened rates of male fetal deaths, as was

found to be the case during the Dutch famine [Roseboom et al., 2001a].

Another possibility is that starvation affects early cell division of male and

female embryos differentially [Cameron, 2004].

   To our knowledge, ours is the first large scale quasi-experimental evi-


                                     21
dence of a Trivers-Willard effect in human populations. It is also the first

evidence (quasi-experimental or otherwise) of an intergenerational “echo-

effect” of maternal nutritional status on the sex ratio (to our knowledge).

That these changes in the sex ratio parallel larger movements in socioeco-

nomic outcomes suggest the cohort sex ratio as a readily-measured proxy

for maternal conditions prior to birth.

and the municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai. (We have not been able to
access data for Shandong.) In total, some 46,000 ever-married women be-
tween 15-49 years of age were interviewed, providing detailed information
on pregnancy history. These data are available from the Office of Popula-
