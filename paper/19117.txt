                                               ABSTRACT

We introduce the model of asset management developed in Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny (2012)
into a Solow-style neoclassical growth model with diminishing returns to capital. Savers rely on trusted
intermediaries to manage their wealth (claims on capital stock), who can charge fees above costs to
trusting investors. In this model, the size of the financial sector rises with aggregate wealth, and wealth
grows relative to GDP. As a consequence, the ratio of financial income to GDP rises over time, even
though fees for given financial services decline. Because the size of the financial sector fluctuates
with changes in investor trust, the model can account for the sharp decline of finance in the Great Depression,
as well as its slow recovery afterwards. Entry by financial intermediaries as wealth increased in recent
years may have further deepened investor trust and encouraged growth of financial income.

1.Introduction.


        Philippon (2012) documents the astonishing rise of the share of GDP coming from the

financial sector since World War II (Figure 1). Financial income rose from about 2% of the total in

the 1940s to close to 8% at the time of the financial crisis. Philippon and Reshef (2013) document

similar trends in many other developed countries. Greenwood and Scharfstein (2013) show further

that, at least in the last 30 years, much of this rise of finance in the United States comes from

financial services to consumers, especially asset management and credit intermediation of

mortgages and consumer loans.


        The rapid growth of the financial sector has proved difficult to explain.              Perhaps

productivity in finance, as in other services, does not grow as fast as that in other sectors, so we see

a manifestation of the Baumol (1967) disease. However, finance has grown relative to other

services (Philippon and Reshef 2013), and wages in finance have grown faster than in other service

sectors (Philippon and Reshef 2012), inconsistent with this theory. Both Philippon (2012) and

Greenwood and Scharfstein (2013) find the growth of finance puzzling, and are a bit skeptical about

the reasons.


        We present a new model that addresses the evidence on the growth of finance. Ours is a

dynamic Solow-style growth model with a financial sector serving the financial needs of

individuals. The financial sector provides two services to savers. The first is wealth preservation:

financial intermediaries enable investors to preserve their savings for future consumption.         The

second service is access to risky investment opportunities with superior expected return, which

enables wealth to grow over time in expectation. As a byproduct of serving investors, the financial

sector also provides investment resources to firms.


        Our critical assumption is that investors need financial intermediaries to take advantage of

these opportunities. On their own they only utilize highly inefficient self-storage, such as keeping


                                                   2
money in mattresses or in gold. Intermediaries offer savers knowledge of and access to financial

products that they do not have otherwise. In Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny (2012), we refer to the

intermediaries providing such services, be they bankers, brokers, wealth planners, or money

managers, as “money doctors.” Our analogy captures the idea that even though generic investing in

risky assets seems straightforward to economists and finance professors, it actually requires

knowledge and confidence that most savers simply do not have.          We follow Gennaioli et al in

assuming that savers rely on money doctors to help them with risky financial choices. Moreover, as

in that model and in Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2004, 2008), trust in money doctors shapes

investor risk-taking and competition in the industry. Specifically, we assume that investors are less

anxious investing through intermediaries whom they know and trust. Intermediaries competitively

set their fees to attract clients, but because some intermediaries have a “locational” advantage of

being especially trusted by some clients, in equilibrium intermediaries charge positive fees that

capture a share of expected returns on investments.


        We analyze the dynamics of this model of capital accumulation and growth under the

neoclassical assumption of diminishing returns to capital.     We consider both the case of a fixed

number of intermediaries, and of competitive entry by intermediaries, which yield similar results.

The model predicts the growth of the finance share in GDP for the following reason. Recall that

finance in our specification delivers two services to investors: growth and wealth preservation.

With diminishing returns to capital, growth opportunities diminish over time, and so does the

growth rate of GDP. Because it tracks returns to capital, this segment of financial services is a

constant share of GDP. However, finance performs a second service, wealth preservation. Because

the service of wealth preservation tracks wealth, and not GDP, the ratio of this part of financial

income to GDP rises over time along with the ratio of wealth to GDP along the convergence path.

Putting the two parts together, finance grows as a share of GDP, precisely because one of its main

functions is to preserve the stock of wealth that, over time, is growing relative to GDP.


                                                  3
        The basic neoclassical implication of the model, from which most others follow, is the

growth of the ratio of wealth to GDP as the economy converges to the steady state. A recent

presentation by Piketty and Zucman (2012) shows that over the long term this is indeed the case for

many developed countries. We show for the US that the ratio of wealth to GDP has indeed

increased for several plausible measures of wealth.


        The model also delivers an important prediction that the cost of financial services falls over

time. There are two reasons for this in the model, which focuses on investment fees. First,

equilibrium fees are a share of expected returns in our model. As capital accumulates, and expected

returns on capital decline, so do the expected returns on financial assets and management fees. In

addition, in a free entry model, as the demand for financial services rises with wealth, there is entry

by new money managers, who get “closer” to the investors, making finance more individualized.

Competition between money managers also leads to the decline in fees over time.


        Our model also sheds light on the empirical question of the evolution of costs of finance.

Philippon (2012) suggests that unit costs of finance have remained constant. French (2008) and

Greenwood and Scharfstein (2013) find that management fees on equity mutual funds have fallen

over time, but overall fees, including those on private equity and hedge funds, have stayed roughly

constant. Philippon and Reshef (2013) also point to the declining costs of financial intermediation

in most countries outside the US.    In our model, fees on standard products fall over time, in line

with French (2008) and Philippon-Reshef (2013). At the same time, the composition of investor

portfolios tilts toward higher risk, intermediated (and therefore higher fee) financial products, which

might explain why unit fees as measured by Philippon (2012) have not declined.


        The gradual path of convergence to the steady state cannot account for two striking

fluctuations in the size of the financial sector. First, Figure 1 illustrates the sharp decline in the

financial sector in the Great Depression, which lasted for several decades. Second, the size of the

financial sector since the Great Depression has grown relative to income and even wealth. To
                                                  4
account for such evidence, our model’s central ingredient of trust as the lubricant of financial

services proves critical. In our framework, the decline of finance in the Great Depression is

explained as a decline in trust in the financial sector that took decades to rebuild. Indeed, it is

difficult to imagine that technological parameters alone can account for the decline of finance share

that took half a century to reverse, way longer than the recovery of productivity or of the real

economy. Likewise, the growth of the financial sector since the Great Depression can be explained

by growing investor trust in financial markets, as illustrated by the dramatic growth in stock market

participation. In our model, trust may have increased both for exogenous reasons, as the memory of

the Great Depression receded, and endogenous reasons, since increases in wealth encouraged entry

by intermediaries, who got “closer” to their clients and therefore became more trusted.


        In Section 2, we describe our model. Section 3 presents the equilibrium in the financial

sector. Section 4 considers the full equilibrium in the growth model, and discusses the relationship

between the model’s empirical implications and the available evidence. Section 5 extends the

model to the case with endogenous entry of financial intermediaries. Section 6 concludes.




2. The Setup


        This section introduces the key ingredients of the model: the household sector, financial

intermediation, and the productive sector.




2.1 The Household Sector


        The economy is inhabited by overlapping generations of young and old. Time starts at

      and goes on forever. A generation born at time        contains a continuum of workers of size

one, indexed by              [   ]. At –     , during their young age, these workers inelastically


                                                 5
supply their unit labor endowments at the equilibrium wage          . The entire wage income is saved

and invested as described below, and consumption takes place only in old age after investment

income is received. At the end of , the old generation dies without bequest. We describe an

economy with no population growth or technological progress. These assumptions do not change

our results, but an extension relaxing both assumptions in presented in Appendix B.1.


          Workers can invest their resources in two ways. First, they can invest their income in safe

self-storage. Each unit stored at       yields         units at , so that      is lost in depreciation.

We think of storage as an inefficient way to save on one’s own, perhaps by holding cash or gold at

home, or perhaps by keeping all the money in the bank. The case of             captures a perfect self-

storage technology. Second, a worker can hire a financial intermediary, whom we refer to as a

money manager throughout, to invest his savings in a risky financial asset. At the beginning of time

 , the money manager transforms a worker’s resources (one for one) into capital, and rents it to

firms, which use it to produce output at the end of time . We later describe production in detail.


          In the model, we draw a sharp distinction between self-storage, which requires no

intermediation, and risky investments, which require money managers. In reality, the gradation is

more continuous, from cash in mattresses and gold, to bank savings, to liquid market investments,

to illiquid investments such as private equity and hedge funds, with increasing amounts of

intermediary attention (and cost). We view our sharp differentiation as a simplifying assumption.


          There are a discrete number            of money managers in each generation, randomly

selected from the young. A generic money manager active at time is indexed by                   . This

money manager charges his investors a profit-maximizing fee          per unit of investment. At time

all managers invest in the same asset, which yields a stochastic gross return       with mean {        }

and variance     , both of which are determined endogenously in equilibrium. A worker/saver born

at time        delegating at the beginning of time his risky investment to manager thus earns a net


                                                   6
return             . If the income share invested at time              in the risky asset is           , the worker’s

consumption in old age is given by:


                                                       [           (              )].


Consumption increases in the excess return that risky financial assets earn relative to storage (net of

the management fee). We impose the constraint                           – which in Proposition 1 we verify to

hold in equilibrium – because we are interested in cases where risk taking is interior.


         After receiving the wage             at the end of period           , worker                  chooses at the

beginning of time how much of that wage to invest in the risky asset, in storage, and which money

manager        {        } to hire, so as to solve:


                                                 [             (              )                    ]


The preferences of workers are mean-variance with respect to the return of their portfolio. 2

Critically, the utility of the investor         depends on the identity of manager                 through the fee

    charged by j and through the manager-investor specific risk aversion parameter                        > 1, which

we think of as the anxiety experiences investing with . As in Gennaioli et al. (2012), saver sees

risk as being more costly with manager , anxiety                   as higher, the lower is the trust of for .

Investors are less anxious when taking risk with more trusted managers, perhaps because they know

them or their representatives personally, or perhaps because they are persuaded by advertisement.

We thus capture lower trust of in by a higher value of the anxiety parameter                   .

 This objective function arises under quadratic utility when the agent’s risk aversion is decreasing in his initial
(pre-investment) wealth endowment, namely when:


where consumption is the realized investment return, i.e.              ̌     . This utility function avoids the
unappealing feature of standard quadratic utility that the share of wealth invested in the risky asset decreases
with wealth . It is also more tractable than constant relative risk aversion, which requires lognormal returns
and analytical approximations that complicate optimal fee setting by money managers.

                                                           7
2.2 Financial Intermediation


        A worker’s demand for the risky asset depends on his trust for different money managers

and on the fees these managers charge. At each time savers are uniformly distributed around the

unit circle. Each manager is also located along the circle at a constant distance                from the

adjacent managers. The number of managers is exogenously fixed at                  (we endogenize       in

Section 5), and the trust of worker in manager is given by:




where      is the distance along the circle between the worker and the manager. The greater is the

distance between worker and manager , the lower is trust and the higher is the worker’s risk

aversion.3 Parameter          captures the maximal distance at which investor is willing to delegate.

If        , the investor suffers infinite anxiety, namely             , and so he only uses the storage

technology. Two managers located at distance            compete for some investors as long as             .

An investor located halfway between these two managers is willing to take some risk with either of

them. When               investors located in the middle suffer infinite anxiety from hiring either

manager. As a consequence, these investors do not take any risk and each manager has a small,

captive, clientele. As we show below, whether general trust        is above or below       has interesting

implications for the effect of competition on equilibrium fees.


        At time each money manager sets his fee for the generation of savers born at                . This

results in a profile                     of money managers’ fees. Given this profile, each worker


3
  Equation (2) captures investor trust in money managers. As a consequence,          is zero when the money
manager invests his own money, but not when a saver takes risk on his own. In fact, savers neither trust
themselves nor other savers for risky investment. For simplicity, we assume that investors have zero trust
(their risk aversion is infinite) with respect to homemade or non-professionally managed risk taking.

                                                    8
chooses, based on his trust as described by (2), which manager to invest with and how much risky

investment to undertake. The optimal policy of a worker                    is summarized by a vector

[        ]        that takes nonzero value only for the manager to whom the worker delegates his

risky investment. This vector is the solution of the investor’s problem described in Equation (1).

The optimal investment policy depends on time only through the fees          set by managers at time .

This implies that at a fee profile     , the profit earned by a generic money manager j from time

investment is given by:



                                                   [∫            ]


         We consider symmetric Nash equilibria in which each manager sets the same optimal fee

    identified by the condition:


                                                             |


Before computing workers’ investment decisions and management fees, we describe the production

structure of the model.




2.3 The Productive Sector


         There are two inputs: labor and capital, available in aggregate supply                 and      ,

respectively. We assume that capital can be converted back into consumption at no cost, but

Appendix B.2 shows that our main results continue to hold when we relax this assumption. Inputs

at time are owned by workers (labor is owned by the young born at time , capital is owned by the

old who are born at time             ) and hired by firms in competitive markets. The production

technology is risky. If an individual firm hires    units of capital and   units of labor it produces:


                                                        [              ]

                                                    9
In (4),    is an i.i.d shock with mean { }          and variance . Uncertainty is realized at the end of

period          output is produced. The value of a firm consists of two components. The first is its

value added                   , where      captures the firm’s total factor productivity. The second

component is the capital stock           used in production, which the firm returns to investors

undepreciated (up to the stochastic shock      ).


          At time , before the shock     is realized, firms hire capital and labor. Workers are hired on

the spot market and are remunerated with a deterministic equilibrium wage             . The remuneration

of capital is risky since it fully adjusts to the realization of the shock   , and is paid to the holders of

the firm’s financial claims. These claims are bought by savers via money managers and pay an

equilibrium return      with expected value {       } and risk     . The return     is thus determined by

the firms’ investment and by     .




3. Equilibrium in the Money Management Sector


          To solve a worker’s portfolio problem and a manager’s profit maximization problem, we

take wages and expected asset returns as given. These variables are computed in the next section.

At time , each saver – after collecting his period –               wages – optimally chooses a money

manager and an amount of risky investment to solve Equation (1). If worker selects money

manager , he invests in the risky asset a share              of his wealth     . This share is given by:


                                                    (              )



where           is assumed to be in          (Proposition 1 verifies that this is the case). The saver

invests                 in the risky asset and [               ]        in storage. Risk taking increases

in the excess return paid by the risky asset and in investor trust, but decreases in the risk        of the

financial asset. Consider now a worker’s decision of which money manager to hire.

                                                        10
          Figure 2 depicts the case with three managers, in which an investor              is located between

managers      and   . Consider the case when investors do not suffer infinite anxiety with either of

the two closest managers, i.e.,           .

                                                       j

                                                                             i




                                                                                 j
                                      j




                                                   Figure 2


          In this situation (and focusing on small deviations from a symmetric equilibrium), the

investor chooses between the two closest managers              and   . This implies that in setting his fee a

generic manager, say     , competes for investors on his right against            and for investors on his left

against     . To see the implications of this logic for fee setting, consider the general case in which

an investor chooses between his two closest managers and . Denote the distance between

investor and his left-adjacent manager by . Since the distance between managers is , the

distance between the same investor and his right-adjacent manager            is         . In light of Equation

(2), these distances pin down in Equation (5) the investor’s risky investment with either manager.

By plugging these optimal risky investments into the investor’s objective function of Equation (1),

we can show that investor obtains a higher utility by delegating his investment to manager rather

than to manager     if and only if:


                         (        )

                                                     [                       ]
                                                           (               )


                                                  11
Investor    thus hires manager            when the above condition holds and manager                          otherwise.

Intuitively, the investor delegates his risky portfolio to manager when his trust in is sufficiently

high, as captured by a sufficiently small distance                      from . Other things equal, delegation to

manager is also more likely when charges a lower fee (                              is lower) and the competing manager

  charges a higher fee (         is higher).


        Consider now optimal fee setting by manager . With the assumed circular structure, a

generic manager competes for investors against his neighbors on the left and the right. Manager

attracts investors who – according to (6) – are sufficiently close to him. This implies that, if two

competing managers         and        set the equilibrium fees                             , then the profit of manager

from setting fee     is given by:


                                                   (       )                    (           )
                                               ∫



where (         ) is the maximal distance at which an investor prefers to hire manager at fee

to hiring his closest competitor at the equilibrium fee                     . Maximization of the above profit function

yields the (sufficient) first order condition:


                         (        )                            (        )
  (                ) ∫                                                      [       (      )]       (            )



At a symmetric equilibrium                         , we obtain the following result.              All proofs appear in

Appendix A.



Lemma 1 The equilibrium fee at time is given by:



                                           [           (   ) ]



                                                                   12
where         . Management fees increase with the expected return on the risky asset. Furthermore,

for           – which is equivalent to              , fees decrease in the number of managers          and in

the generalized trust    that investors have in the financial sector as a whole.



        From the empirical standpoint, unit fees in our model correspond to the ratio between

aggregate financial sector income           and intermediated wealth       . As in Gennaioli et al. (2012),

equilibrium fees capture a constant fraction of the excess return expected on the risky asset. This

sharing rule is intuitive: managers extract part of the surplus they enable their trusting investors to

access. The fraction     of return extracted by managers decreases as trust in all managers             rises.

When investors trust all managers, competition among them is very intense, which drives down

fees. If             , fees also drop as the number of managers            rises. Intuitively, competition

between highly trusted managers lowers their market power and fees. Fees fall to zero as managers

fill the entire circle, namely as         . In the remainder, we focus on the case where                  .4


        By plugging Equation (7) into the optimal portfolio of Equation (5), we can show that

investor places in the risky asset a share of wealth given by:




        In equilibrium, each investor hires the closest manager and each manager attracts the same

amount of wealth. As a consequence, the aggregate share of wealth invested in the risky asset at ,

which we denote by         , is the product of the number of managers             and the share of wealth

managed by each of them. This aggregate share is given by:




  The case              has some interesting properties. When there are very few managers, a potentially large
4

measure of investors located between any two managers does not take any risk. In this case, an entering
manager could exploit monopoly (or quasi) monopoly profits by locating close to such excluded investors. In
this scenario, entry of new money managers increases participation into risk taking while exerting limited (or
no) downward pressure on the fees charged by existing managers.

                                                                (        )


where the expression in square brackets captures the wealth share invested by the clients to the right

of a manager. With symmetry, the wealth share managed by an individual manager is twice the

amount in square brackets. Equation (8) says that the share of wealth invested in the risky asset

increases in the asset’s excess return (net of fees) per unit of risk, in overall trust , and in the

number of managers         . As trust in money managers increases, fees drop, investors become less

anxious and are willing to take more risk.




4. General Equilibrium Dynamics


4.1 Production, Wages and Asset Returns


           At time , before observing   , a generic firm hires labor and capital to maximize expected

profits:


                                   {                                          }


which are equal to total output (inclusive of both value added and the capital stock) minus factor

payments. Profit maximization yields the optimality conditions:




                                                            {   }


The marginal product of labor is equated to the wage rate, and the average marginal product of

capital is equated to the average (gross) return of financial assets {   }.

                                                    14
         Because the real wage is deterministic, the firm’s wage bill is also deterministic, given by

                           . The production function then implies that, upon the realization of a shock

     , the resources available to the firm’s capital suppliers are

                 . The rate of return per unit of capital in state     is therefore given by:




By taking the expected value of the above expression, one can immediately see that the expected

return { } is equal to the average marginal product of capital [                          ], as in the first

order condition above. With constant returns to scale, remunerating capital with the residual of

output after the wage bill is paid is consistent with optimality.            Evaluated at the aggregate

endowments       and         , the equilibrium wage and expected return are then given by:




                                                             {   }


Furthermore, by using the above expression for        we can show that the variance of returns is equal

to                     [            ] .




4.2 Evolution of the Financial Sector


         We can now characterize the evolution of the economy.               The total amount of risky

investment at time , which buys the aggregate capital stock          , is equal to the past aggregate wage

bill      , times the share of this wealth invested with money managers:




Using Equations (9), we can rewrite this equation as:




                                                   15
By plugging equilibrium returns and variance into equation (8), we can compute the aggregate share

of wealth invested in the risky asset, which is given by:



                                                                          (          )
                                                  [             ]


          Equations (11) and (12) fully characterize the dynamics of the economy. The law of motion

of the capital stock in (11) is very similar to that obtained in a standard Solow model, with the main

difference that now the amount of resources invested in the economy depends, through                  , on the

equilibrium fees set by money managers and on the risk-return profile entailed by real investment.


          In Appendix A we prove that, by combining (11) and (12) we obtain the following result:



Proposition 1 If                    , there are two thresholds ̅ and          , with ̅      , such that, for

    (     ̅) the economy admits a unique nonzero steady state level of capital           at which individual

risk taking is interior and aggregate risk taking is given by                 . The steady state is locally

stable and displays the following properties:


    i)        The steady state capital stock weakly increases with the level of productivity and with

              the number of money managers, formally            ⁄                ⁄

    ii)       Risk taking increases with the level of productivity and with the number of money

              managers, formally        ⁄               ⁄



          When the volatility    of the productivity shock is intermediate, the economy monotonically

converges to a unique steady state level of financial intermediation and investment.5 The steady



5
  The role of production risk is intuitive. If is too low, people are very eager to invest in the risky asset.
Some or all of them give all of their wealth to money managers, setting            . Condition        rules out
this possibility. If is very high, the variance of the risky asset decreases very fast with the capital stock.
This can be a source of multiplicity: some equilibria are characterized by low investment and high risk (which

                                                      16
state level of capital increases in productivity . When investment becomes more productive, the

wage earned by the young and the average return promised by money managers rise. Both effects

increase financial intermediation, investment and output in the economy.                An increase in the

number              of money managers also increases financial intermediation, investment and

output in the steady state. There are two reasons for this. First, when             increases, investors can

find a more trusted money manager, increasing – for given fees – their propensity to invest.

Second, a higher     increases competition among money managers, reducing equilibrium fees and

increasing for a given level of an investor’s trust the investor’s risk appetite.


         One important property of our model is that the steady state is locally stable. That is, an

economy starting below or above the steady state monotonically converges to it.                   Figure 3

graphically represents this convergence process.


                     𝐾𝑡+




                               𝐾                           𝐾                 𝐾𝑡
                                                Figure 3


         Similarly to the standard neoclassical growth models, the main source of stability is

diminishing returns to capital. As the capital stock increases, wages and national income rise. This

raises the demand for financial assets by savers. The increase in financial assets further increases

the capital stock and thus output next period. The growth rate of the capital stock however declines




vindicates low investment), while other equilibria feature high investment and low risk (vindicating high
investment). Condition     ̅ rules out this possibility.

over time, because new resources are invested at progressively lower returns.                  Growth stops

eventually and the steady state is attained.6


         This convergence process has interesting implications for the financial sector. In particular,

how do fees and money management profits change as the economy grows over time? We address

these issues below.



Corollary 1 Suppose that the economy starts below the steady state, namely                        During the

transition to the steady state:


    i)   The unit fee charged by money managers, which is given by:

                                                             [                          ]

         decreases over time as capital accumulates.

    ii) The total income of the financial sector increases over time, at a higher speed than value

         added. The ratio of financial sector income over value added (GDP), is given by:


                                                            [(       )              ]




         As the economy accumulates capital, there are more resources for financial intermediation.

At the same time, diminishing returns to physical capital (              ) imply that ceteris paribus these

additional resources are employed at a lower marginal return. This explains why unit management

fees fall along the transition. As capital deepening reduces the expected excess return on the risky

asset, it also reduces the surplus that money managers can extract from investors. Declines in

expected returns in turn reduce the rents available for money managers, as reflected in their unit fee.


  Unlike in the standard Solow model, however, diminishing returns are not enough to guarantee stability,
6

because in our model risk taking by households increases as the capital stock grows. This phenomenon
creates the possibility of explosive paths on which capital accumulation begets further risk taking and capital
accumulation. The upper bound on the variance of shocks ensures stability by reducing the sensitivity of risk
taking to the capital stock.

                                                      18
        Despite this reduction in unit fees, the aggregate income earned by money managers grows

over time.   This is because the growth in the size of the intermediated wealth             more than

compensates for the reduction in unit fees, and causes financial sector income to rise over time. In

our model financial sector income grows faster than value added, so the ratio of financial sector

income to GDP grows over time.


        To understand this result, recall that in our model financial sector income can be viewed as

remuneration for two services. The first is a “wealth preservation” service: money managers allow

savers to access investment opportunities which on average return the initial un-depreciated capital

and are thus better than self-storage. The second is a “growth” service: money managers enable

savers to earn part of the capital income generated by these productive investment opportunities. In

equilibrium, money managers are remunerated for both services. The remuneration for wealth

preservation is equal to             , which is the product of the per unit of return fee    times the

surplus created by managers relative to riskless storage. Intuitively, wealth preservation is more

expensive the worse is the return on riskless storage (i.e., the lower is ). The remuneration for the

growth service is equal to the per unit of return fee times capital income, namely             . This

remuneration increases in total value added            and in the share     of the value added that

remunerates capital. As capital stock grows, the remuneration for both wealth preservation and

growth services rises, in turn increasing the aggregate income of the financial sector.


    Why does the total financial income grow faster than GDP? Consider the financial sector’s

growth services and wealth preservation separately. As a product of real growth opportunities,

income from growth services grows at the same rate as GDP. Indeed, as shown by the second term

in Equation (14), the remuneration for growth services is a constant fraction             of aggregate

GDP. On the other hand, the first term in Equation (14) shows that the wealth preservation service

grows faster than GDP. The remuneration for this service grows linearly with the capital stock       ,

which in turn grows faster than GDP: while value added is subject to decreasing returns, capital

                                                  19
preservation is not. The fact that a portion of the financial services is dedicated to preserving the

wealth of the economy, and not to the shrinking pool of new profitable investment projects,7 causes

the ratio of financial to total income to rise over time.




4.3. Empirical Predictions.


        Our model yields several empirical predictions, some consistent with the available

evidence, some new. To begin, our model turns the standard neoclassical prediction that the capital

to income ratio increases during transitional growth into a novel rationale for Philippon’s (2012)

and Philippon and Reshef’s (2013) finding that the financial sector grows relative to GDP. As past

economic growth causes the accumulation of considerable wealth, workers (who own the financial

claims on the capital stock) seek wealth preservation opportunities more attractive than self-storage.

Trusted money managers provide access to such opportunities, which allows them to extract a

fraction of the growing wealth. As the availability of profitable investment opportunities declines,

the economy-wide wealth to income ratio rises, causing the relative income of the financial sector

to rise over time. It is not that finance slows down economic growth by driving resources away

from productive opportunities. It is rather the fact that productive opportunities diminish and past

wealth must be preserved that allows the financial sector to expand relative to the productive sector.


        The principal mechanism of the model, and thus its basic prediction, is the growing wealth

to GDP ratio in the economy. Figure 4 presents this ratio, computed for both total and financial

wealth, for the United States, and shows that it rises over time. A presentation by Piketty and



7
  In Equation (14) we exclude storage services or capital preservation from the definition of GDP in the
denominator order to illustrate most starkly our results. The growing relative size of the financial sector is
however robust to alternative definitions. For instance, if one includes financial sector income into GDP,
defining the latter as                       , finance still increases as a share of GDP provided     , which
always holds. But even if one takes the broadest notion of GDP to include the entire capital stock, namely
          , finance would still increase as a share of GDP provided                .

                                                     20
Zucman (2012) shows for several developed countries that the ratio of wealth to GDP indeed grows

over long stretches of time, although they do not connect this finding to the growth of finance.


         The model so far also predicts the decline in management fees over time. As capital

accumulates, the expected return on capital declines and equilibrium fees, which are a share of

expected return, decline as well. It is precisely the same force of declining marginal product of

capital that drives both the decline in fees and the increase in finance share. French (2008)

documents the decline in management fees over time. However, Philippon (2012) finds that, in the

United States, unit costs of finance have not declined, while Greenwood and Scharfstein (2013)

attribute this to a shift to higher fee products. We attempt to reconcile this evidence after extending

our model to incorporate entry by money managers in Section 5.




4.4. Fluctuations in the Size of the Financial Sector


         We have so far focused on long term trends and have ignored fluctuations in the size of the

financial sector, evident in Figure 1. Our model also allows us to analyze the short and long run

responses of the financial sector to shocks. We compare the effects of two permanent shocks: a

permanent drop in productivity     and a drop in the overall level of trust in the financial sector ,

owing for instance to the erosion of investor confidence during a large scale financial crisis. Our

model describes how the financial sector adjusts to these shocks.



Corollary 2 Suppose that an economy is originally in a steady state            .


    i)       Productivity   permanently drops to          . On impact, at a given initial capital stock

                      investment drops, financial intermediation drops, but financial sector income

             increases relative to GDP. Over time, the capital stock and intermediation decrease to



                                                  21
              the new steady state                          , and financial sector income relative to

              GDP returns to the initial level.

    ii)       Trust    permanently drops to             . On impact, at a given initial capital stock

                        unit investment and financial intermediation drop, and financial sector

              income decreases relative to GDP. Over time, the capital stock and intermediation

              gradually fall to the new steady state                             , and financial sector

              income decreases relative to GDP.



          A drop in either productivity or trust causes financial intermediation to shrink, both in the

short and in the long run (at least weakly). In the short run, the two types of shocks entail different

responses in the relative size of the financial sector. While a drop in productivity causes the relative

size of the financial sector to increase, a drop in trust causes the relative size of the financial sector

to decline. This is because the drop in productivity reduces GDP and growth opportunities a lot but

leaves the wealth preservation service of the financial sector relatively unaffected.               As a

consequence, the financial sector shrinks less than GDP, increasing the share of national income

going to finance. In contrast, a drop in trust reduces the remuneration of both the wealth

preservation and growth services of the financial sector. Although such a drop also reduces

investment and income, on impact it exerts a much more drastic effect on the financial sector

income, causing the relative size of finance to drop.


          In our model, permanents shocks to productivity or trust can generate long lasting boom

and bust cycles to the size of the financial sector. As trust suddenly dissipates (owing, for instance,

to a financial crisis), individual take money out of the financial sector and put it into mattresses

(self-storage). This reduces financial intermediation and the financing of profitable investment

opportunities. Income reductions reduce the stock of wealth, further undermining the ability to




                                                   22
finance investment in the future.    This process generates a persistent contraction in financial

intermediation and income until the new, lower, equilibrium is attained.


        Corollary 2 may help make sense of the one dramatic fluctuation in the size of the financial

sector in the United States, namely the collapse of its income from 6 to 2 percent of GDP in the

great depression, which took 40 years to fully reverse (Figure 1). The Great Depression in all

likelihood combined a decline in productivity with a sharp decline in trust in the financial system.

Corollary 2 suggests that both of these factors should have led to a progressive decline in the total

amount of intermediated wealth. On the other hand, the fact that the income share going to the

financial sector immediately shrunk underscore the role of the decline in trust. This is consistent

also with the fact that the financial sector started to grow again only after World War II, and

reached its prewar size only in the 1980s, decades after the productivity and the wealth of the US

economy have substantially surpassed their pre-Depression levels. Only the slow decades-long

return of trust enabled the financial sector to reach new heights as the wealth of the US economy

expanded.




5. Entry into the Financial Sector


        Our analysis has so far focused on the dynamics of fees and of financial intermediaries’

income as shaped by the progressive exhaustion of investment opportunities (the diminishing

returns assumption). We have so far neglected another important dimension of financial sector

evolution, namely entry of new financial intermediaries, which was precluded by the assumption

that the number of money managers is fixed at           .


        We now allow for endogenous entry of financial intermediaries. Formally, we allow the

distance between two adjacent money managers to change over time. Denote the distance at time

by    and the corresponding number of financial intermediaries by                  . For notational


                                                 23
simplicity we treat this variable as continuous, even though the number of active intermediaries is

equal to the largest integer below          . We assume that creating a new money management firm at

time costs             units of consumption, where              . This cost should be viewed as the value of

labor that the founder must expend in order to setup the new financial intermediary and to earn the

trust of investors (indeed, the opportunity cost of time at is equal to the wage rate, which scales

with value added).8 Money managers can enter/exit at any time, so current profits are the only

determinants of entry decisions. Finally, money managers appear in discrete and thus negligible

numbers, so entry of additional managers leaves the labor supply of productive firms unchanged.


         Generalizing our previous analysis, equilibrium fees at time are now given by:



                                                                               [      (    ) ]


The fee            per unit of excess return increases in              because competition among money

managers is less intense when there are fewer managers (             is higher).




5.1 Entry and Equilibrium Dynamics


         If at time a number             of money managers is active, the total profits of the financial

sector are equal to                     [                     ]. At time      money managers enter until the

profit earned by each of them is equal to the setup cost. This condition is given by:


                                                       [                       ]


By dividing both sides by          , we can rewrite the equilibrium entry condition as:

  In this formalization, entry entails a redistribution of managers along the unit circle. This redistribution
8

allows all money managers, including the ones entering at , to be located at the same distance . We assume
that it is costless for existing managers to relocate along the circle, while it is costly to acquire the necessary
generalized trust to operate a firm.

                                                        24
                                                [                  ]


           Here        captures the fee charged by each money manager per unit of service provided

(be it wealth preservation or growth). This component increases with           because a drop in the

number of managers raises fees and the aggregate income of each manager.


           The second term       [                  ] on the left hand side captures the share of the

aggregate value of money managers’ services to aggregate income provided by each individual

manager at time . As shown in the previous section, this ratio increases with the capital stock

because financial intermediaries’ wealth preservation service becomes relatively more important as

the country becomes richer. This feature drives one key property of the entry model, which we

summarize in the result below.



Lemma 2 Consider a path along which the capital stock            increases over time. Equation (17)

implies that along this path:


    i)         The number of active money managers increases (i.e.,    drops) over time.

    ii)        The management fees charged per unit of capital fall over time, owing both to the drop

               in       as new money managers enter, and to the fall in the marginal return to capital

               as   increases.

    iii)       The aggregate income of the financial sector increases over time, both in absolute

               terms and relative to the country’s aggregate income.



           As the capital stock expands, there are more resources available for intermediation. For

given fees, money management becomes more profitable, so incurring the setup cost

becomes worthwhile. This stimulates entry of new money managers, leading to a drop in            until

the profits available to an entering money manager drop back to the setup cost. In this process,


                                                    25
management fees drop. Part of this effect is due, as in the previous section, to the fact that capital

deepening reduces the marginal return on capital and thus the surplus each money manager can

extract.     Entry, however, introduces another mechanism whereby fees drop: the drop in

intensifies competition among money managers, reducing equilibrium fees                .


           Despite the drop in unit fees, the aggregate profits of the financial sector increase over time.

As before, the expansion in the capital stock increases the demand for financial services. This

force, which increases profits, is so strong that it more than offsets the drop in fees. Financial sector

income increases not only in absolute terms but also relative to GDP. In equation (17), the left hand

side must stay constant, which implies that the total income share absorbed by finance

[                     ] increases as higher capital stock   causes     to drop.


           Lemma 2 considers what happens to entry and to the size of the financial sector as the

capital stock      grows over time. We still need to verify, however, that with endogenous entry our

model delivers an increasing path for the capital stock. In this case, the law of motion of the

economy is still captured by Equations (11) and (12) with the only difference that now also

and    evolve according to Equation (17). In the appendix we then prove the following result.



Proposition 2 If the parametric conditions of Proposition 1 hold, and in addition productivity           is

sufficiently high, the entry model admits a unique and locally stable nonzero steady state        .



           Starting from initial levels of capital   below the steady state, the model is indeed capable

of generating a transitional growth path characterized by capital deepening, increasing financial

intermediation, rising wealth, entry of money managers, decline in fees, but also increasing

financial sector income both in absolute terms and relative to GDP. A high level of                ensures

equilibrium uniqueness by bounding the role of the wealth preservation service provided by the

financial sector. If      and thus the return from growth services is low, a high capital stock may

                                                     26
alone create a strong demand for financial services, generating massive entry of intermediaries in

the economy, in turn sustaining massive investment. A large           creates a sizeable demand for

financial intermediation regardless of the wealth preservation component, precluding the possibility

of multiple equilibria.




5.2 Empirical Predictions of The Model with Entry


        The possibility of entry of new intermediaries does not affect the ability of our model to

account for the main patterns of evolution of the financial sector. As illustrated by Lemma 2, the

share of GDP coming from finance increases over time (again due to wealth preservation services),

and adverse shocks to investor trust reduce the income going to money managers. The new twist

here is that some of these effects now occur through entry of new intermediaries. Most notably,

part of the reason why the income of the financial sector grows over time is that the entry of new

intermediaries increases the proximity of money managers to investors, increasing risk taking and

the size of the financial sector.


        This process of increasing participation into risk taking implies that despite the reduction in

the equilibrium unit fee     , the unit cost of financial intermediation may actually increase as the

financial sector expands. To see this, note that the total amount of financial assets in the economy

at time , which includes “safe storage securities” and risky assets is equal to      , the total wealth

of the elderly. At the same time, the total income absorbed by the financial sector is equal to the fee

times risky investment                      , where    is the wealth share that the elderly allocate to

risk taking. The unit cost of financial intermediation is then given by:




                                                  27
As the financial sector grows, unit fees          fall but the composition of investment shifts toward

riskier assets:   rises. As we show in Appendix B, the latter effect may actually dominate, causing

unit costs of intermediation to rise over time.


        This idea can help reconcile the French (2008) finding that in the last 30 years unit fees

have come down for equity mutual funds with the evidence presented in Figure 5 that the average

unit cost of finance – measured as finance income over financial assets – has increased significantly

after the Great Depression and then remained roughly constant after 1980 (using a different

measure, Philippon 2012 also finds that the average unit cost of finance has slightly increased). The

big increase in unit cost after the Depression probably has something to do with recovery of trust

and increased risk-taking as the memory of the Depression receded. In addition, the relative

stability of unit cost in recent years might be related to the entry of new intermediaries in response

to increased wealth, shifting the composition of investments to more intermediated and thus more

expensive forms of finance.


        These compositional effects may be stronger if money managers can introduce new, riskier,

assets. Because these assets rely more on the lubricating role of trust, they may be purchased by

investors only if the latter are sufficiently close to their preferred manager. A highly trusted

manager would introduce new investment options to leverage his trust capital and extract higher

fees.9 The compositional shift toward higher-risk, nonstandard investments may also constitute a

force preventing unit costs from falling over time.




9
  To see the logic behind this intuition, note that in our model unit fees increase in the return paid by the
financial asset (see Equation (7)). Intuitively, the higher the return earned by investors, the higher the rent
that the trusted money manager can extract. As a consequence, the introduction of a higher return-higher risk
financial asset by a trusted money manager allows the manager to charge higher fees to investors, increasing
the average cost of intermediation. To simplify the analysis, we only consider the choice between a riskless
(and thus non-intermediated) asset and a risky asset. We leave the formal analysis of the case of multiple
risky assets to future research.


                                                      28
6. Conclusion.


        We have presented a Solow-style growth model in which the financial claims on the capital

stock are managed by professionals. In that model, the size of the financial sector depends both on

the economy’s GDP and on its stock of capital or wealth. The model accounts for some key facts

about the development of the financial sector in the last century.


        To begin, the model explains why financial sector has grown relative to GDP over time

(Figure 1 from Philippon 2012). The reason is that one of the functions of finance is to preserve the

existing stock of wealth, and wealth has grown over time relative to income, as one would expect

along the adjustment path to the steady state.      The model thus also predicts the growth of the

wealth to GDP ratio over time, shown in Figure 4 and more broadly by Piketty and Zucman (2012).


        Equally important, our model’s emphasis on trust helps explain aspects of the volatility of

the financial sector. Our approach links the sharp decline of finance in the Great Depression, and

its slow recovery over the following 50 years, to the rapid decline and subsequent slow recovery of

trust. Part of that recovery is exogenous, as the memory of the Great Depression recedes, but part

of it is also endogenous in our model, since increases in wealth encourage entry by financial

intermediaries, which creates high trust relationships.


        Our model also seeks to reconcile the somewhat conflicting evidence on the fees and unit

costs of the financial sector. French (2008) presents evidence that fees on equity mutual funds have

declined over time (French 2008), whereas Philippon (2012) and Figure 5 show no evidence of

declining “unit cost” of finance. According to our analysis, an important byproduct of economic

growth, entry by financial intermediaries, and reduction in fees is that investors allocate increasing

shares of their wealth to intermediated financial products, rather than to self-storage. This implies

that the composition of investor portfolios shifts over time to riskier, and hence more expensive,

financial products. This can lead to increases in unit costs, even as fees for given products decline.


                                                  29
        Previous scholars took the evidence on the growth of finance as an indication of problems

with the market economy and the financial system. Without denying the importance of rent-

seeking, agency, and other problems, our paper presents a more benign view. Finance should grow

as an economy matures, because the preservation of wealth is an increasingly important function of

the financial system.

Appendix A: Proofs


Proof of Proposition 1. By plugging Equation (12) into (11), it is easy to see that in any steady
state with positive capital stock   and such that       , is identified by the equation:

                                                                      (           )
                                    [                 ]

which can be rewritten as:

                             [                ]      [                                        ]

where                            . It is easy to verify the above equation admits a unique solution
                     (   )
provided         , which imposes an upper bound on .

         Before studying the steady state, let us verify that     (and in particular that this is so
for all investors). From Equation (12) it is easy to find that the household who is closest to a
manager invests a share of wealth:

                                                         [                                ]
                                                             [            ]

where                    . The function           is increasing in                provided        , which – as we
             (   )
will soon see, it is strictly satisfied at the steady state capital level, and thus along transitional
dynamics occurring around the steady state. which implies that starting from a below steady state
level of capital stock, risk taking increases over time until the steady state is reached. As a result,
by exploiting Equation         , all investors set an interior level of risk taking in the steady state
provided                   , where        . By replacing this condition into        we find that this is
equivalent to:
                                                     [                    ]


which imposes a lower bound on . The upper and lower bounds are mutually compatible, namely
 [       +   ]
     +
                 , provided                   , which we assume to hold. This analysis thus identifies
variance bounds ̅ and , with ̅             , to which we restrict the analysis of our model.

       Consider the steady state prevailing for      ( ̅) This is identified by Equation                     . By
applying the implicit function theorem, and after some algebra, one can find that:


                                                         [                ]

                                                                  [                   ]
                                                         [                    ]




                                                             34
where both inequalities rely on the restriction                and       . Condition (P2) intuitively
says that the steady state capital stock increases in productivity . Condition (P3) says that the
steady state capital stock increases in the number of managers (because lower reduces ).

        Consider now the dynamics of the model. By exploiting Equations (11) and (12), one can
write the law of motion for our model economy as:



                                              [                            ]

The above difference equation implicitly defines a function                        whose slope is equal to:



                                                                               [                              ]
                                             {             (               )                                      }
                    [                    ]                                         [                  ]

At the                  steady state, the above slope becomes equal to:




Where the inequality is due to the assumption            As a result, the zero capital steady state is
unstable, and the mapping            must cut the 45 degrees line at the interior steady state   with
a slope less than one, implying that  is locally stable.


Proof of Corollary 2 At the steady state capital sock           , the new productivity level sets
the wage rate, fees and intermediation at time . In particular, investment and intermediation are
pinned down by the equations:

                                                 +         +


                                                                       +
                         +     +                                                   (     )
                                                      [            +   ]

where       is by definition invariant to changes in , for the initial capital stock is predetermined.

Consider the effects of a change in . The impact of such change on investment and intermediation
is determined by the behavior of the ratio +       +     +      . By the proof of proposition 1 we
know that such ratio is an increasing function of + and a decreasing function of at the steady
state capital level. As a result, by the implicit function theorem, a drop in productivity reduces
financial intermediation and the capital stock + . The relative size of the financial sector depends
on the effect of the productivity change on the product      + . Denote          +      . The relatie
size of finance increases with . In this regard, note that the equilibrium condition
  , where    is a constant, can be rewritten as:


                                          [       +            ]

                                                          35
After some algebra, one can check that the left hand side of the above equation increases in . As a
result, an increase in reduces and thus the relative size of the financial sector, while a drop in
does the reverse. Finally, consider the long run response. It is easy to see from the Proof of
Proposition 1 and from Equation (P1), financial intermediation drops in the long run and the relative
size of the financial sector remains constant.

Consider now the effect of a change in trust . The equilibrium condition is the same as the one
represented above. Because the function +               +      increases in , higher trust increases
investment and intermediation, while a drop in trust does the reverse. Accordingly, because also the
function +              increases in , an increase in trust on impact increases the relative size of the
financial sector while a reduction in trust does the reverse. Finally, in the Proof of Proposition 1 we
also establish that long run intermediation and the long run relative size of finance increase in trust.


Proof of Lemma 2. By inspection of Equations (16) and (17).


Proof of Proposition 2 With endogenous entry, the evolution of the economy is described by the
following equations:

                                                                         (             )
                                  [           ]

                                                      [                                ]

Equation        is essentially the same law of motion of the Proof of Proposition 1, with the only
difference that now (and thus ) are endogenously determined in Equation           .

In the spirit of the Proof of Proposition 1, we can rewrite (P5) as:

                          [           ]

                     [                    ]                     (            )

By replacing in Equation         the expression for                     and by denoting               [            ], we
can find after some algebra that:

                                      ( )         ( )               [            ]

Where             . This equation has a unique solution for                          in (0,1) which we denote by      .

         By replacing the expression for      in the expressions for   and                        in Equation      , we
find after some algebra that the law of motion of the economy is given by:

                                          [       ]

                              [                           ] [                ]




                                                      36
Where again we have that                . The above difference equation has one trivial steady state at
              . A positive and unique steady state exists provided: i) the root multiplying     on the
left hand side above is monotonically increasing in , ii) the value of the root at           is below
            . The latter condition is met when the variance is sufficiently low. On the other hand, a
sufficient condition for i) is that:

                                                    i       i i

Intuitively, in this case the main effect of higher is to increase the numerator, leaving the
denominator almost unaffected (also because in this case          stays small). When this is the case,
then, there is a unique interior equilibrium         . This equilibrium is locally stable (so that the
capital stock monotonically converges to it) provided the slope of the implicit mapping              is
above one at the           steady state. One can check that this is the case provided is sufficiently
high and is above a threshold (consistent with the previous upper bound). The condition that be
bounded is the same as the one required in Proposition 1, except that now the bounds are evaluated
at the equilibrium number of managers prevailing when               as entailed by     . Since
does not depend on productivity , the assumption that be sufficiently large can be added to
ensure stability of the system. Note that when         is made small, the upper and lower bound will
be consistent because locally entry responds slowly to changes in the capital stock, so that around
       the analysis does not virtually change from that with a fixed number of money managers.


Appendix B: Extensions and Additional Proofs.

B.1 Population Growth and Technological Progress

         In the main model, we have assumed that population – and thus labor supply – is constant at
        and that total factor productivity takes a constant value of . We now allow for population
growth and for productivity augmenting technological progress and investigate how these features
affect the evolution of the financial sector. We do so by assuming that the effective labor supply
available at time satifies the law of motion:



where is the rate of population growth and is the rate of technical progress. Because the
production function is Cobb-Douglas, this formulation of labor augmenting technical progress is
equivalent to one in which productivity growth is factor-neutral and increases the value of .

       Denoting by ̂                the capital stock per unit of effective labor, the competitive
remunerations of a unit of effective labor and of a unit of capital are respectively given by:
                                                        ̂

                                                ̂                  ̂

where the second expression implies, consistent with our previous analysis, that the average return
on a unit of capital is equal to { }           ̂    , while the variance of the return to capital is
equal to                    [     ̂   ] .




                                                    37
         Thus far, the only implication of introducing population growth and technical progress is
that factor remunerations are functions of the capital per effective unit of labor ̂ . This implies that
the share of wage income invested into risky asset also depends in ̂ , namely:

                                            (          ̂       )
                                                                   (      )
                                           [       ̂       ]

         The absolute value of the capital stock created at time is then equal to a fraction of
the total wage bill paid to workers at        , which is equal to              , namely
        By dividing both sides by , and by replacing in the equation the expression for     , we
find that the law of motion of the capital stock per unit of effective labor is given by:

                                 ̂                                 ̂

         The law of motion characterizing the capital stock per unit of effective labor is very similar
to that described in Equation (11) of our basic model, except that the fraction of wealth invested in
the risky asset is scaled down by the constant population and productivity growth rates.

        In light of the previous analysis, several immediate consequences follow. First, the capital
stock per unit of effective labor converges to a nonzero steady state value ̂ that is a decreasing
function of and . In this steady state, the per-capita capital stock and per capita output grow at a
constant rate , while the extent of risk taking converges to a constant. The comparative statics
properties described by Proposition 1 continue to hold with respect to the steady state levels of the
per capita capital stock and of the extent of risk taking.

        Second, the properties of evolution of the financial sector also do not change from
Corollary 1. The management fee per unit of capital declines over time as ̂ increases toward its
steady state level. As a consequence, financial sector income rises faster than value added if we
express both the numerator and the denominator in per effective units of labor.

         Finally, the qualitative properties of Corollary 2 also hold in this modified model. In sum,
population and productivity growth introduce additional reasons for the growth of the absolute size
and profits of the financial sector, but do not affect the qualitative behavior of scaled variables such
as unit fees and the income share going to finance.


B.2 Trading and Valuation of the Capital Stock

         In our baseline model consumption and capital are the same good, so that the elderly
consume the capital stock they own at the end of their lives. This assumption simplifies the
analysis, but it raises the issue of whether our result are robust to the more realistic setting in which
capital cannot be converted back into consumption and so the elderly must sell their capital stock to
the young. To shed light on this issue, suppose now that the consumption can be transformed into
capital but capital cannot be converted back into consumption. This implies that at time the
elderly of the generation born at time          must sell the economy’s capital stock to the current
young generation. The amount of capital held by the elderly at the end of time is equal to               .
If the price of capital in terms of consumption is , the value at time of the supply of capital in
terms of consumption goods is equal to                . On the demand side, the consumption income
available to the young born at time to buy – through money managers – the entire capital stock
from the elderly is equal to +         . Of course, the young only demand capital from the elderly if

                                                   38
the price of existing capital is not higher than the resource cost of creating new capital, i.e. provided
       , which importantly affects equilibrium prices.

         To find the equilibrium price , we must determine whether the capital stock
available at time is below or above the desired investment +          by the young born at . If the
young wish to increase the stock of capital, namely                +      , the equilibrium price of
capital settles at       so as to make savers indifferent between buying existing capital goods and
creating new ones. If instead the young wish to reduce the stock of capital, namely             +
   , then the new capital goods will not be produced and the price drops to                 so as to
equate the values of the demand and the supply of capital goods.

        Because our main results focus on transitions occurring below the steady state, let us
consider the implications of this analysis for changes in the valuation of capital markets during
these transitions. Recall that in these transitions, the desired capital stock increases over time,
namely +            +            . As a consequence, if the potential shocks are sufficiently small
that below the steady state capital the condition                 +        holds (at least when   is far
enough from the steady state), then during the transitional growth phase the unit price of capital
stays constant at         . In each period, the elderly sell their capital        to the young, who add
extra investment to implement their desired capital stock +              . The ex-post shock affects
consumption by the elderly and new investment by the young, but leaves the aggregate capital stock
next period unaffected. The law of motion of the economy is then identical to Equation (11): the
possibility to trade capital goods does not affect how the economy converges to the steady state.

         The possibility of trading in capital goods, however, affects the interpretation of our results.
In particular, the capital stock    can now be interpreted as the market valuation of the aggregate
wealth of the economy. The fact that the income share of the financial sector raises with            can
then be viewed as the product of increasing capital market valuations. It should be noted, however,
that in our model these valuations rise through the extensive margin – as new investment takes
place – and not through increases in their unitary valuation , which remains constant at 1.
Allowing for changes in , potentially through asset price bubbles, is an interesting avenue for
future research.


B.3: Competitive Entry of Intermediaries and the Growth of Financial Sector Income

We now show that it is possible that the unit cost of finance (the ratio of financial sector income
over financial assets):

                                                    (       )
                                                                    [            ]

may increase over time, as new intermediaries enter the market. To see why this may be the case,
note that during transitional growth, the capital stock        increases while the distance between
managers decreases. As a result, a sufficient condition for the product         to increase over time
is that the terms that are functions of      decrease in      while ratio which is a function of
increases in . It is immediate to see that the ratio on the right increases in  provided            .
On the other hand, one can find values such that the first term (which is a polynomial of degree 5)
decreases in (e.g. close to ). It is beyond the scope of this analysis to evaluate under what
exact conditions unit costs may be increasing, but it seems that – given that is pinned down by
– one may be able to find economies (values of and of the initial capital stock) for which the
equilibrium is indeed close to and unit costs increase over time until the steady state is reached.
