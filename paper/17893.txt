                                              ABSTRACT

In 2006, Massachusetts passed health care reform legislation designed to achieve nearly universal
coverage through a combination of insurance market reforms, mandates, and subsidies that later served
as the model for national reform. Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System,
we provide evidence that health care reform in Massachusetts led to better overall self-assessed health.
Various robustness checks and placebo tests support a causal interpretation of the results. We also
document improvements in several determinants of overall health: physical health, mental health, functional
limitations, joint disorders, and body mass index. Next, we show that the effects on overall health
were strongest among those with low incomes, non-whites, near-elderly adults, and women. Finally,
we use the reform to instrument for health insurance and estimate a sizeable impact of coverage on
health.

I. Introduction

           A major objective of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) signed into

law in March of 2010 is to increase health insurance coverage in the United States to nearly

universal levels through a combination of insurance market reforms, mandates, subsidies, and

Medicaid expansions. Although the mandates survived constitutional challenges and the 2012

election outcomes make full repeal unlikely, the implementation of the law still faces challenges,

such as the denial of funds during the budgetary process or some states opting not to expand

Medicaid. This ongoing debate highlights the need for projections of the law’s impacts on health,

health care utilization, and state and federal budgets. The multi-faceted nature of the reform and

breadth of the population affected suggests that evidence from coverage expansions in other

contexts will be of only limited usefulness.

           The most similar intervention to date to the ACA is the Massachusetts health care reform

of April 2006, entitled “An Act Providing Access to Affordable, Quality, Accountable Health

Care” and commonly called “Chapter 58” (Long, 2008). 1 The law enabled Massachusetts to

lower its uninsurance rate to 2% by 2010 through a strategy called “incremental universalism,”

or “filling the gaps in the existing system … rather than ripping up the system and starting over”

(Massachusetts’ Division of Health Care, Finance and Policy, 2010; Gruber, 2008a:52). Gruber

(2010) describes Massachusetts’ approach to incremental universalism as a “three legged stool”

of insurance market reforms, mandates, and subsidies/Medicaid expansions (Gruber, 2010).

           The first leg of the stool reforms non-group insurance markets in an effort to ensure the

availability of coverage for those without access to employer-provided or public insurance.

Insurers are not allowed to deny or drop coverage based on pre-existing conditions (guaranteed

issue) or vary premiums to reflect health status aside for limited adjustments for age and

smoking status (community rating) (Kirk, 2000; McDonough et al., 2006). A health insurance

exchange, the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority, offers plans developed by

licensed health insurance companies for those without access to group markets. Enrollment on

the Connector began in October 2006 for those with incomes below 100% of the federal poverty

line (FPL), in January 2007 for those up to 300% FPL, and in May 2007 for everyone else.

Additionally, private health insurance plans are required to provide coverage for young adults on

their parents’ plans for up to two years after they are no longer dependents or until their 26th

birthday (McDonough et al., 2006).2

        This first leg alone would likely lead to adverse selection and a “death spiral” with rising

premiums gradually driving healthy individuals out of the non-group market. The second leg of

the three-legged stool therefore involves mandates requiring adults to be covered by health

insurance and employers to provide health insurance. Individuals without adequate coverage face

a penalty of half of the lowest premium they would have paid in a Health Connector-certified

plan. Employers with more than 10 employees must make a “fair and reasonable” contribution

toward an employer health insurance plan or pay a state assessment of up to $295 per full-time

equivalent worker per year (Massachusetts Health Insurance Connector Authority, 2008).3 The

mandates took effect in July 2007.

        To help low- and middle-income households be financially able to comply with the

mandate, the third leg of the Massachusetts reform provides subsidies and Medicaid expansions.


2
  Guaranteed issue and community rating have been in place in Massachusetts since 1996. The 1996 law only
allowed premiums to vary with age and geography; Chapter 58 further allowed them to vary with tobacco use. The
insurance exchange and the requirement regarding young adults on their parents’ plans both started with Chapter 58.
3 Minimum requirements plans must meet to satisfy the mandates include coverage for prescription drugs and

preventive and primary care, as well as maximums on deductibles and out-of-pocket spending.


                                                        2
Chapter 58 specifies that health insurance be free for people below 150% FPL and that premiums

be subsidized on a sliding scale between 150% and 300% FPL with no deductibles.4 The reform

also expands Medicaid to cover children below 300% FPL (McDonough et al., 2006).

        Taking into account the costs of the subsidies and Medicaid expansions as well as the

savings from reduced safety net payments, Raymond (2009) estimates the annual fiscal cost of

the reform to be $707 million. Through a waiver allowing for a more flexible use of federal

Medicaid matching money, half of this amount comes from the federal government, leaving the

state government’s share at $353 million.

        Table 1 compares Massachusetts’ approach to incremental universalism with that of the

Affordable Care Act. Though there are differences in some of the details, both the Massachusetts

and national reforms were clearly motivated by the same “three-legged stool” approach to

incremental universalism. Both featured guaranteed issue, community rating, insurance

exchanges, mandates, Medicaid expansions, and subsidies. For these reasons, analyzing the

effects of health care reform in Massachusetts provides the best available predictor to date of the

implications of the Affordable Care Act.

        Given that recent nature of the Massachusetts reform, researchers are only beginning to

understand its impacts. Long et al. (2009) find that by 2008 the uninsured rate decreased by 6.6

percentage points for the overall nonelderly population and 17.3 percentage points for lower-

income adults.5 Long and Stockely (2011) find a decrease in unmet medical needs because of

cost among lower income adults but also some evidence of delays in care from being unable to

find a provider. Yelowitz and Cannon (2010) show that Chapter 58’s impact on coverage was


4
  For instance, in 2008 a family with an income between 150% and 200% of the poverty line paid a premium of $35
per adult, while a family with an income in the 250% to 300% range paid $105 per adult.
5 These results support preliminary evidence found by Long (2008) using information from 2006 and 2007.




                                                      3
mitigated by the crowding out of private insurance. They also investigate the effect on self-

assessed health, finding mixed results: an increase in the probability of individuals reporting at

least good health but a decrease in the probability of reporting at least very good health. Cogan et

al. (2010) estimate that the reform increased employer-sponsored insurance premiums by about

6%. Kolstad and Kowalski (2010) show that the reform reduced levels of uninsurance by 36%

among the population of hospital discharges. Length of stay and the number of inpatient

admissions originating from the emergency room both decreased, with some evidence also

suggesting an increase in the utilization of preventive services, a decline in hospitalizations for

preventable conditions, and an improvement in quality of care. Miller (2011a) finds a reduction

in non-urgent emergency room visits, consistent with the newly-insured having access to such

care in other settings. Miller (2011b) focuses on children’s outcomes, finding a substitution from

emergency room care to office visits, a reduction in medical needs unmet because of cost, and an

increase in the probability of reporting excellent health. Kowalski and Kolstad (2012) exploit the

reform’s effect on employer-provided health insurance to show that wage reductions almost

completely offset the cost of health insurance benefits.

       We contribute to this growing literature by conducting the most comprehensive analysis

to date of Chapter 58’s effect on the self-assessed health of adults. Though many open questions

remain about the reform’s effectiveness, as Gruber (2011b:190) writes, “the most significant of

these is the impact of reform on the health of citizens.” We utilize individual-level data from the

Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which allows for the use of longer pre-




                                                 4
and post-treatment periods, a much larger sample, and a broader range of health-related

questions than Yelowitz and Cannon (2010), enabling us to obtain clearer results.6

         First, an ordered probit difference-in-differences analysis shows that the reform increased

the probability of individuals reporting excellent or very good health. A variety of robustness

checks and placebo tests support a causal interpretation of the results. The estimates imply that

annual government spending per adult transitioned into excellent or very good health is $11,465,

split evenly between the Massachusetts and federal governments. We then provide evidence that

the reform improved several determinants of overall health: physical health, mental health,

functional limitations, joint disorders, and body mass index. Next, we examine heterogeneity and

find that the reform’s effect on overall health was strongest for low-income people, racial

minorities, near-elderly adults, and women. Finally, we use the reform to instrument for

insurance coverage and estimate a large effect of coverage on health.


II. Health Insurance and Health

         An important part of the argument for universal coverage is the assumption that health

insurance improves health. As quoted by Yelowitz and Cannon (2010), Levy and Meltzer (2008)

write,

         The central question of how health insurance affects health, for whom it matters, and how
         much, remains largely unanswered at the level of detail needed to inform policy
         decisions. … Understanding the magnitude of health benefits associated with insurance is
         not just an academic exercise …, it is crucial to ensuring that the benefits of a given
         amount of public spending on health are maximized (p. 400).




6
  Specifically, Yelowitz and Cannon (2010) use Current Population Survey supplements and compare a pre-
treatment period of 2005-2006 with a post-treatment period of 2008. They conduct a difference-in-differences
analysis with other New England states as controls. Their sample size is 41,873. In contrast, we utilize data from
2001-2010 and have a sample size of 2,879,296 in our main analysis and 340,592 using only New England.


                                                        5
This section provides a brief summary of theoretical and empirical research on the topic and

summarizes our contribution to this broader literature.

       Grossman (1972) models health as a durable capital stock that is also an input in the

production of healthy time. Health capital depends on the initial endowment of health, past

period health, and past period investments made to preserve it. Medical care and time spent in

health producing activities are the main forms of health investment. Every period people face

uncertainty as to whether they will be affected by a negative health shock, so they buy health

insurance to protect themselves against unexpected medical costs. Because health insurance

reduces the price of care faced by the consumer it increases the demand for medical care (Arrow,

1963; Pauly, 1968). This increase in consumption of care could result in better health, but if the

additional medical care is redundant health outcomes may remain the same or even deteriorate.

This effect is sometimes known as “flat of the curve” medical care, because diminishing returns

in the health production function imply that at some point the health gains associated with more

medical care may be very small (Doyle, 2005).

       The majority of empirical investigations into the relationship between health insurance

and health are observational studies that use multivariate regression analysis. A review of these

studies by Hadley (2003) shows that 15 out of the 20 published between 1991 and 2001 found a

positive association between health insurance coverage and recovery from health conditions such

as cancer, trauma, and appendicitis. Health insurance was also associated with better overall

health status and lower mortality risk in all of the studies that examined these outcomes.

However, these relationships cannot be interpreted as causal because the research designs did not

address the potential for unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality.




                                                6
       During the 1970’s the RAND Health insurance experiment randomly assigned families to

health insurance plans with coinsurance rates ranging from 0% to 95%, with all medical

expenses covered over a threshold. Medical care use increased among people assigned to plans

with lower coinsurance rates, but health outcomes only improved among the poor (Manning et

al., 1987). However, this experiment only shows the impact of health insurance along the

intensive margin from less to more generous coverage, not the extensive margin of no coverage

to any coverage. It is also unclear to what extent findings from the 1970s are applicable today.

       Some studies have taken advantage of the plausibly exogenous variation provided by

public insurance programs like Medicaid and Medicare in order to address the endogeneity of

coverage. Currie and Gruber (1996a, 1996b) find that Medicaid expansions decrease infant

mortality and low birth weight, while Dafny and Gruber (2005) show that they also reduce

avoidable hospitalizations among children. Most recently, Finkelstein et al. (2011) exploit a 2008

Oregon lottery in which winners were given the chance to apply for Medicaid to show that

coverage improves self-reported physical and mental health. The randomization allows for clean

identification of the causal effects of Medicaid eligibility, at least among the low-income

uninsured lottery participants.

       Evidence on the effect of Medicare on the health of seniors is mixed. Card et al. (2004)

find that obtaining Medicare coverage at age 65 improves the self-assessed health of Hispanics

and people with low levels of education; however, the effect for the whole sample is smaller and

insignificant. Finkelstein and McKnight (2008) show that 10 years after the introduction of

Medicare there was not a statistically significant impact on mortality rates for people older than

65. Card et al. (2009) find more favorable results: a reduction in the 7-day mortality rate among

emergency room patients older than 65 compared to those right below that cutoff.



                                                7
       A few studies attempt to estimate the causal effect of insurance on health in contexts

other than public programs, again finding mixed results. Pauly (2005) uses marital status and

firm size as instruments for private insurance coverage and finds a positive but insignificant

effect of insurance on self-reported health and a negative but insignificant effect on the

probability of having a chronic condition. Doyle (2005) shows that uninsured patients receive

less medical care and have higher mortality rates than insured patients after a random health

shock (a car accident).

       To summarize, the extant literature suggests that health insurance coverage appears to

improve health in some contexts but not others. The uninsured in the U.S. consist of a number of

groups, including those too sick to obtain coverage, those too healthy to feel insurance is

necessary, and those too poor to afford private coverage but not poor enough to qualify for

public insurance programs. Obtaining universal coverage in the U.S. therefore requires coverage

expansions across a highly heterogeneous group, making it unclear the extent to which these

prior findings are applicable. The Massachusetts health care reform provides a unique

opportunity to examine an intervention that affects a variety of different categories of uninsured.


III. Data

       Health summarizes a combination of factors that reflect physical and mental well-being.

Among the usual indicators used to measure health in empirical investigations are mortality

rates, hospitalization rates, and self-assessments of overall health. Our study focuses on self-

assessments. At the time this paper was written, state-level mortality information was not

publically available for a long enough time after the reform to construct an adequate post-

treatment period. Regardless, examining mortality rates alone would not capture incremental

improvements in health resulting from, for instance, better treatment for chronic but non-life


                                                 8
threatening conditions. Hospitalizations are not an appropriate measure of overall health in this

context since, to the extent that hospitalizations are price sensitive, changes in hospitalizations

after the reform might simply be due to the lower price faced by the newly insured rather than

changes in health.

        We estimate the effect of the reform on health self-assessments using the BRFSS, a

telephone survey of health and health behaviors conducted by state health departments in

collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The BRFSS, which consists

of repeated annual cross sections of randomly-sampled adults, is well suited for our analysis for

several reasons. First, the dataset contains the necessary variables, including multiple self-

reported health measures, demographic characteristics, and state, month, and year identifiers.

Second, the BRFSS spans a long enough time period to examine both post-reform outcomes and

pre-reform trends. Third, the BRFSS contains an unusually large number of observations for

survey data, and a large sample is critical to obtaining meaningful precision when examining the

impact of a state-level program with effects that might be concentrated amongst only a fraction

of the population.

        We construct the sample as follows. We begin with ten-year window surrounding the

reform, 2001 to 2010. The treatment group consists of individuals living in Massachusetts, while

the initial control group spans most of the rest of the country. We exclude only California,

Maine, Vermont, and Oregon – states that also had (less extensive) health care reforms during

the sample period and could therefore be considered “treated” to some extent – as well as

Hawaii, the only state not included in the BRFSS in every survey year during the sample period.7


7
  Finkelstein et al. (2012) show that the concurrent large-scale Medicaid expansion in Oregon improved self-
assessed adult health, while Kolstad and Kowalski (2010) mention the reforms in California, Vermont, and Maine.
Results including the five omitted states in the control group are very similar and are available upon request.


                                                      9
Following much of the literature (e.g. Long, 2008; Miller, 2011a; Yelowitz and Cannon, 2010),

we focus on the non-elderly adult population ages 18-64. The reform had little effect on health

insurance coverage for the elderly, as it specifically prevented individuals eligible for Medicare

from purchasing insurance through the Connector (Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts,

2006). Moreover, the pre-treatment trends in many of our health measures for the elderly are

substantially different for Massachusetts and the control states, suggesting that our difference-in-

differences identification strategy would not be appropriate for this age group.8 As we will show,

the pre-treatment trends are much more similar for the non-elderly population.

        Our main dependent variable is a self-reported health index asking respondents to rate

their overall health as poor (0), fair (1), good (2), very good (3), or excellent (4). This index has

been previously used by other studies analyzing the impact of health insurance on health (Card et

al., 2004; Pauly, 2005; Yelowitz and Cannon, 2010) and has been repeatedly shown to be

correlated with objective measures of health such as mortality (e.g. Idler and Benyamini, 1997;

DeSalvo et al., 2006; Phillips et al., 2010). According to Idler and Benyamini, another advantage

of the index is that it is a global measure of health that captures the full range of diseases and

limitations a person may have.

        The primary concern with the self-reported health index is its subjective nature. We will

be able to flexibly control for the sources of reporting heterogeneity identified in the literature,

such as age, income, and gender (Ziebarth, 2010). Nonetheless, the estimated effect of the reform

on self-assessed health could still reflect factors beyond objective health. For instance, improved

access to medical care might increase awareness about medical conditions, causing one to self-

report a lower health status after obtaining insurance coverage, ceteris paribus (Strauss and

8Miller (2011a) makes the same observation about pre-treatment trends in the context of the reform’s effect on
emergency room utilization.


                                                     10
Thomas, 2007). In this case, the reform’s effect on self-assessed health would be smaller than its

effect on objective health. Alternatively, if the peace of mind from having health insurance

influences one’s answers to subjective health-related questions, the reform could lead to larger

improvements in self-assessed health than objective health.

         Consequently, we also utilize a number of other health-related dependent variables in an

attempt to verify that the results for the overall self-reported health index are not driven merely

by subjectivity. First, we consider number of days out of the past 30 not in good physical health

and number of days out of the past 30 not in good mental health. These variables are somewhat

less subjective than the overall health index because the respondents are specifically asked to

consider a particular component of health. Even less subjective is the next health measure:

number of days out of the past 30 with health-related functional limitations. Our last four health-

related dependent variables – an indicator for the presence of activity-limiting joint pain, body

mass index (BMI), minutes per week of physical activity, and an indicator for whether the

individual currently smokes – are quite specific and therefore the least open to subjective

interpretation.9 10

         We measure coverage with a binary variable reflecting whether or not the individual has

“any kind of health care coverage, including health insurance, prepaid plans such as HMOs, or

government plans such as Medicare.” The BRFSS does not indicate the source of coverage or

9
  BMI=weight in kilograms divided by height in squared meters. Self-reported weight and height are potentially
susceptible to biases. Some researchers utilize an adjustment developed by Cawley (2004) that predicts actual height
and weight based on self-reported height and weight using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,
and then applies the prediction equation to other datasets that only include the self-reported measures. However,
studies with BMI as the dependent variable have repeatedly found that applying this adjustment has little influence
on the results, so we do not use it here (e.g. Courtemanche et al., 2011).
10
   Minutes per week of physical activity is the sum of minutes of moderate and vigorous physical activity. The
BRFSS gives respondents guidance for how to define moderate and vigorous physical activity, reducing the
subjectivity of these variables. Moderate activities include “brisk walking, bicycling, vacuuming, gardening, or
anything else that causes small increases in breathing or heart rate.” Vigorous activities include “running, aerobics,
heavy yard work, or anything else that causes large ncreases in breathing or heart rate.”


                                                         11
provide any information on premiums, deductibles, or copayments. Finally, we utilize as control

variables the BRFSS’ information on age, marital status, race, income, education, marital status,

and current pregnancy status.

        We also include four state-level variables as controls in a robustness check. The first is

monthly state unemployment rate, obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Next, monthly

state cigarette excise tax rates come from The Tax Burden on Tobacco (Orzechowski and

Walker, 2010) and are adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index for all urban

consumers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Finally, we use annual state hospital and

physician data from the Census Bureau to impute monthly estimates of numbers of hospitals and

physicians per 100,000 residents.11

        Tables 2 and 3 compare the descriptive statistics for Massachusetts and the 45 control

states (44 states plus the District of Columbia) in the pre-treatment period of January 2001

through March 2006. Prior to the reform, Massachusetts was already healthier than the rest of the

country along most dimensions and had a higher coverage rate. Massachusetts residents averaged

higher income and more education than those in other states, and were more likely to be single

and white. Massachusetts also had a relatively low unemployment rate, high cigarette tax, high

physician density, and low hospital density. These baseline differences illustrate the difficulty in

isolating the causal impact of Massachusetts’ health care reform. A naïve estimator using only a

post-treatment cross section would attribute the entire difference in health between

Massachusetts and other states to the reform, including the part of the difference that was already

present prior to its enactment. Our empirical analysis will therefore rely on a difference-in-



11
  Monthly estimates were calculated using the formula:                     , where   and   are annual
estimates, and is number of months from      to           .

differences estimator that controls for pre-treatment differences in state health as well as a

number of time-varying observable characteristics.

       As a precursor to the regression analysis, Figure 1 plots the average values of the health

status index in Massachusetts and the control states every year from 2001 to 2010, along with

their 95% confidence intervals. The graph also shows linear pre-treatment trends for

Massachusetts and the other states, computed by regressing the mean health index on year plus a

constant term. Consistent with the summary statistics from Table 2, Massachusetts residents had

better average self-assessed health than those in the control states even before the reform.

Despite this difference in baseline levels, the pre-treatment trends in both Massachusetts and the

other states were both downward sloping and – critically for the validity of the difference-in-

differences approach – close to parallel. The year-to-year fluctuations in the control states in the

pre-treatment period are estimated very precisely and lie almost exactly on top of the trend line,

while the year-to-year fluctuations in Massachusetts are estimated much less precisely and

deviate more substantially. This underscores the importance of utilizing a sufficiently long pre-

treatment period in the regression analysis. If, for instance, 2005 – a year in which health in

Massachusetts appears to have been below trend – was the only pre-treatment year, a difference-

in-differences estimate might capture mean reversion in addition to the causal effect.

       Over the period after the reform was passed, 2006-2010, health in the control states

remained relatively stable (perhaps dropping slightly) while health in Massachusetts improved.

In 2006, when the subsidies and Medicaid expansions took effect in the early stages of the

reform’s implementation, health increased in both Massachusetts and the control states, but the

gain in Massachusetts was larger. In 2007, health dropped in the control states but increased

slightly in Massachusetts. Health improved slightly in the control states in 2008 while remaining



                                                13
steady in Massachusetts. In 2009, health improved in both groups but by a larger amount in

Massachusetts. Health in 2010 dropped in the control states but held constant in Massachusetts.

To more formally investigate whether the health improvement in Massachsuetts relative to the

control states was a causal response to health care reform, we next turn to regression analysis.

The regression results will broadly support the preliminary findings from Figure 1, although we

will see that in a regression context the health benefits did not emerge until 2007.


IV. Regression Analysis


IVa. Baseline Model

         We estimate the impact of Massachusetts health care reform on overall self-assessed

health status using an ordered probit difference-in-differences model.12 Suppose the underlying

relationship between the covariates and a latent variable representing health ( ∗ ) is given by
           ∗
                                 ∗                         ∗                                                       (1)

where i, s, and t are indices for individual, state, and month/year combination (e.g. January

2001).         is a dummy variable for whether the respondent lives in Massachusetts. Following

Kolstad and Kowalski (2010), we define                         as a dummy variable equal to 1 from April

2006 to June 2007, the time period after the law had been passed but before all the key

provisions had been implemented.                   is a dummy variable equal to 1 starting in July of 2007,

when the final major component of the reform – the individual mandate – took effect.




12 Given the strong distributional assumptions made by the ordered probit model, we also considered two more
flexible approaches to modeling the impact of the reform on health. The first estimates a series of four probits with
the dependent variables being indicators for fair or better, good or better, very good or better, and excellent health.
The second uses the same dependent variables but estimates linear probability models. The conclusions reached are
the same; the results are shown in Appendix Tables A1 and A2.

         We do not observe                     and instead observe an ordinal health measure      such that

where      through        are constants that represent the cut-off points. An ordered probit regression

of       on the covariates from (1) computes the following probabilities of being in each of the

five health states:

          Pr         0     Φ                        ∗                   ∗                                      (3)

          Pr                                                                                                   (4)
               Φ               ∗                            ∗
               Φ                   ∗                            ∗                            ∀ ∈ 2,3,4

          Pr         4     1       Φ                    ∗                   ∗                                  (5)

where                    , the cutoff points adjusted for the constant term. The coefficient of interest is

     , which captures the difference between the change in Massachusetts from the “before” to the

“after” period and the change in the control states from the “before” to the “after” period – in

other words, the “difference in differences.”

         Computing treatment effects in non-linear models has been the source of confusion in the

literature. Ai and Norton (2003) showed that the cross difference in a nonlinear model is

different from the marginal effect on the interaction term, and could even be the opposite sign.
13
   The controls are especially important in our context, as the Massachusetts reform could have caused uninsured
individuals to move to the state, changing the underlying demographic composition of the state’s residents and
potentially confounding the estimation of the reform’s causal effect. (The pooled cross-sectional nature of the
BRFSS does not allow us to exclude Massachusetts residents who moved there after the reform.) Indeed, using the
control variables as dependent variables shows that after the reform Massachusetts’ population became older, less
white, and poorer, relative to the control states. Accordingly, excluding the control variables from equation (1)
attenuates the estimated effect of the reform somewhat (although the sign and significance level remains the same).


                                                                15
However, Puhani (2008) showed that the cross difference identified by Ai and Norton (2003) is

not the same as the treatment effect, and that when the treatment effect is the parameter of

interest it is appropriate to focus on the coefficient of the interaction term. A similar observation

has been made by Terza (2012). Following Puhani (2008), our “treatment effect on the treated”

is given by

                   1,                      1                  |               1,            1, ,                             |           1,   1, ,   (6)

where        and   are potential outcomes with and without treatment. The “average treatment

effect on the treated” is the mean of this treatment effect across those individuals living in

Massachusetts in the “after” period (July 2007 through December 2009).

        Because of the nonlinearity of the model, the treatment effect depends on the value of the

other covariates. The effects of the reform on the probabilities of being in each of the five health

states among the treated are

         ,    ,    0                   Φ                          ,   ,                                  Φ                       ,   ,               (7)

where the state subscript has been replaced by                                              for Massachusetts, and is restricted to the

“after” period.

        The key identifying assumption in the difference-in-differences model is that                                                                 ∗

          and       ∗                                  are uncorrelated with the error term. In other words, the estimates

can be interpreted as causal effects of the reform if we assume that in the absence of the reform

changes over time in health would have been the same in Massachusetts and the control states,


                                                                                   16
conditional on the control variables. The similarity of Massachusetts’ pre-treatment trend in

health to that of the other states shown in Figure 1 provides preliminary support for this

assumption. We therefore use all 45 other states as the control group in the baseline regression,

and consider several alternatives in Section IVb.

           Our standard errors in the baseline regression are heteroskedasticity-robust and clustered

by state. As shown by Bertrand et al. (2004), conventional difference-in-differences methods can

over-reject the null hypothesis because of serial correlation even when standard errors are

clustered. We therefore use more stringent standards for statistical significance than usual: 0.1%,

1%, and 5% significance levels. In Section IVd we will more formally investigate whether

underestimated standard errors could be driving our conclusions.

           The first column of Table 4 reports the coefficient estimates for                    ∗          and

       ∗           from the ordered probit regression, along with the average treatment effects on the

treated in the after period.14              ∗           is insignificant and its coefficient estimate is small,

while          ∗          is significant at the 0.1% level and its coefficient estimate is considerably

larger. In other words, the reform’s effect on health did not emerge until it was fully

implemented. The t-statistic for                 ∗          is 5, meaning that our clustered standard errors

would have to be underestimated by a factor of more than 2.5 for the statistical significance to be

driven by autocorrelation.

           The estimated average treatment effects show that the Massachusetts health care reform

decreased the probabilities of being in poor, fair and good health and increased the probabilities

of being in very good and excellent health. The drops in the probabilities of being in poor, fair,

                                                            17
and good health are 0.2, 0.4, and 0.7 percentage points, respectively, while the increases in the

probabilities of being in very good and excellent health are 0.1 and 1.1 percentage points.

        We next conduct two back-of-the-envelope calculations to help assess the economic

significance of these estimates. The first consolidates the five treatment effects into a single

measure that attempts to quantify the overall increase in health. We multiply each of the

treatment effects by the value of the health status index associated with the corresponding

category (0 for poor, 1 for fair, 2 for good, 3 for very good, and 4 for excellent), and then divide

by the sample standard deviation. This result is an overall effect on health of 0.029 standard

deviations, shown in the third-to-last row of Table 4.15 The magnitude of the impact therefore

appears modest across the entire population, but perhaps large amongst the small fraction of the

population who experienced a change in coverage as a result of the reform and is likely

responsible for most of the effect.

        The second calculation combines the estimated treatment effects with the information on

the reform’s costs from the introduction to compute the annual fiscal cost for each adult

transitioned from poor, fair, or good health to very good or excellent health. We do this first

considering total government spending (federal and state), and then using only Massachusetts’

share of that spending. The former provides a more relevant projection for national health care

reform, while the latter is more relevant for evaluations of the Massachusetts reform. 1.2% of the

adult population transitioned into very good or excellent health. The adult population in

Massachusetts was 5,138,919 in July 2010 according to the Census, so 1.2% translates to 61,667

individuals. Since the reform cost an estimated $707 million in FY2010, total government


15
  This calculation should be interpreted with caution, as it relies on the strong assumption that each incremental
increase in the health index represents the same improvement in health.



                                                       18
spending is an estimated $11,465 per year for every adult whose health improves from poor, fair,

or good to very good or excellent. Since Massachusetts splits the costs evenly with the federal

government, the state spends approximately $5,732 annually per adult transitioned into very

good or excellent health. These calculations are far from complete cost-effectiveness analyses, as

they ignore costs to patients and private insurers as well as benefits from consumption

smoothing/risk protection and improvements in children’s health. They do, however, provide

some information about the returns to government spending while underscoring the point that

financing universal coverage at the federal level is likely to be more difficult than in

Massachusetts, as matching money is not available.


IVb. Robustness Checks

        This section further examines the validity of the identifying assumption of common

counterfactual health trends between Massachusetts and the rest of the country by considering a

number of alternative control groups and adding state-level covariates. First, we use as the

control group the ten states with the most similar pre-treatment average health status indices to

Massachusetts (“match on pre-treatment levels”). Second, we “match on pre-treatment trends”

by running regressions of health on time (measured in months) plus a constant term for each state

from 2001-2005 and then choosing as the comparison group the ten states with the most similar

slopes to Massachusetts. Next, we use a control group of the ten states with the most similar pre-

reform health insurance coverage rates (“match on pre-treatment coverage”).16 We then consider



16
   When matching on pre-treatment levels, the control states are Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia,
Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Utah, South Dakota and Virginia. When matching on pre-
treatment trends, the control states are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Washington. When matching on pre-treatment coverage, the control states are
Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and
Wisconsin.


                                                      19
a control group consisting of other New England states because of their geographic proximity to

Massachusetts.17

         The fifth robustness check constructs a “synthetic control group” for Massachusetts, as

described by Abadie et al. (2010). We first aggregate to the state-by-year level and allow the data

to select the combination of the other 50 states that best matches Massachusetts on health status

and the control variables during the pre-treatment years 2001-2005.18 The resulting control group

is 70.5% Connecticut, 13.7% Washington, D.C., 0.3% New Hampshire, and 15.5% Washington

state. Following Fitzpatrick’s (2008) application of this method to individual data, we then

multiply the weights for the individual-level observations by these shares, leaving Massachusetts

fully weighted and dropping the states that received a zero weight.19

         The next regression uses the original control group of 45 states but excludes the year

2005. Recall from Figure 1 that in 2005 health in Massachusetts was below the trend line, raising

the question of whether the improvement in health from 2005 to 2006 could be due to a

temporary negative shock in 2005 rather than the reform in 2006. The long pre-treatment period

mitigates this concern by tempering 2005’s influence, but dropping 2005 addresses it directly.20

         Finally, we return to the full sample but control for the potential time-varying state-level

confounders unemployment rate, cigarette tax rate, physician density, and hospital density, along


17
   Recall that the New England states Vermont and Maine were excluded from the main control group because they
had their own (less intensive) health care reforms during the sample period. We include them in the New England
control group, but we have verified in an unreported regression that the results are similar if we exclude them and
just use Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire.
18
   We do this using the Stata module “synth” (Abadie et al., 2011). For health status, we include average health
during all five pre-treatment years, as well as average health in the first and last pre-treatment years 2001 and 2005.
This accounts for both pre-treatment levels (the overall average) and trends (the first and last pre-treatment years).
19
   In the “matching on pre-treatment levels,” “matching on pre-treatment trends,” New England, and synthetic
control regressions, the number of states is 11 or fewer. Angrist and Pischke (2008) note that standard errors
clustered by state are unreliable when the number of states is small. As they recommend, we instead cluster standard
errors at the state-by-year level in these four regressions.
20
   Other unreported robustness checks experimented with the use of shorter pre-treatment periods beginning in 2002,
2003, or 2004. The results remained similar.


                                                         20
with linear state-specific time trends to allow for differential trends in health along unobservable

dimensions.21 Controlling for unemployment rate and cigarette tax could be especially important

given the differential impacts of the recession across states and the large cigarette tax increase

passed in Massachusetts in 2009.

        We present the results of these robustness checks in Columns 2 through 8 of Table 4. The

coefficient of the interaction term                   ∗             remains insignificant in almost all

specifications, while the interaction term                     ∗         remains highly significant in all

specifications. The magnitude of the coefficient estimate for                   ∗          ranges from 0.026 to

0.053, so the baseline estimate is toward the conservative end of that range. The treatment effects

are also generally similar across specifications. The effect on: P(Poor) ranges from -0.001 to -

0.003, P(Fair) ranges from -0.003 to -0.006, P(Good) ranges from -0.005 to -0.010, P(Very

Good) ranges from 0.001 to 0.002, and P(Excellent) ranges from 0.008 to 0.017.


IVc. Testing for Differential Pre-Treatment Trends and Delayed Effects

        This section simultaneously addresses two possible issues with the estimates from Table

4. First, the difference-in-differences approach assumes common counterfactual health trends

between Massachusetts and the rest of the country. The robustness of the estimates to different

constructions of the control group is consistent with this assumption, but conceivably health

trends in Massachusetts could be so unique that no appropriate comparison group of states exists.

Second, the preceding regressions do not differentiate between the short- and long-run health

effects of the reform following full implementation. Since health is a capital stock accumulated

21
   We relegate the state-level control variables to a robustness check rather than using them in the main analysis
because of concerns that some of them – in particular physician density and hospital density –could be endogenous
to health care reform. Moreover, the four state-level controls are all individually and jointly insignificant, so the
state fixed effects appear to sufficiently capture their influence on health, at least conditional on the individual
controls.


                                                          21
through repeated investments, the improvements in health resulting from the reform could

increase over time. Alternatively, the long-term uninsured might experience a pent-up demand

for medical services after obtaining coverage, in which case the entire improvement in health

could be reached quickly or even be temporary.

        We address these issues by re-estimating equation (1) with a broader set of interaction

terms. First, we split the “before” and “after” periods into halves, resulting in five periods called

“early before,” “late before,” “during,” “early after,” and “late after.” 22 We then include

interactions of the Massachusetts dummy with indicators for each one of these periods, except

“early before,” which is considered the reference period. A second regression interacts

Massachusetts with a full set of year dummies. These models test the common trends assumption

by testing for differential trends between Massachusetts and other states in the pre-treatment

period. If the treatment and control groups were trending similarly before the reform, then they

likely would have continued to trend similarly from 2006-2010 if the reform had not occurred.

The models also distinguish between short- and long-run effects by including multiple

interactions from the post-reform period.

        Table 5 displays the coefficient estimates for the interaction terms. The regression

splitting the before and after periods into halves shows that health trends in Massachusetts and

other states were similar across the “early before,” “late before,” and “during” periods, with a

sizeable gap emerging in the “early after” period that grew somewhat in the “late after” period.

The difference between the coefficient estimates for              ∗                 and       ∗                is

not significant, though, so the evidence that the effect strengthened over time is not conclusive.



22
 Specifically, “early before” consists of months 1-31 of the pre-treatment period while “late before” consists of
months 32-63. “Early after” consists of the first 21 months of the after period and “late after” the last 21.


                                                      22
         Turning to the regression with one-year splits, there is again little evidence of differential

pre-treatment trends, with the one exception being the temporary negative health shock in

Massachusetts in 2005 that we observed earlier in Figure 1. (Recall that the regression excluding

2005 from Table 4 provides evidence that this shock is not meaningfully influencing our

conclusions.) A positive interaction effect first emerges in 2007 – the first year in which the

reform was fully implemented – and the magnitude of the effect remains roughly similar through

2010. In sum, the results from Table 5 do not provide clear evidence of differential pre-treatment

trends between Massachusetts and the control states, or the effects being either delayed or

temporary.


IVd. Tests Related to Inference

         This section conducts tests to help rule out the possibility that the statistical significance

observed in the baseline regression is merely an artifact of underestimated standard errors. First,

following Bertrand et al.’s (2004) suggestion, we compress all the available data into a state-

level panel with three time periods – “before”, “during”, and “after” – and regress state average

health index on          ∗            ,     ∗           , and state and time period fixed effects. Next, we

compress the data into only two cross-sectional units – Massachusetts and other states – and ten

years, defining 2006 and 2007 as the “during” period and 2008 to 2010 as the “after” period. We

then regress average health index on                ∗           ,      ∗         , a Massachusetts dummy, and

year fixed effects.23 As shown in Table 6,                 ∗          remains statistically significant in both




23The small sample sizes preclude the inclusion of the full set of control variables. In lieu of these, we include in
both regressions a single control variable that summarizes the influence of all the controls at once. This variable,
which we call “predicted health status,” is computed by regressing the health index on the controls in individual-
level regressions using the pre-treatment data, then using the coefficient estimates to predict the health index for the
whole sample, then aggregating to the appropriate level.

regressions despite the small sample, and the effect sizes in standard deviations (of the

individual-level health index) are similar to those from Table 4.

        In the spirit of Abadie et al. (2010), we also consider a different approach to inference

and ask how likely it would be to estimate similarly large health improvements simply by

picking any state at random. We re-estimate the baseline ordered probit regression with each of

the 45 control states as the “treated” unit, considering the p-value for Massachusetts to be the

proportion of these states that exhibited as large a health improvement as that estimated for

Massachusetts (i.e. the probability a health improvement as large as the one seen in

Massachusetts would be observed in a random draw). Since Abaide et al. (2010) specifically

recommended this method for use with the synthetic control approach, we also repeat the

analysis but using a synthetic control group for each state rather than the full control group. In

the full sample regressions, four states – Florida, New Jersey, New York, and Tennessee – had

larger health improvements in the after period than Massachusetts, for a p-value of 0.089. Using

synthetic controls, only two states – Florida and Tennessee – had larger gains than

Massachusetts, for a p-value of 0.044.24


IVe. Other Health Outcomes

        This section moves beyond the overall health index and explores the effect of the reform

on a variety of additional health outcomes: number of days out of the past 30 not in good

physical health, not in good mental health, and with health-related functional limitations;

activity-limiting joint pain; BMI; minutes per week of physical activity; and smoking status.

These variables were chosen because they satisfy two conditions: 1) they are strongly and


24
  We do not report the full set of results for all 45 states due to space considerations; they are available upon
request.


                                                      24
significantly correlated with the overall health index in the expected direction (as shown in

Appendix Table A3), and 2) they do not rely on a doctor’s diagnosis, since a diagnosis requires

medical access which is endogenous to the reform.25

         Analyzing health outcomes beyond the overall self-assessed health index serves three

purposes. First, verifying that we also observe improvements in health using more specific (and

therefore less subjective) questions increases our confidence that the reform did in fact improve

objective – and not merely subjective – health. Second, examining additional outcomes sheds

light on the mechanisms through which the effect on overall health occurred. For instance,

obtaining health insurance can improve physical (or mental) health through increased utilization

of medical services, mental health through lower stress from reduced financial risk, or health

behaviors through expanded access to advice and information. Third, including the health

behavior-related variables BMI and smoking tests a separate prediction of economic theory:

insurance coverage reduces financial vulnerability to health shocks, which could cause people to

take more health risks, a phenomenon known as “ex ante moral hazard” (e.g. Dave and Kaestner,

2009; Bhattacharya et al., 2011).

         Days not in good physical and mental health, days with health-related limitations, and

minutes of exercise per week are non-negative count variables with variances higher than the

means. We therefore estimate negative binomial models for these outcomes. The conditional

expectation is given by

                     |    ,                                                                                     (11)




25
  The first condition excludes, for instance, alcoholic drinks per month, which is only weakly correlated with health
and in the opposite of the expected direction. The second condition excludes BRFSS questions that ask whether a
respondent has ever been diagnosed with a particular chronic condition, such as diabetes and asthma.


                                                        25
where                    is the number of days or minutes,           is the over-dispersion coefficient, and     is

defined by

                          exp               ∗                             ∗                                    (12)

The treatment effect on the treated is defined as

             ,       ,      exp             ,   ,                        exp          ,   ,                    (13)

while the average treatment effect on the treated is the mean of among Massachusetts residents

in the “after” period.

           For the binary outcome variables (activity-limiting joint pain and smoking status), we

estimate probit models of the form

          Pr                 1                                                                                 (14)

                 Φ                   ∗                       ∗

with the treatment effect on the treated being

             ,       ,      Φ                                        Φ                            . 26         (15)

Body mass index is continuous, so we estimate a linear regression in which the treatment effect

is simply the coefficient estimate for                ∗          .

           Some of the health-related questions were not asked in Massachusetts in certain years,

necessitating restrictions to the sample. Activity-limiting joint pain and the two measures of

exercise are only available in odd-numbered survey years, meaning that the “during” period

spans only six months (January 2007 to June 2007). We therefore combine those six months with

the rest of 2007 and 2009 and classify the two years as the “after” period, dropping the                         ∗

             interaction from those regressions. Additionally, the physical health, mental health, and

health limitations variables are not available in 2002.

26
     We include cigarette tax as an additional covariate in the smoking regression.


                                                           26
        Table 7 presents the results. We use the full control group because, as shown in Appendix

Figures A1-A7, the pre-treatment trends for these other health outcomes are similar for the full

control group and Massachusetts. 27 Health care reform in Massachusetts is associated with

reductions in the number of days not in good physical health, not in good mental health, and with

health-related functional limitations, as well as a lower probability of having activity-limiting

joint pain. The magnitudes of these reductions range from 0.013 to 0.041 standard deviations,

roughly similar to the size of the effect for the overall health status index. It therefore seems

unlikely that the observed effect on the health index is driven purely by the subjectivity of the

question. Moreover, these results suggest that the reform improved health more broadly than

merely by reducing stress from lower financial risk.

        Turning to the health-behavior related variables, the reform is associated with a 0.040

standard deviation reduction in BMI, but no statistically detectable effect on exercise or

smoking. The drop in BMI suggests that expanded access to medical care improves at least some

weight-related behaviors, perhaps through information or accountability. Moreover, the lack of

an effect on exercise suggests that dietary changes are responsible for the weight loss, although

the BRFSS does not contain sufficient information during our sample period to test this directly.

The non-effect on smoking is consistent with evidence that smoking habits respond only

gradually to external factors (e.g. Courtemanche, 2009), but could also reflect the health

consequences of smoking already being widely-known even without physician access.

Importantly, none of the regressions provide any evidence of ex-ante moral hazard causing

individuals to take more health risks after obtaining insurance.


27Specifically, the pre-treatment trend lines for Massachusetts and the control states are very similar for physical
health, health limitations, joint pain, BMI, exercise, and smoking. The pre-treatment trends are somewhat different
for mental health, but by an amount that could easily be attributed to sampling error.


                                                        27
         The final column of Table 7 presents the results using as the dependent variable a

“cardinalized overall health status index” equal to the predicted outcome from a regression of the

health index on the most plausibly objective health outcomes: functional limitations, joint pain,

BMI, exercise, and smoking (              0.15).28 This approach is advocated by Ziebarth et al. (2010)

and others as a way to handle reporting heterogeneity in self-assessed health. The impact of

     ∗         remains positive and significant, and the effect size in standard deviations is similar

to those from Table 4. This provides further evidence that our conclusions are not merely driven

by subjectivity.


IVf. Heterogeneity

         We next return to the actual overall health status index and examine heterogeneity in the

effect of Massachusetts health care reform on the bases of gender, age, race, and income. Kolstad

and Kowalski (2010) found the largest coverage expansions among men, young adults,

minorities, and those with low incomes. However, different effects on coverage do not

necessarily translate to different effects on health, as the impacts of coverage on health could

also be heterogeneous. We consider the following subsamples: women; men; ages 18-34, 35-44,

45-54, and 55-64; non-Hispanic whites; those of another race/ethnicity; and household incomes

below $25,000, between $25,000 and $75,000, and above $75,000.29 We choose these income

splits in order to loosely align with the provisions of the reform, which specify that health

insurance be free up to 150% FPL ($23,050 for a family of four) and subsidized up to 300%




28
  We also considered using all seven alternate health outcomes to make the prediction. The results were similar.
29
  We also ran regressions further dividing the category for those of another race/ethnicity into blacks, Hispanics,
and others, but the sample sizes became too small for meaningful differences to emerge.


                                                       28
($69,150 for a family of four).30 We estimate the baseline ordered probit model with the full

control group, as the pre-treatment trends for Massachusetts and the control states (shown in

Appendix Figures A8-A19) are similar for these subsamples.31

        Table 8 reports the results. The impact on health is positive and significant for both

women and men but stronger for women. Stratifying by age, the effect is largest among the near-

elderly aged 55-64, then about equal among those 18-34 and 45-54, and smallest (but still

positive and significant) among those 35-44. The reform improved health across both racial

groups, but the effect was largest for non-whites. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests

that the reform reduced health disparities between non-whites and whites by 5.3%.32 Stratifying

by income, the reform had by far the largest effect among those with incomes below $25,000, the

group eligible for the most generous subsidies. We observe moderate health improvements

among the middle income group, and smaller and statistically insignificant improvements for

those with high incomes.


IVg. Instrumental Variables

        We close the empirical analysis by using                 ∗           and        ∗         as instruments

to estimate the impact of having insurance coverage on health. This instrumental variables

approach requires stricter assumptions than the reduced-form model, as the reform must only


30
   2012 federal poverty lines are available at coverageforall.org/pdf/FHCE_FedPovertyLevel.pdf, accessed 6/26/12.
Since the BRFSS only reports income categories and lacks comprehensive information about household size, lining
up the categories to exactly match 150% and 300% of the poverty line is not possible.
31 Specifically, the pre‐treatment trend lines are almost identical for the subsamples of women, men, ages 35‐

44, ages 45‐54, ages 55‐64, and those with low incomes. The pre‐treatment trend lines look slightly different
for the race groups and those with middle or high incomes, but the differences are small enough that they
could be due merely to sampling error.
32 In Massachusetts in the “before” period, the mean health status indices of non-whites and whites were 2.559 and

2.898, respectively, for a difference of -0.339. The treatment effects imply changes in the health status indices of
non-whites and whites of 0.054 and 0.036, for a difference of 0.018. We therefore estimate that the reform reduced
racial health disparities by 5.3%.


                                                        29
impact health along the extensive margin of insurance coverage, conditional on the controls. This

assumption would be violated if the reform also influenced health through the intensive margin

of coverage, for instance by causing some individuals to switch from high-deductible

catastrophic coverage to more comprehensive coverage available through the Connector. This

assumption would also be violated if the reform affected the health of those who did not switch

insurance plans through system-wide changes to health care delivery or peer effects. Despite

these caveats, the instrumental variables analysis is useful because it estimates the magnitude of

the impact of insurance on health that would be necessary for the extensive margin to be the only

channel through which the reform influenced health. If the magnitude is implausibly large, then

other mechanisms must play a role as well.

        The first stage predicts insurance coverage using the following linear probability model:

                               ∗                      ∗                                       (15)

where        is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the person reported having any health insurance

coverage. Because of the non-linearity of the second stage, we utilize a two-stage residual

inclusion (2SRI) approach in which the residual from the first-stage regression is included as an

additional regressor in the second stage. Terza et al. (2008) show that in non-linear contexts

2SRI gives consistent coefficient estimates, while traditional two stage least squares does not.

The second stage is modeled as an ordered probit and the probabilities of being in each of the

five health states are given by,

        Pr         0     Φ                                                                    (16)

        Pr               Φ                                                  Φ                 (17)
                                                , ∀ ∈ 2,3,4

        Pr         4     1   Φ                                                                (18)




                                                30
where          is the first-stage residual. The effect of health insurance on the probability of being in

health state is

           ∆        Pr           |          1    Pr        |         0                              (19)

The asymptotic standard errors of these probabilities and the standard errors for the second stage

estimates were calculated following Terza (2011).33 Equation (19) represents the “local average

treatment effect” of insurance among those who obtained coverage as a result of the reform, and

is subject to the usual caveat regarding generalizability.

           Table 9 reports the coefficient estimates of interest from the first and second stage

regressions for the full sample, along with the estimated impacts of insurance on the health state

probabilities. The first stage estimates an increase in the coverage rate of 2.1 percentage points in

the “during” period and 5.6 percentage points in the “after” period. The F statistic from a test of

the joint significance of            ∗          and   ∗        is large, suggesting the instruments are

sufficiently strong. Turning to the second stage, obtaining insurance leads to a positive and

statistically significant improvement in health. The first-stage residual is significant and

negatively associated with health, providing evidence that an OLS estimator would suffer from a

downward bias. Insurance is estimated to reduce the probabilities of being in poor, fair, and good

health by 5.8, 9.2, and 8.5 percentage points, while increasing the probabilities of being in very

good and excellent health by 8.1 and 15.3 percentage points. The overall effect of insurance on

the health status index, encompassing changes in all five probabilities, is 0.594 of the sample

standard deviation.

           These effects are strikingly large, but assessing their plausibility requires a comparison to

other estimates from the literature. Finkelstein et al. (2011) employ the cleanest research design

to date among studies of the impact of insurance on self-assessed health: a randomized

intervention in Oregon granting Medicaid eligibility to a subset of the uninsured. They estimate

that Medicaid enrollment increases the probability of being in good, very good, or excellent

health by 13.3 percentage points. The sum of our estimated effects on the probabilities of being

in those three health states is a similar 14.9 percentage points. The results from the two papers

are not directly comparable given the differences in interventions and populations, but this

similarity suggests that it is at least conceivable that the reform’s entire effect on the self-

assessed health of the non-elderly could have occurred through the extensive margin of coverage.

Future research should more directly investigate the roles of other potential channels, in

particular the intensive margin of coverage.

       We also conduct instrumental variables analyses for the gender, race, age, and income

subgroups, allowing us to assess whether the heterogeneity in the reform’s effect on health

observed in Section IVf comes from heterogeneity in the effect on coverage or the effect of

coverage. Table 10 reports the results. The coverage expansions are larger for men than women,

but women have greater health gains from coverage, explaining the greater net effect of the

reform for women. Among the age subsamples, those under 35 years old have the largest gains in

coverage, but also the smallest health improvements from obtaining coverage. 55-64 year olds

have the smallest effect of the reform on coverage but the largest effect of coverage on health.

Stratifying by race shows that coverage rates increase the most for non-whites but that the health

effects of coverage are the largest for whites. Finally, the coverage expansions are by far the

largest for the low-income group, second largest for the middle-income group, and relatively

small for those with high incomes. However, the effect of coverage on health is the strongest for

the high income group.



                                               32
V. Conclusion

       This paper examined the effect of health care reform in Massachusetts on self-assessed

health using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). An ordered

probit difference-in-differences analysis showed that the reform increased the probability of

individuals reporting excellent or very good health while reducing their probability of reporting

good, fair, or poor health. These results were robust to alternative constructions of the control

group and the addition of state-level covariates. We did not find evidence that the estimates were

meaningfully impacted by differential pre-treatment trends, or that the short- and longer-run

effects were statistically different. Next, we examined a number of more specific health

outcomes and found improvements in physical health, mental health, functional limitations, joint

disorders, and body mass index. Evaluating heterogeneity revealed that those with low incomes,

minorities, near-elderly adults, and women experienced the largest gains in health as a result of

the reform. Finally, we used the reform as an instrument for health insurance coverage and

estimated a large positive impact of coverage on health.

       Perhaps the clearest limitation of our analysis is that all our health outcomes were self-

reported. Our finding of similar results across a range of health outcomes with varying degrees of

subjectivity increases our confidence that our findings largely represent “real” changes in

physical/mental health. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the observed

improvement in health could merely be due to a “warm glow” from acquiring health insurance.

To underscore this point, recall that our estimated effects of insurance on self-assessed health are

a similar magnitude to those of Finkelstein et al. (2011), and they found that a sizeable portion of

the reported health improvements following the Oregon experiment occurred prior to measurable

changes in overall health care utilization. Obtaining insurance coverage can reduce stress, which



                                                33
can directly improve numerous aspects of health even without any additional medical care being

utilized, but Finkelstein et al. (2011) do raise the question of what exactly the estimated

improvements in self-assessed health are capturing.

       We argue that Finkelstein et al.’s (2011) finding regarding timing does not automatically

apply to our context for several reasons. First, their data only tracked individuals for a year after

the intervention, while we have 4½ years of data after first of the newly-insured in Massachusetts

obtained coverage and 3½ years after all major facets of the reform took effect. If a “warm glow”

from acquiring insurance was driving the effect, we would have expected the reported health

benefits from the reform to diminish over time, but as Table 5 showed this was not the case.

Second, other studies have documented changes in health care utilization in Massachusetts either

before or around the same time as we observed health improvements (Kowalski and Kolstand,

2010; Miller, 2011a). Next, the newly insured in the Oregon experiment were winners of a

random lottery, which could lead to a stronger “warm glow” than simply acquiring health

insurance from a statewide intervention like the reform in Massachusetts. Accordingly, we

consistently find that the effects on health were statistically zero in the “during” period, which

includes nine months after those with incomes below 100% FPL became eligible for free

coverage. We therefore do not observe the immediate spike in self-assessed health seen in the

Oregon experiment. Nonetheless, as the necessary data become available it will be important to

evaluate the impact of the Massachusetts reform on unambiguously objective measures of health

such as mortality.

       Another natural question is the degree to which our results from Massachusetts can serve

as projections for the Affordable Care Act. The general strategies for obtaining nearly universal

coverage in both the Massachusetts and federal laws involved the same three-pronged approach



                                                 34
of non-group insurance market reforms, mandates, and subsidies, suggesting that the health

effects should be broadly similar. However, the federal legislation included additional cost-

cutting measures such as Medicare cuts that could potentially mitigate the gains in health from

the coverage expansions. On the other hand, baseline uninsured rates were unusually low in

Massachusetts, so the coverage expansions – and corresponding health improvements – from the

Affordable Care Act could potentially be greater. Of course, larger coverage expansions may

mean higher costs, and costs should be weighed against benefits when evaluating the welfare

implications of reform.

rather than state because of the small number of states. *** indicates statistically significant at the 0.1% level; ** 1% level; * 5 % level. All regressions include
the individual-level control variables, state fixed effects, and fixed effects for each month in each year. Observations are weighted using the BRFSS sampling
weights.

Notes: The coefficient estimates are equal to the treatment effects because the model is linear. Heteroskedasticity-
robust standard errors (clustered by state in the first column) are in parentheses. *** indicates statistically significant
at the 0.1% level; ** 1% level; * 5 % level. The first regression includes state fixed effects and dummies for the
during and after periods; the second regression includes year fixed effects and a dummy for MA. Both regressions
also control for “predicted health,” which is based on regressing health on the control variables in an individual-
level regression. The control group consists of all 45 states from the full control group in the first regression, and
one cross-sectional unit collapsing all individuals from these 45 states in the second regression. Observations are
weighted using the BRFSS sampling weights when aggregating.

Notes: A linear probability model is estimated in the first stage so the coefficient
estimate equals the treatment effect. Standard errors, heteroskedasticity-robust
and clustered by state, are in parentheses. *** indicates statistically significant at
the 0.1% level; ** 1% level; * 5 % level. All regressions include the individual-
level control variables, state fixed effects, and fixed effects for each month in
each year. The full control group is used. Observations are weighted using the
BRFSS sampling weights.
