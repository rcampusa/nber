                      Does Knowledge Intensity Matter?
               A Dynamic Analysis of Research and Development
                 Capital Utilization and Labor Requirements


                                  ABSTRACT


     In this paper we have developed a dynamic analysis of a firm under-

taking research and development (R&D) investment, physical capital accumulation

and utilization, along with labor requirement decisions. Empirical work has

found that there are significant costs to develop knowledge. Consequently,

R&D capital is treated as a quasi—fixed factor, along with the traditional

physical capital stock.

     A number of empirically relevant Implications arise from the analysis.

It is shown that along the dynamic path as the R&D intensity of physical capital

increases, knowledge per worker rises and the utilization rate of physical

capital decreases. We distinguish between the intertemporal movement of the firm,

and the response to unanticipated changes in demand and cost conditions. An

increase in product demand causes the firm to increase both the R&D growth rate

and the labor intensity of R&D capital. Contrary to a viewpoint held by many,

the R&D investment does not displace labor. Finally, our model provides a

framework to justify the empirically observed direct relationship between

the physical capital growth and utilization rates.

1. IntroductIon

    Recent empirical findings have suggested a number of interesting and

novel results on the role of research and develoçment in the production and

investment process of a firm. First, relative Input prices, such as the

real wage rate and the real user cost of physical capital significantly

affect R&D decisions, both in the short and long runs (see Rasmussen

[19731, Coldberg [1979], and Bernstein and Nadiri [1983]). Second, R&D

influences the ut±L:ation of physical capital. Indeed, it was found that

R&D expansion decras the rate of physical capital utilization, implying

that plant and eq nant become relatively more idle (see Nadiri and Bitros

[1980]). Finally, signif leant development costs must be incurred on the

part of the firm r order to expand R&D to its desired long run level.

Presence of these costs leads to intertemporal linkage of the R&D invest-

ment and imply a distributed lag structure for R&D investment expenditure.

In fact this adjustient process can take anywhere from three to five years

to complete (see Mansfield [1968], Criliches [19801, Nadiri [19801).

     The existing dynamic theory of investment has not been able to fully

explain these important empirical findings. Investment theory ignores the

empirically Important interplay, both In the short run and intertemporally,

between the decisions to accumulate knowledge, to utilize and invest in

physical capital and to hire labor. As Criliches [1979] points out,

knowledge is a stock. Thus the dual role of R&D must be explicitly

 recognized. In this paper the R&D investment flow is determined as part of

 the short run equilibrium, while as a form of capital, the stock Is an

 input In the production process, and its level governs the Intertemporal

 evolution of the firm.

      A major difficulty In modelling the effect of R&D accumulation on phy—
                                   —2—


sical capital utilization arises because, in general, utilization is con-

sidered to be costless. This implies that physical capital is always fully

utilized, and therefore the utilization rate is independent of changes in

the level of R&D capital and stock of plant and equipuent. A result which,

as we have observed, is not substantiated by emplriáal work.

     In this paper the cost of physical capital utilization arises because

the wage rate increases as plant and equipment are utilized at a higher

rate. The rising wage schedule reflects the workers' diminishing rate of

substitution between leisure and consumption. Thus the hours of operation

move from the moat to the least attractive. Rhythmic wage rates were first

introduced by Marris [1964] and then formalized in a static franework by

Lucas [1970] and Winston and McCoy [1974]. Recently Abel [1981] developed

a dynamic analysis with costly labor utilization where the capital—labor

ratio was fixed n the short run. In the present context, with costly phy-

sical capital u'il±zaiton, knowledge and physical capital are quasi—fixed

factors. The firm alters the level of these stocks through their invest-

ment decisions. Ibreover, to permit general short run substitution possi-

bilities, both labor requirements and the utilization rate are variable.

     A nunber of empirically relevant results emerge from the present ana-

lysis. First, as the "knowledge intensity" of the firm's physical capital

stock (i.e., RD capital/physical capital increases the physical capital

stock utilization rate decreases while knowledge per worker rises. In a

sense the growth of knowledge capital, given the level of demand, creates an

inventory of physical capital which may be used in the future but is idle

in the present. Second, there is an important distinction to be drawn bet—
                                               —3—


    ween the intertemporal unfolding of the firm, and the response to unan-

    ticipated changes in demand and cost conditions. When product demand

    increases the growth rates of knowledge and physical capital rise and there

    are increases in the utilization rate and labor requirements per unit of

    R&D capital. Therefore, the model illustrates that R&D investment does not

    displace labor, w'ich is a result contrary to the viewpoint of many. In

    addition, we are abie to explain the empirically observed direct relation-

    ship between the physical capital utilization and growth rates of output.

          This paper is       organized   as follows: The structure of the model and

    the   short run equilibrium properties are analyzed in section 2. Section 3
    is devoted to the dynamic path and steady state characteristics. The
    effects   of unanticipated changes in demand and cost conditions on the

    steady state       are derived in section 4. The last section of the paper
    includes a summary        of   our results and some suggestions for future research.

    2.    The Model
           Consider a firm whose production process can be represented as

    (1)             y(t) =
                             F(Y(t)Kp(t)L(t)Kr(t))
    where y(t) is output, F is the twice continuously differentiable production

    function which is homogenous of degree 1, y(t) is the index of physical

    capital utilization, K(t) is the stock of physical capital, K(t) is the

    stock of R&D arid L(t) are labor services. All          variables   are evaluated at
•
    time t.         The marginal products are positive and diminishing for each of the
                1
    factors •
                                        —4—


        The physical capital utilization rate can be thought of as an index of

plant and equipnent (P&E) or machine usage at each time period. Resources

must be brought to bear to alter the rate at which physical capital is

used. These costs are manifested in the wage bill. cilearly labor prefers

certain time perIods to work, as the major portion of factories are

operated in the daytime and during the week. Thus in order to attract

workers to overtime, night and weekend shifts, a premiun wage must be paid.

This premium reflects, in essence, the diminishing rate of substitution

between leisure and onsumption for workers. The implication is that the

wage rate consists of two elements, the fixed scale or basic rate, s, and

the premium rate w(i). The premium rate is an increasing strictly convex

function of the physical capital utilization rate. As the utilization rate

increases each worker receives a higher wage, and as the unused physical

capital stock di:ninishes the paynent per worker increases at an increasing
        2
rate.

        In this model the distinguishing characteristic between knowledge and

physical capita is that once the stock of R&D exists there are zero costs

associated with its utilization. Hence although there are costs to develop

knowledge capital, as there are costs to purchase and install physical

capital,. only the latter involve utilization costs.3

        We are now in a position to describe the flow of funds for the firm,

V, which is the revenue after the wage bill and investment costs have been

deducted,4

where f has been derived from the fact that the production function exhi-

bits constant returns to scale, k=Kp/Kr is the physical capital intensity,

(of R&D capital) or 1/k is the knowledge intensity of physical capital,

&=L/Kr is the labor intensity (of R&D capital) or ilL is the knowedge

intensity of labor (i.e. knowledge per worker), and p is the fixed product

price. The costs of purchasing and installing additional physical capital

is C, with C'>O, C">O for positive investment in physical capital, i.e.

I>O, and C(O)=O. Thcre are also costs associated with developing addi-

tional R&D. These ccsts are captured by E, with E'>O, E">O for Ir>O and

E(O).5

      Knowledge and physical capital accumulate according to,

where O51 and Oi1 are respectively the rates of P&E depreciation and

R&D obsolescence.

      In this model the stocks of R&D and physical capital are quasi—fixed

factors of production while the labor requirements and the physical capital

utilization   are variable in the short run. This means that in order for
the firm to maximize the present value of the flow of funds, it selects
these latter two varIables and        the investment flows associated with the

capital   stocks.

where r is the ccrant                  discount          rate which represents the opportunity

costs of funds.

        In order           1aiyze equation set (6), it is convenient to deal with

the   set   in two segrnents. First, consider equations (6.1) —                     (6.4) from
which we can OiVE              or L,        y, I, and 1r given the capital stocks and the

investment demand prices. Upon solving, we can then substitute into

equations (6.5) —             (6.7)    to determine the intertemporal paths of the stocks

and shadow prices.

      The solution to (6.1) —                       (6.4)   is defined as the short run or temporary

equilibritm. Equations (6.1) and (6.2) simultaneously characterize the

short run equilibrhmi for the utilization rate and labor requirements.

By combining these equations we find that
                                      —7—.



(7)         sw'yz = sw(y) = m


where z =          is worker per machine hour and m is the short run marginal
            L/YK
production costs.     L-t maximizing the present value of the flow of funds, at

each time period the firm minimizes the cost of production given the level

of output. In add±::on, from either (6.1) or (6.2), to determine output

the firm equates the 3hort run marginal cost of production to the product

price.

      Before continuing, let us consider the role of R&D capital in the

determination of euilibrium. Suppose that the firm does not engage in R&D

investment so that 1r=° This could arise, for example, if development

costs are too high for any r> This means that equations (6.4) and (6.7)

drop Out. Moreover 6.5) reverts to equation (3) and Kr(t)=Kr(O)>O for all

time. The stock of knowledge is given and constant, and it ceases to be a

factor of production. }ènce, from equations (6.1) and (6.2) (with constant

returns to scale and constant real wages), we can solve for the nuber of

workers per machine hour and the machine utilization rate. In fact, these

variables are constant over time. In other words given constant returns to

scale, and constant real wages, the firm never has an incentive to alter

its ratio of worker ?er machine hour and the utilization rate. The impli-

cation is that, in this context, knowledge capital accumulation provides

the impetus for changes (apart from unanticipated exogenous shocks, as for

example in the real wage) in the proportion of labor and physical capital

used in the production process.

      When a firm begins to engage in R&D investment, it must decide on the
                                        —8--



rate   at which the stock of knowledge is    to   be accumulated. This stock
affects   the physical capital growth rate, the level of output and input

proportions, clearly, in this model, It is precisely the endogenous accu-

mulation of knowledge which causes the firm to evolve.

       Let us now revert to the discussion of the temporary equilibrium.

Because physical capital utilization costs emerge through the wage bill, ft

Is of interest to determine the region on the premium wage rate schedule on

which the firm operi:es. To this end, it is convenient to rewrite

equations (6.1) and (6.2) as


(8)         01 =   e1/e
where 01 =   w'y/w   is the utilization rate elasticity of the wage, and e1 =

f1yk/f, e,=f2Z/f, with e1 the physical capital services elasticity of out-
put and e& is the labor services elasticity of output. Noting that the

labor elasticity with respect to the wage rate is unity, equation (8)
illustrates   that the ratio of cost elasticities must equal the ratio of

revenue elasticities. Therefore, if the output elasticity with respect to

labor is greater than (is less than) the capital services elasticity, then

the firm operates    on   the inelastic (elastic) portion of the wage schedule.

Intuitively, when cost. responds relatively more to labor services than to

capital services (through the utilization rate), in order for the firm to

be maximizing t.he flow of funds, revenues must also be responding more to

changes in labor services. This result generalizes that found in Oi [19811

and Abel [1981], where the firm operated only on the elastic segment of the

wage schedule. These authors restricted the form of the production func—
                                                 —9—


tion such that eL < e1, and therefore                      must exceed unity.7

       From equations (6.1) and (6.2) we can observe that labor demand and

the utilization rate depend on the capital stocks, and the real scale wage

rate. Moreover, because these first order conditions are homogenous of

degree zero In L, K,, and Rn we can actually solve for the labor intensity

(L) and the utiliza:ion rate (y) in terms of the physical capital intensity

(k) and the real saIe wage rate (sip). If the physical capital intensity

increases we find that



(9)
                                                       —
           .}= [p(i1+f11yk)(pf21k—su')                     pf21y(pf11k2—sw"L)1/H1

where H1 is the relevant Hessian determinant. In order to determine the

sign of the right side of (9), consider the variable profit function per

unit of R&D capital,


            it   = pf(yk,&)     —     s(y)Z.

We assume that it      is   strictly concave in 1, k and £.8 This implies that the

matrix of second order derivatives




                    'r k                       pf22          pf21k—sw'    pf21y

                            •lTkk_j

is negative definite. Thus the determinant of the matrix of the right side

of (10), which is defined as H2, is negative, the second principal minor,

which is H, is positive and the diagonal tes in the matrix are negative.
                                       — 10 —




Now with H2<0, one of two sufficient conditions for 111>0 is that the nuniera—
tor of the right side of (9) be positive when f12>0 and negative when

f12<0. Hence 39./3k0 as f120. If increases in the physical capital
intensity increase the marginal product of the labor intensity then the two

intensities are directly related.

      Next for the machine utilization rate



 h1               [pf21(pf12k—su') —   p2f22(f1+f11yk)1/H1.

The second sufficient condition for 111>0 when 112<0 is that the numerator of

the right side of (11) is positive when f1+f11yk>0 and negative when

f1+f11yk<0. By defining e11 =                   then f1 +           =                 and
                                 f111k/f1,                  f11yk       pf1(e11+1),
thus we find i/k0 as e11 + 10. The intuition can be easily explained.

An increase in t1e physical capital intensity effects the value of the

marginal product of the utilization rate (which is pf1k) by the amount

p(f11yk-l-f1) =              Moreover, the increase in this intensity does

not affect the mar Thai input cost of the utilization rate (which is sw'i).

Therefore, if e1+1>O then the value of the marginal product increases

above the marginal input cost. In order to restore equilibrium, the uti-

lization rate must increase. The higher rate simultaneously lors the

value of the marginal product and raises the marginal input cost, until the

equality between the two is once more established. nversely, if e11+1<0

t1n the value of the marginal product of the utilization rate declines

with the increase in physical capital intensity. This means that the rate

must fall to bring about an equilibrium.9
                                            —11 —




       As the R&D intensity of physical capital Increases (i.e. 1/k in-

creases), knowledge per worker rises and physical capital becomes relative-

ly more idle, when f12>0 and e11 ÷ 1>0.                In this case, the R&D intensity of

physical capital displaces labor per unit of R&D, and also physical capital

through the utilization rate. In addition, from the production function in

R&D intensive forti, when k declines, leading to decreases In £ and 1, out-

put per unit of knowledge capita'. falls. Thus as the R&D intensity of phy-

sical capital Increases, and since p Is exogenous to the firm, the R&D

intensity of sales (fly) Increases.

       In the situation with f12>O and e11 + 1<0, the expansion of the stock

of knowledge per unit of physical capital leads to a higher utilization

rate. The firm produces output with a relatively higher R&D intensity of

physical capital, and increased use of physical capital, while the labor
                        10
intensity declines.

       Increases in the real scale wage rate (s/p) make it more expensive to

produce output whether through a higher physical capital utilization rate

or by hiring labor. The reason is that the costs of altering utilization,

given the stock of physical capital Is manifest in the preniun wage rate.

Thus we find

The right sides of (12) and (13) are negative because the variables profit

function is strictly concave, and therefore it is also strictly quasi—
                                           — 12 —




concave.    This latter condition is used to establish that the nunerators in

the right side of (12) and (13) are negative.

       We can summarize our results from equations (9) and (11)—(13) by

defining y =   r(k,s/p)   with r1o as e11 + 10, F2<0 and £ =       G(k,s/p) with
G1>O, C2<O. The P&D intensity of physical capital affects the utilization

rate in accordance with the value of the elasticity of the marginal product

of physical capita. services, while increases in this intensity (i.e. 1/k)

decreases the labor intensity of R&D. FInally a rising real scale wage

rate decreases the labor intensity and the utilization rate.

       Turning to the finn's   investment     behavior, we can observe from (6.3)

and (6.4) that both types of Investment rates are positively related to
their respective shadow prices. Thus

                                        1/[E•Ir/Kr + 2E' 1>0.

An increase in the marginal value of investment to the firm, other things

constant, increases the growth rates for both types of capital. These

results are similar to those found in Lucas [19671, Could [19681, Treadway

[1970], and Hayashi [19821. The investment decisions highlight the inter—

temporal link, as the capital growth rates depend on the Investment demand

prices,   which are equal to the present value of the rentals accruing to
units of the stocks installed at the current time, but brought into service
over   the remaining time horizon.

3.    Dynamics and   the Steady State

       Given the short run solution, we are in a position to analyze the

intertemporal path of the firm and the steady state properties.

Substituting F(k,s/p), G(k,s/p), J(q1) and J(q2) into (6.5) yields



(16.1)      k =                     +
                  k[Jp(1)_tS_J(2)       ii]


       From equation (:6.1) we can determine how the physical capital inten-

sity evolves. The growth rate of the physical capital intensity (k/k) is

a function of the demand prices of both types of investment, the depre—

ciation rate of physical capital and the rate of obsolescence of the stock

of knowledge. It is independent of the physical capital intensity itself.

This result is due to the separable nature of the adjustment costs asso-

ciated with the quasi—fixed factors, and because the depreciation and

obsolescence rates are exogenous. We find that      ak/3q1 =   k.J'>O and k/aq2 =
                                                                p
—    kJ'<O (for k>O). Therefrre, with k=O there is a locus in (q2, q1) space

(see Figure 1) which is positively sloped with dq1/dq2 (at k=O)=J'/J'>O.
                                                                       rp
        The k0 locus shows us that In order to maintain the equality between

the growth rates for both types of capital, each investment demand price

must rise, thereby generating increases in the growth rates. Moreover,

if the demand price of P&E (q1) is above that defined by the k=O curve, for

any value of q2, then the P&E growth rate outruns tl rate for R&D, causing

k>O. The converse occxs for values of q2 below the k=O locus.

        Turning to the evolution of the demand price of physical capital

investment, substituting the temporary equilibrium into (6.6) yields,

This   equation   points out that the firm equates the rate of return on physi-

cal capital (the right side of (16.2)) to the opportnity cost of funds

(r). The rate of return consists of three elements, the value of the

marginal product et of depreciation, the reduction in physical investment

costs brought about by the stock expansion and any capital gains that arise.

From (16.2) we cai discern how the time path of the demand price changes in

response to changes in the shadow price itself and the physical capital

intensity. First,      an   increase in the demand price, given the physical

capital intensity, leads to a decrease in the rate of return on physical

capital. }nce, given the opportunity cost of funds, a capital gain must

accrue to the firm.         In fact 3q1/3q1 =                   which is positive if
                                                rI-6—(I/K)>0.
the present value of the flow of funds is to be positive in the neigh—
                                  11
borhood of the steady state.           Ixt an increase in the physical capital

intensity decreases the value of the marginal prodit of physical capital.

This implies that the rate of return drops below the opportunity cost of

funds. In order to restore the equalities a capital gain must arise. Thus

                      Recall that 112<0 and          from the strict concavity of the

variable profit function in R&D intensive form. mbining these results

yields a q10 locus in (k,q1) space in Figure 1, whIch is negatively sloped

since dq1/dk (at q10) = 112/Hi (rI-ó—(I/K))<O. Pbints above the q=o locus

define q1>O, while points below illustrate tj1<o.

       A similar set of results can be derived for the demand price of R&D

investment, since

                     G(k,s/p))r(k,s/p)k —

                         E(J(q2))(J(q2))2]/q2.

Clearly q2/3q2=r+.t—(i /K)>O and aq2/ak=kH2H1<O. Thus a q2=O locus is

defined      which is    posively sloped in (k,q2) space in Figure 1 and dq2/dk

(at   q2=O) = — kH2/H1       (ril.1_(Ir/Kr))>O. Ibreover, below q20, q2<O,   and

above, q2>O.

      Using the four cuadrant technique         developed by Abel [1981] we can

characterize      the steady state solution (kq1=q2=O) for the firm from Figure

lat (k
         e      e e
               q1, q9 There exists a unique steady state which is a saddle

point. The steady state magnitudes are denoted by the formation of the

rectangle and the dyziamic paths are monotonic and illustrated in (k, q1)

and (k, q2) spaces in Figure i.12

      From Figure 1 e can characterize the nature of the path that the firm

follows to the steady state. The paths of k, q1, and q2 are illustrated in

the northwest and southwest quadrants. Supse that k° < ke (i.e. the ini-

tial physical capital intensity is less than the steady state magnitude)

then q > q and q < q. The intuition is quite clear. In order for the

firm to be able to increase its physical capital intensity up to the steady

state level, it must be investing in physical capital at a rate above and

knowledge capital below that needed to maintain long run equilibrium.

      It is also possible to discern the intertempral paths of the labor

intensity.      For k° < ke, since the physical capital and labor intensity are
                                         — 16 —




 directly   related (as C1 > 0) then £ < te. This means that with the R&D

 intensity of physical capital above its steady state level, knowledge per

 worker is also too high. A further implication, which canbines the pre-

 vious results on the dynamic path, is that in order to reduce the knowledge

 per worker from the excessive level, the firm must accunulate physical

 capital at a rate aoove and knowledge capital at a rate below that found in

 the   steady   state. us the growth rate of R&D capital is directly related

 to, while the growti rate of physical capital is inversely related to the

 labor intensity.

       Along.the dynamic path the relationship between the R&D intensity of

 physical capital and the utilization rate depends on the elasticity of the

• marginal product of physical capital services. If increases in the physi-

 cal capital intensity    increase   the value of the marginal product of the

 utilization rate (i.e. e11 + 1 > 0), then the elasticity of the marginal

 product of physical capital services is inelastic. In this situation, as

 the physical capital intensity increases towards the long run level, physi-

 cal capital becomes relatively less idle. Thus 10 < 1e, which follows from

 y =   r (k,s/p) with     > 0 as e11 + 1 > 0.     In other words the R&D intensity

 of physical capital increases, the degree to which physical capital is uti-

 lized decreases.

       Notice that when the utilization rate is below its long run magnitude,

 the physical capital growth rate is above the steady state rate. clearly,

 the firm is utilizing physical capital at too low a rate because the stock

 is growing too rapidly. Mrevoer, we see that the stock is expanding at

 an excessive rate, because the firm desires to increase the physical capi—
                                          — 17 —




tal   intensity (or lower the R&D intensity of physical capital). As a. con-

sequence, in this situation (with e11 + 1 > 0), there is a negative

correlation between the physical capital growth rate and the utilization

rate, while there is a direct relationship between the latter rate and

knowledge accunula:ion.'3


4.    Comparative Steady States
      In this section we consider the effects of unanticipated changes in
the   exogenous variables, such as the product price and the cost of capital,

which characterize the firm's environment.

      First, suppose that there is an increase in the opportunity cost of

funds. This increase implies (from (16.2) and (16.3)) that the rates of

return on capital njSt correspondingly increase. Hence at the original

steady state with =ke, in order to maintain q1=q2=0, the investment demand

prices must faL'. bwever, when both q1 and q2 decrease, the physical

capital intensity of R&D responds in an ambiguous manner, because the

growth rates of both physical and R&D capitals are falling. These effects

can be discern by setting equation set (16) equal to zero and differen-

tiating with respect to the discount rate,



               IK) IK
              a(pt o(r/ r)

where 113 =                         and   n=r+S_Ip/Kp=r+I_Ir/Kr>O. clearly, from
              knH2(J'p+kJ'r)/Hi<O
(17.1)   the increase in the discount rate leads to the identical effects on

the capital growth rates, and consequently physical capital intensity is
                                             — 18 —




not unambiguously altered. Notice that since the utilization rate and

labor intensity depend on the physical capital intensity, ambiguities in

the latter translate into ambiguities for the former variables. In fact

from



(17.2) 3k—=      nk   r-,

                        pq1—J   rq2j/1-13
we can observe that the movement of the physical capital intensity depends

on the relative responsiveness of physical and R&D investment to their

respective demand prices. If, for example, physical capital resj:onds rela-

tively more to its demand price, then, as the opportunity cost of funds

increase, physical capital intensity declines. The higher discount rate

exacts its toll on the stock of physical capital relative to R&D
                                                                   capital.
       Next suppose that there is an autonomous change in the obsolescence

rate on R&D, such that knowledge becomes obsolete at a faster rate. In

this instance there is a shift towards the capital stock with the relative

increase in its life. Thus the physical capital intensity increases by,



(18.1)          —                     > 0.
                    n[r!+q2kJ;]/H3

The increase in physi.cal capital intensity lowers the value of the marginal

product of P&E and therefore its rate of return. In order to restore the

equality between this rate of return and the opportunity cost of funds, the

physical capital investment demand price must decrease. In other words,

the growth rate of physical capital declines by,



(18.2)
           3(1) = — J2[q2kJfl/H3
                                 <0.
                                         — 19 —




Interestingly,   the growth rate of R&D capital is subject to two opposing

forces, as its useful life diminishes at a faster rate. The increase in

the R&D depreciation rate causes its investment demand price to decline at

the initial steady state (k=ke), to retain the equality between the oppor-

tunity cost of funds and the rate of return on R&D capital. Ibwever, as

the physical capital intensity increases, the value of the marginal product

of R&D capital increases, and this moveent shifts the burden of adjustment

away from the price and onto the stock.

     The increase in the physical capital intensity implies that the labor

intensity also increases in the steady state. Moreover, when e11+1<O the

utilization rate decreases, while for e11+1>O the rate increases.'4

Notice that, for the unanticipated increase in the R&D obsolescence rate,

when e11+1>O the growth of physical capital and its utilization rate is

inversely related, while the converse occurs for e11+1<O.

     The last unanticipated change that is considered is due to a shift in

product demand which causes an increase in the output price. The increase

in the product price increases the value of the marginal product for physi-

cal and R&D catital, and thereby also the rates of return. Given the

opportunity cost of funds, and in order to remain in long run equilibrium,

the investment demand prices must increase. nsequently the shift in

demand causes the capital growth rates to increase by

 intensity is ambiguous. As the product price increases, given the invest-

ment demand prices, the intensity must increase in order to bring the rate

of return of physical capital into line with the opportunity cost of funds,

while for the rate of return on R&D capital, the intensity must decrease.15

      Although ambiguities associated with the physical capital intensity

pose difficutlies in determining the effects on the labor intensity and the

utilization rate, there are situations when unambiguous results can be

discerned. From the definition of F (k,s/p) and C (k,s/p),

We know that C1 > 0, C2 < 0 and F2 < 0 (by equations (9), (12) and (13)).

Hence if sgn r1       sgn ak/ap then y/p > 0 and if ak/ap > 0 then aL/ap >
0.   cbnsequently if the unexpected rise in the product price increases the

physical capital intensity and if e11 + 1 > 0 (so r1   > 0),   the labor inten-

sity and utilization rate increase. The response to the price shock is

that the physical capital growth rate, the utilization rate, the labor

requirements per unit of R&D capital, and the growth rate of knoi1edge capi-

tal are positIvely correlated. Moreover, from the production function we

can see that, in this case, output in R&D intensive form also increases.

Hence, unlike the movement along the intertemporal path where the utiliza-

tion rate, the labor intensity and the R&D capital growth rate are inver-

sely related to the physical capital rate of growth, we now have a

situation   where there are co-movements of these variables)6 In this con-

text, as opposed to the conventional wisdan, R&D capital accunulation does

not displace labor. In addition, we are able to provide a rationale for

empirically observed direct relationship between physical capital accumula—

tion and its utilization rate.


5. ODnelusion

     In this paper we   have   developed a dynamic analysis of a firm under-

taking physical and knowledge capital accumulation, along with labor

hiring and utilization decisions. Utilization costs were introduced

through a rising wage rate associated with the greater flow of physical

capital services per unit of the stock.

     For the intertemporal movement, it was established that increases in

the knowledge intensity of physcial capital led the firm to decrease its

labor intensity (uieasured In R&D terms), while the effect on the utiliza-

tion rate depended on the magnitude of the elasticity of the marginal pro-

duct of physical capital services. In general when increases in the

knowledge intensity of physical capital decrease the marginal product of

the utilization rate, then physical capital becomes relatively more idle.

Consistent with this context, the physical capital growth rate is inversely

correlated with the utilization rate, the R&D capital growth rate, and the

labor Intensity. Ibwever, we have shown that it is important to

distinguish between the evolution of the firm in the absence of unan-

ticipated demand and cost changes, and the movement in response to these

shocks. Indeed, an unexpected price rise, in general, causes the firm to
                                      —22--




 increase its labor intensity, physical capital growth and utilization, and

R&D   accumulation.

        To understand the process of R&D accunulation and the integration with

physical capital growth and utilization there are important areas of future

research. In this paper we have distinguished R&D and P&E in the basic way

of recognizing that physical capital is costly to use. }bwever, the

variable utilization rate did not affect the rate at which physical capital

was depreciated. By allowing endogenous depreciation, It would then be

possible to investigate the relationship between R&D growth and P&E durabi—

lity.

        Also, the only type of knowledge that we have considered is that which

is not embodied in the physical capital stock. In fact, the firm can

undertake R&D activities or it can buy other factors of production which

embody technical advances undertaken by other firms. Modelling this aspect

would entail a vintage physical capital model with the integration of R&D

investment. Ibwever, since the current state of vintage capital models

relies on very specific technologies and generally only investigates steady

state properties, much work needs to be done In this area.

      Finally, R&D can affect the demand conditions confronting the firm,

and consequently interfirm rivalry becomes art important consideration.

Thus an interesting extension would be to develop a dynamic model of

Industry equilibrurn with both physical and R&D capital accumulation.

 1.   The production function reflects that the utilization elasticity of
      output equals the physical capital elasticity of output. A related
      form is found in Nadiri and Rosen [1969], Taubman and Wilkinson [1970]
      and Abel [1981].

2.    See Oi [1981] for a survey of the use of rhythmic wage rates in static
      models of production.

 3. We could introduce a utilization rate for R&D capital.    In the pre-
     sent paper the rate Is fixed and normalized to unity. If the rate is
     variable, we could assume it to be positively related to the physical
     capital rate. The results would not be materially affected and the
     distinction between the two quasi—fixed factors would still stand,
     since only physical capital exhibits costly utilization. Finally,
     labor hiring is anonymous with labor utilization, since the latter is
     a variable factor of production.

      form which depends on gross investment. See Lucas [1967], Could
      [1968] and Hayashi [1982].

      the   matrix of second order derivatives with respect to the control
      variables (L, -',   I, I) is negative definite.

 7. A form of he production function which is usually adopted, in the
     absence of R&D capital, is y=yLf(k), where k=K/L (see Oi [19811 for
     a survey).     this instance equation (8) becomes Oy=1/e0. Thus the
     technology restricts e1 to be a constant and equal to unity. Since

     i restricted to be greater than e.

 8. Although the strict concavity of the variable profit function is only
     a sufficient condition for the stability of the short run equilibrium,
     it is a necessary condition for the stability of the steady state.

 9. This result extends the previous work on utilization in the context of
     rising factor prices. The usual form of the production function
     restriced e- + 1>0, and so the stock of machines and its utilization
     rate were dIrectly related. Indeed, if y=iLf(k). as In footnote 7,

13. When e11 + 1 K 3, for k° < k, we find yO > ye Thus the utilization
      rate is positively related to the physical capital growth rate and
      inversely related to the physical capital intensity and the knowledge
      capital growth rate.

     follow from the effects of an increase in the R&D obsolescence rate.
     Here the P&E rtensity and R&D growth rate decline, while the P&E
     growth rate moves in an ambiguous direction.

16.   Actually, the condition is less stringent for the utilization rate
      because all that is needed is that sgn r1 = sgn ak/ap. We do not
      need ak/ap > 0.  Tn addition, an unanticipated decrease in the scale
      wage rate generates the same qualitative effects as the product price
      increase.
