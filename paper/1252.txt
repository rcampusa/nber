                    Costs and Benefits of an Anti—Inflationary Policy:
                                   Questions and Issues


                                         ABSTRACT


         This paper analyses how the output or unemployment cost of achieving a
    sustainable reduction in the rate of inflation depends on the structure of
    the wage—price process and how the !tsacrifi    ratio" can be minimized. In
models where the natural rate is invariant under the anti—inflationary
policies, price level inertia is not sufficient for a positive sacrifice
ratio. Without sluggishness in the core inflation rate, a zero sacrifice
ratio can be achieved simply through intelligent demand management. With
sluggish core inflation, the sacrifice ratio is positive unless intelligent
demand management is complemented by cost—reducing fiscal measures or
effective incomes policy. Letting the exchange rate float does not reduce
the sacrifice ratio. If core inflation is partly backward—looking and
partly forward—looking, current core inflation may be a function of current
and past expectations of future recessions. Conventional sacrifice ratio
calculations ignore forward—looking aspects of behaviour and may therefore
underestimate the true cost of disinflation. If there is hysteresis in the
natural rate (e.g. through a gradual adjustment of the natural rate towards
the actual rate) and if there is sluggish core inflation, the sacrifice
ratio will become infinite.

        Whenever sluggish core inflation is present, credibility of the anti—
inflationary (monetary) policy alone cannot obviate a positive sacrifice
ratio.

 I. Introduction


       Unlike many contributions to this subject, the present paper has

 the virtue that at any rate its title (which was chosen by the organizers

 of the conferences) makes sense. As Hall [1981, p. 432] states

 "Inflation is an outcome of economic processes, not an exogenous causal

influence". At the level of the economy as a whole, it is therefore

a nonsense to refer, as is often done, to the costs of inflation or

to the benefits from lower inflation. Since inflation is endogenous,

the benefits or costs of lower inflation can only be discussed sensibly

by specifying the changes in exogenous variables and parameters (policy

actions or rules, external events etc.) that bring about and sustain

the lower rate of inflation. Partial equilibrium or single—structural—

equation "costs of inflation" analyses are void of policy implications.

       As regards the benefits from policies to achieve a sustained

reduction in the rate of inflation, we shall be brief, because we have nothing
                                                       1
much      to add to the received wisdom on the topic       First consider

a non—stochastic economy. We shall assume that a permanent reduction

in the proportional rate of growth of the nominal stock of money is a

necessary condition for a permanent reduction in the rate of inflation.

Unless debt neutrality prevails or government interest—bearing debt

is index—linked, the reduction in the growth rate of the nominal money

stock will have to be matched by an equal reduction in the growth rate

of the stock of government bonds in order to achieve sustained

reduction in the rate of inflation.
                                  —2—



     It is important to appreciate that it is the same institutional

feature of the economy that causes costs to be associated both with

policies that cause inflation and with policies to reduce inflation.

That feature is the existence of nominal contracts that are not perfectly

price level—or inflation—contingent. The reasons for the existence

of such contracts have to do with the advantages of using money in the

first place —— the benefits from using a common nulneraire, standard

of deferred payment, medium of exchange and means of payment. They

are either too obvious or too deep to be considered in this paper.

Bringing down inflation is costly because of the existence of non—

contingent money wage and price contracts. In a deterministic setting,

imperfect and incomplete indexation of prices and rates of return is the

main reason for welfare costs to be associated with policies that

cause inflation.    The only other cost is the 'relabeling cost",

i.e. the cost of changing prices more frequently, which can be

generalized to the cost of the disruption of well—established methods

of transacting business (Canton, 1982, p. 139).

     The best—known cost of non—indexation is the loss of consumer

surplus suffered when the demand for real money balances declines as (and

to the extent that) the nominal interest rate rises in response to

an increase in the (expected) rate of inflation. With the nominal

rate of return on money balances assumed fixed (typically at zero)

the nominal interest rate represents the opportunity cost of holding

money. Partial equilibrium approaches take the real interest rate

as given and have the nominal interest rate rising one for one
                                   —3—



 with an increase in the (expected) inflation rate. This represents

 a tax on the holding of money balances. If the demand for money is

 interest—sensitive and money is produced costlessly, this will impose

 a dead—weight loss of consumer surplus given by the trapezoidal area

under the (compensated) money demand function between the low inflation

and high inflation quantities of money demanded2. General equilibrium

approaches treat the real interest rate as endogenous and not necessarily

invariant to the policy changes that cause the higher rate of inflation.

In a multi—period setting the entire sequence of discounted instantaneous

(or single period) trapezoidal utility losses must be considered

[Feldstein 1979j.

     Non—indexation or incomplete indaxation extends in practice well beyond

the rate of return on high-powered money balances, and affects private

contracts as well as tax laws and regulations. Extensive work on the

subject has been done by Fischer and Modigliani [1978],

Fischer [1981bJ.

     When comparing a situation of low inflation with one of high

inflation, the lower level of welfare (presumable) enjoyed in the latter

can be attributed either to the policy that brings about the higher

inflation (i.e., higher monetary growth) or to the failure to implement

policies that permit a partial or complete adaptation to the higher

inflation. If indexation is cheap, let alone costless, dead—weight

losses, incurred because of a combination of inflation and incomplete

indexation, can be attributed with as much justice to the failure to

implement policies to adapt to inflation as to the policies that cause
                                                          —4—




the inflation. This holds for any undesired distributional consequences of
policies that cause inflation as much as for the inefficiencies that they
entail.
            Turning to a stochastic world, a vast literature has sprouted in

recent years on the costs of variable or uncertain inflation and on the

links between expected inflation and the variability or uncertainty of the
                                                                                     3
price level, the rate of inflation or relative prices .                                      Even in determin-

istic models it is possible, if not all prices can be adjusted costlessly

mean inflation rate and the (anticipated) variability of relative prices. The

costs of such anticipated variability can e evaluated using conventional

deterministic welfare economic tools. In what follows only unanticipated

or currently unperceived variability, i.e. inflation or relative price

uncertainty,will be considered. Causal chains have been proposed running

from high (expected) inflation rates through to relative price uncertainty,

suggesting that inflation may raise the noise-to—signal ratio for relative

price movements, thus impairing the allocative efficiency of the price mechanism.

           Since the expected rate of inflation, its variance and the variance

of relative prices are all jointly endogenous in any reasonable macroeconomic

model, it is very hard to understand what the "costs of inflation uncertainty"

literature is trying to say. It is certainly interesting to study the time

series behavior of mean inflation, of inflation variability and uncertainty

and of relative price variability and uncertainty (see e.g. Fischer [1981]).

By regressing any one of these on any subset of the remaining ones, one cannot

hope to extract a structurally invariant relationship. The statement

"high expected inflation causes highly uncertain inflation" makes no

sense. The statement "certain policies or events that cause the first

moment of the distribution function of inflation to increase also

tend to raise its second moment" does make sense.                                   E.G. :       if higher

mean monetary growth is associated with increasingly unpredictable

monetary growth, both the higher mean inflation and the increasing

unpredictability of inflation can be attributed to monetary policy.

     Perhaps the argument is that there is a structurally invariant

relationship between mean monetary growth and the unpredictability of

monetary growth for a monetary aggregate with the following two properties.

First, it is the relevant causal one in the inflation process and second,

the parameters of its distribution function can only be chosen by the

authorities subject to some constraints. E.g. the authorities cannot

control monetary growth exactly, but they can choose the first two moments

of its distribution function, subject to the constraint that mean and

variance are positively related. Since it is likely to be welfare—reducing

for the authorities to throw more extraneous no1se into the system, a further

argument for lower mean money growth exists if the variance of the

innovation in the money stock process is an increasing function of the

expected rate of monetary growth. Unless this is the case, finding

a positive pattern of covariation between mean inflation and relative

price uncertainty carries no implications for monetary policy.

    Note, that none of this provides an argument for maximizing the

predictability of future monetary growth rates but only for minimizing

the variance of the innovation in the money stock process. Consider e.g. the

monetary growth rule m       —       =        +         m is the logarithm
                       t+J

of the nominal money stock, u is the random, unpredictable, component

in the money growth process i.e. Et ul =           0,   while   is the predictable

tainty hypothesis can be represented by


       m, t

                                    —6—



of current and past realizations of random variables, i.e. it could be

governed by a non—stochastic feedback rule. While such rules tend to

make m+2 —          say, less predictable, in period t and earlier, than
             m+i,
a non—stochastic open loop path for money growth, such-feedback rules

may well help diminish the undertainty that matters. Examples are

changes in the information content of observed market prices induced

by monetary feedback rules (Turnovsky [1980] Weiss [1980], Buiter

[1980, 1981]).

     From the proposition that governments should not throw extraneous

random noise into the economic system by randomizing their monetary

policy rules, it also does not follow that minimizing uncertainty

about future inflation or future relative prices is sensible policy. E.g.

by freezing all relative prices through legislative fiat their

predictability is maximized but any shocks to demand or supply will have

to be absorbed through rationing and other disequilibrium mechanisms.

Random shocks to the system will, in general, be absorbed by unexpected

changes in prices, in quantities produced, sold and consumed and by

unexpected changes in the values of policy instruments such as the

money supply, which are set according to some contingent or conditional

rule. By removing the elements of conditionality in the monetary rule

to enhance the predictability of the future money stock path, shocks will

have to be absorbed in some other way. Only detailed analysis of fully

specified models can determine what kind of monetary rule maximizes

expected utility.

    A final argument for policies consistent with low or zero inflation

is that price level stability (zero inflation) is the only stable

equilibrium. Positive inflation inevitably entails rising rates of

inflation. (The symmetric argument for negative inflation rates is

not made; there have been hyper—inflations but no hyper—deflations).

     The political economy of inflationary monetary growth creating

pressures for higher and more inflationary rates of monetary growth

has never been spelled out satisfactorily. The historical experience

of most OECD countries would seem to contradict it. If any inflation

carried in itself the seeds of a hyper—inflation (with some non—

negligible probability) the case for striving for price level constancy

would of course be strengthened considerably.

II. The cost of policies to achieve a permanent reduction in inflation.


          In Part II of this paperwe shall consider the familiar Okun style

output costs of securing a lasting reduction in the rate of inflation.

There are well—known objectives to taking the cumulative net output loss

(perhaps discounted) associated with an anti—inflationary policy as

a measure of its cost .       It   ignores the benefits of additional output

produced at home by the unemployed and not recorded in GNP, as well

as the marginal valuation of their leisure and search time. We shall

proceed regardless for two reasons. First, it has been argued (see

e.g. Gordon [1973]) that if one attempts a conventional triangle approach

grounded in applied welfare economics, the answers don't come out all

that differeatly from the crude Okun's gap measure. Second, it is hard

to take seriously an approach that cannot differentiate between an employed

worker taking a vacation and a worker becoming unemployed. Conventional

inicroeconomic analysis models utility as increasing in leisure, i.e. leisure

is a "good thing", and thereby confines labour to the category of "bads". Over-

whelming empirical evidence on the importance of work (i.e. of being employed,

of having a job) for most people's well—being, happiness and even sanity

has not made much of a dent in the "extended holiday" approach to

unemployment.

          Formally, it is quite easy to combine the "leisure as a good thing"

and "work as a good thing" approaches. Consider the state—dependent

utility function v(•) given below. c is a vector of goods and services

other than leisure. L is the endowment         of time and £ hours spent working.
O     is an indicator variable which takes on values 0 = 1     if employed and
0 =   0     if unemployed
                                      —9—


          U =   v(c,    E)


      The utility function is well—behaved in consumption and leisure

 (strictly increasing and quasi—concave). The benefit from being employed

 is represented by the assumption that for any given c = c and £ =   £
we have

       v(, L—2., 1) >   v(,   L—.Q., Q)4



     Depending on what further properties one attributes to the utility

function5 and on the budget constraints when employed and unemployed,

one could still have people choosing voluntary unemployment.

     In this paper only conventional output gap costs will be considered.

Even if they have no clear welfare significance, it would still be

worthwhile from a positive economics viewpoint to know their magnitude.


Bringing down inflation with a policy—invariant natural rate.


     In this section we consider models that have the long—run natural

rate property: the same level of real output (rate of unemployment)

is consistent with any steady—state and fully anticipated rate of inflation.

While output and unemployment can differ from their natural levels

outside the steady state, these natural levels themselves are taken to be

constant. For this class of modelswe shall show that price level inertia

is not sufficient to generate output costs of policies to bring down

inflation. For there to be such costs, inertia should attach to the

rate of change of the price level. A number of "Keynesian" models,

e.g. Buiter and Miller's [1981, 1982] variant of Dornbusch's [1976]

overshooting model, Calvo's [1982 a,b,c] continuous time version of
                                                   -10-



Taylor's [1980] staggered overlapping money wage contract rnode1

Mussa's [1981] sticky price model and Obstfeld and Rogoff's [1982.] version

of a price adjustment rule of Barro and Grossman t1976] all have the property

that, in principle, inflation can be reduced or eliminated costlessly.

well—designed and credible monetary and fiscal policy can make these

economic systems mimic the real behavior of a completely flexible money

wage and price economy.

     After considering these models we analyze the cost of bringing

down inflation in models with sluggish core inflation. These costs,

and the properties of desirable anti—inflationary policies turn out to

depend crucially on the relative importance of backward—looking

("long term contracts") versus forward—looking ("expectations") determinants

of current inflation.


Closed economy models.


     This subsection deals with closed economy models. Much of the

analysis only requires consideration of the wage—price block. Where a

complete, if rudimentary, macroeconomic model is required, the following

standard log—linear IS—LM model will be used.


(1) m—p--Ar+ky                                        A>0;k>0

(2) y(t) =        —y(r(t)   —    p(t,t))       + c(m(t) —   p(t))   + f(t)   >   0;   c >   0;   n   >0

m is the nominal stock of money balances, p the general price level,

r the short nominal interest rate, y real output and f a measure of

fiscal impact on aggregate demand. All variables except r are measured

in logarithms. For any variable x, x(t) denotes its time derivative, i.e.


       —
  x(t) =   urn /x(t+h)
                                —   x(t)
               k     h                     /
           h-*O
                                               —11—



  x(s,t) denotes the value of x expected, at time t, to prevail at time s.

  I assume x(s,t) =   x(s),   x< t. The expected instantaneous rate of change of

  x is denoted
          —
    x(t,t)=
                 /x(t+h,t)
                 I
                              —   x(t,t)        The unaxpected change in x is
                          h                .

 Costless disinflation with price f1exibil.


      Let capacity output or the natural level of output be denoted y. This

 is treated as exogenous and constant. The benchmark case for costless

 disinflation is represented by the flexible price level model which

 complements (1) and (2) with the assumption of continuous full capacity

utilization.


 (3) y=y

     For simplicity it is assumed here and in what follows that the

initial position of the economy is one of full stationary equilibrium

with a high constant rate of monetary growth i.          All   models considered will

have the classical property that the steady state rate of inflation

equals the steady state rate of growth of money?

     It is easily checked that, regardless of what the initial rate of

inflation happens to be, an unanticipated, immediately implemented

and permanent fixing of the rate of monetary growth             m(t)     ii(t). at


will immediately and permanently set the rate of inflation at              if

expectations are rational. If the IS curve is vertical (y=0) and there

is a real balance effect (0) this follows trivially from the stronger

proposition that real money balances are determined uniquely by y and f.
                                         —12—


If neither y nor A equal zero, the behavior of expected real money

balances is governed by


  (t,t) =       (A +   y)i(t) + p(t) -   (y + A1k)y +        f(t)
where

  i(t)     m(t) —   p(t).

Since A1 +             is positive there is, for a given information set,

a unique continuous convergent solution given by



  £(t) =
                                       + 'c)(t-s) [yf(s,t)          + p(s,t)]ds
           (A
                   1) y         _fe
When   both     f and p are expected to remain constant at f and p respectively

for all future time this simplifies to


(4) Z(t) =(
                     )      -
                                y   AC y+AE
       Thus, while the level of the real stock of money balances will,

in general, be a function of the rate of monetary growth (even across

steady states) through the effect of anticipated money growth on the

expected rate of inflation and thus on the nominal interest rate, the

adjustment of the real stock of money balances to a new rate of growth

of the nominal money stock will be instantaneous. The price level will

jump discontinuously if required to satisfy (4). After that the rate

of inflation equals the new constant rate of money growth.

       The general solutiOn for the expected rate of inflation for constant

y and f is:
                                            —13—



 (5) (t,t) =            +   yc)   j(A' + y)(t-s) p(s,t)ds.
               =   p if u(s,t) =      for s >   t.
     The actual rate of inflation —— the sum of anticipated and unanticipated

inflation ——    is   given by



(6) (t) =      f            +
                                c)(t_s)[(A_l + yc)(s,t) + _       P(st)j ds
     Note that in this model the credibility of current announcements

of future policy is both necessary and sufficient for a sustained

reduction in inflation to any level. While, by construction, there never

are any output costs of bringing down inflation, a desired reduction in

inflation ma not be achievable, regardless of the actual past and current

path of monetary growth, simply because expectations concerning future

monetary growth are sufficiently pessimistic. Inflation, and policies

to combat inflation, are exclusively forward—looking. I shall return to

this credibility issue when I discuss the fiscal preconditions for

a sustained deceleration of monetary growth below.


Costless disinflation with price level inertia.


     The following four sluggish price adjustment mechanisms permit,

in principle, costless and instantaneous sustained reductions in the

       In all four cases the price level, p, is treated as predetermined:

it cannot move discontinuously in response to current changes in

expectations about the future. Also in all four cases, the rate of change

of the price level is an increasing function of excess demand pressure,

measured as the excess of the level of current output (which is viewed

as demand—determined) over the natural level of output. In equations (7), (8) and

(9) it is only current excess demand which, given "core' inflation, affects current

inflation. In Calvo's model both current and anticipated future excess

demand affects current inflation. Equations (7), (8) and (9) only

differ in the augmentation term, or core inflation —— the rate of inflation

when there is no excess demand or supply. In equation (7) core inflation

is identified with the right hand side derivative of the money stock path:



     .i (t) =— r.      rn(t+h)        m(t)
                                  —

              h0
              h>0


In equation (8) core inflation is given by p, which is the right—hand side

derivative of the equilibrium price oath that would be enerred -if t1'

price    level were fully flexible. This is of course the rate of inflation

calculated 1n equation (5). Mussa's equation (9), as developed

by   Obstfeld       f1982j   ,   specifies core inflation as the right—hand side
derivative of the price               path p(t)      which would clear the outnut market

 (set y(t) =   y)      given the actual (and in general non—Wairasian equilibrium)

 values of the other endogenous variables, p(t), (t,t) and r(t). p(t) is

 therefore defined by:


   y =   -y(r(t)   -   p(t,t))      + c(m(t) -   (t))   + f(t).


     In the spirit of Taylor, Calvo specifies the current contract price,

v(t), as a forward—looking moving average with exponentially declining

weights of the future expected general price level pet) and future expected

excess demand:

                                                 —5(s—t)

                                T
Note that the current contract price v(t) is non—predetermined. The general

price level, which is predetermined, is a backward—looking, exponentially

declining moving average of past contract prices:


(lib) p(t) =
                   [v(s)e_tds +
                    -to

    In   a fullemployment, stationary equilibrium v(t,t) =          '(t)   =


A positive (zero, negative) steady state rate of inflation requires a

current contract price, v(t), above (equal to, below) the current general

price level, p(t).

    It will be apparent that all four mechanisms in equations (7) — (10)

have flexible core inflation. It would appear that simply reducing

monetary growth to i,           say, and keeping it there would be sufficient
                                   —16--




 to reduce inflation in (7) without Output costs. In equations (8),

 (9) and (lOa,b) the further proviso of credibility of current announce-

 ments of future reductions in monetary growth has to be added.

    The reason that this isn't quite correct is that a cet. par.

 reduction in money growth would in general affect the money market and

output market. To effect a permanent reduction in inflation at full

employment other policy parameters will have to be changed when monetary

growth is reduced. Steady—state output y = y is, from (4), sustained

by monetary and fiscal policy as follows:



  y(t)       +kyA±ky(A±ky) (m(t) -p(t))

    The long—run effect of a reduction in money growth is to reduce

inflation one—for—one, reduce the nominal interest rate (but less than

one—for—one if there is a real balance effect ) and thus raise the

demand for real money balances. In the classical flex—price model

the real money balances required to effect an instantaneous transition

to low inflation at full employment comes about through a discontinuous

jump down in the price level. With a predetermined price level, the

required increase in real money balances can instead be achieved by

a discrete, discontinuous increase in the level of the nominal money stock

at the same time, t, that its rate of change is reduced permanently.

The required money jump is given by:


(12a) dm(t) =          d
                                           —17—



          Alternatively, expansionary fiscal policy could accompany the

 reduction in money growth in such a way as to leave the nominal interest

 rate unchanged. The required fiscal expansion is given by


 (12b) df=—1d

          This fiscal action relies on the direct aggregate demand effect of

increased public spending or lower taxes. We shall show below

how cost and price reducing indirect tax cuts could be used as a substitute

for an increase in the nominal money stock as a means for achieving

an increase in real money balances at a given before—tax price level.

        It can be checked easily that provided the money stock is raised

according to (12a) or a fiscal stimulus is provided according to (12b)

when monetary growth is lowered to .i, the rate of inflation will settle

immediately and permanently at i while output remains equal to y
           11
throughout.

      For Calvo's model the existence of costless disinflation policies

may not be quite as transparent as for the other three. First note that,

treating y — y       as   exogenous both roots of the dynamic system      (lOa,b)
are   zero. Following Buiter [1983c1 the convergent solutions for             v and p
are given by:


(13a) p(t)                             +                      -   )dTds
                    p(t0) + f              2]      f(Y(T,S)
                              to              to

(13b)      v(t) =   p(t) + K(t) + f(Y(Tt) - )dT


      K   is a parameter to be determined from the terminal boundary condition.
                                                  —18—


A natural transversatility condition do determine K (and one consistent

with (ha)) is



(13c) K(t) =              [v(T,t)   -   p(T,t)]   =   urn          = ujm,t)
                  T                                   T              T
     It     is easily seen from equations (1) and (2) that along any

(anticipated) full employment path (y(T,t) =                y)   with a constant expected

rate of money growth i         and   a constant expected value of f, it must be

true        that K(t) =   -.    Thus, as p is lowered from p to p and in is increased
once and for all to maintain full employment, v will drop discontinuously

by            and inflation is reduced costlessly and permanently.

The dependence of the current price level on a "twosided" moving

average of output expectations will re—emerge in a slightly modified

form when inflation inertia is added to price level inertia.

     If monetary or fiscal policy actions to maintain full employment

when the monetary growth rate is reduced are ruled out, the increased

demand for real money balances resulting from a successful anti—inflation-

ary policy can only be satisfied by a lowering of the price level path

relative to the nominal money stock path. This will involve unemployment

and excess capacity in all four sticky price level models. E.g.. in the

Dornbusch variant,


     f(y(s) -     )ds     =
                               (u(t0)      -

       to
     By the time the economy settles down to a new stationary equilibrium

and a new, higher, stationary stock of real money balances after a

reduction in i,      the   undiscounted cumulative net output loss will be
                                                      —19—



 (13)         f(y(s) -           )ds   =         I(-
        The net output cost of reducing steady state inflation decreases

as the short—run Phillips curve steepens and the interBst sensitivity

of money demand decreases.

        These costs of bringing down the price level will be different

for the four price adjustment mechanisms considered in this section.

They are not considered any further here because of space constraints.

The methods of the next section dealing with inflation inertia can be

brought to bear on the problem of price level inertia with obvious

modifications.


Inflation inertia.


       The simplest way of introducing inflation inertia is by postulating

a backward—looking adaptive process for core inflation, ri, as in (14a,b).


(14a) p =              —          +r
(14b)         =   (p —     1T)




       Both   the price level, p, and core inflation, IT,              are   predetermined.

It is now no longer possible to avoid paying the output or unemployment

cost of bringing down inflation merely by manipulating aggregate demand

as in the previous section. In the model of equations (14a, b) a sustained

reduction in inflation requires a reduction in core inflation. Since


n(t)      (t0)
                   +
                             f(y(s)
                                           —   )ds,   the undiscounted cumulative net
                                 to
                                             —20-



 output cost of bringing down inflation permanently is given by

                                    r(°')—Tr(t)
                                             °
 (15)               —
          J (y(s)       y)ds    =

           to

 It   is a decreasing function of the slope of the short run Phillips

 curve and an increasing function of the mean lag of the backward—looking

core inflation process -               This loss measure can not be altered by
changing the timing or the intensity of the anti—inflationary package.

Given , and the desired reduction in steady state inflation, the

net output cost is a constant. (See e.g. Miller [1979], Buiter and

Miller [1982, 1983], Miller and O'Donnell [1983]).

      Clearly, with discounting, policy makers will not be indifferent

between different trajectories with the same net output cost. We shall

not address these issues as they are both well—understood (see e.g.

Phelps [1972] and Hall [1976]) and comparitively unimportant: characterizing

efficient policies (and inefficient policies!) would seem to be more

useful than searching for an optimal policy.

      The major drawback of the model of core inflation in equation (14b)

is the complete irrelevance for current core inflation of current and/or

past anticipations of future economic events. To remedy this (14b) is

replaced by (iSa, b). Core inflation, i,                 is   a backward—looking

exponentially declining moving average of past "contract inflation", q,

while q is a forward—looking moving average of future expected inflation.


(iSa) i(t)      Tr(t0)e                 + l J q(s)e                ds              >   0

                                                 —21—



    By differentiating (15a, b) and using (14a) we obtain the two

equation system:


(16a) Tr(t) =    —E1(ii(t)
                             —
                                 q(t))
(16b) q(t,t) =     —2(ji(t)
                                 —   q(t))   —
                                                 2'i'(y(t)
                                                                —



    Comparing this with Calvo's model in equation (iDa, b) two differences

stand out. First equations (16a, b) have "slipped a derivative" as

compared to (lOa, b). Inertia now attaches both to the level and the

first derivative of the price level path. Second, the mean lags of the

backward—looking core inflation process,                            and of the forward—looking

contract inflation process,                  are permitted to be different from each

other.

    Treating the output gap y — y as exogenous, the convergent solutions
                                                 13

    For convergence it is assumed that                      >
                                                                :
inflation adjusts more quickly than core inflation or the mean lag
                                                                       current contract



of the contract inflation process is no longer than that of the core

inflation process.

    Equation (17b) shows that "current contract inflation" q(t) can be

brought down discontinuously by announcing, at t,a credible path of

future recession.        Core inflation ir(t) is a function of the

expectations, formed at each instant in the past, of the entire future
                                                     —22—



path of the output gap. It can only come down (gradually) in response

to credible announcements that policies to generate a recession will

be pursued in the future.

       To get a better appreciation of the cost of bringing down inflation

in this model,we now consider an example of a specific path for

expected output.

       The initial position at t0 is one of current and expected future

full employment with actual, core and current contract inflation all equal

to each other. At t0 output is unexpectedly lowered to y(t0) < y. The

output gap is then expected to decay exponentially at a rate y so that

                        —                   —     —y(T —    t0)

Substituting (18) into (17a, b) yields

                                                                                -i(t —

The undiscounted cumulative net output loss incurred for this reduction

in inflation is

     Consider     the special case where y =                  (the     mean lag of the output

 process equals the mean lag of the core inflation process). In this

 case the impact of the current and expected future recession is to

 reduce actual inflation and current contract inflation .immediately

 to their new long—run equilibrium levels:

  p(t) =   q(t)    =
                       rr(t0)
                                +   'Y(y(t0) —   ),       t   >   t.
Core inflation only approaches its long—run equilibrium value gradually

according to

  ir(t) = 7r(t0)   +
                                       —
                                              — e
                                                 —y(t —   t,)

                       ''(y(t0) —      y)(1                       )
    In   this case actual inflation and current contract inflation

have been eliminated immediately and permanently, but the output cost

is still to come. This would be obvious to an observer who can measure

core inflation, which has yet to be brought down. It will be shown

below, that there exist policies that reduce both actual and core

inflation to any desired level before any of the output costs have

actually   been incurred. This raises the problem of time inconsistency
and credibility of policy.

"Gradualism'T   versus "Cold—turkey"

    It can be seen from (19b) and (20a) that if y is larger (smaller)
than ,     current contract inflation will on impact fall below
(stay above) its new long—run equilibrium level. This might suggest that
a short sharp recession would, by changing current contract inflation
promptly, be a more effective means of bringing down core inflation
than a longer and milder recession. In fact the opposite is the case.
From (20a, b) it follows that, holding constant the cumulative net output
                                         —24--



        y(t0)
 loss                 ,   a deeper initial recession (a smaller value of y (t0))

 followed by a faster recovery (a larger value of y) would produce a smaller

 reduction in steady-state inflation. The reason is, from (17a), that

 later expected output gaps, although discounted as regards their effect

 on ir(t), are also counted again and again (in fact continuously) on the

 interval t0 —   t.
     In   the presence of inflation inertia which is due to contractual or

 other institutional arrangements rather than to sluggish expectation

 adjustments, there are "diminishing returns" to cold turkey deflation

and gradualism is preferable. Only if a short sharp shock can break

down the nominal inertia, i.e. if the adjustment equations (15a,b)

or (16a,b) are not structurally invariant to certain dramatic changes.

in the policy regime, is there a case for anti—inflationary heroics.


Time inconsistency and the timing of.anti—inflationary benefits and

2c25ts.
    It has already been shown that it is possible, through credible

policy announcements, to bring down actual and current contract inflation

imnediately ——   before      the output losses (whose expectation generated this

reduction in inflation) have been incurred. It will be apparent from equations

(17a,b,c) that it is also possible, if policy announcements are credible,

to bring down core inflation gradually (i.e. over any finite time interval)

to any desired level before any of the output costs have been incurred.

Consider e.g. a policy which, starting at to keeps outputat its catacitv

level y until t >      t0, at    from   till     > t and again at V after t.

      Having achieved the desired reduction in core inflation at t=t without

actually having suffered any output costs as yet, the temptation

to renege on the earlier commitment to create a recession between

t and t gould be hard to resist.

      The argument that the recession must take place in order to validate

and confirm the expectations held between t=t and t=t and thus to preserve

or invest in credibility for future policy announcements is unlikely

to prove apolitical winner. Why have a recession when core inflation

has already subsided? A policy maker treating bygones as bygones will

at t=t and beyond, keep output at its capacity level.
                                      —26—



       What this suggests is that any optimal policy will be time—inconsistent

(Kydland and Prescott [1977], Buiter [1981, 1983bJ1 if it has the property

that some output costs still have to be incurred (if previous expectations

are to be validated) after the inflation objectives have been achieved.

Unless credible precommitment is possible such policy announcements

will not be believed by the private sector.

       Time consistent policies must be characterized by a better matching

of the time profiles of costs and benefits: if a credible strategy

cannot have the costs following the benefits, the recession will have

to be brought forward in time. If a speedy reduction in inflation is

sought, a deep, short recession will be the only credible strategy.

It    has already been shown that "short—sharp shocks" of this kind are
likely to be inefficient.
       The model under consideration not only has implications for policy

design but also for policy evaluation. Consider again the general

expressions (17a,b,c).        Conventional cost measures focus on output

or unemployment costs incurred up to the time that a given reduction

in core inflation has been achieved. When forward—looking expectations

and inflation inertia play a role, as they do in this model, some, most

or all of the costs attributable to the reduction in core inflation

may be incurred after the anti—inflationary objective has been achieved.

to   increasing the number of periods for which nominal contracts hold

in discrete time models. E.g. by slipping another derivative in

the model of equations (lla and l6a, b) we obtain:



f(t)     =
             1((t)       —   r(t))

j(t,t) =     2((t) —         r(t)    —

      With nominal inertia in the price level, core inflation and the

rate of change of core inflation, the output costs of bringing down

Some Open Economy Consideratons and the Sensible Use of Fiscal Policy in a

Disinflationary Programme.

        In an open economy, appreciation of the exchange rate might seem to

offer a mechanism for bringing down inflation more rapidly or at less

cost than in a closed economy or an economy on a fixed exchange rate.

        This will be considerered in an open economy extension of the model

with backward—looking core inflation given in (14 a,b). Possible direct

cost and price effects of direct and indirect taxes are also introduced here.

They can be applied to all closed economy models in an obvious way. The

economy is a price taker in the world market for its imports, whose world

price is p*, and in international financial markets. The country has some

market power in the market for its exportable. Perfect capital mobility

and international asset substitutability are assumed. r* is the foreign

nominal interest rate. w denotes domestic costs, i.e. labour costs per

unit of output or even the CD? deflator at factor cost; p is the consumer

price index, e the price of foreign exchange, g exhaustive public spending,

T. the rate of indirect taxation and T the income tax rate. The model is

         The model is similar to the one considered in Buiter and Miller

 [1982, 83]. Note that taxes have both aggregate demand effects (equation

 26) and direct cost effects (equations (23) and (24)). Only a fraction

 of an increase in income tax rates is translated into higher wage settle-

 ments (equation (23)). One interpretation of (23) is that it is the

 (adjusted) after—taxmoneywage w —                            that is predetermined or sticky rather
                                                    Td
 than the before tax wage w. Note that the consumer price index can move

 discontinuously, even if w is predetermined, through changes in indirect

 tax rates and in the exchange rate. The latter influences the c.p.i.

 through the share of imports in final consumption 1 — ct.

         From equation (23) — (25) and (29b) it follows that

 (30a) (t) -         (t0)    =

     The familiar closed economy output costs given in equation (15) are

found back as the first term on the right—hand side of (30b).                               They can be

reduced by an appreciation of the real exchange rate, c, by a cut in indirect

taxes and, if            0, by a cut in direct taxes.

     A balanced budget cut in indirect taxes matched by an increase in direct

taxes helps reduce the output cost of disinflation only if direct tax

increases don't raise before tax wage settlements one—for—one.

effect,    the increased stock of real balances associated with a lower

rate of monetary growth will require a loss of competitiveness to maintain

equilibrium in the output market if (5 + 6)                > . Assuming    that there

is no long—rin effect on competitiveness from a reduction in the rate of

inflation, any favourable short—run or impact effects on the price level,

the rate of inflation and the core rate of inflation from an initial

appreciation of the exchange rate will not lower the undiscounted cumulative

net output cost of securing a sustained reduction in core inflation.

Buiter and il1er [1982, 1983] show that, on impact, a reduction in monetary

growth will be associated with a discrete, jump appreciation of the nominal

exchange rate (a step down in e and c). If e jumps down, so, from (24),

does p and so, from (25), does iT.          Core inflation jumps on impact but the

apparent reduction in output cost that this entails is nullified by the net

depreciation of the real exchange rate that will be required during the

remainder of the adjustment process to restore competitiveness. Only if

the short, sharp shock of a sudden revaluation breaks down the inertia

captured in (23) and (25) will it help reduce the output cost of bringing

down inflation.
                                    —31—

     In principle, by using indirect and, if      0, direct tax cuts to

melt core inflation instantaneously, a costless and immediate transition

to a sustained lower rate of inflation is possible. The higher stock of

real money balances demanded in a low inflation equilibrium can be provided

either by engineering a step increase in the level of the nominal money

stock at the same time its growth rate is reduced or by cutting taxes.

Indirect tax cuts will do the job and so will direct tax cuts, if      # 0

and if it is the after—tax money wage rather than the before—tax money

wage that is predetermined. If step adjustments in m are ruled out,

immediate attainment of the new long—run equilibrium values of m — p and IT

while maintaining full employment will in general require use of all three

fiscal instruments, g, T. and Td.

     Finally, in the context of this model, incomes policy can be seen

as the ability to !boverridel the core inflation adjustment equation

(25). An extreme version would permit the authorities to pick a new

starting value for ri.   The model clearly isn't rich enough to suggest

reasons why such policies have a habit of   breaking   down.

Hysteresis          in the natural rate.


      One of the most striking macroeconomic coincidences of the last

fifteen years has been the way in which estimates of the natural rate

of unemployment have moved up, along with the actual rate of unemployment.

In this subsection we consider the implications of the hypothesis that

this co—movement represents a causal influence running from current

and past actual unemployment to the current natural unemployment rate.

Letting —y stand for the actual unemployment rate and —y for the natural

rate, we nostulate that

      R(t) stands for whatever structural factors or policies may affect

the natural rate (union power, unemployment benefits, minimum wage

etc .).      The second term on the right—hand side of (35) and the first term

on the right—hand side of (35') represent the hypothesis that unemployment

destroys human capital by having a negative effect both on attitudes

towards working and the aptitude for work. The idea is an old one.

Recent formalizations can be found              in   Buiter and Gersovitz [1981],

Hargreaves Heap [19801 , Gregory [1982, 1983] and Gregory and Smith

[1983 1 .      Clearly, as itten in (35) the            hypothesis is

too strong, since no bounds are set on the natural rate in the long run:

by   selecting      an approDriate path for unemployment, the natural rate

can be steered to any level, Such global hysteresis is implausible.

Over some finite range of unemployment rates, the hypothesis may, however,
                                                   —33.-



have merit.           (35) should be viewed as the log—linear approximation

 in the relevant range of unemployment rates to a model with local

hysteresis. While the long—run or stationary Phillips curve                      is   vertical,
it can be made vertical at any point within that range.

       To keep the exposition brief, the simple sluggish core inflation

model of equations (14a,b) is added to (35).                        It is, of course,

still true that


     (t)   =   (t0)   +   f[Y(s) - (s)]ds

Since the natural rate no longer is invariant under the disinflation

process, deviations from the natural rate cease to be a useful measure

of cost. In the absence of tax cuts or incomes policy, core inflation

can only be lowered by raising the actual unemployment rate above the

natural rate. This, however, will, by (35') begin to raise the natural

rate, thus reducing gradually the disinflationary effect of any given

increase in the actual rate.                  Formally, since

        In the hysteresis model a permanent increase in the rate of

unemployment —Ly will only buy a finite long—run reduction in the

rate of inflation —Air =              (—Ay)       .     With an exogenous natural rate
                                 2
that same steady state reduction in inflation can be achieved by having

the same constant increase in unemployment for only a finite period

of time.




        The simple hysteresis model outlined here has much the same implications

for the inflation—unemployment process as does entering the rate of change

of output (unemployment) rather than its level as an argument in the

Phillips curve. The simplest version of this model is



(36)                y +11

(lb)           =      —




The solucion for core nfiation is



(37a)       (t) =
                    (t0)    +        (y(t)    -
                                                   y(t0))

while current inflation is given by



(37b)       (t) =     (t)    +        (y(t)    -
                                                      y(t0)   +
                                                                  (t0)

         The striking imrlicaion of this model is that all anti—inflationary

gains from a contractionary policy are completely reversed if the economy

is permitted to recover. As Tobin [1980, p.El] says "It is possible that

there is no i:AIRU, no natural rate, except one that floats with actual history.
                                                   —35—



 It is just possible that the direction the economy is moving in is at least

 as important for acceleration and deceleration as its level. These

 possibilities shouid give policy makers pause as they embark on yet another

 application of the orthodox demand management cure for inflation".



       Note that equation (37b) is consistent with some of the early work on

 Phillips curves, which argued that both the level and the rate of change

 of unemployment could be significant in inflation equations but ignored

 endogenous core inflation (e.g. Phillips (1958) and Lipsey (1960)).



       This similarity between the hysteresis model and the model of eqiations

 (36) and (l1b) is especially striking when we consider the               effect,    in the

hysteresis model, of a constant path y(s) =                y for t0 < s    <   t.   This

yields the following expression for core inflation



              Tr(t) =   (t0) +-—       ( —(t0[i— e
                                        —

Asymptotically,         the hysteresis model too has complete reversibility of

inflationary gains achieved through contractionary policy.



      though the economic mechanisms involved are very different, the
output, or unemployment cost of achieving a permanent reduction in                  inflation

an exogenous natural rate y and no adjustment, however gradual, of core

inflation it towards actual inflation, the "sacrifice ratio" —           the
cumulative, undiscounted net output or unemployment cost          (expressed as a
percentage)   divided by the steady    state reduction in the inflation rate —
is   infinite. The same specification with an exogenous natural rate but

gradual convergence of core inflation to actual inflation, yields a positive

but finite sacrifice ratio, whose exact magnitude depends on the details

of the core inflation adjustment mechanism. The assumption of instantaneous

adjustment of core inflation through rational perception and anticipation

of credible policy actions produces a sacrifice ratio of zero. The

hysteresis model with gradually adjusting core     inflation again yields an
infinite   sacrifice ratio. Not because, as with the old Phillips curve,

core inflation never adjusts but because the natural rate adjusts gradually

toward.s the actual   unemrlo:\ent   rate. The case for any policy action(s)

that   can "override" the core—infatioi adjustment eguatlons s therefore
even stronger if the hysteresis hynothesis has anything to reconrnend it.

for the credibility of a policy to reduce steady state inflation is the

consistency of the long—run monetary objectives with the government's

fiscal program.



      We can get some sense of the "eventual monetization" implied by the

government's fiscal program by considering the government's comprehensive

 III. Conclusion.


     One conclusion that emerges strongly from this paper is the importance

 of fiscal policy in securing a lasting reduction in inflation at least

 cost. First, the long—run reduction in monetary growth which is necessary

 for a sustained reduction in inflation is only credible if it is consistent

 with the government's spending and tax programs and its outstanding

 non—monetary assets and liabilities. Second, indirect tax cuts (and

 under certain conditions direct tax cuts) can be used in ways first

 suggested by Okun [1978] to secure a painless melting away of core

 inflation. Tax cuts or a once—and—for all increase in the level of the

nominal money stock path must also be used in order to provide the higher

stock of real money balances demanded when the inflation rate is lower

at a given price level rather than through a further downward shift

in the price level path.

    A final comment suggested by the analysis of the paper relates to the

apparent contrast between the findings of R. J. Gordon who has documented

many historical episodes during which bringing down inflation appears

to have been costly (Gordon [1982]) and I. S. Sargent who finds that

the ends of four hyperinflations in the post—World War I era were achieved

without dramatic output losses (Sargent [1982]). These findings can be

reconciled by arguing that during hyperinflations inflation inertia

(if not price level inertia) disappears. All the advantages of longer

term non—contingent nominal contracts are overridden by the need to

revise prices almost continuously. During hyperinflations (at any rate
                                   —42—



 in their final phases) the inflation process is characterized by models

 like the ones in equations (8), (9) and (lOa,b) or even by the purely

 classical flexible price model.

     If there is no inflation inertia but still some pr.ice level inertia,

 optimal anti—inflationary policy has the following features. First, a

 credible announcement of current and future reductions in monetary

growth. This was provided by fiscal reform and currency reform plus

 the general realization that something had to be done and was going to be

done to stop the hyperinflations. Second, a once—and—for all increase

in the level of the nominal money stock to raise the stock of real money

balances without any need to lower the price level path. The real world

counterpart to this were the very large increases in the nominal money

stocks in the periods following the sudden ending of the hyperinflations

[Sargent, op.cit.J. Such money stock jumps make no sense in a flexible
          17
price model but may be called for in models with price level inertia.

    Gordon considered episodes of moderate inflation. Long—term non—

continoent nominal contracts are adopted because they permit economic

agents to economize on frequent, costly renegotiations, on the search and

information costs of first identifying all possible relevant contingencies

and then monitoring them and on the costs of enforcing complicated

conditional contract clauses. Continuously variable and perfectly flexible

prices or fully contingent contracts are costly and undesirable when

the benefits from changing prices frequently outweigh the costs.

In moderate inflations, long—term nominal contracts are still viewed as

viable and desirable by private agents. Such changes in the length
                                  —43—


of these contracts and in other relevant characteristics as one would

expect to occur when the trend rate of inflation changes, are likely to

be second—order for the range of inflation rates experienced in most

OECD countries since World War II. With the unconditional long—term

nominal contract structure intact, even fully credible announcements

of future reductions in monetary growth will not remove the need for

a period of (expected) output losses and unemployment if inflation is to

be brought down.

 1.    An elegant statement and extension of the traditional theory
       of the welfare costs of inflation is Fischer {1981b].

 2.    This assumes that lump—sum taxes are available to the government.
       If higher monetary growth and the associated higher inflation
       increase the real value of new money issues (if the elasticity
       of demand for real money balances with respect to the interest rate
       is less than unity) the same real public spending program can be
       financed with lower explicit taxes. If these taxes are
       distortionary, the usual welfare loss measure overstates the
       true cost.

3.    The most careful and informative mark in this area has been done
      by Fischer [1981a,b, 1981]. See also Taylor [1981].

4.    v(,f—i,1) >vC,L,O) for any 2 (O<2<L) would mean that even without
      any pecuniary advantage of employment over unemployment, people
      would choose to be employed. It is a much stronger condition than
      the one given in the text.

5.    Separability,   i.e. v(c,L—9,,®) =    v(u(c,L—2),O) would be convenient

10.   When both ' and   are equal to zero, a reduction in monetary growth
      and inflation leaves the nominal interest rate unaffected and
      costless disinflation is automatic.

11. Note that since m and f are manipulated to keep output at its
     full employment level, the Barro—Grossman equation (8) and the
     Nussa equation (9) coincide.

12. It is assumed that there is no long—run trend in the rate of
      inflatIon.

15.   This is very similar in spirit to John Flemming's suggestion
      in Flexnming tJ.976J.

16.   Hysteresis is the property of dynamic    systems   that the stationary
      equilibriiun   is a function of the initial conditions and/or the
      transition trajectory towards the steady state. In systems of
      linear differential equations with constant coefficients such as
      Dx = Ax + Bz, hysteresis is present when A has one or more zero
      eigenvalues.
