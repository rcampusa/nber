                                            ABSTRACT

The canonical consumer demand model predicts that as the price of a substitute decreases,
quantity demanded for a good decreases. In the case of demand for sexual activity and
availability of alternative leisure activities, popular culture expresses this prediction as “television
kills your sex life.” This paper examines the association between television ownership and coital
frequency using data from nearly 4 million individuals in national household surveys in 80
countries from 5 continents. The results suggest that while television may not kill your sex life, it
is associated with some sex life morbidity. Under our most conservative estimate, we find that
television ownership is associated with approximately a 6% reduction in the likelihood of having
had sex in the past week, consistent with a small degree of substitutability between television
viewing and sexual activity. Household wealth and reproductive health knowledge do not appear
to be driving this association.

1 Introduction

The canonical consumer demand model predicts that as the price of a substitute decreases

quantity demanded for a good decreases. In the case of sexual activity and alternative leisure

activities, popular culture expresses this prediction as television kills your sex life. 1 This paper

examines the association between television ownership and coital frequency using data from

nearly 4 million individuals in national household surveys in 80 countries from 5 continents.

        Whether and how fast coital frequency decreases with expansion in television ownership

has several major implications for understanding human behavior and for policymaking. If coital

frequency is highly responsive to television ownership, this would suggest that humans are

willing to substitute electronic media for intimate human companionship. Policymakers in high

(low) fertility countries that are concerned with fertility rates may wish to consider subsidies,

taxes, information campaigns, and other methods to promote (curtail) television ownership.

        Existing economic studies in developing countries focus on the effects of television

content, not television ownership, on behavior and opinions. For example, three studies provide

evidence that the content of television programming affects gender and health norms, including

those determining fertility. Jensen and Oster (2009) found that the introduction of cable

television in India improved women’s status and reduced fertility. They argued that the

mechanism linking cable television and women’s status was the “modern” content of cable

television, which changed household norms about female autonomy. La Ferrara et al. (2009)

found that the expansion of soap operas in Brazil reduced fertility, and also argued that the

“modern” gender norms in these soap operas was the mechanism linking soap operas to fertility.

A third paper randomized whether Nigerian respondents saw a television series with an

educational message about HIV/AIDS or a non-educational program. Those who saw the

program with an educational message had increased likelihood of HIV testing and reduced

likelihood of testing positive for a sexually transmitted infection at follow-up (Banerjee et al.

2017).

         Focusing on the availability of electronics more widely, Burlando (2014) found that a

large power outage in Zanzibar increased births in the short term. As this power outage

eliminated access to television as well as other production and consumption technologies,

including lighting, one cannot conclude that television was the mechanism linking the power

outage to sexual activity.

         In the United States, economic analyses of the causal effect of television ownership has

used the historical expansion of television (e.g., Gentzkow 2006, Campante and Hojman 2013),

which occurred during a period in which data on sexual behavior was not widely collected.

Today, television ownership is nearly universal in high-income countries, making these countries

an unfavorable setting for an analysis of the relationship between television ownership and coital

frequency. Focusing on television content in the United States, Kearney and Levine (2015) and



                                                2
Trudeau (2016) found that a television show chronicling the experiences of pregnant and

recently postpartum teenagers (i.e. MTV’s 16 and Pregnant) decreased teenage fertility. 2

        We build on the existing studies to examine explicitly the association between television

ownership and coital frequency in 80 lower income countries. 3 Television ownership is a highly

relevant “treatment” margin, with approximately 1 out of every 2 households in our data owning

televisions. Coital frequency is both a leisure activity and reflects fertility intentions. Even as a

leisure activity, more frequent intercourse increases the risk of pregnancy and sexually

transmitted infections. Therefore, understanding this relationship is crucial for family planning

and disease reduction or elimination.

        A fundamental barrier to measuring the causal effect of television ownership on coital

frequency is the endogeneity of material and sexual consumption decisions. Consumer theory

predicts that income, relative prices, information, and tastes simultaneously determine television

ownership and coital frequency. Another major barrier is the lack of data on sexual behavior

from settings where television ownership is less than universal.

        We use several strategies to address these barriers. While we cannot ensure that our

estimates are causal, we take a number of steps to limit confounding factors. First, we use data

from 80 countries collected as part of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). This

standardized national household survey collected in low- and middle-income countries contains

detailed information on sexual behavior, reproductive health knowledge, consumer durables

(including television) ownership, sociodemographic characteristics, and geographic location. By

using comparable data across so many countries, we can include country level fixed effects—

controlling for any time invariant differences between countries about preferences or television

2
  Other studies outside the economics literature have looked at the portrayal of genders on TV (Durkin 1985) or the
correlation between TV content and teenage sexual behavior (summary in RAND 2004).
3
  The survey questions are about “sexual intercourse.” We cannot differentiate among sexual practices.

                                                         3
availability. Therefore, our empirical strategy compares people within the same country. Second,

these data provide substantial variation in television ownership, with approximately 50 percent

of households in the data owning a television. Third, we directly control for individual level

potential confounding variables such as income (or wealth) and sociodemographic and

geographic characteristics associated with heterogeneity in relative prices, information, and

tastes. Finally, we include information on other consumer durables ownership (e.g., refrigerator,

radio, bicycle). Therefore, while not necessarily causal, the wealth of controls allows for a

detailed understanding of the nature of the relationship between television ownership and coital

frequency. 4

          Our analysis yields evidence indicating that while television may not kill your sex life, it

is associated with some sex life morbidity. Put slightly differently, the results of the analysis are

consistent with a small amount of substitutability between television viewing and sexual activity.

We find that television ownership is associated with approximately a 6 percent (1.7 percentage

point) reduction in sexual activity, a statistically significant yet not particularly large association.

This finding is robust to including a variety of controls. Household wealth does not appear to be

driving the main result, casting doubt on a prime omitted variables bias concern. Knowledge

about reproductive health does not appear to be driving the main result either. Given our inability

to rule out reverse causality—people who wish to engage in sexual intercourse less frequently

might purchase a television—our results can be thought of as the maximum, in absolute value,

causal relationship. And as the maximum, they are smaller than what one might expect from

conventional wisdom, certainly smaller than TV killing one’s sex life. We further find that

having a refrigerator is associated with a decrease in the likelihood of having had sex for women,

perhaps reflecting the ability to delay gratification or the relative power of women in the
4
    We discuss limitations of this package of strategies in further detail in the Conceptual Framework section.

household. Indeed, consistent with a story of female empowerment we find that women in

households with televisions are more likely to participate other household decisions. Owning a

motorcycle or car is associated with an increase in the likelihood of sex in the last week,

potentially reflecting that these modes of transportation facilitate anonymous sexual relations.

       We provide additional evidence that the association between television ownership and

coital frequency is not driven by those abstaining from sex entirely or those who would never

admit to having had sex. Our point estimates are larger in absolute magnitude when we limit the

estimates to those who had sex in the past 12 months.

   These findings make four main contributions to the existing economic literature. First, we

provide microeconometric evidence on the association between television and sexual activity,

complementing existing economic literature on television and fertility (e.g., Jensen and Oster

2009, La Ferrara et al. 2012, Burlando 2014). Second, the analysis complements the economic

analysis of the effects of television on other behaviors, including voting (e.g., Gentzkow 2006),

educational achievement (e.g., Zavodny 2006, Gentzkow and Shapiro 2008), divorce (Chong and

La Ferrara 2009), social capital (Olken 2009), political polarization (e.g., Campante and Hojman

2013), mental health (Waldman et al. 2014), fast food/soft drink consumption (Chou et al. 2008,

Andreyeva et al. 2011, Grossman et al. 2012), and general consumption behavior (Bursztyn and

Cantoni 2016). Third, the analysis provides suggestive evidence on a mechanism—a decline in

sexual activity—possibly underlying the negative association between television viewing and

happiness documented in previous economic research (Bruni and Stanca 2008). Fourth, we study

access to television—a highly relevant “treatment” margin in low- and middle-income countries

over the past thirty years—whereas the majority of the aforementioned studies focus on

television programming content.

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a conceptual framework.

Section 3 characterizes the data and presents the statistical methods. Section 4 reports the results.

Section 5 discusses the main findings and concludes.



2 Conceptual framework

To conceptualize the threat of television killing one’s sex life, we use the lens of the standard

consumer demand model. In this model, prices and income determine the choice set, which

interacts with tastes to determine the optimal consumption bundle of sex and television. We may

expand the model to include uncertainty, which means that beliefs (or information) also affect

choice. Alternative theories, such as television having a direct epidemiological effect on libido

through a biochemical pathway, are ruled out a priori.

       One potential concern is that both sexual activity and television ownership could be

influenced by wealth and any association that we detect reflects this relationship. Higher wage

income increases the opportunity costs of both television watching and sexual activity.

Television ownership is a normal good (Letschert 2010), while income’s relationship with sexual

frequency is unclear (Blanchflower and Oswald. 2004; Forston 2008). We will explicitly control

for household wealth and other socio-demographic controls in our models to mitigate this

concern.

       The relationship between television and sexual activity might also occur through specific

television programming: the content of television programming may convey information about

the benefits and costs of sexual activity. To illuminate the empirical relevance of these

mechanisms, we examine the sensitivity of the results to controlling for reproductive health

knowledge.



                                                 6
         Ruling out the above pathways, we will focus our findings on the extent to which, as

leisure activities, the two activities are potentially substitutes for each other. Owning a television

reduces the price of television viewing, which may cause you to substitute television viewing for

sexual activity.

         Whether most sexual activity is a leisure activity or a means for procreation, or both, is an

open question. Our analysis cannot disentangle these two potential motives for the activity. 5

Instead, as television watching is only a substitute for the former (leisure) motive and not the

latter (procreation), finding a negative association between the two likely indicates some level of

substitutability. We will not be able to determine whether owning a television reflects a lower

preference for sexual activity or causes it.



3 Data and statistical methods

3.1 Data

The data in this analysis are all available Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) as of January

2018 and include surveys conducted from 1986 to 2016. 6 We define the study sample to include

individuals with complete responses to the main outcome of interest (i.e., timing of last sex),

television ownership, and the standard socio-demographic covariates (e.g., age, years of

schooling, and married). Our sample includes nearly 4 million respondents from 80 low- and

middle-income countries across 5 continents. The DHS contain data on self-reported sexual

frequency, asset ownership, and other demographic characteristics. Table 1 presents descriptive

statistics for the study sample. Coital frequency is approximately 0.30 acts per week (Panel A).

Approximately 1 out of every 2 households own a television (Panel B). Females are

5
  Further, the motive could differ by gender. Unfortunately, our data do not allow us to explore whether this drives
some of the differences that we find when separating the sample by gender.

  See Appendix Table A1 for a list of countries and survey rounds in our study sample.

overrepresented in this sample because the DHS started as a fertility survey and in many

countries surveys more females than males (Panel C). 7 Average age is around 30 years old.

        Generally, both television ownership and sexual activity are increasing over the period. 8

Across our sample, 36% of respondents surveyed in the 1980s reported having a television. This

number increases each decade with 52% reporting owning a television in the 2010s. Reporting

sexual activity in the prior week also increases over the period from 24% in the 1980s to 35% in

the 2010s. When comparing urban and rural respondents, urban respondents are about 40

percentage points more likely to report television ownership in all decades--57 percent vs. 18

percent in the 1980s and 79 percent vs. 32 percent in the 2010s. Across all decades, rural

respondents are more likely than urban respondents to report sexual activity with a gap of 1 to 5

percentage points—25 percent vs. 24 percent in the 1990s and 38 percent vs. 32 percent in the

2010s. Unmarried people are slightly (2 to 5 percentage points) more likely than married people

to report television ownership across all decades and much less likely (over 20 percentage

points) to report having had sex in the past 7 days. Additional details on decade-specific means

appear in Appendix Table A2.

3.2 Statistical methods

        The primary conceptual difficulty in understanding the relationship between television

ownership and sexual activity are confounding factors that could simultaneously affect both.

Therefore, we use multivariate regression analysis to control for many, but admittedly not all, of

these factors. The main regression equation is:




7
  To address concerns about sample composition driving the main result, we examine the association between
television ownership and sexual activity separately by female/male.
8
  As we control for year fixed effects in our specifications, we are not simply finding a correlation between two
similarly trending variables.

in year t, 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an indicator variable for household television ownership, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a

vector of sociodemographic controls (discussed below), 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐 are country fixed effects, 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 are

survey year fixed effects, and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an idiosyncratic error term. We use ordinary least squares

(OLS) regression with heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors clustered at the country level to

estimate the parameters of Equation (1).

          Our specification controls for potential omitted variables in three ways. First, country

fixed effects (𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐 ) control for any time invariant preferences or television availability differences

across countries. Second, survey year fixed effects ( 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 ) control for worldwide changes in

preferences or television availability. 9 Finally, we include additional individual level survey
                           ′
responses in the vector 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 that control for potential seasonality (i.e. month of survey), potential

changes in preferences over the lifecycle (i.e. age and marital status), socioeconomic status (i.e.

education, urban residence, and wealth), and the ownership of other consumer durables to

alleviate concerns outlined in Section 2. Despite these inclusions, we cannot control for all

omitted variables and in our discussion we outline the limitations of the study. 10

          To understand whether the findings are correlations of general television watching or

specific content gleaned from watching television, we also include knowledge of reproductive

health.



9
  Our results are robust to the inclusion of country by year fixed effects.
10
  An alternative strategy would be to use an instrument for the ownership of a television. Unfortunately, available
instruments such as tariffs or the quantity of televisions imported are either correlated with other time varying
country characteristics or would fail the exclusion restriction. Further, as we focus on television ownership and not
content, the introduction of a specific show would also not be a valid source of exogeneity.

                                                                    9
4 Results

4.1 Main results

Table 2 presents the main results. All specifications include country fixed effects and survey year

fixed effects. Panel A displays results for the full sample. Column 1 presents the results of

regressing an indicator variable for sex in the past week on an indicator variable for television

ownership and indicator variables for country of residence and survey year—effectively finding

the naïve association that one might guess based on people who they know. Even this point

estimate is rather smaller than the “killing” one might expect. The point estimate, -0.025,

suggests that television ownership is associated with approximately a 2.5 percentage point

reduction in the likelihood of having had sex in the past week (statistically significant at the 1%

level). A 2.5 percentage point reduction is approximately 10% compared to the sample mean, a

substantial although not particularly large association.

        In Column 2, we control for total consumer durables owned, a prime omitted variables

bias concern in the specification in previous column. The point estimate remains negative,

statistically significant (at the 1% level), and nearly doubles in magnitude in absolute value,

suggesting that wealth is not driving the main result. In Column 3, we control for number of

contraceptive methods known instead of total consumer durables owned and find a similar

pattern. This would seem to indicate that neither wealth nor reproductive health knowledge are

the mechanisms driving the association between television ownership and sexual activity. 11

        In Column 4 we include these controls for other durables ownership, reproductive health

knowledge, and a full set of socio-demographic controls (i.e., age indicator variables, indicator

variables for years of schooling, an indicator variable for married, and an indicator for urban


11
  As mentioned in the Introduction, other authors have noted the impact that television content can have on sexual
health behaviors. That does not appear to be the primary mechanism here.

                                                        10
residence). The inclusion of all of these controls reduces some omitted variables bias. As

expected, the point estimate for television is somewhat attenuated, but remains statistically

significant (at the 1% level). These results suggest that owning a television is associated with a

lower likelihood of having had sex in the past seven days, a decline of about 6% (1.7 percentage

point decline on a mean of 30 percentage points) in our most conservative estimate (Column 4).

We consider this a conservative estimate as we include as many relevant controls as possible to

minimize bias. Even with these control variables, we cannot rule out reverse causation—those

who prefer less frequent sexual relations could be more likely to own a television. Therefore,

even this conservative estimate is likely an upper bound, in absolute value, of the underlying

causal relationship. 12

         In Panels B and C, we present results estimated separately for females and for males,

respectively. In Columns 1 and 2 the point values are smaller for males than females and the

relationship is less precisely estimated. In Column 4, the specification with the most number of

controls, the estimated association is a relatively precisely measured 0 for males. Therefore, the

relationship in the first three columns for males was the result of the correlation between

television ownership and other individual level observables. Once these observables are

included, the relationship disappears. Also, note the sample size for males is only 20 percent of

the size for females, also potentially affecting statistical precision. The results suggest that

females are driving the association in Panel A. We discuss the potential reasons for this in the

Mechanisms section.

4.2 Do other consumer durables kill your sex life?



12
   In results not presented, we further include survey year fixed effects times country fixed effects as additional
regressors. This marginally reduces the point estimate to -0.012 with statistical significance at the 1 percent level.


                                                         11
        Given the findings thus far one could ask, “do other consumer durables kill your sex

life?” Table 3 explores this research question by examining the associations between several of

the other main consumer durables asked about in the DHS and sexual activity using the same

specification as Column 4 in Table 2. 13 Consistent with modes of transportation making sexual

activity easier, the ownership of a motorcycle or car are associated with increases in sexual

activity. Individuals with these modes of transportation can more readily seek out anonymous

sex or travel away from prying eyes to engage in sex. Cars can also be used as a setting for a

sexual encounter (Lewis 1980). Further, this ownership might reflect having to travel greater

distance for work, making maintaining multiple relationships more likely. Finally, this could

instead reflect road proximity, echoing the findings of Djemai (2018) that those living closer to a

paved road are more likely to be HIV positive in part because they can more readily engage in

risky sexual encounters.

        Perhaps more surprisingly we find a negative association between refrigerator ownership

and having had sex in the past week for women. As with our main result of TV and coital

frequency, we cannot assign a causal interpretation to this coefficient. Instead, this could reflect a

joint utility determination—people who seek the ability to routinely forgo food consumption

today for food consumption tomorrow, i.e. refrigerate uneaten food, might also be more likely to

forgo other consumption activities, i.e. sexual relations. Alternatively, female empowerment

could be driving this relationship—women with more bargaining power in the household could

be more likely to own refrigerators and refuse sexual relations. We explicitly test the association

between television ownership and women’s role in household decision making below.

4.3 Does television kill your risqué lifestyle?


13
  Recall that Table 2 Columns 2 and 4 included consumer durables as controls. Therefore, the effects presented in
that table were net of any effects presented here.

                                                        12
       Television may substitute for characteristics of your sex life other than coital frequency

or may influence which characteristics are preferred. In that sense, television may kill your

risqué lifestyle if not your entire sex life. Table 4 examines this question by regressing three

additional measures of sexual behavior on television ownership: an indicator variable for

multiple partners in the past 12 months, an indicator variable (for males) for paying money for

sex in the past 12 months, and an indicator variable for not using a condom at last sex in the past

12 months. Overall, the coefficient estimates suggest little overall association between television

ownership and risqué behavior with small and statistically insignificant point estimates. The one

exception is that for males the association for lack of condom use is negative and statistically

significant—men with televisions are more likely to have used a condom during their last sexual

encounter. One explanation for the overall lack of statistical significance in this set of regressions

is that the overall reported prevalence of multiple partnerships in the full sample and

transactional sex is low (i.e. approximately 1 to 2%).

4.4 Additional heterogeneity

       In Table 5 we test for additional heterogeneity by age, marital status, years of schooling,

and whether the respondent lives in an urban location. In each case, we keep the dummy variable

for television ownership and additionally include an interaction between this dummy and the

characteristic of interest as an additional covariate in equation 1. Each column includes the

results for a separate interaction term. Each Panel is a separate sample—full, females, and males.

We find positive and insignificant relationships by age, being married, number of years of

schooling, and living in an urban location for both the full sample and women only (Panels A

and B). For men, the interaction for years of schools and living in an urban area appear to

dampen the relationship between television ownership and sexual activity as can be seen with



                                                 13
positive and statistically insignificant coefficients on the interaction terms in Panel C, Columns 3

and 4. For example, for males with zero years of schooling, television ownership is associated

with a 2.4 percentage point reduction in the likelihood of sex in the past week. For males with 8

years of schooling, the estimated association is zero and for males with more than 8 years of

schooling, the estimated association becomes positive. The average years of schooling of men in

our sample is 6.7. In Column 2, across all samples we find that the overall relationship (sum of

the coefficient on television and television times married) for married individuals is statistically

insignificant, while the main effect remains statistically significant for the full sample and

women only.

4.5 Mechanisms and robustness checks

       We are unable to test directly the reasons behind the association between television and

coital frequency. In Table 6 we test additional outcomes that could be mechanisms. Panel A

contains the results for the full sample, while Panel B is women only, and Panel C is men only.

In Column 1, we test the association between television ownership and the ideal number of

children. Across all three panels, owning a television is associated with a negative and significant

decrease in the reported ideal family size: 0.18 for women and 0.34 for men. Relative to the

sample means, these are 5 percent reduction for women and 7 percent reduction for men.

Therefore, television content might be decreasing ideal family size or households who desire

smaller families could be purchasing televisions to use television watching as a substitute for

sexual relations.

       In Columns 2 and 3 we test the relationship between television ownership and female

empowerment. Female empowerment is both consistent with the prior literature on television

show content increasing women’s bargaining power and the negative relationship between sex



                                                14
and owning a refrigerator—the content of these shows might empower women to refuse sex and

these empowered women might also negotiate refrigeration ownership. Starting in 1992, some

DHS surveys asked female respondents whether they had sole or joint decision-making power

over contraceptive use. In Column 2, we control for a dummy variable indicating an affirmative

response and find no statistically significant relationship. Starting in 1997 some DHS asked

women whether they participate in four separate household decisions—“woman's own health

care,” “major household purchases,” “purchases for daily household needs,” and “visits to her

family or relatives.” In Column 3, we use the number of these decisions in which a respondent

takes part as a dependent variable. Television ownership is associated with women taking part in

0.07 more decisions, an increase of 3 percent over the mean of 2.03. As these are only

associations, we cannot know whether empowered women are more likely to own televisions or

television ownership influences the household decision making process. 14

        Table 7 displays the results of a variety of robustness checks concerning timing. Column

1 repeats the estimates from our preferred specification (Table 2, Column 4) for ease of

comparison. In Columns 2-6, we examine sexual activity at 2 days, 14 days, 31 days, 3 months,

and 12 months, respectively. The point estimates are roughly similar for each of these outcomes

(0.011 to 0.017) but on an increasing mean. Therefore, while in percentage point terms it is

roughly constant, in percentage terms, the largest percentage change is 7 percent at the two day

measure and the smallest is 2 percent at the 3 and 12 month measures.

        Table 8 contains a number of other robustness checks that limit the sample in different

ways. In Column 1, we again repeat the estimates from our preferred specification (Table 2,

Column 4) for ease of comparison. In Column 2, we return to examining sexual activity within


14
  The sample over which these questions were asked is smaller than our primary sample. The results in Table 2 are
robust to estimating them over this limited sample.

                                                       15
the past week, but limit the regression sample to those who have had sex in the past year. In

Column 3, we limit the regression sample to the more recent DHS survey rounds (i.e. 2006-

2016). In both of these robustness checks, the point estimate on television is almost identical to

the original estimates in both magnitude and statistical significance. Column 4 limits the sample

to those age 25 and older and Column 5 limits the sample to currently married. The coefficients

of interest in the final two columns are almost identical to each other and larger in absolute

magnitude than the original estimates.



5 Discussion and conclusion

Does television kill your sex life? Popular culture claims “Yes.” A former health and family

welfare minister of India claimed it could dramatically decrease population growth. Evidence

from nearly 4 million individuals in 80 countries from 5 continents suggests “a little.” We find

that television ownership is associated with approximately a 6% reduction in sexual activity, a

statistically significant yet not particularly large association. These results are robust to

controlling for household wealth, suggesting that a prime omitted variables bias hypothesis—

wealthier households are simultaneously more likely to own a television and have lower levels of

sexual activity—seemingly is not a concern. Further, if admitting to sex is more taboo for higher

status individuals, as long as owning other consumer durables and educational attainment are

decent proxies for an individual’s status, then we have eliminated this channel as well. In

addition, the results suggest that knowledge about reproductive health is not driving the

association between television ownership and sexual activity. Despite controlling for many of the

potentially confounding factors, ultimately this finding is at most suggestively causal as we




                                               16
cannot rule out that people who prefer less frequent intercourse are more likely to own a

television.

       Regardless of the causal channel, reduced sexual frequency should result in fewer births.

Assuming that the 6 percent decrease that we measure is similar across both sex for procreation

and non-procreation purposes, we might expect then a 6 percent decline in overall births. This

percent decline is similar in magnitude to the 5 percent reduction we estimate for ideal family

size among women with televisions.

       More recently, popular culture has claimed that smartphones are killing people’s sex

lives. Our study population resides in low- and middle-income countries and were surveyed

largely around 2010, before the widespread availability of smartphones. In countries with

ubiquitous smartphones, the smartphone might be the real sex life killer. Future research might

examine this question.
