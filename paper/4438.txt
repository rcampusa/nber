        Using 1970-1985 sectoral data for the OECD we find that inflation in nontradable goods

is higher than in tradables. We identify a demand shift towards nontradables and faster growth

of total factor productivity in the tradable goods Sector as the prime causes of higher nontradables

inflation. In addition, disinflation attempts and the exchange rate regime appear to have had

significant influence on the relative inflation rate.

 1 Introduction
The disinflation experiences of the 1970s and 1980s, both within the group of OECD
countries and outside it, have highlighted the role of international markets. Inflation
appears to behave differently across sectors. Indeed, exchange-rate based stabiliza-
tions have been characterized by a higher rate of inflation in sectors sheltered from
international competition.1 A difference in the behavior of inflation across sectors
are also the definining feature of fluctuations in the real exchange rate (the relative
price of nontradable goods2 ) in two-sector models of small open economies.3 Hence,
discussions of exchange-rate misalignment have to focus on sectoral inflation.
    In this paper we take a closer look at the determinants of differentials in sectoral
inflation rates. We examine the time series and cross-sectional behavior of the relative
price of nontradables in terms of tradables in a sample of fourteen OECD countries
during the period 1970—85. We begin with the traditionally dominant supply side
explanations, resting on the assumption of faster productivity growth in the tradables
sector [Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964)]. The supply side approach yields a
negative correlation between relative prices and relative production across sectors.
In contrast, we find that in most OECD countries the increase in the relative price
of nontradable goods has been accompanied by an increase in the share of output
produced in the nontradable goods sector. We hence consider demand side shifts
as additional determinants of relative price movements. Finally, we compare the
evidence for the quasi-fixed exchange rate regime in the core EMS and the managed
flexible exchange rate system in non-core European and non-European economies to
determine whether the exchange rate regime played a role in addition to the demand
and supply side factors.
   'See, for example Kravs, Heston and Summers (1983), Summers and Heston (1991) Dc Gregorio, Giovannmi and
Krueger (1993), and Micossi and Milesi-Ferretti (1993).
   For specillcity, we will throughout the paper use the expression "relative pnce of nontradables". Nevertheless, it
is useful to bear in mind that an increase in this relative pnce corresponds to a real appreciation.
  3Developed originally by Salter (1959) and Swan (1960), and extended to incorporate intertemporal effects by
Dornbusch (1983), Edwards (1989), Frenkel and Basin (1992) and Rogoff (1992), among others.
     Kravis and Lipsey (1983) and Bhagwati (1984) presents an alternative supply-side view based on factor endowment
differentials. The fairly narrow distribution of relative factor endowments across OECD economies [Wolf (1992)1
renders this approach more relevant for discussion of relative price movements between LDC8 and DCs than for the
dato.sets underlying our analysis.
   The paper is divided into seven sections. We begin in section 2 by discussing the
basic theoretical framework underlying our analysis. In .ections 3 and 4 we describe
the data and propose a measure of tradability underlying our later empirical work. In
section 5 we discuss the time series and cross sectional properties of relative prices and
their determinants. Section 6 reports regression results aimed at disentangling the
supply, demand and macroeconomic determinants of the relative price of nontradable
goods. Section 7 concludes.


2 A Conceptual Framework
Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964) formalized—see also Harrod (1939), chapter IV,
for an earlier discussion of this idea—what has since become the benchmark model of
real exchange rate determination: faster productivity growth in the tradable than in
the nontradable goods sector leads, via wage equalization, to a decline in the relative
price of tradables.
  To illustrate their proposition, consider the following production functions for the
two sectors:

                                     = 9TLTTKTlT,                                      (1)
and
                                YN = ONLNNKNIN                                         (2)
where the subscripts T and N denote tradable and nontradable goods, Y denotes
output, L labor inputs, and K capital. Under perfect competition prices in each
sector are thus given by:

                      PT =                             T)(1aT)                         (3)
   and

                     PN =     _WR1aNN(1 — aN)1''                                       (4)
where W is the unit cost of labor and R the rate of return on capital. Consider the
case of a small open economy with perfect capital mobility, and express all prices in


                                            2
terms of the of tradable goods (PT is the numeraire). Perfect capital mobility and law
of one price in the tradable goods sector insures that the rate of return in tradables
R is equal to its world value. Defining P as the relative price of nontradable goods,
log-differentiating the expressions for prices, and then solving for the difference, it
can be shown that:

                           P=OT—ON+(aN—aT)W                                                                   (5)
where the denotes the rate of change.
   Given R, equation (3) uniquely determines wages. Given both W and R, equa-
tion (4) then uniquely determines the price of nontradables. Hence, as Rogoff (1992)
emphasizes, under the joint assumption of a small open economy and perfect capital
mobility the relative price of nontradable goods is determined exclusively by techno-
logical conditions and is independent of demand conditions.
   Log-differentiating equation (3) and substituting into expression (5) yields an ex-
pression for the change in the relative price of nontradable goods:5


                                                                                                              (6)
   The intuition for the positive link between faster productivity growth in the trad-
able goods sector and the relative price of nontradable goods is straightforward: Imag-
ine there is an increase in tradable goods productivity (OT) while nontradable goods
productivity °N remains constant. Given the world real interest rate R and given the
price of tradables PT, the productivity increase is matched by a real wage increase
that keeps the marginal cost of tradables constant but increases the marginal cost,
and hence the price, of nontradables. In contrast, an increase in °N with 0T constant
does not affect wages (determined in the tradable goods sector) and hence leads to a
fall in the relative price of nontradables.
   While demand shifts have no effects on the relative price of nontradable goods,
they do alter the composition of output. To analyze the demand side of the economy,
we consider the case of a representative consumer maximizing the present discounted
value of
  5igoff (1992) obtains the oame equation from the factor market equilibrium conditions. See also Obatfeld (1993)

                                    U(CN, Cr) = CN(CT —              )1_                                     (7)
 where CN and       Cr denote     the consumption of nontradable and tradable goods,                    respec-
 tively. The parameter U represents the subsistence level of consumption of tradable
 goods, yielding a less than unitary income elasticity of the demand for tradable goods.
 For simplicity, the consumer is assumed to maximize utility on a period-by-period ba-
 sis, subject to the budget constraint (expressed in terms of tradable goods):6

                                          I=CT+PCN+PG                                                        (8)
where     I is   total income, and G is total government expenditure, falling entirely on
nontradable  goods and financed through lump sum taxation.
    The corresponding demand functions are given by:


                                                                                                             (9)
and

                                          CN=--[I—PG—U1                                (10)
    If   government        expenditure is a constant fraction of total income, PG = gI, the
total    demand (public and private) for tradable and nontradable goods equals:

                                      CT=(1—b)(l—g)I+çzlC                                                  (11)

    and

                                                                    I     1U
                                  CN+G=[+(l—)g]-—--                                                        (12)
    Hence for C> 0 the income elasticity of demand for tradables falls short of unity
while that for nontradables exceeds unity, thus an increase in income will result in an
increase in the consumption share of non-tradables.7
   °The assumption rules out the use of the cun-ent account to smooth consumption, and thus ignores the different
response of the economy to transitory and pennanent shocks. For an intertemporal analysis of the current account
and its empirical impbcauons in a similal framework to the one of this paper see Stockman and Tesar (1990) and
Glick and Rogoff (1993).
   TSee Bergstrand (1991). Relative demands may also be shifted by d,anges in the preference parameter        [Dc
Gregorio, tiovannmi and Krueger (1993)]. In this case, increased demand for nontradables is again reflected by an
increase in both the relative price and relative production of nontradable goods.


                                                       4
   Figure 1 illustrates the determination of relative prices and production as the
intersection of the downward sloping relative demand for nontradable goods (the
ratio of (12) and (11)) and the relative supply curve. Under the border case of perfect
capital mobility the supply curve is horizontal (Si). While supply shocks affect both
the equilibrium relative price F and the relative production levels of tradable goods,
demand shifts only affect the composition of output, but not relative prices. A non-
zero slope of the relative supply curve—obtained by relaxing the extreme assumptions
of perfect competition in goods and factors markets, law of one price for tradable
goods, and perfect capital mobility—is thus a necessary condition for an effect of
demand factors on relative prices (S2).8
   It is useful to further separate shifts in relative demands by origin, distinguishing
shifts in the preferences of the private sector from changes in the size of the public
sector. Government expenditure has two effects on sectoral demands. It directly
produces a range of nontradable commodities, ranging from healthcare to public
safety. In addition, the financing of increased expenditures reduces disposable private
income, a reduction which, given the income elasticities derived above, falls more
heavily on the nontradable sector. As the overall decline in private sector spending
on nontradables falls short of the increase in government spending on nontradables,
the net effect of an increased public sector share is a shift in relative production and
consumption towards the nontradable sector.

and real terms, permitting the construction of sectoral deflators, as well as detailed
input data, permitting the derivation of sectoral total faptor productivity levels.
   We augment the OECD database by data on inflation, total government expendi-
tures, and government expenditures on goods and services, taken respectively from
the IMF International Financial Statistics, the IMF World Economic Outlook, and
the United Nations Detailed National Account Statistics. We also use data on per
capita GDP from the IMF World Economic Outlook. Our classification of sectors ac-
cording to their level of tradability, discussed in the next section, is based on sectoral
export data reported in the United Nations Trade Statistics for commodity exports,
and in the IMF Balance of Payment Statistics for service exports.


4 Tradability
The theoretical literature on real exchange rates relies upon a neat division of com-
modities into "tradables" and "nontradables". Unfortunately few real world com-
modities fall easily into the nontradable category. Indeed, as Roy Harrod pointed
out, virtually all commodities are tradable within some area, with the extent of the
area determined by transportation cost. Notwithstanding, most economists would
argue that certain commodities are in some sense inherently "less tradable" than
others.
   Shifting from theoretical to empirical work requires an operationalization of this
prior. An obvious benchmark for tradability is the extent to which a particular
good is actually traded. This benchmark implicitly underlies the shortcut adopted
in most empirical work of labeling manufactures as "tradables" and services as "non-
tradables". While historically quite accurate, the often cited globalization of service
markets casts doubts on the continued validity of this simple dichotomy for recent
years. We make the implicit assumption explicit and base our classification on the
ratio of total exports across all fourteen OECD economies to total production across
all fourteen countries for each sector. We define a sector as "tradable" if more than
10 percent of total production within an area is exported. While the measure remains
subjective in the selection of the particular threshold, it has the virtues of being based
on the sample data and being easily subjectable to sensitivity checks.
   Table 1 reports the ratio of total exports across the fourteen sample OECD coun-

                                           6
tries to the total value of production, both converted into US dollars, for all sectors."
Among the four main sectors, manufacturing is seen to e most tradable under this
definition, with exports amounting to 45.2 percent of production, followed by mining
with 31.5 percent, agriculture with 23.6 percent and services with 4.3 percent. All
sectors experience a sizeable increase in tradedness between 1970 and 1985, with a
particularly pronounced increase in manufactures. The table provides little support
for rapidly increasing service exports suggested in some informal accounts. Rather,
overall the aggregate results support the standard practice of treating manufactures
as tradables and services as nontradables goods.

         Export share in total production.



   A look at more disaggregated data reveals substantial variation. Within manu-
facturing, export shares range from 60 percent for metal manufacturing to a low 14
percent for non-metal minerals. Within services, the low overall tradedness contrasts
 "As (at as possible,   missing observations were matched to avoid distortions.

sharply with the 28 percent of transportation services production being exported
in 1985. Indeed, the export sbare of the transport sector, the only subcomponent
of services for which reliable export data are available, exceeds the export of three
manufacturing subsectors, paper products, food and non-metal mineral products.
   Our classification is reported in the last column of table 1. With a 10 percent
threshold , agriculture and mining are classified as tradables, as is all of manufacturing
and transportation. The remaining services, accounting for about 50-60 percent of
GDP, are treated as nontradables.'2 The sizeable differences between sectoral shares
provide our measure with some local robustness: cutting the threshold to 5 percent
would have no effect, raising it to 20 percent would shift the quantitatively small
non-metal mineral products from tradables to nontradables.


5 Sectoral Inflation
Based on the classification derived above, we aggregated the sectoral deflators to
obtain aggregate price indices for tradable and nontradable commodities. The same
aggregation was used to construct time series on sectoral total factor productivities.'3
We begin our empirical discussion by examining the time series and cross sectional
properties of these data.
   Table 2 reports the mean and the standard deviation of the annual change in
the relative price of nontradables to tradables. With the exception of Canada, the
relative price of nontradables increased for all fourteen OECD economies over the 1970
to 1985 period, at an average of more than 1 percent per year. The results are quite
dispersed, ranging from less than zero for Canada to the sustained 3.3 percent higher
inflation rate for nontradables in Japan. Differentiating the core EMS economies
(those who started within the narrow band in 1979: Belgium, Denmark, France,
Germany, the Netherlands) from the remaining OECD economies however reveals a
substantially lower dispersion of relative inflation rates within the core, suggesting a
possible relationship between relative inflation rate dispersion and the exchange rate
regime.

   Figure 2 plots the change in the share of nontradables against the average annual
change in the relative price of nontradables. The figure reveals a negative correlation:
the larger the increase in the relative share of nontradables, the smaller the average
annual increase in the relative price of nontradables. The figures furthermore reveal
that eight of the fourteen OECD economies experienced both an increase in the relative
price of nontradables and an increase in the relative share of nontradables. Only
Japan and Norway experienced an increase in the share of tradable goods above half
of a percentage point. This positive comovement between relative price and relative
output changes suggests that demand side factors played a significant role in the
determination of relative output.
   Table 3 reports the correlation of the tradables inflation rates across the OECD
economies, expressed in common currency. Under relative purchasing power parity,
the correlation would approach unity. In line with a sizeable previous literature, PPP
in this simple sense is rejected for the overall sample. Looking separately at the EMS
core however reveals a fairly close correspondence: the correlation of the German
tradables inflation rate with France amounts to 0.91, with the Netherlands to 0.97,
with Belgium to 0.91 and with Denmark to 0.93. In contrast, the correlation with
European non-EMS economies and non-European countries is significantly lower, with
a zero correlation with the US and a negative correlation with Canada. The data thus
suggest a fair degree of comovements of tradable prices within quasi-fixed exchange
rate blocs, with fairly small correlations between countries linked by flexible exchange
rates. 14

   Interestingly, both the same pattern and—more strikingly—almost the same nu-
merical values are observed for the correlations of nontradable goods inflation rates
(Table 4). Again, the average correlation between core countries, at 0.92, substan-
tially exceeds both the average correlation within non-core countries (0.74) and the
average correlation across the entire sample (0.53).
   The close comovements of both tradable and nontradables prices across the core
admits two explanations under the framework laid out above. First, productivity
shocks to both the tradable and nontradable sectors could be more similar within the
core compared to between core and non-core. Second, demand side shocks, such as
 '4Thi5 is consisnt with th findings of Mussa (1986).

fiscal shifts and income growth, could be more correlated within the core. Moving
beyond the narrow confines of the model, the striking çlifferences between the sub-
groups of economies operating under fixed and under flexible exchange rates suggests
that the exchange rate system may have played an additional independent role.

   Table 5 reports the summary of the correlations of demand and supply factors
across several groups of countries for the entire 1971-1985 period. Among Euro-
pean countries we separate out the core EMS economies (Belgium, Denmark, France,
Germany, Netherlands). We also report the average correlations for the subset of
non-European countries and the total sample of 14 countries.
   The data reveal a moderately positive correlation of both supply side and demand
side shocks for the entire sample. Separating the European economies into core
and non-core suggests a substantially higher correlation of demand and supply shifts
within the core. A comparison of European and non-European economies reveals

    The results are suggestive of an additional determinant of inflation correlations in
Europe. While the exchange rate regime provides an obvious candidate, the possibility
of reverse causation must be taken into account: the higher correlations of sectoral
inflation rates and their determinants within the core-EMS countries may precede the
creation of the EMS and may indeed have been the reason leading these countries to
join the EMS. To control for possible reverse causation we divide the sample period
into pre-EMS (1971—78) and post-EMS (1979—1985). The results are shown in Table 6.
While inflation correlations have increased uniformly across Europe, the correlations
of demand and supply side factors have increased for the non-core but decreased for
the core economies. The marked difference between core and non-core over the two
subsamples is suggestive of an additional role of the exchange rate system in bringing
about the higher correlation of inflation rates.

    To summarize, our initial exploration of the data has yielded a number of inter-
esting results:
    • The relative price of nontradables has increased almost uniformly across the
      fourteen OECD economies over the 1970 to 1985 period.
    • Most countries experienced both an increase in the relative size of the nontrad-
      ables sector and an increase in the relative price of nontradables. The change in
      relative size and in relative price of non-tradeables were negatively correlated.
    • The correlation of inflation rates, productivity growth rates, income growth
      and fiscal growth rates has been substantially higher within the quasi-fixed ex-
      change rate bloc of the EMS core compared to non-core countries. For the core
      economies, the correlation of demand and supply side shifts fall short of the in-
      flation correlations. While the correlation of inflation rates has increased for all
      European countries in the period 1979-85 compared to the period 1971-78, the
      correlation of demand and supply side shocks over the same periods increased
      for the non-core but decreased for the core economies.


6 Determinants of the Relative Price of Nontradables
As a first pass at examining the Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson (HBS) hypothesis, figure
3 plots equation (6), the weighted relative productivity growth against the change in
relative prices. Total factor productivity growth is seen to be higher in the tradable
goods sector (corrected by factor shares) for all the sample countries, as suggested by
the original HBS hypothesis.55 Furthermore, the figure reveals the positive correlation
between the productivity growth differential and the increase in the relative price of
nontradable goods suggested by HBS.
  Taken in conjunction with the finding in figure 2 of a negative relationship between
the relative change in the price of nontradables and the increase in the share of
nontradahles, a first glance at the data thus suggest a significant role of supply side
factors. However, the simultaneous increase in both the relative price and the relative
share of nontradables for a sizable subset of countries suggests that demand side
  '5This result is (empirically) not driven by the correction cepj/ce, it holds when both shares are assumed to be the
same.


                                                         14
factors also matter. We next turn to econometric analysis to disentangle the relative
contribution of the two effects.'6 To distinguish the two :effects, we add demand side
factors to the right hand side of equation (6) and estimate the reduced form equation
(13):

                            Pi, = /3oi + 13i0.,t + f32g,t + I33Yi,i    + f34ir,                         (13)
where 0 corresponds to the difference of total factor productivity across sectors cor-
rected by the labor shares (as in equation (6)), the subscripts i and t indicate country
and time, g is government expenditure over GDP (both in real terms), y is the level
of per capita income, and ir is the first difference of the rate of inflation.
   The coefficient th measures the impact of productivity growth as suggested by
HBS with an expected positive sign. The next two variables (g and y) proxy demand
shifts. While in general the coefficients depend on both supply and demand side
factors, for the specific case of a flat supply curve /32 and /33 will be zero. Signifi-
cant coefficients on income and fiscal growth are thus sufficient to rule out the flat
supply curve assumption underlying the pure HBS model. With a positively sloped
supply curve, both variables are expected to enter positively. Finally, relaxing the as-
sumption of instantaneous price adjustment in the non-traded sector, we include the
first difference of inflation to capture the possibility of transitory dynamics. If price
adjustment in the nontradable sector is more sluggish, an attempt to bring about dis-
inflation via exchange rate appreciation leads to a temporary decline in the relative
price of nontradables and a temporary expansion of relative tradables production,
leading to a predicted negative sign on /3g. For example, De Gregorio, Giovannini
and Krueger (1993) discuss the effects of unwarranted wage increases reflecting e.g.
lacking credibility of macroeconomic policy(makers). With the law of one price hold-
ing in tradables, the wage pressure will be manifested solely in the nontradable sector,
resulting in an increase in the relative price of nontradable goods and a reduction in
the relative output of tradables.
   Because of the high persistence of the explanatory variables as well as of the resid-
uals in the level equation, all regressions were run in first differences using seemingly
  '6For relted mpfric1 evidence on deerminans of he real exchange rate ee Hxieh (1982), Marston (1987), Froot

 unrelated regression with common coefficients across countries. The results are pre-
 sented in table 717 Estimation by SUR in first differences eliminates the constant.'8
 All regressions but 3 and 4 use total government expenditure in GDP, with a sample
 average of 19.4 percent. Regression 3 excludes from government spending the sub-
 category "total purchases of goods and services," with a sample average of 5.2 per-
 cent, to obtain a closer approximation of spending on non-tradeables. The remaining
 government expenditure comprises mostly employment compensations, amounting to
 roughly three quarters of total government expenditure. Regression 4 uses, instead,
 only purchases of goods and services. The number of observations in regressions 3
 and 4 declines because data are not available for Belgium and Italy.
    The coefficients on total factor productivity differentials have the expected value
 in all the specifications and are statistically significant. The average coefficient esti-
mate of 0.23 (in regressions 1—4) implies that a 3 percentage points faster productivity
growth in the tradable goods sector results in a 0.7 percent increase in the relative
price of nontradables. The coefficient on total factor productivity differentials in-
creases somewhat when income growth or changes in government expenditure are
omitted from the regressions (see 5—7). The highest point estimate is 0.38.
   The coefficient on total government expenditure over GDP (regressions 1—2, and
5—8) is always positive and significant, with point estimates ranging between 1.5 and
2.0, suggesting that an increase of one percentage point in the share of government
expenditure increases the relative price of nontradable goods by 1.5 to 2 percent.
Regression 3, which uses employment compensations, shows no significant differences
with 1. However, regression 4, which uses only the subcategory of purchases of goods
and services, yields an insignificant coefficient, lending credence to the use of the
compensation variable as a better measure of government nontradables spending.
   '1To test for robustness, all regression reported in this section and the evidence presented in the previous section
were performed with two alternative classifications. The first one excluded electricity, gas and water, production of
gOvenlnsent services, and other services from the nontradable goods sector, and included transportation, storage and
conununication services as nontradable goods. The second alternative classification looked at a narrower set of sectors,
by including only manufacturing as tradable goods; and wholesale and retail trade, restaurants, hotels, transport,
storage, cormnm,ication, finance, insurance, real estate, and community, social and personal services as nontradables.
Overall, the results were robust to this changes of classification, indicating that our result are not stemming from
some specific sector misclassified.
  '"To capture potential country specific effects, the regressions were also estimated with country specific intercepts,
and the results did not change significantly.

All regressions were estimated using SUR for the first differences of (13).
Regressions 3 and 4 uses a narrower measure of government expenditure (see text).
Regression 8 includes two dummy variables for the oil shocks (see text).

   The second demand variable, income growth, enters positively as expected, and
in most cases significantly, with a coefficient in the order of 0.24 and 0.29 (except
in regressions 4 and 6, where the exclusion of the relevant component of government
expenditure reduces the point estimate to 0.17 and 0.09, respectively) suggesting that
a five percent income growth would be matched by a 1 percent increase in the rela-
tive price of nontradables. Several authors have interpreted the positive correlation
between the relative price of nontradables as an indication of the importance of pro-
ductivity differentials [e.g., Kravis, Heston and Summers (1983)]. Implicitly, these
authors thus associate income growth solely with supply rather than demand factors.
The regressions however reveal an effect of income growth on the relative price of
nontradable goods even after controlling for productivity differentials, justifying its
interpretation as an indicator of demand.
    Regressions 2 and 8 reveal some evidence for differential price adjustment speeds
across sectors: in the sample, disinflation is associated with an increase in the relative
price of nontradables, suggesting more flexible tradable goods prices in line with the
discussion of section 2. The finding is consistent with the real appreciation typically
observed in the aftermath of exchange rate stabilizations. Interestingly, the effect
appears to be common across exchange rate regimes: including a dummy variable
interacting with the acceleration of inflation for core EMS economies versus non-EMS
yielded an insignificant coefficient.
   Finally, we examine the potential role of the two oil price shocks falling within our
sample. By inducing a simultaneous decline in both income and the relative price
of nontradables, an oil price increase potentially enhances the negative correlation
illustrated earlier. Regressions 2 and 8 includes 2 dummy variables for the oil shocks,
taking values of one in 1974—75 and in 1979—80 respectively. However, little evidence
for a major role emerges: the dummies were marginally significant, and the parameter
estimates remain almost unchanged. Including measures of the real price of oil likewise
does not suggest that the two oil price shocks contributed significantly to the stylized
facts presented above.
   The results presented so far suggest a rather more important role for demand side
movements than suggested by the previous literature. To some degree, our results may
however depend on the use of relatively high frequency data, potentially concealing
long run trends. While our results reject the notion of a short run flat supply curve,

                                           18
it may be more reasonable to think of perfect capital mobility as holding over the
long run, and thus of the supply curve becoming flatter as the observation frequency
declines. To allow for this possibility we estimate regression (13) using the average
rate of growth of the variables during the period 197085:'

R2 = 0.31, and N obs. = 14.
   The coefficient on total factor productivity differentials increases and becomes
insignificantly different from unity. In contrast, the coefficients on the share of gov-
ernment expenditure and per capita income become insignificantly different from
zero, indicating an increased importance of supply and a diminishing importance of
demand factors in the long run.
   In order to disentangle the relative importance of demand and supply factors in
the rising trend of the relative price of nontradables, table 8 uses the estimated short
(equation 1 in table 7) and long run (equation (14)) regression equations to decompose
the average annual increase in the relative price of nontradables into the contribution
made by the faster growth of total factor productivity in the tradable goods sector,
the contribution made by increasing government expenditures and income, and a
residual.2° While the high correlation the explanatory variables suggests some caution
in interpreting the table, the results indicate that in the short run demand side factors,
in particular income growth, rather than relative productivity growth differentials
were the dominant determinant of relative price changes over the sample period.
Government spending plays a fairly secondary role, reflecting the small overall change
in the share of government spending during the sample period [see also De Gregorio,
Giovaimini and Krueger (1993)]. In the long run, as reflected in the coefficients
of equation (14), most of the increase in the relative price of nontradables can be
explained by the faster increase of total factor productivity in the tradable goods
sector.
  t9Since we are interested in trend movements, we exclude the temporary effects from changes in inflation.
  20Since we are interested in trend movements, we exclude the temporary effects from changes in inflation. The
percentage change in the relative price of nontradables is calculated as the log-difference. Table 2 employed the 15th
root, resulting in small differences between the average in the two tables.

7 Concluding Remarks
The failure of high inflation countries in the OECD to converge towards their better
performing partners has been often attributed to lacking credibility arising from the
strategic interactions among unions, employers, and policymakers. The results of this
paper suggest that more fundamental factors may also be to blame.
   Examining sectoral data for 14 OECD countries we find that inflation over the 1970
to 1985 period has been driven predominantly by the nontradables sector. Examin-
ing the determinants of relative inflation rates we find empirical support for several
effects. First, through its impact on the composition of demand, trend growth in
income (and to a lesser extent government spending) has contributed to the increase
in the relative price of nontradables. Second, higher trend growth of total factor
productivity in tradables has operated in the same direction, suggesting that efforts
to raise productivity growth in the nontradables sector, for example by stimulating
increased competition, may provide a promising avenue towards disinflation. Third,
we also find that the relative price of nontradables decrease as inflation accelerates,
suggesting differential adjustment speeds across sectors.
   The data reveal a substantially higher correlation between demand and supply
shifts, and hence of relative price movements for the EMS-core countries. Moreover,
sectoral inflation rates are substantially more correlated among the EMS core than
are the demand and supply factors. These findings suggest a potential effect of the
exchange rate regime on relative price movements.
