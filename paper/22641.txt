                                          ABSTRACT

Sports participation is a leading environmental explanation of the male advantage in some spatial
skills. We exploit the large increase in females’ high school sports participation due to Title IX
to test this hypothesis. We relate Title IX induced increases in females’ sport participation to the
spatial content of their occupational employment as captured by Dictionary of Occupational
Titles codes, and a test of three dimensional spatial rotation. We find little evidence that this
increase in sports participation had an impact on either of these measures.

Introduction


       “Lab research” on sex differences in humans finds that females and males differ

in some (but not all) spatial skills. On balance this sex difference favors males. “Why?”

is an important question for our knowledge of how skills are formed, but also for

understanding persistent female/male differences in field of study and occupational

choice. Spatial skills are strong predictors of entry into STEM fields (e.g., Sorby 2009,

Wai et al. 2009) and so this sex difference might help account for the lower presence of

females in these occupations. 1 Baker and Cornelson (2016) report that spatial skills and

depth perception, as captured by the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), are

statistically and economically significant predictors of gender separation in the labor

market. Based on a simulation, they conclude that negating this selection on spatial skills

would, all else equal, lower the Duncan Index 2 of gender segregation in the labor market

by roughly 10 percent in both 1970 and 2012. 3

       The sex difference in some dimensions of spatial cognition emerges at very young

ages (e.g., Moore and Johnson 2008, Quinn and Liben 2008). In tables 1 and 2 we report

sex differences in tests of two dimensional and three dimensional spatial rotation by

grade (controlling for age) and by age (controlling for grade), from the Project Talent

  The Duncan Index is a common measure of segregation. It is often interpreted as
indicating (in this application) the percentage of females (or males) who would need to
change occupations if the occupational distribution of men and women were to be the
same.
3
  While eliminating selection on spatial skills would reduce the amount of employment
segregation, the authors show that it would also tend to increase the male-female wage
gap, because it would reduce female employment in a number of highly-paid occupations
that have low spatial aptitude ratings.


                                                                                            2
data. 4 This is a survey of roughly 5 percent of the US high school population in 1960.

The test scores are standardized so the estimated sex differences are in standard

deviations. The results indicate that a) the sex difference in spatial abilities captured by

these tests is evident by high school entry, and b) the sex difference grows over the high

school years. They point to an origin of these sex differences at younger ages and

suggest that the differences are potentially affected by the passage through high school.

       There are at least three contending hypotheses of why gender differences in

spatial skills exist. One is based on the effects of the higher androgen exposure males

experience in the pre and post natal periods. A second is based in the principle of

evolutionary selection and females’ historical role as gatherers and males’ historical role

as hunters. A third, and the focus here, is based in corresponding sex differences in

environmental stimuli that differentially promote the development of spatial skills in

males and females.

       As researchers have pointed out, unlike for quantitative, verbal and reasoning

skills, spatial skill development is not an element of normal school curricula (e.g.,

Halpern et al. 2007). Therefore, non- or extra-curricular activities have emerged as

potentially important early life environmental factors affecting spatial skill development

(Sherman 1967). Most recently, boys higher use of computers and greater gaming

activities have been investigated as agents of spatial cognition (e.g., Cherney and London

2006, Cherney 2008, Connelly et al. 2012). However for a majority of current labor

market participants a more historically relevant environmental factor may be males’

                                                                                               3
higher rates of participation in sports and physical play (e.g., Baenninger and Newcombe

1989, Bjorkland and Brown 1989, Halpern 2012).

        As has been noted previously, the relationship between males’ higher

participation in sports and better spatial skills in some dimensions needn’t be causal.

Boys may simply participate more in sports because they have higher spatial skills for

some other reason (Crawford and Chaffin 1997, Halpern 2012).

        Environmental theories of sex differences in skills and attributes are commonly

evaluated indirectly by the age at which the difference first appears. The reasoning is, the

younger the age of emergence a sex difference the less likely environmental factors can

be important. This testing strategy therefore typically aims to rule out the entire class of

environmental explanations rather than distinguish among its competing elements.

While perhaps sound in principle, this approach faces the challenge that it is difficult to

test very young children and the results of tests at young ages are often open to

interpretation. 5

        While the sex differences in spatial skills have been tracked to young ages (e.g.,

table 1), so have sex typed sports participation and play. We adopt a different empirical

strategy examining the impact of a large, quasi experimental change in females’ sports

participation at childhood ages—Title IX. As documented by Stevenson (2007, 2010)

Title IX, which banned sex discrimination in programs and activities at federally funded

educational institutions, led to a dramatic increase in female participation in high school

level sports over the 1970s. Female participation rose from under 5 percent at the start of

the decade to close to 30 percent by the end. At the same time male participation
5
 See, for example, Connellan et al.’s (2000) evidence of females’ people orientation and
males’ mechanical/things orientation in a sample of one day old babies, and the resulting
debate (e.g., Halpern 2012).


                                                                                               4
remained fairly constant at between 50 and 60 percent. Stevenson reports that this

increase in participation led to consequent increases in females’ education attainment,

labor force participation and, intriguingly, their choices of occupations. We follow up on

this latter finding to discover if there was a corresponding change in the spatial content of

women’s jobs.

       We measure the spatial content of employment using the Dictionary of

Occupational Titles (DOT). The DOT codes provide ratings of occupations in terms of a

variety of aptitudes, skills, physical demands, environments and cognitive requirements.

We use the aptitude “spatial” and the physical demand “depth perception” to capture the

spatial content employment.

       A direct method of evaluating the impact of sports participation on spatial

cognition is with measures of individuals’ spatial skills. Unfortunately tests of spatial

skills are not regularly conducted on national samples. That said, we do have access to

national level tests that broadly bracket the enactment of Title IX, and also bring this

evidence to the analysis.

       We begin by briefly reviewing the literature on sex differences in spatial skills

and providing an overview of Title IX. After outlining our measurement and empirical

strategy, we present OLS and IV results of the impact of sports participation on the

spatial content of women’s jobs. The estimates are consistently very small, negative and

statistically insignificant. We then show that this evidence is consistent with estimates of

the impact of Title IX induced sports participation on direct measures of the spatial skills

of high school seniors.

       In a series of robustness checks we show that our results are not a result of cross




                                                                                               5
state differences in pre-existing trends in the spatial content of employment, and that they

are robust to an alternative estimation procedure that uses comparisons of spatial

employment changes between men and women within the same state. We also explore

the possibility that the results are a result of differences in the spatial content of the

particular sports that men and women play, and show that any such differences are

unlikely to be leading to our results. The bulk of women’s increased participation was in

sports that rely relatively heavily on spatial skills (such as basketball and tennis).

Weighting increases in participation based on an external ranking of sports’ spatial

demand makes no difference to our results.

        Finally, we show that our results are unlikely to be explained by changes in the

overall educational, physical and interpersonal demands of jobs chosen by women (which

might mask an increase in spatial aptitude if they are negatively correlated with spatial

skills across jobs.) We perform a principal components analysis of these broader job

characteristics, and show that none of the components that capture the spatial skills are

significantly affected by Title IX. On net, it seems that the increase in sports participation

that we analyze had very little influence on the types of jobs chosen by women.

        Our results contribute to a small but growing literature in economics on the

sources and consequences of gender differences in skills and attitudes that are important

in the labor market. A number of studies have examined the importance of “people

skills” in which females are widely viewed as having an advantage (e.g., Weinberg 2000;

Black and Spitz-Oener 2011; Borghans et al. 2014, Weinberger 2014 and Deming 2016).

Another branch of this literature examines sex differences in competitiveness (e.g.,

Croson and Gneezy 2009, Niederle and Vesterlund 2011, Buser et al. 2014). The gender




                                                                                             6
gap in spatial skills is widely acknowledged in other fields. Spatial skills are viewed an

important prerequisite to success in STEM occupations, but to our knowledge they have

not been the subject of much previous study in economics.

Sex Differences in Spatial Cognition

         As noted in the Introduction, a male advantage in some spatial abilities has been

widely documented. In her summary of the literature, Halpern (2012) reports that while

there is a male advantage in spatial perception, mental rotation, spatiotemporal ability,

and to a lesser extent, spatial visualization, the evidence for abilities related to the

generation and maintenance of a spatial image is mixed. Sanders (2013) reports that

females have an advantage in remembering the spatial location of objects in an array.

Many of these sex differences emerge very early in life (Halpern 2012). The evidence in

tables 1 and 2 for tests of mental rotation point to an origin pre high school.

          Spatial perception is the ability to identify the vertical or horizontal planes in a

stationary display while ignoring irrelevant information. Mental rotation is the ability to

envision how objects appear when rotated in two or three dimensional space. Spatial

visualization involves multistep processing of spatial input—for example identifying

where hole punches through a folded piece of paper will appear when the paper is

unfolded. Spatiotemporal abilities involve processing dynamic spatial displays, such as

identifying arrival time for a moving object and judging velocity. Generation and

maintenance of a spatial image involves performing a task using a spatial image drawn

from memory. 6

         One theory of the source of these sex differences is the higher level of androgens

males are exposed to prenatally and at very young ages. Higher levels of testosterone in

                                                                                                 7
utero are thought to slow the development of the left side of the brain leading to right side

dominance (e.g., Collaer et al. 2007, Peters et al. 2007). Many visual spatial functions

are controlled by the right hemisphere of the brain, and there is evidence that spatial

abilities are related to the 2D:4D ratio. 7

        A second theory of some of these sex differences is based in evolutionary theories

(e.g., Jones et al. 2003). For example, one hypothesis is that females perform better at

object location tasks reflecting their historical duties as food gatherers. A complementary

hypothesis is that males are better at geographic tasks due to their historical duties as

hunters. Sanders (2013) interprets the male advantage in coincidence-anticipation timing

as consistent with a hunting past. 8

        A third interpretation of the sex differences in spatial abilities is that they are

environmentally determined. Support comes from evidence that the sex difference varies

across countries according to some measures of socio-economic development (e.g., Lippa

et al. 2008). There is also evidence that spatial cognition is responsive to training (e.g.,

Miller and Halpern 2013, Hyde 2014). Finally, during childhood boys and girls

participate in sex typed activities. Boys participate more in some activities that are

thought to promote spatial skills (Halpern 2012).

        Proximate environmental factors that lead to population level sex differences in

spatial abilities have not been so rigorously investigated. One challenge is that there is

little explicit training in spatial skills at the elementary and secondary school levels. Two

candidates, which may have different generational relevance, are computer gaming and

  He also interprets the female performance superiority for stimuli in near space tasks and
male superiority for stimuli in far space tasks within a hunter/gatherer perspective.

athletic activity. 9

        There is evidence that both male and female athletes perform better on formal

tests of spatial skills than non athletes (e.g., Ozel et al. 2004, Notarnicola et al. 2014).

Furthermore, boys participate in sporting activities at higher rates than girls starting at

young ages (Cherney and London 2006, Stevenson 2007; Vilhjalmsson and

Kristjansdottir 2003 and references therein). Also, research suggests spatial aptitude is

responsive to athletic training for both males and females (e.g., Deno 1995, Moreau et al.

2012). Together this evidence provides a basis for suspecting a relationship between

boys’ greater participation in sports and higher spatial cognition, but it does not provide a

causal link.

Title IX

        Title IX, enacted by Congress in 1972, was part of the “Education Amendments

of 1972”. 10 It prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex at federally funded

educational institutions. Perhaps its best known impacts have been on high school level

and collegiate sports programs. While as Stevenson (2010) notes, the compliance

requirements were quite complex, roughly speaking in the sports domain Title IX

required high schools and colleges to raise female athletic participation to approximate

equality with their male athletic participation by July 1978. Pre Title IX, male athletic

participation rates in high school varied considerably by state, while female athletic

participation rates were uniformly low. Therefore, the challenge of Title IX compliance

9
  While computer gaming and athletic activity, two experiential pastimes associated with
males, have garnered much attention, there are numerous female and gender neutral
extracurricular activities thought to promote spatial cognition. For example, Newcombe
et al (1983) in their catalogue of spatial activities cite pursuits such as horse jumping,
drawing and painting, ballet, field hockey, knitting and gymnastics.
10
   Much of the following discussion follows Stevenson (2010).


                                                                                               9
varied significantly at the state level. This feature, along with an argument that the

enactment of Title IX was uncorrelated with unobserved determinants of athletic

participation rates and later student outcomes, makes this episode an attractive forum to

evaluate the impacts of high school athletic participation.

        Stevenson (2010) provides this analysis, showing that female athletic participation

rates in high school increase sharply after Title IX came into effect. She reports that

female participation rose from under 5 percent pre Title IX to close to 30 percent by the

end of the 1970s. This increase in participation was also positively related to a state’s pre

Title IX male athletic participation reflecting how the compliance target varied at the

state level.

        Stevenson also provides instrumental variables (IV) estimates of the impact of

females’ sports participation on their labor market participation and educational

attainment, using pre Title IX male participation rates as an instrument. The estimates

indicate that sports participation positively affected both these outcomes. Secondary

results indicate that states with greater growth in opportunities for females to play sports

saw greater growth of females in “male” and “mixed” occupations relative to female

occupations. To the extent that male and mixed employment is positively related to the

spatial skill requirements of jobs, this is an initial signal that the increased female sports

participation precipitated by Title IX may have increased the spatial content of female

employment.

        There are potentially many reasons why Title IX led to increased educational

attainment and labor market participation. Stevenson (2010) points to possible positive

effects of athletic participation on the ability to compete in a controlled environment and




                                                                                             10
work in a team setting. Athletics may also enhance self-esteem, create larger social

networks and engender more encouragement and attention from adults. Our focus here is

on sports’ documented impact on spatial skills. Of course, if other skills that are

influenced by sports participation are negatively correlated with spatial requirements

across jobs, it is possible that we will not see an increase in the spatial content of

employment even if women’s spatial skills have improved. We investigate this possibility

in our robustness checks.

       Title IX also changed females’ opportunities to participate in sports at the

elementary, junior and post secondary school levels. As Stevenson (2007, 2010) notes

sports participation at the college level is much lower than at the high school level, so any

contribution of increased opportunities at the postsecondary level are unlikely to account

for a large share of any effect. Potentially more important are the opportunities in

elementary schools, which had a much shorter window to comply with the new law—a

deadline of July 1976. Therefore, most “post Title IX members” of our analysis samples

will have also been exposed to any increased opportunities for female sports participation

at the elementary and junior school levels. The sample females’ exposure to increased

opportunities for sports participation as result of title IX could have started at ages

younger than high school entry.

Data and empirical strategy

       Our data on male and female high school sports participation were provided by

the National Federation of High Schools (NFHS), which tracks male and female

participation by state, sport, sex and year. We use data from the 1971-72 school year to

construct pre-Title IX male and female participation rates, and from 1977-78 to construct




                                                                                           11
female sports participation rates just prior to the compliance deadline. 11 We divide the

numbers of female or male participants in sports (or a particular sport) by an estimate of

either female or male high school enrolment at the state/year level 12 to produce

participation rates. A list of the sports captured by the data, as well as information on the

number states offering each sport is provided in the appendix.

       To link sports participation to occupational skills, we use data from the 1980 and

2000 Public Use Census samples. We examine outcomes for women aged 25-34 in each

year, who have at least a high school education and who are working in the civilian

labour force. The 1980 sample will contain individuals who completed high school prior

to Title IX, while the 2000 sample will contain individuals who completed high school in

a period when states were required to be in compliance with Title IX.

       To measure occupational skills, we link 1990 Census occupation codes to

measures of skills from the 1991 Dictionary of Occupational Titles. 13 The DOT, which

11
   Data prior to 1971-72 do not identify female participants. A change in the data
collection methods starting with the 1978-79 school year render the data from this year
forward not directly comparable to earlier data. Following Stevenson (2010) we omit
data for Iowa from the analysis as this state did not start reporting participation by sex
until the 1981-82 wave.
12
   High school enrolment by sex is not available for these years at the state level. We
simply calculate the numbers of females (males) as 50 percent of the total. Total high
school enrolment by state by year is obtained from the National Center for Education
Statistics. An alternative strategy followed by Stevenson (2010) is to try to infer sex
specific enrolments from reported high school graduation rates in the 1980 and 2000
censuses. As noted by Stevenson, the limitations of this approach include that it also
captures GED certification and must use state of birth to identify state of high school, but
it also potentially accounts for any increases in female enrolments as a result of increased
athletic opportunities. In any event, Stevenson reports that her results are robust to using
the 50/50 allocation, which we also find using the alternative.
13
   The DOT codes are at a finer level of occupational detail than the Census occupation
coding scheme (so that each Census code contains a number of DOT occupations). We
average the DOT ratings across all DOT occupations within a Census code, using
occupations’ shares of employment as weights. As a result, although our DOT measures
are categorical, they are continuous within our data.


                                                                                            12
was created by the U.S. Department of Labor, rates each of several thousand occupations

along a number of dimensions such as aptitudes, temperaments, environments and

physical demands. Our measures of spatial skills from the DOT are the aptitude “spatial”

and the physical demand “depth perception”. 14

       The spatial aptitude is, “The ability to think visually of geometric forms and to

comprehend the two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional objects. The ability

to recognize the relationships resulting from the movement of objects in space” (US

Department of Labor 1991). This measurement roughly captures some of the skills of

mental rotation and spatiotemporal ability. Optometry is an occupation with a very high

level of this aptitude, while insurance, sales is an occupation with a very low level.

       Depth perception is, “Three-dimensional vision. Ability to judge distances and

spatial relationships so as to see objects where and as they actually are” (US Department

of Labor 1991). Examples provided in the coding handbook span spatiotemporal abilities

and coincidence anticipation timing skills. Bus driving is an occupation with a high

demand of this skill, while sociology is an occupation with a low demand for this skill.

       Our identification strategy follows Stevenson (2010). Because Title IX applied

nationwide, a strategy that simply related pre/post Title IX time series variation in an

outcome (e.g., the spatial content of female employment) to corresponding variation in

female athletic participation, might possibly be confounded by contemporaneous time

varying factors that also affected the outcome. As a result, Stevenson uses an

14
   While “physical activity” may suggest either activities such as crouching, or physical
capacities such as strength, both or which are rated in this category, the DOT also deems
activities such as vision acuity, talking and depth perception as “physical”. A key
distinction from “aptitudes” is that physical activities can be measured by their frequency
(not present through constant) while aptitudes are measured in terms of percentile ranges
relative to a population.


                                                                                           13
instrumental variables (IV) approach that relates cross state, pre/post Title IX changes in

outcomes, to cross state changes (1971-72 to 1977-78) in females’ sports participation,

using cross state variation in pre Title IX males’ sports participation (in 1971-72) as an

instrument. Variation in the “1972” male participation rates captures corresponding

variation in the targets states had to pursue to comply with Title IX. Note that the

assumption here is the correlation of the change in any outcome with the cross state

variation in male sports participation pre Title IX distinguishes a Title IX sports effect

from time effects that were concurrent with the enactment of the amendments.

using men’s 1972 high school sport participation rate interacted with the POST (c=2000)

dummy variable. We standardize the DOT aptitude/skill measures to have a mean of

zero and a standard deviation of one. Standard errors are clustered at the state/cohort

level.

         We also provide direct evidence on the relationship between spatial skills and

sports participation using a test of spatial skills from the sample of seniors in the Project

Talent data and Seniors Cohort of the High School and Beyond (HSB) dataset. This is the

test of three dimensional spatial rotation from the Project Talent survey (e.g., tables 1 and

2) that was administered to the seniors cohort of the HSB. As noted above, the Project



                                                                                             14
Talent data are from 1960, while the HSB data are from 1980. Therefore, the Project

Talent testing predates Title IX, while the deadline for Title IX compliance is

approximately at the midpoint of the high school career of seniors in the HSB. In both

cases, we restrict the sample to respondents aged 16-19; this encompasses 95% of the

respondents in the High School and Beyond data, and 97% of the Project Talent data. We

also restrict the sample to respondents with an identifiable race. Our measure of spatial

ability in both samples is the number of correct answers on the spatial test, which ranges

from 0 to 16. We standardize this measure separately by year to have a mean of zero and

a standard deviation of one. 15

OLS estimates of the relationship between sports participation and the spatial

content of employment

       We begin our analysis by investigating the simple OLS relationship between

sports participation and the spatial content of employment at the state level within our

census analysis samples. To do this we run the regressions

(2)            𝑆𝑖𝑠𝑐 = 𝜂 + 𝜙𝑃𝑠𝑐 + 𝜋𝑋𝑖𝑠𝑐 + 𝜔𝑖𝑠𝑐

pooling men and women together.

       The results are reported in table 3. The first estimate for each measure of the

spatial content of employment excludes state fixed effects and so captures both the cross

section and time series (conditional on a common time effect) variation in the data. In

each instance there is a positive and statistically significant relationship between sports

participation and the spatial content of employment. For example, a 100 percentage point

increase in high school sports participation is estimated to increase the “spatial” aptitude

15
  These regressions include three indicators for age and two indicators for race (black
and other, with white as the omitted category.)


                                                                                              15
of employment by 11 percent of a standard deviation and physical demand “depth

perception” by almost 14 percent of a standard deviation.

       The second estimate for each measure is also conditional on state fixed effects.

Therefore, the identification is within state variation in sports participation and the spatial

content of employment conditional on the common time effect. In each case the estimate

is larger, for the spatial aptitude markedly so. A 100 percentage point increase in sports

participation now increases this measure of the spatial content of employment by over 20

percent of a standard deviation.

       These estimates are consistent with a hypothesis that sports participation promotes

the spatial cognition demanded in certain occupations. However, it may also be true that

individuals with higher spatial cognition for other reasons are drawn to both sports while

a child, and occupations using spatial skills when an adult.

The effect of Title IX on sports participation and the spatial content of employment

       To address the potential bias in the OLS estimates in tables 3, we next focus on

the increase in females’ high school sports participation precipitated by Title IX. We

begin estimating the first stage relationship between the change in females’ sports

participation and males’ pre Title IX sports participation. The equation estimated is

                 𝑓                    𝑚
(3)            𝑃𝑠𝑐 = 𝜃 + 𝜅 ∙ (𝑃𝑂𝑆𝑇 ∙ 𝑃𝑠1972 ) + 𝜆𝑋𝑠𝑐 + 𝜈𝑠𝑐

The result is reported in the top panel of table 4. The estimated coefficient on the

instrument indicates that states that had a 10 percentage point higher Title IX target saw

an over 5 percentage point higher increase in female sports participation. The F-statistic

for the regression allays any fears about weak instruments. Similar to Stevenson (2010),

the result indicates that pre Title IX males’ sport participation is a strong predictor of the




                                                                                             16
change in females’ high school sports participation. It is this estimated increase in

females’ sport participation that is the basis for our hypotheses for changes in females’

spatial employment.

       A base set of estimates of the impact of female sports participation on the spatial

content of their occupational employment is presented in the bottom panel of table 4. In

the first row are the reduced form estimates from regressing the DOT aptitude/skill

rating—spatial and depth perception—of females’ employment directly on the instrument

and the controls. The estimates on the instrument indicate a negative, insignificant

relationship between the pre/post Title IX change in the (DOT) spatial content of

females’ employment and males’ pre Title IX sport participation.

       The IV estimates in the second row confirm this inference. Each estimate is

negative, statistically insignificant and very close to zero. A 100 percentage point

increase in female participation is estimated to decrease the spatial aptitude of

employment by 0.6 percent of a standard deviation and the depth perception of

employment by 1.7 percent of a standard deviation. The conclusion here is that the

increase in females’ sports participation as a result of Title IX, had no impact on the

spatial content of their employment.

       The “failure” of the IV estimates to yield a positive impact of female sports

participation on the spatial content of women’s occupational employment is clearly

demonstrated in figures 1 and 2. Here we graph the state level changes in our DOT

measures on male sports participation in 1972. These graphs capture the reduced form

relationship between the instrument and our measure of the change in the spatial content

of the jobs females hold. There was an increase in the DOT spatial content of female




                                                                                            17
employment over the 1970s, but it bears little relationship to the cross sectional levels of

pre Title IX male sports participation. The change in the DOT depth perception is on

balance negative, but the only states experiencing positive growth are those with the

lowest targets for Title IX compliance. Given that this cross state variation in male

participation is a strong predictor of the change in females’ sports participation over the

period Title IX was enacted, there is little evidence here that this increase in female sports

participation lies behind the increase in “spatial employment”.

Direct Evidence of the Impact of Sports Participation on Spatial Skills

        A potential qualification to this conclusion is that our findings could be influenced

by any changes in females’ labor market participation between our pre and post Title IX

samples. Note that we are not using any secular changes in the spatial content of female

employment for identification. Stevenson (2010) provides evidence, however, that there

are increases of females’ participation correlated with pre Title IX male’s sport

participation—Title IX induced sports participation increased females’ participation in

the labor market. 16 One could construct a story in which sport participation increases

females’ spatial skills, but also spatial skills are positively related to labor market

participation, and the entrance of workers with lower skills brought down the average

level of skills in the sample working population. 17

        To try to address this issue we examine a direct measure of spatial skills for
16
   Stevenson (2010) reports that the labor force participation of 24-34 year old women
rose from 62% to 72% between 1980 and 2000, and roughly 4 percentage points of this
increase could be attributed to Title IX.
17
   For example, suppose that the positive effects of sports participation on spatial skills
are confined to the new entrants to the labor force, whose higher levels of these skills are
nevertheless lower than unaffected labor force participants. More plausibly the impact of
sports participation on spatial skills is more widely distributed, but nevertheless the net
effect of the increase in these skills and the increase in participation is a lower level of
spatial skills among market participants.


                                                                                              18
graduating seniors from the Project Talent and HSB data sets. Although conditional on

continuing in high school until grade 12, these samples do provide a more temporally

stable population. 18

        In Table 5 we report reduced form and IV estimates of the impact of Title IX

induced sports participation on the spatial test score. 19 Both the reduced form and IV

specifications estimates are small, negative and statistically insignificant. Figure 3 shows

the reduced form specification visually; the estimated regression line linking changes in

females’ spatial test scores to male 1972 sports participation is almost perfectly flat.

These results strongly echo the results in table 5 for the spatial content of female

employment.

        Note that by using the Project Talent data as our pre Title IX observation, these

estimates also capture any changes in spatial skills over the 1960’s to the extent they are

correlated with pre Title IX male sports participation. In attempt to net out any 1960s

change in spatial skills due to changes in female sports participation, we have re-

estimated the reduced form omitting states with unusually high rates of female sports

participation in 1972. The results are almost identical to those in table 6. 20

        We have also re-estimated the reduced form substituting Grade 10 Project Talent
18
   Heckman and Lafontaine (2010) report that the high school graduation rate increased
by just over 5 percentage points between 1960 and 1980.
19
   The first stage for the IV estimates in Table 5 is nearly identical to the first stage
presented in Table 4; the coefficient on the instrument is 0.509 (the same as in Table 4)
and the F-statistic is 82.7, slightly stronger than the 80.1 shown in Table 4. The
difference between the first stages arises from the relative weight of each state in the
regression, which may differ because of the distribution of respondents across states; in
practice, this matters very little.
20
   The coefficient on the reduced form estimates is -0.054 and insignificant if we exclude
the top four states (which have participation rates of 0.15-0.2, as opposed to less than 0.1
for all other states.) If we exclude all states with sports participation above 0.05 (21 states
and 29 percent of observations), the coefficient is 0.058, and is still statistically
insignificant.


                                                                                             19
test scores for the grade 12 results. 21 As noted above, high schools graduation rates are

marginally higher in 1980 than in 1960. By substituting a lower grade’s scores for the

1960 observations we attempt to better hold constant the underlying population being

tested. The results are quite similar using the grade 10 scores: the coefficient on the

instrument in the reduced form is -0.073, as opposed to -0.053 in our main results, and

remains insignificant. 22

Robustness Checks and Alternative Hypotheses

          In this section, we investigate the possibility that there are pre-existing trends in

the spatial content of women’s employment that are correlated with men’s pre Title IX

sports participation in 1972. Next, we consider two alternative explanations of our

conclusion that the increase in females’ sports participation as a result of Title IX had no

impact on their relative spatial skills. First, we explore the possibility that Title IX had

no impact on females’ spatial skills because it increased participation in sports that have

little spatial content. Second, we investigate a hypothesis of how Title IX might causally

affect females’ spatial skills, with no concurrent effect on the spatial content of their

occupations. This could occur if Title IX had even stronger impacts on females’ levels of

other job-relevant aptitudes that are negatively correlated across occupations with spatial

skills.

Robustness checks

          An a priori objection to using the Title IX framework to evaluate the contribution
21
   While the females’ spatial scores change by grade, our focus is the relative pre/post
change in scores correlated by males’ pre Title IX sports participation, so this should not
be a significant consideration as long as the grade effect is uniform across states.
22
   If we instead use the scores for grade 11 students the reduced form estimate is -0.028
and statistically insignificant. Finally, if we use grade 9 grades, a perhaps less advisable
strategy due the higher presence of retentions in this grade (Heckman and Lafontaine
2010) the reduced form estimate is 0.014 and statistically insignificant.


                                                                                                  20
of sports participation to spatial cognition is if there was some pre existing relationship

between males’ pre Title IX high school sport participation levels by state (the

instrument) and trends in the spatial content of state employment. 23 For example, states

with higher male sport participation rates, and thus higher targets under Title IX, might

also have greater growth in (female) employment with high levels of spatial skills.

       To test for such a relationship, we estimate a placebo reduced form regression of

pre Title IX employment outcomes on the instrument. These regressions are of the same

format as in table 4, except now we measure the spatial content of females’ employment

using data from the 1970 and 1980 censuses, rather than the 1980 and 2000 censuses. The

1970 and 1980 data exclusively capture individuals who completed high school pre Title

IX.

           The results are reported in the top panel of table 6. The estimate for the spatial

aptitude is positive, but small and statistically insignificant. The estimate for depth

perception is also positive, modest and marginally statistically significant. There is no

strong evidence that females in states with high pre Title IX males’ sport participation

experienced substantially higher growth of occupational employment with a high spatial

content.

       Although it does not appear that male sports participation in 1972 was correlated

with underlying changes in the labor market that would affect the spatial content of

women’s jobs, it is worth noting that any such changes would also be likely to affect

men. In contrast, Title IX provided a shock to the sports participation of women only. We

next adopt a difference-in-differences framework to evaluate how any common trends
23
  Stevenson (2010) provides further discussion of the factors driving pre Title IX
variation in males’ sports participation across states, including school size and climate—
time invariant fixed factors.


                                                                                                21
over the decade Title IX came into effect changed the spatial content of employment.

        In bottom panel of table 6 we report the results of a difference-in-differences

regression relating changes in the spatial content of women’s jobs to changes in the

spatial content of men’s jobs in the same state, pre- and post-Title IX. The regression

equation is

          𝑓                                                                𝑚
(4)     𝑆𝑖𝑠𝑐 = 𝜏 + 𝜑 ∙ 𝐹𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑒 + 𝜇 ∙ 𝑃𝑂𝑆𝑇 + 𝜌 ∙ 𝐹𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑒 ∙ 𝑃𝑂𝑆𝑇 + 𝜓 ∙ 𝑃𝑂𝑆𝑇 ∙ 𝑃𝑠1972 +

                            𝑚
                𝛾 ∙ 𝑃𝑂𝑆𝑇 ∙ 𝑃𝑠1972 ∙ 𝐹𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑒 + 𝜗𝑋𝑖𝑠𝑐 + 𝜄𝑖𝑠𝑐

The coefficient of interest is 𝛾, which captures any differential relationship between male

sports participation in 1972 and changes in the spatial content of women’s jobs, relative

to the same relationship for men in the same state. The estimates of this coefficient in

table 9 are statistically insignificant and very close to zero. A 100 percentage point

increase in male sports participation in 1972 was associated with an increase in female

spatial aptitude of 1.5 percent of a standard deviation, relative to men in the same state;

for depth perception, the effect is 2.2 percent of a standard deviation. Neither estimate is

statistically significant.

Differences across sports in spatial training

        We have shown that the overall increase in female sports participation induced by

Title IX had no effect on the spatial content of women’s jobs or on a spatial test scores of

high school seniors, and have interpreted this as suggesting that sports do not play a large

role in explaining male-female differences in spatial aptitude. A further objection to this

interpretation is that not all sports participation may be equally productive at increasing

spatial cognition. For example, the so called “ball” sports may be more significant

promoters of spatial cognition than sports like running or swimming. It is possible that



                                                                                              22
Title IX increased females’ sports participation, but not in sports that matter to spatial

skills. Alternatively, Title IX may have increased participation in sports that matter, but

our instrument misses this growth. In either case our IV estimates would be dominated

by increases in participation in sports that have little relationship to our outcomes of

interest.

        In table 7 we investigate this hypothesis. We list the pre and post Title IX levels

of female participation in the different sports in our sample. Pre Title IX participation in

almost all sports was very low; close to zero in all sports except basketball, track and

field and tennis. Total female participation in all sports was 3.3 percent.

        Post Title IX we see participation growth in many sports. Basketball and track and

field stand out, but so do volleyball and to a lesser extent baseball and tennis. In 1978

total female participation in these sports is 28.8 percent.

        The relationship between the increase in female participation in these specific

sports and our instrument is explored in table 8. Here we present the “first stage”

relationship between females’ participation in specific sports and males’ pre Title IX

sports participation in 1972. With a few exceptions our instrument picks up the increases

in participation seen in table 7. For example, the largest estimates are for basketball and

track and field. What our instrument “misses” is the increase in females’ participation in

baseball. 24

24
  To try to exploit any increase in baseball due to Title IX we might use male sport-
specific participation as an instrument for female participation in the same sport (e.g.,
predict female baseball participation with pre Title IX male baseball participation.) While
Title IX does not mandate increases in female participation in specific sports, pre Title IX
male participation in specific sports may capture “existing capacity” and thus the least
cost path to Title IX compliance in a given state. The increase in female baseball
participation predicted by pre Title IX male baseball participation has no effect on either
spatial aptitude or depth perception of females’ occupational employment (results


                                                                                             23
        We are not aware of any generally accepted ranking of sports by their potential to

develop spatial aptitude. Research on spatial activities provides some guidance.

Newcombe et al. (1983) developed a “spatial activity questionnaire” by asking

undergraduates to rank 231 common activities for both the spatial ability they required

and whether they were traditionally masculine, feminine or neutral activities. All of the

sports we consider, with the exceptions of swimming and cross country, were part of a

list of 81 spatial activities as designated by at least 75% of the judges. 25

        Ozel et al. (2004) investigate the relationship between sport and mental rotation

tasks, distinguishing between open skill (e.g., basketball, badminton, soccer, judo) and

closed skill (swimming, track and field, archery, body building and gymnastics) sports.

They hypothesize that practitioners of open skill sports will be quicker in the cognitive

processing of the task response. While the open skill group do exhibit faster response,

the difference from the closed skill group is not statistically significant. Moreau et al.

(2012) investigate the impact of the practice of wrestling and running on performance in

mental rotation tasks. They hypothesize that a sport that involves the mental

manipulation of objects in three dimensional space (wrestling) would have a greater

impact of this dimension of spatial ability than one that does not (running). Using

random assignment of university level students to the two sports, the authors found

greater improvement in mental rotation test scores among the students practising

wrestling, although the runners also showed improvement.

        ESPN has produced a ranking of 60 different sports along ten different


available upon request).
25
   Only certain track and field activities are included in the list. One notable feature of
the development of this questionnaire was the systematic attempt to enumerate the
universe of activities practiced by high school and college students.


                                                                                              24
dimensions: endurance, strength, power, speed, agility, flexibility, nerve, durability,

hand-eye coordination and analytic. The ratings are the average score out of 10 given to

each sport by a panel of eight experts, which included two members of the United States

Olympic committee, two professors of kinesiology, a professional athlete and three sports

journalists. While spatial aptitude is not ranked explicitly, we focus on the analytic

aptitude, “The ability to evaluate and react appropriately to strategic situations. Example:

Joe Montana reading a defense; basketball point guard on a fast break”. 26 This

description suggests an ability to read fluid three dimensional environments, which

involves elements of spatiotemporal skills and coincidence anticipation timing. There is

also an element of reactive speed, but that skill is explicitly evaluated in another the

dimension, hand—eye coordination. Sports such as hockey, soccer and basketball rank

highest in analytic aptitude, followed by football, tennis, golf and volleyball. 27 Lower

ranked sports include swimming and multiple distances running. While the analytic

aptitude as defined also involves some “thinking tasks”, the examples provided suggest

these tasks are in reaction to initial spatial perception, and the ranking of sports by this

measure is in rough accord with alternative identifications of spatial sports.

          In tables 7 and 8, we see strong increases in females’ participation in basketball

and volleyball—sports that we might expect count as spatial aptitude training. Tennis

might also be included in this group. The results in table 8 indicate that together these

three sports represent 60 percent of the first stage estimate in table 4. Gymnastics and

track and field are the other two sports with “large” first stage estimates. Gymnasts have

been demonstrated to have better mental rotation abilities in certain dimensions than non

athletes (Jansen and Lehmann 2013). Gymnastics falls just below the midpoint in the

ESPN ranking of analytic aptitude and is an element of Newcombe et al.’s (1983) spatial

activity questionnaire.

        Track and field is harder to categorize because it includes very different activities.

For example, in the ESPN ranking distance running and pole vault are just below the

midpoint, while sprints and high jump are near the bottom. That said, both high jumping

and pole vaulting are elements of the spatial activity questionnaire.

        Overall, it is not obvious that the increase in female participation post Title IX, or

that part of it correlated with cross state variation in males’ participation in 1971, is

concentrated in sports that have no spatial content. In fact, at least a majority of the

increase picked up by the instrument is in sports considered to have above average spatial

demands.

        As a summary of the discussion, we use the ESPN aptitude rating for sports, along

with the sport participation rate data, to construct an average rating for this aptitude by

state, sex and year. Specifically, the average rating for the analytic aptitude a is
                 𝑎𝑔         𝑔
(5)             𝑅𝑠𝑐 = ∑𝑗 𝑃𝑠𝑐𝑗 ∙ 𝑅𝑗𝑎

where g indexes gender, s indexes states, c indexes cohort and j indexes sports. 𝑅𝑗𝑎 is the

                                 𝑔
ESPN ranking of a in sport j, 𝑃𝑠𝑐𝑗 is the state level participation rate of cohort c and

gender g in sport j. The aggregate rankings are standardized to have a mean of zero and a

standard deviation of 1.

        In the top panel of table 9, we report the first stage relationship between this

measure of the content of females’ sports participation and males’ pre Title IX sport

participation. Echoing the results in table 4 there is a strong positive relationship. A state



                                                                                              26
where the pre Title IX male’s sport participation was 10 percent higher would see a 0.3

standard deviation higher increase in the analytic content of females’ sport participation.

        The corresponding IV estimates are reported in the bottom panel of the table.

They indicate that weighting the increase in females’ sports participation in this way does

little to change the inference in table 4. The estimated relationship between the analytic

content of females’ sports participation and the spatial content of their employment is

small, negative and statistically insignificant, mirroring the results in table 4.

Title IX and the development of non-spatial skills

        Title IX induced sports participation led to an increase in the educational

attainment of women (Stevenson 2010), and so had an impact on some cognitive or non-

cognitive skills. It is possible that an improvement in these other skills could mask any

effect of Title IX on spatial aptitude, because groups of skills tend to be correlated across

jobs. For example, if the spatial demands of a job are negatively correlated with its

required educational or interpersonal skills, then as a result of Title IX women may select

into jobs with lower spatial aptitude even if their spatial abilities improved.

        To investigate whether Title IX induced sports participation affected the overall

skill profile of jobs chosen by women in this way, we first perform a principal

components analysis of a selection of job characteristics, to discover how these are

correlated with spatial skills across occupations. Stevenson (2007) notes that sports

participation is thought to enhance leadership and interpersonal skills, as well as

endurance. Also Stevenson (2010) shows the direct effect of Title IX on females’

educational attainment. Not all these aptitudes/skills are captured by the DOT data. To

measure cognitive demands we use the DOT rating “general educational development –

reasoning”, although the results are very similar if we use GED math or language. To

measure interpersonal demands, we use the DOT variable “temperament – dealing with

people.” 28 Finally for physical demands, we use the DOT physical strength rating.

       In the top panel of table 10 we report the results of our principal component

analysis of these skills plus our spatial measures across occupations. For each component

we report the weightings for each DOT skill and the associated eigenvalue. The first

component appears to capture the overall physicality of a job; it positively weights

physical strength and the spatial aptitudes, and negatively weights reasoning and people

skills. The occupations with the highest rating on this component are those related to

construction and trades; the occupations with the lowest rating are judges and lawyers.

The second component appears to reflect more abstract spatial skills, with high

weightings on reasoning and both spatial measures, and low or negative weightings on

interpersonal skills and physical strength. Occupations at the highest levels of this

component include dentists, architects and physicists. The other components are more

difficult to interpret, but are also relatively unimportant. The first two components are the

only ones with eigenvalues greater than one (generally considered the threshold at which

components are retained in this type of analysis), and together explain about 80% of the

joint variance in the five measures.

       In the bottom panel of the table we report the results from reduced form

regressions of each component (which are standardized to have mean zero and standard

deviation of one) on males pre Title IX sports participation. Most of the estimates are

small and statistically insignificant. The exception is the estimate for component 3,

 Baker and Cornelson (2016) show that it makes very little difference using alternative
measures of people skills.


                                                                                           28
which has little relationship to either measure of spatial skills. Even for this component,

males pre Title IX sports participation accounts for very little of the variance: the R^2 for

this regression is 0.003. On net, it does not appear that males’ pre Title IX sports

participation affected the general skill profile of jobs chosen by women, particularly with

respect to spatial skills. It seems unlikely, then, that changes to educational attainment,

interpersonal or physical skills are offsetting any tendency towards employment in

occupations with higher spatial requirements.

Conclusions

       Extra curricular activities are a leading environmental explanation of the

emergence of sex differences in spatial cognition at young ages. While the sex difference

in computer gaming is a working hypothesis for cohorts of workers currently entering the

labor market, it cannot be the source of this sex difference for older cohorts of workers

(e.g., table 1). However, computer gaming is just a current episode of the long history of

sex typed activities in childhood. A promising explanation from earlier years is boys’

higher rates of participation in sports and play. We exploit the effects of Title IX on

females’ sports participation, what Stevenson (2007) observes is “…arguably the largest

change to mass participation in sports history”, to test this hypothesis. As such, Title IX is

also arguably the largest change to childhood sex typed activities of recent times.

       We find no evidence that the massive increase in female high school sports

participation following the enactment of Title IX increased spatial cognition among

women as captured either by their occupational choices or direct tests of three

dimensional spatial skill. Although the skill profile of jobs chosen by women did change

over this period, the change was similar across states with very different levels of Title




                                                                                              29
IX-induced female sports participation. This suggests that high school sports participation

is not an important determinant of spatial cognition related, gender differences in

occupational choice. Our results also cast doubt on a hypothesis that sports participation

is the source of sex differences in three dimensional spatial rotation.

        It is important to note that our results do not imply that sports training does not

increase spatial cognition—there is evidence from random control trials that it does (e.g.,

Moreau et al. 2012). Among other considerations, there are likely differences between

the training received in an RCT and through a more passive participation in school sports.

Also, because spatial skills are multidimensional, it is possible that Title IX increased

spatial skills not spanned by our DOT measures or by the tests scores in the Project

Talent and HSB surveys.

        Finally, while Title IX applied to elementary and middle schools, we are not

aware of data that would allow us to evaluate its impact at this level. To the extent that

Title IX’s targets and the compliance of elementary schools at the state level echoed

targets and compliance at the high school level, our empirical strategy should capture any

impact of the resulting increase in females’ sports participation at younger ages.

However, it is possible that it is sports participation at these younger ages that is critical

for spatial cognition. Then, if Title IX compliance in elementary schools was low our

analysis does not offer a fair evaluation of the sports participation hypothesis.

Alternatively, if Title IX’s impact at the state level differed markedly in elementary and

high schools, our analysis might miss an effect of the law (and sports participation) on

spatial development. Subject to these qualifications the balance of our evidence casts

some doubt on sports participation as the source of sex differences in some spatial skills.




                                                                                                 30
       Although we are unable to make a link to Title IX, both females’ three

dimensional spatial cognition and the spatial content of their occupations increased

relative to males’ over the period of study. The Project Talent and HSB data reveal that

the sex difference in the three dimensional spatial rotation test declined by 35 percent

among high school seniors between 1960 and 1980. 29 The gender difference in the DOT

measures declined by 22.3 percent for spatial aptitude and 11.0 percent for depth

perception between our 1980 and 2000 cohorts. 30 Spatial cognition has been relatively

understudied by economists, but is increasingly acknowledged as both a correlate of the

gender segregation of employment and a key to entry to jobs in the STEM sector. An

explanation of recent changes in the spatial skills of males and females remains an

important topic for future research.




29
   In 1960 the male/female difference in the test of three dimensional spatial ability was a
statistically significant 0.388 of a standard deviation, while in 1980 it was a statistically
significant 0.253.
30
   In 1980, the male-female difference in occupational spatial aptitude was a statistically
significant 0.730 standard deviations; by 2000, it was 0.567 standard deviations. The
differences for depth perception were a statistically significant 0.857 standard deviations
in 1980, and 0.764 standard deviations in 2000.

Appendix

        The NFHS data contain information on 47 sports for the years 1971 and 1978

(counting close variants of the same sport, such as fast and slow softball, as a single

sport.) Our measure of total sports participation for both boys and girls is the sum of

participation across all of these sports.

        Table A1 shows the number of states with positive participation in each of the

sports listed in the NFHS (with indications for sports that are combinations of different

variants.) The sports that are individually identified in parts of the analysis are shown in

bold font.

Notes: This table shows the female sports participation rate by sport and year. Participation rates are calculated
using data on sports participation by gender, provided by the National Federation of High Schools. The participation
rates are calculated by dividing the number of participants in each sport by estimated high school enrolment by
gender for each year, based on NCES data. (The NCES does not provide enrolment by gender; we assume a 50%
gender split.) The set of sports shown are those that had non-zero male enrolment in 1972, and non-zero female
enrolment in 1978.

Notes: Principal component analysis - the results in this panel are from a principal components analysis of five DOT
job attributes: spatial aptitude, depth perception, GED – reasoning, temperament – dealing with people, and physical
strength. Each attribute is normalized to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1 (across occupations) prior
to the analysis. The coefficients in this panel represent the weightings on each variable in constructing the
components. Positive weightings indicate that the component is positively correlated with the indicated skill, with
larger values indicating a stronger relationship. Reduced form - the estimates in this panel are derived from
regressions of the indicated principal component (weightings shown in Table 12) on “post” (an indicator for the year
2000 sample) and “post” interacted with the male sports participation rate in a respondents’ state in 1972. The
sample is the set of women aged 25-34 who are employed in the civilian labor force, from the 1980 and 2000
Census samples. Controls include 9 indicators for age and 4 indicators for race, as well as state fixed effects. The
regression is weighted using person-level weights, and standard errors (shown in parentheses) are clustered at the
state by cohort by sex level. *, ** and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10, 5 and 1 percent levels
