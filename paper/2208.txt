          U.S. and Foreign Competition in the Developing
                Countries of the Asian Pacific Rim



                               ABSTRACT


     This paper examines changes since the early 1960s
in the export shares of the United States and its major
competitors in the markets of the developing, countries of the
Asian Pacific Rim (APR), defined to include Hong Kong, Korea,
Taiwan,   Singapore,     the      Philippines,    Malaysia,    Thailand,
Indonesia, and China.   A technique for revealing a country's
factor—price advantages or disadvantages in its trade with
another country is   also used to analyze the U.S. comparative cost
position relative    to the countries of the region.     Among the
findings are that    the U.S. export share in the APR market has
reniained roughly    constant over the period and that the United
States has a relative factor-price advantage with all the
developing countries of the region in physical capital and
skilled labor and a disadvantage in unskilled labor. For land
and natural resources, the picture is mixed.
     The competitive performance of these developing countries in
the markets of the United States, Canada, Japan, the European
Community, Australia and New Zealand, and in the region itself is
also studied, revealing the familiar result that the developing
countries of the region and Japan have increased their market
shares significantly since the 1960s.   In addition, the volume
and distribution of U.S. and Japanese direct investment in the
Asian Pacific Rim is examined.

 1. INTRODUCTION1

      The ability of the major developing countries of the Asian
 Pacific Rim (APR) - Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea (henceforth

 referred to as Korea), the Republic of China (henceforth referred
 to as Taiwan), the Philippines, Malaysia,         Singapore, Thailand,
 Indonesia, and     the People's Republic of China (henceforth
 referred to as China) -    to   compete in the markets of the United
 States is well-known and frequently cited by many domestic
industries as a matter for national concern. Much less        is known
about the competitive performance and potential of American
industries in the markets of the major developing countries of
the APR and interest in this matter is only beginning to
develop;' it will be the focus of this paper.

     The following section provides an economic overview of the
APR by comparing the main economic characteristics             of the
countries in the region and those of the region as a whole with
other major groupings of countries.             Sincethe prospects for
exporting goods and services to the countries of the region
depend on the policies these countries follow in such matters as

assistance in preparing the paper and also to Gary Sampson of the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Geneva for

providing the export and import data on the developing countries
of the Asian Pacific Rim.           1
promoting economic growth and the opening    of domestic markets,

the third section briefly describes the economic policies pursued
by each APR country in the recent past.        This section also

analyzes the success of major trading partners in penetrating the
market for imports in each country and how successful each
country has been in exporting to major foreign markets. Finally,

the trade and development policies likely to be followed in the
future in each country is briefly discussed in section three.
     Section four analyzes the competitive performance of the
United States and its major competitors in the markets for
imports in three groups of APR countries: the advanced developing
countries (ADCs) of the region -    Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan, and
Singapore; the resource-rich countries (RRCs) of the region -   the
Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia; and China. It
also examines changes since the early 1960s in the shares of the

import markets in these APR country groups captured by the United

States, Canada, Japan, the European Community, Australia and New
Zealand, and other countries within the region, together with
changes in the commodity composition of exports to the APR groups
from these countries and country-groups.        A technique for
revealing the sources of a countrys comparative advantage is
used to determine the relative factor-price advantages          and

disadvantages the United States has in its        trade with the

countries of the region.
     Section five briefly looks at the performance of the three
APR country groups in exporting to the United States and other

                                2
 major foreign markets and examines changes since the early 1960s
 in the share of their exports absorbed by the United States and
 other countries and shifts in the commodity composition of their
 exports.

      Because trade and investment are       closely linked, it is
 necessary to take foreign investment into account in evaluating
 U.S. competitive prospects in the region. Section six examines
 the volume and country distribution of   direct foreign investment
 in the region by the United States and its main competitor in the

 area, Japan. Changes in the relative importance of U.S. direct
 investment in different sectors in the APR countries are also
 studied. The final section summarizes the main conclusions of
 the paper.



2. AN OVERVIEW OF ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND PERFORMANCE

  2.1 The Developing Countries of APR Compared to Other gions
     The tremendous market potential in the developing countries
of the Asian Pacific Rim lies simply in their being not only the
most populous but the fastest growing region of the world. The
population of the nine countries totals 1.33      billion, whereas
that of the next most populous region, South Asia, amounts to .87
billion.   Gross national product (GNP)   per capita in the nine
countries grew at a remarkable average rate of 5.75% between 1965
and 1984. In contrast, GNP per capita in the industrial market-

economy countries increased at an average rate of only 2.5%
during this period and at average rates of    1.9% in both South

                               3
Asia and the countries of South America (World Development Report

1986, Annex Table 1).
     Table 1 compares the APR countries with a selected group of
countries outside of the area in terms of basic            economic

characteristics and performance indicators.         Except for the

Philippines, per capita income grew much more rapidly in the
developing countries of the Asian Pacific Rim       than in mature

developed countries such as the United States and West Germany
and, in most cases, even Japan, the newest         and most dynamic

developed country.      Yet, though per capita income levels in the
APR countries rank among the highest for all developing nations,
there is still a wide per capita income gap between the advanced
industrial market economies and these countries.     West Germany's

1984 per capita income, for example, is more than five times as
large as South Korea's and almost seventeen times as large as the

Philippines' per capita income in that year.
     The magnitude of the APRs output and imports is also small
when compared to that of the developed countries.     The total of

all nine countries' gross domestic product in 1984 was $656
billion, only slightly more than one-half of Japan's and not much

greater than West Germany's GDP.       The difference in imports is

less striking due to the high degree of dependence on trade of
most countries in the region. Their total 1984 imports of $181
billion are roughly equal to those of Japan and of West Germany

in that year.        Thus, the major market opportunities for the
United States are still in other developed countries; the major

                                   4
developing countries of Southeast Asia and East Asia represent an
important potential market rather than a major current one.
     Compared with     other developing     regions, however, the
developing countries of the Asian Pacific Rim already rank as the
largest market. The 1984 $656 billion GDP level of the region
compares with GDP levels of $623 billion for all of South
America, Central America, and the Caribbean and of $406 billion
for South Asia, for example.        Moreover, the 1984 $181 billion
import level of the region compares with only $64 billion for
South America, Central America, and the Caribbean and $25 billion
for South Asia.   This market-size advantage is likely to widen
during the rest of the century, given the currently higher growth
rates in the Pacific Rim countries.

     Table 2 shows the growth and trade experience of the APR and
selected other countries before and after the first oil crisis.
The general slowdown in growth in both the developing and
developed countries after the first oil shock is evident from the
table. It should be noted, however, that the relative decline in
growth rates has been less in the APR countries than in such
developed countries as the United States, Japan, and Germany. In
the United States, the percentage decline in the average annual
growth rate of GDP between 1965-73 and 1973-84 was 28%; in Japan,

56%; and in Germany, 57%.     The average annual GDP growth rate
actually increased in Hong Kong and Malaysia (also India) and
declined by only 18% on the average in the other seven developing
countries in the Asian Pacific Rim.


                                5
 2.2 Diversity among the APR Countries
    As shown in Table 1, there         are significant economic
differences among the developing countries of the Asian Pacific
Rim. It is usual to divide the countries into three groups, the
first comprising South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore;
the second consisting of the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, and
Indonesia; and the third being China. The first group is usually
designated the "newly industrializing countries" (NICs) of Asia,
a term indicating their relatively early emphasis on export-
oriented industrialization. While the words, "newly industrial-
izing," were appropriate in the ].960s and early 1970s when they

first adopted policies aimed at significantly increasing the
exports of manufactures, it seems more appropriate to use Hong
and Kraus&s (1981) term, "advanced developing countries" (ADCs),
especially since other countries of the region later also adopted

policies aimed at export-oriented industrialization.   Per capita

income in all of the ADCs is higher than in the countries of the
other two groups, though if per capita income alone is the basis
of the classification, it would seem reasonable to include
Malaysia in the first group.     There is also a significant gap
between income levels in Singapore and Hong Kong and in Taiwan
and South Korea.
     The second group of four nations is usually described as the
resource-rich countries (RRCs) to indicate the much greater share

of primary products in their exports compared to the ADCs (see

Table 3)2          The   greater share of production devoted to

                                 6
 agriculture is an indication of their    greater land resources as
 well as their lower per capita income         levels. Except for
 Malaysia, the RRCs are less open than the ADCs of    Asia in terms
 of trade's share of GDP, and these countries have pursued import-

 substitution policies more vigorously than    the ADC.    Another
 difference is the higher natural rate of population growth in the
 RRCs than in the ADCs.3

      China is unique in several respects. It is by far the most

 populous country in the world and it ranks third in area. Though
 it has become much more    outward-looking in recent years it
 remains, as the export and import shares presented in Table 1
 indicate, a very closed economy compared to other countries in
the region, although not in comparison to such countries as India
and the United States. While its GDP       growth rate since 1965
compares favorably with the RRCs', China's low per capita income
level makes the country more similar to the countries of South
Asia than to those of the Asian Pacific Rim.


  2.3 Savings Investment, Foreign Debt, and Trade 4justment
     A necessary, though not       sufficient, requirement for a
country to raise its growth rate is to increase its investment
and savings rates significantly.     As Table 4 shows, such an
increase has occurred in the ADCs, the RRCs and China.    In five
of the nine countries, investment as a share of GDP rose by more

than ten percentage points between 1960    and 1984, and in three
others the increase was at least five percentage points. The
1984 investment ratio in Singapore was an incredible 47 percent,

                               7
and it was 30 percent or more in Taiwan, Malaysia, and China.
The increase in domestic savings has been even more impressive,
especially in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and
Indonesia. The rate of gross domestic savings is now about 30
percent or more in six of the nine countries. The only developed
countries that can match these savings rates are Japan (31
percent) and Norway (35 percent).
    An excess of domestic investment over domestic savings
indicates that savings by foreigners are financing part of a
country's investment activities. Such was the case for the ADCs
in the initial phases of their take-off to high rates of growth,
as the figures in Table 4 on the resource gap indicate.      The

large positive number for Hong Kong in 1984 indicates that
domestic savers were investing some of their savings abroad,
probably because of their uncertainty about the political future

of the colony.
     A more direct indication of the extent to which a country
has relied on external sources of finance is the magnitude of its
external debt and the ratio of the external debt to the country's
GNP. The debt-service share of exports of goods and services is
a rough indicator of the degree of difficulty the country has in

meeting its external obligations.   Table 5 presents information
on these various debt indicators for the APR countries, except
for China, on which debt data are unavailable.          As with
developing countries generally, the data show a very rapid
increase in external borrowing for APR countries over the last 15

                                8
 years.     This ability to draw upon external sources, especially
 private capital markets, has been an important factor in enabling
 growth to continue at high rates. It has, however, also led to
 serious debt-servicing problems for some nations that borrowed
heavily and then around 1980 were suddenly faced both with much
higher real interest rates and falling prices for their export
products.      Four APR countries -    South Korea, Thailand, the
Philippines, and Indonesia - are on most lists of countries faced

with significant debt-servicing problems; debt-servicing charges
in 1984 claimed more than 15% of the foreign exchange they earned

from exporting goods and services. The drain of debt-servicing
on the foreign exchange earnings of Singapore and Hong Kong is
negligible and only about 5% for Taiwan and Malaysia.
     Obviously, in order to cope with increased debt-servicing
charges, a country must generate additional foreign exchange by
improving its balance of trade.      Table 6 shows that the trade
balance of the four main indebted countries, South Korea,
Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia improved between 1983
and 1985. Korea, whose balance of trade has improved steadily
since 1981, achieved the most desirable type of trade adjustment
between these years -     an   expansion of imports and exports.
Thailands improved trade balance between 1983 and 1985 came
about through an expansion of exports and contraction of imports.
The recent trade adjustment in both the Philippines and Indonesia
was achieved by reducing both exports and imports.

3. DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND TRADE PERFORMANCE
     As with most developing countries in the world, the major
economic goal of those in the ksian Pacific Rim over the last 40
years has been to increase the rate of economic development.
Their success in achieving this goal and the extent to which
their development policies involve a willingness to open their
own markets to the products of other countries largely determine
the trading opportunities of the United States and others in the

region.    This section briefly describes the nature of the
development strategies pursued by the individual APR countries
and analyzes the shifts that have taken place in the commodity
composition and geographical distribution of their exports and

imports.   It also speculates as to each country's likely future

trade and development policies.


  3.1 The Advanced Developing Countries

    3.1.1 Hong Kong
     3.1.1.1 Trade and Development Policy
     The British colony of Hong Kong is unique among developing
economies in that it has achieved its remarkable post-World War
II growth under a policy of "positive nonintervention."   Imports
and exports of both goods and capital have been completely free
from government taxes, subsidies, or other controls, and no
effort has been made to direct investment into particular
sectors. The standard tax rate on earnings and profits is the
lowest of any industrial state, being set at the level of 12.5%

                                  10
 from 1951-1966.

         Until the early 1950s, Hong Kong's    prosperity was based on
 re-exporting products from South China throughout the world and
 serving as an entry port for foreign products         destined for the
 mainland.   Two external events in the 1950s disrupted this
 entrepôt role. The first was the change of government as the
 Communists took control of the mainland.         Their inward-looking
 policies resulted in a significant diminution in Chinas trade
 with Hong Kong.       Dissatisfaction with the new government led to
 massive emigration from China to Hong Kong that increased the

colony's population by almost 50% in a few years. The second
event that reduced Hong KOng's role as a trade facilitator was
the United Nations embargo imposed on China because of its role
in the Korean War.

     Fortunately, the Chinese immigrants included entrepreneurs
who had both industrial experience,
                                    especially in textiles, and
the capital necessary to establish manufacturing activities.
Utilizing the abundant supply of low-wage workers that also
became     available    through                    these
                                  immigration;             individuals
spearheaded the shift in Hong Kongs economic structure front that
of entrepôt to exporter of labor-intensive manufactured products.

The industrialization effort was also helped by the existence of
an excellent infrastructure of port,          banking, insurance, and
shipping facilities, and a long history of commercial ties with
overseas traders. Manufacturing employment increased from 82,000
in 1950 to 216,000 in 1960, while the share of re-exports in

                                  11
total exports declined from 88% to 27% in that decade.

    3.1.1.2 Trade Performance
    As can be seen from Table 7, which indicates the colony's
pattern of exports and imports in 1960, 1978 and 1983, Hong Kong
has gradually diversified its manufacturing    activities and, in

particular, reduced its dependence on textiles and clothing.
Exports in the machinery and transport equipment category have
become significant.   The diversification has been due in part to

the efforts of the government, which, beginning in       the late

1970s, backed away somewhat from its hands-off policy and began

to arrange industrial support facilities and    technical services

to facilitate the shift toward more capital-intensive, high-skill

manufacturing sectors.
     A more detailed breakdown of the composition of Hong Kongs
trade with its major trading partners is presented in Table 8.
Between 1963 and 1980 both the United States and Japan moderately
increased their share of the combined exports to Hong Kong by the

United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, the
European Community, other ADCs       the RRCs in the region, and

China.   The U.S. share increased from 16% to 18%. The countries
that increased their export share the most, however, were the
other ADCs, i.e., Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore; their share rose
from 8% to 16% between these years despite the exclusion from the
figures of exports from Taiwan to Hong Kong in 1980 (and 1984).
The European Community and the four resource-rich countries -   the
Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia, were the losers

                                12
 in. terms of export shares between 1963 and 1980.

      The major change between 1980 and 1984 was the emergence of
 China as a major supplier to the Hong Kong market.           In 1984
 almost 30% of exports to Hong Kong came from China. Of course,
much of this reflects the re-emergence of entrepôt trade for Hong

Kong as China became more open. The U.S. market share declined
 about a third between 1980 and 1984 (from 18% to        12%), due no
doubt in part to the appreciation of the dollar relative to other

major currencies after 1980. Japan's share also declined between
these years but less in relative terms than the U.S. share.
     Table 8 also shows the country/region distribution of Hong
Kong's own exports between 1963 and 1984.       The share of exports
to the United States increased from 35% in 1963 to 50% in 1970
and then declined to 41% by the end of the 1970s, a decade in
which the dollar depreciated.        As the dollar appreciated in the
early 1980s, the share of Hong Kong's exports absorbed by the
United States again rose to 50%.            Remarkably, the share of
exports absorbed by Japan remained at about 4% over the entire
period.   The trend in the EC share was downward over the period
with an especially sharp fall evident after 1980.

     The main factor in Hong Kong's long-term economic outlook is
the coming return of sovereignty to China in 1997. The agreement
reached in 1984 between Great Britain and China called for the
maintenance of Hong Kong's market-oriented economy for at least
50 years after 1997, but, despite this provision, there is
understandably a great deal of uncertainty about the future.

                                13
   3.1.2 Singapore
     3.1.2.1 Trade and Development Policies5
     The economy of Singapore, like that of Hong Kong, was for

many years based on entrepôt trade, specifically, the processing,

repackaging, and     re-exporting of   the primary products of
Southeast Asia to other areas and the re-exporting of imported

industrial goods     to other parts of Asia.       Following the
attainment of self-government in 1959, the Singapore.governnient
adopted an industrialization strategy that has passed through
three stages: an import-substitution phase from 1960 to 1966; a
labor-intensive, export-oriented phase from 1966 to 1970; and
since 1970, a higher-technology, skill-intensive phase that is
also export-oriented (Yue, 1980).
     The first phase, in which tariffs and quotas were used to
stimulate domestic manufacturing, was closely tied        to the
prospect of a Malaysian common market, including the former
Malaya, Singapore, and the Borneo states of Sabah and Sarawak.
Government officials thought that this market would be of
sufficient size for Singapore to become an efficient supplier of

manufactured products, given temporary protection.        But the

political union of the four states lasted only from 1963 to 1965,
and with Singapor&s withdrawal from the federation, the proposal

for a Malaysian common market collapsed.
     Although import protection was increased to        ease the
domestic adjustments related to the country's withdrawal from the
                               14
 federation, the development strategy shifted around 1966 to one
 of attracting foreign investment to expand exports of labor-
 intensive manufactures. In addition to establishing new tax
 incentives       to   attract       foreign     investors, the government
introduced restrictive           labor legislation        to restrain wage
increases and maintain stable labor relations, restructured the
educational system to provide more technical                    workers, and
provided      a    wide      range    of   facilities      and services to
industrialists.        The     outcome     was     a    rapid   decrease in
unemployment, an increase in the share of domestic exports in
total exports from 25% in 1965 to 38% in 1970, and a marked
acceleration of the growth rate.

     As the upward pressure on wages increased due to the success
of these measures, Singapore shifted to a new development
strategy in the early 1970s, emphasizing exports of skill-
intensive, higher-technology products.             To stimulate the export
of these products, the government provided equity and loan
assistance to firms producing them, expanded training facilities
and gave financial support to private-sector training activities,
allocated funds for financing export bills below the prime rate,
subsidized the insurance of export activities, and undertook
extensive export-promotion programs.             Beginning in 1969, most
tariffs and quotas were reduced or abolished to enable exporting
firms to obtain needed inputs at competitive world prices, and by
the mid-1970s, Singapores level of protection was very low.
    The extent         to which Singapore has relied on foreign

                                      15
investment to increase its exports of manufactured goods is
indicated by the fact that, in 1980, export sales by wholly
foreign-owned firms constituted 72% of the economy's         total

exports of manufactured goods, export sales by joint ventures
21%, and export sales by wholly locally-owned     firms only 7%.

Another notable feature of the country's development policy is
the high rate of domestic savings, achieved by compulsory
retirement contributions by employers and employees. By 1978 the
contribution rate reached 38.5% of wages and salaries          and

contributed 22% of total national savings. The government has
used these funds to provide an infrastructure that is conducive

to development.
     3.1.2.2 Trade Performance
     Unlike Hong Kong, Singapore never relied on textiles and

clothing as an important export product, as Table 9 shows.     Its

industrialization via the export route has been based mainly on
oil refining and, to an increasing extent, on skill—intensive
machinery and other manufactures.       Industrialization has also

expanded the market within Singapore for high- skill, high—
technology products, as the changes in the country's import
pattern indicate.
     The United States has done very well in the Singapore market
(Table 10), increasing its export share from 7% in 1963 to 21% in
1984 -   a   performance that outdid the Japanese export share
increase.    The other ADCs also gained in market share, while the

EC and, especially, the RRCs lost in relative terms.         On the


                                 16
export side, the figures show that the shares of Singapores
exports taken by both the United States and Japan rose between
1963 and 1984, the U.S. from 13% to 27% and Japan from 8% to 12%.
As would be expected from exchange rate developments, the
increase in the share of exports going to the United States was
especially large between 1980 and 1984. Shipments to other ADCs
also increased in relative terms over the 21-year period. In
contrast, the share of Singapore's exports received by the EC
fell from 29% to 12% from 1963 to 1984.

     There is no alternative for Singapore, if it is to continue
to raise its living standard, but to remain an open, export-
oriented economy.   At the same time, one can expect to see a
continued shift in the composition of its exports toward higher
labor-skill products, while importing high-technology goods as
well as products where scale economies are important.


  3.1.3 Korea.

     3.1.3.1 Trade and Development Policies6

     From 1945 to 1960 Korea followed an import-substitution
development policy, using high protective tariffs, quantitative
import restrictions, and a multiple exchange-rate system with a
generally overvalued currency to stimulate domestic production
for local markets. While growth was fairly impressive during the
1950s, it was largely induced by substantial U.S. aid following
the Korean War; 74% of Korean investment was financed by foreign
aid between 1953 and 1960. The growth rate began to decline in

                              17
the late 1950s as the easy import-substitution opportunities were
exploited and U.S. economic aid was reduced. The degree of
inwardness of the economy at that time is indicated by the fact
that exports of goods and services were only 3% of GDP in 1960;

by 1980 they had climbed to 36%.
    A significant shift in Korean development policy toward an
outward-looking strategy occurred after the student revolution in
1960 and the military coup in 1961. The won was devalued and a
unitary exchange-rate system established, the interest rate was

permitted to      rise to   encourage domestic       savings, and a
stabilization program was implemented.            A nunber of export
incentives were introduced, including exemption from tariffs on

imported inputs     and capital        equipment for use in export
production, accelerated depreciation         on    capital facilities
employed in export production, and a lowering of direct taxes on

income earned from exporting.          Exporters also had access to
credit below the market-rate of interest, received preferential
electricity and transportation rates, and were granted generous

wastage allowances on imported inputs.
     In the late 1970s another change in development policy
occurred as the government, fearing that Korea was losing its
competitive advantage in labor-intensive manufactures due to
rising real wages, began to encourage the production of capital-
intensive intermediate products. This policy shift was reversed
in the early 1980s and priority again given to export expansion
as the major engine of growth.

                                  18
       The rate of growth that followed the shift in development
  strategy toward export promotion can only be described as
 phenomenal. Per capita incomes rose at an average annual rate of
 7% between 1960 and 1980.     During the export—led industrial
 transformation, the share of manufactures in         total exports
 increased from 14% in 1960 to         91% in 1983 (Table 11), and
 domestic savings as a fraction of GDP rose from 1% to 30% between
 1960 and 1984 (Table 4).

      A feature of Korean policy of considerable concern to the
 United States and other industrial countries with which Korea has

 a large export surplus is the continuing high level of protection
 in both the agricultural and industrial sectors that makes it
difficult for foreign suppliers to sell in the Korean market.
      3.1.3.2 Trade Performance

      As Table 12 indicates, the United     States' export share in
the Korean import market, after falling sharply from 49% to 31%
between 1963 and 1970, increased slightly to 34% between 1970 and

1980 and then remained constant thereafter.      Japan was the main
gainer at U.S. expense between 1963 and 1970 with its share
rising from 35% to 49%, but this share had fallen back to about
41% by 1984.   Australia and New Zealand, Canada, and the RRCs
have all gained steadily in market share throughout the 21-year
period -

     The distribution of Korean exports exhibits
                                                 considerable
volatility.     Exports to    the United States, for example,
constituted 50% of all exports to the regions listed in the first

                                  19
column in 1970, rising from 32% in 1963, then dropping to 35% in
1980, only to rise again to 46% during the period of dollar
appreciation in the early 1980s.     The share of exports sent to

Japan shows a steady decline over the entire period.     Exports to

the European Community display an upward trend.
    Because the country's poor endowment of natural resources
and comparatively small size leave no   alternative for achieving

continued rapid growth but to retain the emphasis on exporting
manufactured goods, Korea is likely to remain an outward-looking

economy. Like Singapore, it can be expected to move into higher-
skill, more capital-intensive export production, however. At the
same time, with some prodding it    should become a better market

for high-technology goods and agricultural products.
     The Republic of Korea's relations with North Korea are of
major concern to the United States.     Because of the perceived

threat of aggression from the north, the United States still
maintains military forces in South Korea and has a treaty
commitment to the country's security. The U.S. government favors
gradual reunification between North     and South Korea but there

seems little prospect for that in the    short term.       Yet, the

prospect for reasonably      peaceful relations between the two

countries in the short term seems favorable.



  3.1.4 Taiwan
     3.1.4.1 Trade and Development Policies7
     There was great political and economic turmoil in    Taiwan in


                               20
 the period immediately after World War II. The end of fifty
 years of Japanese rule and thus the loss of the country's
 traditional export market was followed by the Communists' take-
over of mainland China, the immigration of large numbers of
Nationalists from the mainland and their assumption of power in
Taiwan, and the loss of another important market in China.

     The government's first response to the economic problems it
faced was to undertake a land reform program in the agricultural

sector and an import-substitution policy with high levels of
protection     for   the   manufacturing 'sector;     The Country's
adjustment efforts were assisted by a substantial inf low of
foreign aid, mainly from the United States.         Between 1951 and
1959, 37% of total investment was financed by foreign aid.
     Beginning in the late 1950s and into the early 1960s, the
government 'introduced policies that changed Taiwan's development
strategy from one of import substitution to one that emphasized
the export     of labor-intensive manufactures.       The multiple
exchange'-rate system was abolished and the overvaluation of the
country's currency corrected by a series of devaluations. Import
controls were eased and tariffs reduced on many manufactured
goods.      (As in Korea, the Taiwanese government still highly
protects some domestic industries with import controls and
tariffs.)     Investment by foreigners and local residents was
encouraged by such measures as a five-year income tax holiday for

certain new industrial establishments, a sharp reduction in the
maximum business income tax, and tax exemption for undistributed

                                21
profits retained for investment purposes. Exporting was also
encouraged directly by rebating customs duties on imported
inputs, permitting the deduction from taxable income of an amount

equal to 2% of annual export earnings, and allowing a 10% tax
deduction for manufacturing, mining, and handicraft firms that
exported more than 50% of their output.        In addition, some
industries received direct export subsidies that were financed by

levies on domestic sales.       Low-interest loans and government
assistance in the form of marketing, managerial, and technical
services were also available for exporting activities. Beginning
in the mid-1960s, the government also established duty-and tax-
free export-processing zones.
    3.1.4.2 Trade Performance
    As in the Korean case, the post-World War II development
policies of Taiwan transformed the country from an agricultural
to an industrial economy within a comparatively short period. In
the period 1952-54, industrial exports made up only 9% of total
exports, but in 1970 the share of industrial exports in total
exports was up to a level of 78% and by 1982, to 88%.
    As    Table   13   shows, changes in the country/regional
distribution of Taiwan's imports between 1963 and 1984 are
similar to those of Korea. The U.S. share of imports into Taiwan
declined sharply from 43% to 26% between 1963 and 1970, then
increased to 33% in 1980 and remained constant thereafter. As in
the Korean case, Japan's export share rose considerably between
the first two years (from 35% to 52%), then declined to 40% by

                                22
 1980 and remained there over the next four      years.     The EC's
 export share also rose over the entire period. In contrast to
 the Korean case, however, the export share of the        other ADCs
 rose, while that of the RRCs fell.

      Since the UNCTAD Trade Data tape does not contain exports
 from Taiwan for 1980 and 1984, the country/region composition of

 Taiwanese exports is only given for 1963 and 1970. These years
 do show the marked shift in the direction of Taiwanese exports
 toward the United States. From accounting for only 20% of these
 exports in 1963, the U.S. share had increased to 44% by 1970.
The CommUnity's share rose slightly, but the most significant
other shift between these years was the fall in Japan's share
from 38% to 17%.

     Like Korea and Singapore, to achieve continued rapid growth,
Taiwan has no alternative but to concentrate         on exporting
manufactured goods, but it can be expected to shift toward
higher-skill_requiring, more capital-intensive products.      As it
is pressured to liberalize its own trade barriers, Taiwan should
improve as a market        for high-technology   manufactures and
agricultural products.

     There is, of course, considerable uncertainty about the
political future of Taiwan. In proposing unification, China has
offered to make Taiwan a special administrative region, following

the Hong Kong approach, and allow it to maintain its economic and
social system.     Thus far, however, no visible progress has been
made toward reunification, despite TaiWan's increasing political

                                23
isolation in the world.      The official position of the U.S.

government seems to be that a gradual and natural process of
unification is best and that other countries should not intervene

in this process.


  3.2 The_Resource-Rich Countries
    3.2.1 The Philippines
     3.2.1.1 Trade             nc2&e
     The development policy of the Philippines since the late
1940s   can be characterized as initially one of import
substitution, then a series of modest and short-lived efforts to

liberalize   the  trade and exchange-rate regimes.       Exchange
controls were first introduced in late 1949 as a consequence of a
balance-of-payments crisis caused immediately by the election-
related easy creçlit and liberal spndirtg poiicies of the
government   and   more basically by the countrys overvalued
currency and pent-up demand for consumption goods.   Rather than

lifting the controls after the crisis passed, the government used
them during the 1950s to promote the development of domestic
manufacturing activities.     As often happened in developing
countries that follow this strategy, growth rates initially were
quite high, but by the late 1950s, as the    easy stage of import
substitution   had passed,    they   had   fallen significantly.
     Devaluation, the elimination of most exchange controls, and
the establishment of a unified exchange-rate system occurred in
the early 1960s, but these changes were in response to charges of

                               24
maladministration of the controls and pressures from traditional
exporters rather than to a conscious decision to promote exports
of manufactures. High tariffs still protected the manufacturing
sector, although its growth rate fell even further in the early
1960s. An effort in the late 1960s to stimulate growth through
credit and fiscal expansion led to a new balance-of-payments
crisis and the re-introduction of exchange controls.

     The 1970s began with the floating of the peso and the
passage of legislation aimed directly at stimulating exports of
non-traditional agricultural and manufactured goods.         Firms
exporting more than 50% of their output were exempt from sales or
customs taxes on materials used in         export production and
permitted to deduct part of their export revenue from taxable
income.     The government also constructed the first export-
processing zone. -    Partly   in response to these measures but
probably due more importantly to the 50% decline in real wage
costs in manufacturing between 1969 and 1974, there was sustained

growth in manufacturing exports until 1981 (Alburo and Shepherd,
1986).    The share of manufacturing exports in total exports rose
from 12% in 1970 to 44% in 1980.

     Further liberalization efforts were undertaken in the early
1980s, the most important of which was the reduction of tariffs
under a new, more rational system of import protection, but the
exchange crisis of 1983, related to the countrys external debt
problems, prevented the full implementation of the measures as
exchange controls were introduced once again. Since 1984 the

                                25
cutoff of foreign capital, the austerity measures the government
was forced to adopt, and the political crisis in the country have
brought about a decline in real GNP.
     3.2.1.2 Trade Performance
     The commodity distribution of the Philippines' •exports and
imports is given in Table 14. Primary product exports other than
minerals have declined significantly between 1960 and 1983 as the

share taken by manufactured goods rose from 4% to 50%.     Due to

the greater importance of fuel imports, the share of imports of
manufactured goods fell from 75% to 65% between 1960 and 1983.
     The Philippines is another case where the U.S. share of the
country's import market decreased significantly between 1963 and

1970, while Japan's share increased significantly (Table 15). The
U.S. export share rose in the 1970s and, despite the exchange
rate developments,, rose again in the 1980s.     The other major
gainers were the ADCs, whose share of the Phillippines' imports
went up from to 2% to 11% between 1963 and 1984.     In contrast,

the Japanese and EC export shares of the Philippine market fell
in both of these periods.
     The country/region distribution of Philippine exports shows
a decreasing dependence on the United States as a trading
partner. The share of the country's exports sent to the United
States declined from 47% in 1963 to 27% by 1980.     The share of

exports taken by Japan rose somewhat from 1963 to 1980; the EC
share remained about the same. The most important shift was the
increase from 3% to 11% in the relative importance of the ADCs as

                                 26
 an export market between these years. This may be related to the
 establjshnient of the Association of        Southeast Asian Nations
 (ASEAN), since Singapore, an ADC, is an ASEAN member. Export
 share of the other ASEAN members, which are RRCs, remained
 roughly the same, however.

        The economic history of the Philippines over the last forty
 years and the present political turmoil do not       give reason to
 expect the country to shift its development strategy in the
 foreseeable future and focus on becoming an outward-looking
 exporter of manufactured goods. Periodic attempts to liberalize
 can be expected, but the conflicting economic and political
pressures within the country seem likely to result in the same
pattern of on-again, off-again government controls on trade and
development that has been seen over the last forty years. Yet,
because of the richness of its human and physical resources, the

Philippines is likely to continue to grow at a respectable rate.
        U.S.   concerns   with   the   Philippines   go beyond the
historically close political and economic relationships between
the two countries. Clark Air Force Base and Subic Bay Naval Base
are the largest overseas American air and naval facilities, and

they are generally regarded as vital to a U.S. military presence
not only in the Pacific but also in the Indian Ocean and Persian
Gulf.     It would be a severe blow to U.S. military strategy if a
Philippine government forced the United States to relinquish
control over these bases. Since poor economic performance in the

Philippine economy contributes to the possibility of such an

                                 27
outcome, the United States may wish to consider establishing
closer economic ties with the Philippines, for example, by
granting the       country   more favorable treatment under the
Generalized System of Preferences or perhaps negotiating a free

trade arrangement with the country.



  3.2.2 Malaysia
     3.2.2.1 Trade and Development Policies10
     Peninsular Malaysia (the former Malaya) achieved political
independence In 1957; Sabah and Sarawak became independent and
part of Malaysia in 1963.       Fortunately, Malaysia already had a

per capita income that was considerably     above the other three

resource-rich countries.     As in most developing countries, the
Malaysian government began its industrialization endeavors with
import substitution fostered by moderate levels of protection and
generous fiscal incentives, such as were provided in the Pioneer
Industries Ordinance in 1958 and the broader Investment Incentive

Act in 1968.     In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a deliberate
effort was made to promote exports. This included permitting a
double deduction from taxable income for export expenses and a
further tax deduction based on Malaysian raw material and wage

costs.     Free-trade and export-processing zones, in which firms
can freely import materials and capital goods used in export
production, were also established in various parts of          the

country.       Furthermore, the government provided low-cost export
insurance, helped to keep shipping rates low, and engaged in the

                                 28
 promotion of Malaysian exports throughout the world.
      The country's development efforts have been successful in
 achieving an impressive degree of diversification            of both
 primary-product and manufacturing activities. For example, palm
 oil and timber production has increased to the point that these
 sectors are now as important as the rubber and tin industries as
 earners of foreign exchange.         Impressive processing activities
 have been established in the palm oil and rubber sectors. The
 oil and natural gas industries have also become major export-
 earning industries.    Textiles and apparel, electrical machinery,
 and, especially, electronics products have become important
export items as well.     As can be seen from Table 16, exports of
manufactured products increased from 6% of total exports in 1960
to 22% in 1983.

     3.2.2.2 Trade Performance

     The Malaysian import figures for 1963 seem unreliable, due
perhaps to its political union with Singapore in that year.
Subsequent data show a steady increase in the share of the
Malaysian import market captured by the United States, this share
rising from 11% in 1970 to 16% by 1984 (Table 17). Japan's share
increased significantly between these       years, from 4% to 25%,
while the ECs share decreased significantly. Import trade with
the ADCs also rose appreciably but dropped with the other RRCs.

     The country/region distribution          of   Malaysian exports
indicates that the United States gradually increased its share
between 1963 and 1980.11 Shipments to Japan, the AIDCs, and the


                                 29
other RRCs remained about the same over the time period; those to

the EC fell in relative importance.
      Malaysia has been successful in achieving an export-oriented
industrialization strategy that is based on processing its
abundant natural resources and on utilizing its abundant supply

of low-cost labor.        There would seem to be no major reasons why
this pattern will not continue, at least in the medium term.



  3.2.3 Thailand
       3.2.3.1 Trade and Development Policies12
      The modern industrialization efforts of the government of
Thailand can be said to have begun with the establishment in 1959

of the Board of Investment, set up to promote domestic investment
with the use of tax incentives, and a new, mildly protective
customs schedule was put into effect in 1960.         The government

also influenced industrial expansion by means of entry controls
and the use of preferential credit arrangements.      The net effect

was     a   development     policy    that   to some extent favored
manufacturing industries producing for the domestic market.

       With the passage of the Export Promotion Act in 1972,
greater attention was given to the promotion of manufactured

exports.     Its provisions included exemption from paying import
duties on imported materials used in production for export, the
exemption from business taxes on export-producing activities, and
a Bank of Thailand discount facility at below- market rates for
short-term export loans made by commercial banks.         Since 1972


                                     30
 exporters are also eligible for a 20% rebate on electricity
 charges incurred in export production.  The Department of
 Commerce began export—promoting activities in 1975.

        Beginning in 1974, as the sharp increase in the price of oil
 caused a deterioration in the country's balance of payments,
 there was an increase in industrial import protection. Nominal

protection on import-competing manufactured goods increased from
35% to 50% between 1974 and 1978 (World Bank, 1980). Greater
increases in business taxes on imports than on comparable
domestic products, the imposition of import surcharges on certain
products, and the increased use of import controls were other
policies favoring import-substituting activities.         The debt
crisis of the early 1980s and a sharp deterioration in Thailands
terms of trade brought about further import restrictions.
       3.2.3.2 Trade Performance

       Despite the somewhat contradictory nature of Thailand's
recent development policies, export growth has been very high in
the last decade (Table 2), with exports of textiles and apparel,
machinery and equipment, and other manufactures continuing to
make up an increasing share of the country's total exports (Table
18).

       As in a number of the other APR countries, the U.S. share of

Thailand's imports from its major trading partners decreased
between 1963 and 1970 as Japan's share increased (Table 19).    In
the Thai case, however, these share changes were not as great as
in the other cases. The pattern of a U.S. share gain and a

                                   31
Japanese loss in the 1970s, as the dollar depreciated, and the
reverse of these changes in the 1980s, as the dollar appreciated,
also took place in Thailand. The EC share in Thailand's imports
fell steadily throughout the period. The other important change
in export shares was the increase in the ADCs share from 11% in
1963 to 22% in 1984. The share of the other RRCs    in exports to

Thailand remained about the same over the period.

     The share of Thailand's exports absorbed by the United
States rose significantly from 10% to 22% between   1963 and 1984.

Shipments to the EC also increased between these years but only
from 23% to 27%. japan's share fell after 1970 from 30%    to 17%.

Interestingly, Thai exports to other RRCs and the ADC5 diminished

in relative importance over the entire period.
     The Thai government's policy of modest intervention in the
market economy seems likely to continue into the foreseeable
future and to result in high growth rates and a growing degree of
export-oriented industrial diversification.



  3.2.4 Indonesia
     3.2.4.1 Trade and Development Policies23
     Indonesia has been the least successful of the resource—rich
countries in shifting from an inward-looking policy that protects

domestic   producers   of manufactured products from foreign
competition to a strategy of promoting exports of manufactures.
The 8% share of manufactures in total exports in 1983 (Table 3)
is much lower than that for the other three RRCs.      The unusual


                               32
 richness of its resources and especially its ability to take
 advantage in export markets of the sharp oil price increase in
 the 1970s may in part be responsible for this low manufacturing
 share by reducing the balance-of-payments pressures for the
 expansion of manufactured exports.

         Four separate periods can be distinguished since Indonesia
 achieved its independence in 1949: the period of constitutional
 democracy (1950-57);     the "Guided Democracy" of 1958-1965; the
 liberalization of the "New Order" (1966-1971); and developments
up to the present after the period of liberalization (Pitt,
1985). The first period saw sporadic attempts to dismantle the
elaborate system of foreign exchange controls and import quotas
that had existed under Dutch rule. But lobbying pressures on the

government to grant preferential import privileges to the new
class of indigenous importers and to     monopolistic organizations
of domestic industrial firms formed to         import a common raw
material tended to undermine these liberalization efforts.

    The second period, 1958-1965, was marked by President
Sukarnos implementation of his concept of "guided democracy"
under which there was an aversion to free markets and foreign
capital.     The traditional Dutch trading houses were nationalized
so that by 1959 only 20% of the import trade remained in private
hands.    The government allocated all foreign exchange and, in
doing so, favored inward-oriented state enterprises.  Moreover,
the gOvernment's policy of allocating raw materials on the basis
of a firm's existing productive capacity encouraged the expansion


                                33
of capacity, though this capacity was under-utilized; in 1965
manufacturing as a whole operated at only between 20% and 30% of

capacity.
        The period 1966-71 saw sweeping liberalization in Indonesia,
beginning with a scheme to encourage exports that permitted
exporters to sell a portion of their foreign exchange earnings at
free-market prices. The government ended the direct allocation
of foreign exchange to manufacturing firms and importers were
permitted to buy almost any good they wished.         Subsidies and
preferential credit rates to state enterprises were cut sharply.
Another important change was the enactment of a law to encourage

foreign investment by exempting firms that undertook priority
investments from taxes on as much as 60% of their profits for up
to six. years. A unified exchange-rate system was established in
1970.

        In the period immediately after the liberalization phase,
the new government shifted back toward import substitution with
the increased use of quantitative import controls, including the
banning of imports of many consumer goods, an increase in
tariffs, and the introduction of numerous regulations covering
investment activities.       In 1978, however, the currency was
devalued and an export certificate scheme was introduced that
tended to subsidize exports of manufactured goods. This led to a

significant percentage increase in such exports, though starting
from a very low level. Nevertheless, the governments policies
are still biased toward capital-intensive, import-substituting

                                 34
 activities and include cumbersome regulations that discourage
exports of labor-intensive manufactures.
     3.2.4.2 Trade Performance

     Unlike in the other countries analyzed, the structure of
Indonesian production has not shifted significantly toward
export-oriented manufacturing. Only 7% of the country's exports
were manufactured goods in 1983 (Table 20), while the share of
fuels, minerals, and metals in exports rose from 33% to 80%
between 1960 and 1983.

     The country/region composition of lndonesian imports (Table
21) shows a rise in shares from both the United States and Japan
between 1963 and 1970 and a decline in the export shares of the
ADCs, the RRCs, and the EC. In the 1970s the U.S share fell and
Japan's increased, while in the 1980s their shares remained
unchanged. In contrast, the share of imports from the Community
increased in the 1980s.    Imports from the ADCs dropped sharply
from 19% to 5% between 1963 and 1970 but remained roughly
constant thereafter.

     Indonesian exports to both the United States and Japan rose
significantly in the 1970s, while exports to the EC and the ADCs
fell appreciably during this period. In the period of the l980s
covered in Table 21,      the percentage   distribution of the
destination of Indonesian exports remained roughly the same.
  As in the Philippines, there do not seem to be any strong
reasons to expect that Indonesia will change its development
strategy from that of recent years. Strong vested interests have

                                 35
been created that favor an inward-looking industrialization
strategy, and they are likely to continue to prevail in the

political   decision-making process determining development policy
into the foreseeable future.


  3.3 China
    3.3.1 Trade and Development Policies14

     Undoubtedly, the     developing country in the APR whose
policies are of greatest potential significance to the United
States and other competitors in the region is China. The
modernization reforms initiated in       the    late   1970s could
eventually transform the Chinese economy into both a major
competitor and market in the area and the world.            But the

possibility of a return to Maoist economic policies, involving
autarky and a de-emphasis       on the    acquisition of Western
technology, cannot be ruled out.
     China's current trade policies are aimed at increasing
exports in order to pay for the capital equipment, intermediate
inputs, and      advanced technology needed for industrial and
agricultural modernization. One means of stimulating exports has
been the establishment of Special Export Zones in which Western
know-how, managerial skills, and capital can be combined in joint

ventures with low-wage Chinese labor.        As Table 22 indicates,

the share of exports of manufactures in total exports equaled 57%

in 1983, with textiles and clothing being the most important
export category.    Among the country's primary product exports,

                                36
crude petroleum and petroleum products have become increasingly
important.

        Encouraged by government policy, foreign investment in China
exceeded $3.5 billion by 1985, but firms doing business in China
face many difficulties, including arbitrary tax •and tariff
charges,      inadequate    supplies   of    skilled   labor,   poor
transportation and communication facilities, and the resistance
of vested interests to the economic reforms.
    3.3.2 Trade Performance
        After U.S. trade with China opened up, the United States
quickly became an important supplier, furnishing by 1980 about a
quarter of China's imports from its major market-oriented trading

partners (Table 23). The U.S. share dropped to 18% by 1984,
perhaps reflecting the overvalued dollar. Japan's share rose
from 11% in 1963 to 43% by 1984, and the ADCs became more
important as exporters to China over the period, whereas the
shares of exports supplied by the EC and Australia and New
Zealand declined between these years.
        Chinese export figures are only available for 1984 on the
UNCTAD Data Tape. The 42% share going to Hong Kong indicates the
importance of that colony as an entrepôt for China. Japan is the
next largest recipient of Chinese goods at 27% and the United
States and the European Community each absorbed about 12% in
1984.

        It seems much too early to predict, even in the medium term,
what China's future role in the world trading and foreign

                                 37
investment system will be.
4. THE COMPETITIVE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNITED STATES AND ITS
 MAJOR COMPETITORS IN THE APR MARKET
     In      the   preceding   section    the major country/region
distribution of the imports and exports of each of the nine
developing countries in the Asian Pacific Rim was examined. As
is apparent from this analysis, no single pattern emerges as to
how well the United States has competed in the area. In three
markets - Singapore,    Malaysia, and China, the share of U.S.
exports in total exports from the Countries' major trading
partners was greater in 1984 than in 1963.        In four countries-

the Philippines, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Thailand, this export
share declined but by six percentage points or less.          In two
countries, Korea and Taiwan, the U.S. share of exports dropped by
more than ten percentage points over the period.      Interestingly,

except for Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan ship a larger proportion
of their exports to the United States than any other countries in

the group.
     In only two countries, Hong Kong and China, is there a more
than 5% decline in the U.S. export share between 1980 and 1984,
when the dollar appreciated significantly.          Indeed, the U.S.

export share rose between these years in the Philippines,
Singapore, and Malaysia.       During 1970, however, when the dollar
depreciated against the major currencies, the U.S. share of the
export market increased in Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia,
Singapore, and the Philippines.        Furthermore, in all of these

                                  38
    countries the share of exports supplied by the United States was
    higher in 1984 than in 1970.        In four countries - Thailand,
    Korea, the Philippines, and Taiwan, the U.S. competitive position
    worsened between 1963 and 1970.      (Data are not available for
    these two years for China and Malaysia.)

          Table 24 indicates the importance of developing countries of
    the APR as an export market for the United States.       (Also see
 Naya, 1986.) The shares of total U.S. exports going to the ADCs,
 the RRCs, and China all increased between 1968 and 1982, the
combined share for all three rising from 6.5% in 1968 to 13.1% in
 1982.      If one adds Japan's share of U.S. exports to these
figures, which increased between 1968 and 1982 from 8.5% to 9.9%,
the combined exports of the United States to the major developing
and developed countries of the APR constituted 15.0% of all U.S.
exports in 1968 and 23.0% in 1982.        There is no doubt that the
Asian Pacific Rim is becoming a major area of export interest to
the United States.

          Table 25 examines the success in trade of the United States
relative to its major competitors in the import markets of
developing countries of the APR, not on an individual-country
basis but in the ADCs and the RRCs as groups of countries, and in

China. The competitive record of the United States is shown to
be a mixed one.        The U.S. export share in the import market of
the ADCs in the area remained at around 20% between 1963 and 1984
-
    20%    in 1963, 18% in 1970, and 21% in both 1980 and       1984,
whereas its share of the goods exported by the major suppliers to

                                   39
the four RRCs dropped steadily from 24% in 1963 to 16% in 1984.15
In contrast, after U.S. trade with China was opened, the U.S.
share of the Chinese market rose to 27% by 1980, then declined to

18% in 1984.
     For the region as a whole, the trend in the •U.S. export
share was slightly upward, moving down from 21.6% in 1963 to
19.0% in 1970 but then rising to 23.5% in 1980 and remaining
almost unchanged at 23.2% in 1984, despite the sharp appreciation
of the dollar. The significance of this upward trend in export
performance in the APR market can be appreciated by noting that
the U.S. share in world exports declined between 1963 and 1984,
falling from 14.6% in 1963 to 13.6% in 1970 and 11.0% in 1980 and

then rising slightly to 11.2% in 1984.
     The most successful competitor in the APR market was Japan.
Its shares of total exports to the ADCs, the RRCs, and China from
the countries listed in the first column of Table 25 rose for all

three between 1963 and 1984.     By 1984 Japan was their largest
supplier, supplying 30% of the ADCs' import market, 26% of the
RRCs' import market, and 43% of China's imports from the
countries listed.   The main loser in competition for sales in
these markets was the European Community; its export shares
declined steadily in all three parts of the APR market over the

21-year period.
     An important change in the markets of developing countries
that is only beginning to be appreciated (e.g., see Ahmad, 1985)
is that the more advanced developing countries are beginning to

                               40
be important suppliers of manufactured goods to other developing
countries.       This is clearly occurring in the APR market. As
Table 25 shows, the export share of the ADCs in their own import
market increased from 8% in 1963 to 12% by 1984, while their
export share in the RRCs market rose from 1% to 10% between
these years.        The less industrially advanced RRCs did not
participate in this trend, however; their shares to the ADCs and
to other RRCs declined over the period.

        Another aspect of the growing importance of the market for
international goods in the developing countries of the APR is
that total exports to these countries by the United States,
Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the European Community, as
well as by the countries of the region to each other, amounted to

2.97% of world exports in 1963, 3.56% in 1970, 4.74% in 1980, and
5.85% in 1984.

        Changes in the commodity composition of U.S. exports to the
ADCs, the RRCs, and China between 1968 and 1982 are indicated in
the first part of Table 26.        The comparative advantage of the
United States in agricultural products and high-technology goods
is evident.      As would be expected, agricultural imports are more
important for the resource-scarce ADCs and China than for the
RRCs.     For both the ADCs and the RRCs, exports of machinery have

grown significantly in relative importance over the period, from
21% for the ADCs in 1963 to 34% in 1982 and from 30% to 49% for
the RRCs between these years. The relative decline in exports to
China of machinery between 1975 and 1982 may reflect special

                                 41
circumstances. Another commodity class that gained somewhat in

relative importance    over the period is chemicals, whereas
transportation equipment declined.
     Further insight into which        categories   of     goods the
competitors in the APR market have been successful n exporting
can be gained by utilizing Krause's (1982) breakdown of goods
into four groups: natural resource-intensive, unskilled labor-
intensive, technology-intensive, and human capital-intensive.
Table 25 divides the exports to the APR of the United States and
its competitors into these four categories.              As would be
predicted under the factor-proportion theory of international
trade, the commodity groups in which the United States has the

largest market     share   are      natural resource-intensive and
technology-intensive. In trade with the ADCs, the U.S. export
share increased modestly over the 1963-1984 period for both types
of goods. For the RRCs, the U.S. export share declined for
natural resource products -      a not-unexpected result -   and also
for technology-intensive products, though less than in the other

product categories. U.S. performance in the import market of the

APR countries declined, as expected, for labor-intensive products

and also,    rather surprisingly, for human capital-intensive
products. As Table 27 indicates, the fastest growing category of
exports to ADCs and RRC5 was, except for the 1980-84 period,
technology-intensive goods.       The United States       is in the
fortunate position of specializing in commodities for which
market demand is growing rapidly.

                                 42
      Another picture of the nature of U.S. exports, utilizing the
 U.S. Department of Conunerce (1976) breakdown of all goods into
 those that are technology-intensive and non-technology-intensive,
 is presented in Table 28. The analytical assumption behind this
 division is, of course, that temporary differences among coun-
 tries in developing and introducing new technological knowledge
are the basis for differences in the commodity composition of
trade.   Though not always explicit, the ability to create new
technology and undertake innovation depends, in turn, on there
being high levels of research and managerial•skills. The table
shows that over the 1968-1982 period the United States has
shifted the composition of its exports to every country or region

toward high-tech goods. Imports from every region have moved in
this direction, but the percentage by which technology-intensive
exports to the world by the United States exceed technology-
intensive imports was still about the same in 1982 as in 1968.

     Consistent with the factor-proportion theory, Table 25 shows
that the main U.S. competitor in the APR, Japan, gained market-
share position over the period in the ADCs, the RRCs, and China
in technology-intensive and human capital-intensive goods, while
it lost in the labor-intensive category.     The EC lost in every
category between 1963 and 1984, whereas the ADCs gained in export
shares within their own market in every category, registering an

especially impressive gain in the high-technology group.

    A technique developed by Hilton (1983) provides still
another means of revealing the comparative-cost position of the

                               43
United States vis-à-vis the countries of the Asian Pacific Rim.
It involves regressing the ratio of U.S. exports to U.S. imports

to a country by commodity on the cost shares of capital,
unskilled labor, skilled labor, land, and other natural resources
in the individual commodities. The coefficients on the various
factor shares are a measure of the differences in relative
factor-prices between the United States and the other country.
If, for example, the coefficient on a particular factor is
positive, this implies that the relative price of the factor is
lower in the United States than in the other country. A negative
sign means that the factor is relatively cheaper          in the other

country and, thus, that the other country has a comparative
advantage in producing goods in which that factor     constitutes a

relatively large proportion of production costs.      -




     The results of regressing bilateral export/import ratios for
the United States and the countries of the APR for (in most
cases) over 200 commodities on a five-fold division of factor
shares for these commodities are presented in Table 29.       For all

the countries listed, the United States has a relative factor-
price advantage in skilled labor and a disadvantage       in unskilled

labor. Furthermore, for all countries except Indonesia (and that
coefficient is not significant at the 10% level or better), the

United States    has a comparative factor-price advantage in
physical capital.     As expected, the United States            has a
comparative advantage in land—intensive and natural resource-
intensive products vis-à-vis Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Korea.         The


                               44
land coefficient has the wrong (but not significant) sign for
Singapore, while the negative sign on the natural resource
coefficient reflects Singapore exports of refined petroleum.

     The four resource-rich countries, Malaysia, Thailand, the
Philippines, and Indonesia, all have a factor-price advantage in
both land and natural resources relative to the United States.
The U.S. trade pattern with Japan reveals that the United States
has a relative factor-price advantage in natural resources, land,
and capital and a disadvantage in unskilled labor. Interestingly,

though not quite significant at the 10% level, the coefficient on
skilled labor indicates that Japan has a comparative price
advantage in this factor, too.



5. EXPORT PERFORMANCE OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OF THE APR

     Although this    paper is        primarily concerned with the
performance of the United States and its competitors in the APR
market, data has also been collected on the performance of the
developing countries of the region in the markets of the United
States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, the European
Community, and in the region itself.      Analysis of the trade of
the individual countries in section 3 revealed that every country

except the Philippines shipped a larger proportion of its exports
to the United States at the end of the period covered (usually

1984) than in the beginning (usually 1963).     In most cases, the
increase was very significant. In contrast, the share of exports
from Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Thailand to Japan

                                 45
declined over the period, while the export shares from Hong Kong
and Malaysia to Japan remained unchanged. Only the export shares
of Indonesia and Singapore to Japan rose. The share of exports
taken by the EC declined for Malaysia, Indonesia, and Hong Kong,
remained about      the same    for Singapore,   Taiwan, and the
Philippines, and increased for Korea and Thailand.
       The relative position of the APR countries as sources of
imports for the United States is given in Table 24. The
developing countries of the region supplied 6.5% of all U.S.
imports in 1968, 10.7% in 1968, and 14.7% in 1982. The share of
the ADCs in these figures rose from 53% in 1975 to 63% in 1982.
Adding Japans import share to the shares of the developing
countries brings     the figures to 19.1%, 22.7%, and 30.5%,
respectively, in the three years.
       The U.S. export share to the developing countries of the APR
rose 6.5 percentage points between 1968 and 1982, while the U.S.
import share from these countries increased 8.2 percentage
points.     The U.S. export share to Japan rose 1.2 percentage
points, and the U.S. import share from Japan rose 3.2 percentage
points in the same period.

       The most important category of imports into the United
States from the ADCs and China is textiles and apparel (Table
26).      The proportion that these goods make up of total U.S.
imports from the ADCs is declining, but textiles and apparel have
become more important in U.S. imports from China. Oil and gas
was the main import from the RRCs in the early part of the period

                                46
 covered, but by 1982 the 30% share for this category was matched
 by a 30% share for imports of electrical           and electronic
 machinery.    Electrical and electronic products are also an
 important category of imports from the ADCc.

      The change in composition of U.S. imports from        the APR
 developing countries    toward more complex products such as
 electrical and electronic machinery is also    apparent from Table
 28, which divides all imports into technology-intensive and non-

technology-intensive goods.        As this table indicates, imports
from all the countries or regions listed          are becoming more
technology-intensive.


6. DIRECT INVESTMENT IN THE APR COUNTRIES

     Achieving a market position abroad by means of direct
foreign investment., in addition to exporting goods, has become an

increasingly important element in corporate stategy over the last
25 years.     Table 31 indicates the extent to which U.S. and
Japanese companies have pursued this strategy         in the APR
countries. Although total Japanese dirct investment in the ADCs
and RRCs combined is nearly $2 billion more than U.S. investment,
American investment in the ADCs is greater than Japans, $4.2
billion versus $3.5 billion. In view of Japan's lack of natural
resources, it is to be expected that Japanese direct investment
in the RRCs is greater. Japan's investment in oil-rich Indonesia
alone amounted to 46% of its total investment in the APR. Korea
and Hong Kong were Japan's next most important direct investment

                              47
markets.      Hong Kong followed by Indonesia and the Philippines
were the most important U.S. investment markets in the area.

        Tables 32 and 33 provide additional information on U.S.
direct investment.    Table 32 indicates the share of total world

U.S. direct investment received by individual APR countries and
industries in these countries. U.S. direct investment in the APR

is a small but rapidly growing proportion of total U.S. direct
investment, its share of total U.S. direct investment rising from

3.6% in 1977 to 6.7% in 1984. The shares in each country except
the Philippines increased between these years. The most impor—
tant APR countries for U.S. direct investment in 1977 (and, as
seen in Table 31, also in 1980) were, in order of relative
importance, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and the Philippines. In 1984
the ranking was Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Philippines/Malaysia.
        U.S. investment in the region is focussed more on the
primary and service sectors than on manufacturing, which absorbed
only 3.6% of total U.S. manufacturing investment abroad in 1984,
whereas the shares were 8.7% for petroleum, 10.7% for banking,
6.4% for trade, and 4.7% for banking.        Indonesia and Malaysia

were the major countries in which U.S. petroleum investments were

made.      U.S. investment in service activities went mainly into

Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Philippines.
        Table 33 shows the industry distribution of U.S. direct
investment in each country in 1977 and 1984.            Except for
Indonesia, there has been a relative shift away from investment

i.n primary-product    sectors and toward manufacturing and/or

                                48
service activities. In Korea and Taiwan the relative importance
of U.S. manufacturing investment declined between 1977 and 1984,

perhaps reflecting their advancing industrialization.      The share
of investment    in manufacturing    increased significantly in
Malaysia and Singapore and remained about the same in Hong Kong
and the Philippines. Service activities investment increased in
relative terms in Korea, Hong Kong, and the Philippines.


7. CONCLUSIONS
     A number of conclusions can be drawn from this analysis of
the economic performance of the United States and its competitors
in the developing countries of the Asian Pacific Rim, defined to

include Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, the Philippines,
Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and China.     First, and perhaps
most important, is that the APR is a rapidly growing, though
still small, international market for goods and services and
foreign direct investment.     Exports to the countries of the
region by their major trading partners, defined as the United
States, Canada, Japan, the European Community, Australia and New
Zealand, and the APR countries themselves, amounted to 3.0% of
total world exports in 1963 and 5.8% in 1984. The area also has
become relatively more important as a market for U.S. exporters,
the share of total U.S. exports going to the APR rising from 6.5%
in 1968 to 13.1% in 1982. If Japans share of U.S. exports is
added to these figures, the share of U.S. exports taken by the
developed and developing countries of the APR moved from 15.0% in

                               49
1968 to 23.0% in 1982.
        The United States has performed quite well in competing with

the other major trading partners (defined as in the preceding
paragraph) of the APR countries. The U.S. export share of this
market rose from 21.6% in 1963 to 23.5% in 1980 and remained near

that level in 1984, despite the appreciation of the dollar
relative to the currencies of Japan, the countries of the
European Community, and other U.S. competitors in the region
after 1980. Within the region, the U.S. gained slightly in
market share in the markets of the ADCs (defined as Hong Kong,
Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore), moving from 20% in 1963 to 21% in
1984, but lost in the RRCs (defined as the Philippines, Malaysia,
Thailand, and Indonesia), falling from a 24% share in 1963 to a
16% share in 1984.       In the Chinese market the United States had

no market position in 1963, but by 1984 the U.S..share of China's

imports from its major trading partners was 18%.
        The major competitor of the United States in the region is
Japan. In 1984 japan's share of the ADCs' market was 30%, as
compared to the U.S. share of 21%, and the Japanese share of the
RRCs' market was 26% compared to the U.S. share of 16% in that

year.       Japan supplied 43% of China's imports from its major
trading partners in 1984, whereas the United States supplied only

18%.
        Japan has also been the most successful competitor over the
period in terms of gains in market shares.     In 1963, for example,

the U.S. and Japanese shares of imports into the ADCs and RRCs

                                  50
from their main trading partners were about the same, whereas, as
noted above, in 1984 Japanese market shares exceeded the U.S.
shares by about ten percentage points. The biggest loser in the
competition for market shares has been the European Community.
The ECs shares of the market for foreign goods in the ADCs and
RRCs were only slightly below those of Japan and the United
States in 1963, but they are now below the ADCs as suppliers to
the ADCs themselves and to the RRCs.         The rapid growth in the
market shares achieved by the ADCs is one of the most important
developments in the area.       It must be recognized that these
countries are beginning to supply an increasing proportion of the
market for manufactured goods in the APR.        China, too, is now
taking an appreciable part of this market.
     The various methods used to reveal the comparative-advantage

position of the United States in'the region indicate, as would be
predicted from the factor-proportion theory of international
trade, that the United States has a competitive advantage in
commodities utilizing relatively large capital and skilled labor
factor shares.     Furthermore, in the resource-scarce ADCs, the
United States has a comparative advantage in land-intensive and
other natural resource-intensive commodities. The United States
tends to be at a disadvantage in producing labor-intensive goods
in the entire market and in land-intensive and natural resource-
intensive goods in the RRCs.

    One observes the results of these basic factor conditions in

the commodity composition of U.S. exports to the region, that

                               51
tend to be concentrated in natural resource-intensive goods, such

as agricultural products, and in technology-intensive goods, that

require relatively high professional and managerial     skills to

market successfully.   It is in these that the United States is

competing most successfully against its export rivals in the APR

market.   One would expect this pattern to continue, though it
must be recognized that not only Japan but the ADCs and RRCs are

shifting into the high-tech area.        The United States must
continually upgrade its level of high-tech products to maintain
its market positions in the APR market and other world markets.

     Market opportunities    for the United States depend on
economic and political conditions in the countries of the region

as well as on U.S. competitive abilities. It seems that the
present APR governments will continue to pursue export-oriented
economic policies.. There is, however, some political uncertainty
stemming from outside pressures in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and from
both outside and inside pressures in Korea. It is conceivable but

unlikely that these pressures could bring government changes that
would reduce market opportunities in these countries. Even with
the present governments in Korea and Taiwan, the United States
needs to apply pressure for the removal of their import barriers.
     There is considerable political uncertainty in another
important market for U.S. goods, the Philippines. One would
expect economic policies to continue as they have with alternate
cycles of liberalization and control, resulting in a moderate
rate of growth. But there is also the possibility of a political

                               52
shift resulting not only in more inward-looking economic policies
but in the removal of U.S. military bases from the country. In
Indonesia there are also strong political interests favoring
import-substitution over export-promotion policies.      Unlike the
ADCs, resource-rich countries like Indonesia and the Philippines
are not forced to promote exports of manufactures to produce a
politically acceptable growth rate.      Thailand and Malaysia are
not only rich in resources but have adopted policies to utilize
their     abundant   supplies   of unskilled     labor to produce
manufactured goods for export. They should continue to do well,
but like the other countries must be pressured to open their own
markets to a greater extent.

     While this paper has been mainly concerned with the export
opportunities of the United States and others in the APR market,
data have also been collected on the performance of the APR
countries in world export markets. The picture that emerges is a
familiar one.. The developing.countries of the APR have sent an
increasing share of their exports to the United States, in many
cases a significantly larger share. In 1984 the U.S. trade with
the RRCs was roughly in balance, but the U.S. incurred a
merchandise deficit of over $6 billion with the ADCs. The shares
sent to Japan have generally declined or, in a few cases,
remained about the same. For the EC the share changes are mixed
- some   rising, some staying the same, and others declining.
    Textiles and apparel are the most important category of
imports from the ADCs and China, but products requiring higher

                                53
skills,   particularly     electrical   machinery    and electronic

products, are becoming more significant.     Oil and gas have long
dominated the RRCs pattern of exports to the United States, but
in recent years electrical        and   electronic   products have
challenged their position as the most important export category.
Clearly, the APR countries        are increasing     the degree of
complexity of their export product mix.
     The 1980 volume of direct investment by the United States in
the ADCs was greater than Japan's, but Japanese direct investment
in the entire region was greater than that of the United States.
The United States is, however, increasing the share of its total
investment going to the region, though this share is still quite
small, growing from 3.6% in 1977 to 6.7% in 1984.      Oil and gas
and service activities, such as banking and trade, are the
sectors in the APR that receive the largest share of world
investment.   Services and manufacturing are the sectors in which
investment in the developing countries of the Asian Pacific Rim
is growing most rapidly.
