                                          ABSTRACT

Throughout history, technological progress has transformed population health, but the
distributional effects of these gains are unclear. New substitutes for older, more expensive health
technologies can produce convergence in population health outcomes, but may also be prone to
“elite capture” leading to divergence. This paper studies the case of penicillin using detailed
mortality statistics and exploiting its sharply-timed introduction in Italy after World War II. We
find penicillin reduced both the mean and standard deviation of infectious diseases mortality,
leading to substantial convergence across disparate regions of Italy. Our results do not appear to
be confounded by competing risks or mortality patterns associated with World War II.

I       Introduction

Technological progress in medicine has been described as a leading explanation for the in-
crease in post-World War II era (Davis 1956; Preston 1975; Easterlin 1999; Mokyr 2002;
Acemoglu and Johnson 2007) and is often put forth as a solution to health challenges in
developing countries. Yet technological progress can also have unintended consequences for
the distribution of disease. If only elites can afford a health technology, or if a technology is
a private good that might substitute for public good provision, such innovation could widen
health disparities, at least initially (Mosca 1939; Olson 1965; Kremer and Willis 2016; Ashraf
et al. 2016). Alternatively, “breakthrough” health technologies that are less expensive may
supplant older, more expensive ones may encourage population health convergence.
        In this paper, we analyze the effects of the introduction of penicillin, arguably one of
the most important medical technologies of the twentieth century (Tomes 1990, 1998). Dis-
covered to kill Staphylococcus bacteria by Alexander Fleming in 1928 – and successfully
isolated and produced by Howard Florey, Ernst Chain, and Norman Heatley in 1939 –
this new “miracle drug” quickly became the first-line treatment for pneumonia, diphtheria,
syphilis, gonorrhea, scarlet fever, and other infectious diseases (Dowling 1977; Levy 1992).1
Penicillin’s achievements were preceded by those of sulfa agents, the first chemotherapy de-
veloped to fight infection and the subject of scholarship by Jayachandran, Lleras-Muney
and Smith (2010), who find the introduction of sulfa drugs led to impressive reductions in
maternal mortality and pneumonia deaths in the historical United States.2
        We build off the Jayachandran et al. (2010) study in two ways: first, by exploring the
role penicillin had on average mortality in Italy following its introduction by the United
    1
      The Lancet published a high-profile article in 1943 entitled “General and Local Administration of Peni-
cillin,” describing the effectiveness of penicillin in treating wounded soldiers in North Africa (Florey and
Florey 1943). Some scholars estimate that penicillin saved at least 300,000 lives during the Second World
War (Dowling 1977; Levy 1992; Ratcliff 1945).
    2
      Conybeare (1948), Loudon (1988), and Mackenbach and Looman (1998) also provide suggestive evidence
on the importance of antibiotics. By contrast, some studies suggest that penicillin did not have the dramatic
effect commonly attributed to it (Hemminki and Paakkulainen (1976) studying Finland and Sweden, for
example).



                                                     1
Nations in the aftermath of World War II, and second, and more generally, by documenting
the effects of the technology on the distribution of mortality.3 Some scholars suggest that the
distribution of new technologies, even inexpensive ones, often benefit the elite first (Brenzel
and Claquin 1994). Others suggest that more portable technologies which do not require
large scale infrastructure investments are less prone to elite capture and have considerable
potential to improve population health (Acemoglu and Robinson 2008; Mosca 1939; Olson
1965). For penicillin, this could be particularly true given that political decision-making
often targeted expensive water and sanitation infrastructure – which can greatly reduce the
spread of infectious diseases – towards more elite neighborhoods and communities (Bigatti
2014; Massarutto 2011; Picci 2002; Troesken 2004). Finally, technological progress may
be “necessary” but not “sufficient” for health convergence – institutions may be critical to
ensure benefits are distributed to those most in need.
    To study the distributional consequences of the introduction of penicillin, we assemble a
dataset of Italian vital records spanning much of the twentieth century (Atella, Francisci and
Vecchi, 2017). We use these data to estimate the contribution of penicillin to infectious dis-
ease mortality decline in Italy during the twentieth century. Focusing on the years between
1924 and 1955, we first establish its average effect on mortality by interacting the sharp tim-
ing of penicillin introduction with causes of death sensitive to penicillin, controlling for time-
and region-level effects as well as regional linear time trends. We then estimate penicillin’s
effect on the distribution of mortality in four ways: first, by analyzing changes in the age
distribution of deaths over time, using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests to detect significant
differences in these distributions year-by-year; second, using our econometric approach akin
to our framework for studying mean reductions in mortality rates, but testing for differential
declines by initial level of infectious disease death rates; third, testing for β-convergence,
following the literature on macroeconomic growth and economic convergence (Barro and
Sala-i-Martin 1992); and, fourth, testing for σ-convergence by estimating the relationship
  3
    Sulfa drugs are distinct from beta-lactam antibiotics, of which penicillin is the first developed (Mandell,
Douglas and Bennett 2010).


                                                      2
between penicillin introduction and changes in the standard deviation of regional mortality
rates (Janssen et al. 2016).
   We find sharply-timed reductions in penicillin-sensitive mortality rates across Italy that
closely coincide with the introduction of penicillin in 1947. There are no trend differences
between penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-insensitive diseases prior to 1947, and the subse-
quent decline of about 0.3 deaths per thousand annually represents a 66% reduction relative
to the average rate of penicillin-sensitive deaths in earlier years. Then, using all four esti-
mation approaches, we find clear evidence of mortality rate convergence across regions of
Italy. Relative to years prior to 1947, the introduction of penicillin reduced the disper-
sion of penicillin-sensitive mortality rates across regions by 68%, explaining 40% of all-cause
convergence over this period.
   We also consider two important threats to the internal validity of our analyses. The
first is competing risks. Because our estimation framework relies on comparisons between
penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-insensitive diseases, reductions in penicillin-sensitive deaths
could mechanically increase non-communicable disease (NCD) mortality as those benefitting
from penicillin live long enough to suffer and die from non-infectious causes. We show that
competing risks are not a threat in practice because the decline in penicillin sensitive death
rates is present when examining a simple change over time (i.e. not making comparisons with
NCDs). Furthermore, even when the sample time frame is limited to a very short window
following pencillin’s debut, thereby reducing the movement of infectious disease survivors
into deaths due to non-infectious causes, we still find statistically significant and medically
meaningful effects. The second issue is that penicillin was introduced shortly after the end of
World War II. Infectious disease mortality rates commonly surge during wartime (Erdem et
al. 2011; Zapor and Moran 2005), so their decline relative to non-infectious mortality rates
could partly reflect the end of conflict and regression to the mean. However, our results
are similar across areas with varying degrees of war-related destruction and are robust to
excluding years 1943–1945 (the years of most intense conflict in Italy) from our estimation.


                                                3
         The paper proceeds as follows. Section II provides historical background on public health
in Italy and the introduction of penicillin, and Section III describes the construction of the
dataset. Section IV focuses on the role of penicillin for mean reductions in mortality, and
examines penicillin’s contributions to population health convergence. Section V presents es-
timation results. Section VI considers competing risks and presents other robustness checks,
and Section VII concludes.

II        Background

II.A        Early Efforts to Combat Infectious Disease Mortality in Italy

At the time of unification in 1861, life expectancy at birth in Italy was approximately 29
years, and the crude death rate was about 35 per 1,000 people (Atella, Francisci and Vecchi,
2017). In 1887, Francesco Crispi’s government introduced the country’s first sanitary reforms
under the Crispi-Pagliani law.4 However, infectious disease deaths in Italy did not begin to
decline until the early twentieth century, which historians link to improvements in municipal
hygiene under provisions of the law governing water quality and sanitation in urban areas
(Giovannini 1996; Giuntini 1999; Pogliano 1984). During fascist rule (1920-1943), public
health initiatives targeted the so-called “triple endemic diseases:” malaria, syphilis, and
tuberculosis.5
         Italy’s nascent healthcare system and reforms often failed to reach its poorest members
(Giovannini 1996; Giuntini 1999; Pogliano 1984).6 Municipal authorities were responsible
for providing healthcare to the indigent, yet in practice private charitable organizations
     4
      The establishment of a health system is interpreted by historians as one of the most important achieve-
ments of Italian “political and moral life” at the beginning of the new Kingdom [Croce (1928), cited in
Cosmacini (2005), p. 345].
    5
      The most important provisions focused on malaria were issued between 1923 and 1934 through a series
of laws designed to arrive at a thorough land reclamation operation (bonifica integrale). The Consolidation
Act on the reclamation of marshlands was approved with Royal Decree no. 3256 of 30 December 1923. Law
no. 3134 of 24 December 1928, called the “Mussolini Law,” granted financial resources to land reclamation
and provided for integration regarding the supply of drinking water and the construction of rural buildings,
hamlets, and roads.
    6
      The law’s principles of universalism became effective only in 1978, when the Italian National Health
Service System (SSN) was established.




                                                     4
provided these services (Opere Pie, or “Pious Organizations”).7 A Royal Decree in 1884
established that private firms could invest in the water sector (Ermano and Massarutto
2012). Massarutto (2011) argues this decree and the ensuing privatization directed water
supply towards the wealthy in urban areas. As late as the 1950s, only 52% of private houses
in Italy received potable water (Doria 2010), and only 7% had all three utilities: potable
water, adequate sanitation, and electricity (Barra Bagnasco 1996).8
       Mortality rates in Italy declined on average during the early- to mid-1900s (see Figure
1), though wide regional health disparities in infectious disease mortality were prevalent at
the beginning of this period (Figure 2, Panel A). Nationally, life expectancy at birth in Italy
rose to 40-45 years – but varied by as much as 12 years across regions.9 These regional
disparities peaked in 1925-1930, remained high until WWII, and then declined sharply at
the end of the war. Understanding whether the introduction of penicillin contributed to the
compression of regional mortality rates is a central focus of this paper.

II.B      The Advent of Penicillin in Italy

The supply of penicillin in Italy began in 1947 (Luzzi 2004). In its early stage of distribution
(1945 and 1946) penicillin was available in Italy through international aid only, imported by
the UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) channel and limited
in quantity. At that time the black market was flourishing. Therefore, having enough money
and connections, people could reach for the drug (the initial distribution of penicillin in Italy
by the US Army started with the main intent of using it to treat the spreading of venereal
   7
      The “non-poor” generally used services provided by individual private-practice doctors (medici libero-
esercenti ) who made home visits.
    8
      Until the end of WWII, national public spending for infrastructure was concentrated in the North. On
public investments in water, a Royal Decree issued in 1884 created a dualism in the management of water
services: water was public, but private companies could invest in the sector once awarded government licenses
(Ermano 2012). As a result, water was largely provided to wealthy families in urban areas (Massarutto
2011). Although many subsequent laws governing water management were issued between 1861 and 1950,
universalism in the water sector was not achieved until the late 1950s (Mantelli and Temporelli 2007).
Modern water infrastructure in poorer southern regions was completed only in the late 1980s (Mantelli and
Temporelli, 2007).
    9
      During the 1920s the regional variation in life expectancy at birth was almost as large as that estimated
for Indian states between 2011 and 2016 – ranging from 61.5 years in Madhya Pradesh to 77 years in Kerala
(Ponnapalli et al., 2013).


                                                      5
diseases). To resolve this problem ENDIMEA (Ente Nazionale Distribuzione Medicinali
agli Alleati) was established, which began its work on October 1st, 1944. Since January
1st, 1945, each provincial health office began to communicate to the General Directorate
of Public Health (DGSP), within the Ministry of the Interior, estimates of the demand for
medicines for the quarter. The DGSP, based on the requests and the availability of drugs,
granted the drugs to the applicants, informing ENDIMEA to ship the product to the local
private wholesalers. Once the wholesaler collected the drugs, he was responsible for the
distribution of medicines to the Provincial Health Offices. The latter also had an obligation
to follow the drug during the journey from the wholesaler warehouse to the pharmacies or
hospitals, in order to prevent theft and illegal sales.10
       Italian patients could receive the new drug free of charge if requested by their physicians.
Provincial Health Offices were held accountable for any shortages of medicines, and phar-
macists received a high margin for the sale of antibiotics, which discouraged the emergence
of an underground market favoring the wealthy (Battini 1946; Luzzi 2004).

III      Data

III.A       Vital Statistics Data11

The Italian National Statistical Office (ISTAT) provides national vital statistics in annual
Health Statistics Yearbooks (Annuario di Statistiche Sanitarie) starting from 1887. Vital
statistics for years 1924-1955 were digitized at the region-year-cause of death level.12
       Harmonizing Regions. ISTAT data provides death counts for Italy’s regions over time.
  10
      The Italian health authorities were responsible for any shortages of medicines. In the spring of 1945
the drug became available via physician prescription, but only in the City Public Health Offices (Ufficio
d’Igiene). In 1947, the pharmaceutical company “SPA Milan” became the first private Italian company to
market antibiotics, selling Supercillin (in vials) and Prontocillin (tablets). A year later, the Anglo-American
monopoly over penicillin was broken by Domenico Marotta, then-director of the Istituto Superiore di Sanit,
who called Ernst Chain to lead the International Centre for Microbiological Chemistry in Rome.
  11
     For a complete description of the vital statistics, see Appendix A.
  12
     To the best of our knowledge, formal demographic analyses of the quality and completeness of Italy’s
historical mortality statistics have not been published. However, Italian vital statistics back to the nineteenth
century are included in the Human Mortality Database (HMD), and data quality is a central criterion for
HMD inclusion. http://www.mortality.org/. (Data documentation for Italy HMD available at: http:
//www.mortality.org/hmd/ITA/InputDB/ITAcom.pdf).



                                                       6
Due to changes in administrative regional borders over our period of investigation, we had
to aggregate some regions. From 1924 until the end of WWII, Italy was organized into
18 administrative regions with only minor changes across region borders. The only excep-
tion was the establishment of Valle dAosta in September 1945. For this reason, to obtain
a harmonized regional dataset from 1924 to 1954 we treat Piedmont and Valle dAosta as
a single region. Thus, our sample includes the following 18 regions: Piedmont and Valle
d’Aosta, Lombardy, Trentino Alto Adige, Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Liguria, Emilia Ro-
magna, Tuscany, Umbria, Marche, Lazio, Abruzzi and Molise, Campania, Apulia, Basilicata,
Calabria, Sicily and Sardinia.13
    Harmonizing Cause of Death. Officially, ISTAT assumed the responsibility of collecting
mortality data at individual level only in 1930, following Law no. 2238 issued in December
1929. Previously, the statistical office was within the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry and
Trade via Indagine sulle cause di morte. ISTAT collects this information using an official
reporting format (“Scheda di morte”) following international standards recommended by the
World Health Organization (WHO). These individual death certificates consist of two parts.
A general practitioner or coroner certifies the first part and ascribes cause. The “initial
cause” – disease or trauma – is recorded, which may have led to additional complications
but initiated a causal chain leading to death. Diagnostic codes are then assigned to each
death using WHO International Classification of Diseases (ICD) criteria. The second part
is completed by a municipal civil registrar and includes information about the demographic
and social characteristics of the deceased.
    Causes of death reported in Italy’s vital records change over time. We therefore use
categories that can be consistently identified and tracked across all study years, effectively
adopting the classification used in 1956–1957 for all years of our analysis (1924–1955).14 We
   13
      For sake of completeness, in December 1963 the region of Molise was established by splitting the “Abruzzi
and Molise” into two distinct regions. This last change brought Italy to have the current administrative
structure based on 20 regions.
   14
      The 17 causes of death are the following: infective and parasitic diseases; tumors; allergic and endocrine
glands diseases; blood and hematopoietic diseases; psychic and personality disorders; nervous system diseases;
circulatory system diseases; respiratory system diseases; digestive system diseases; genitourinary system dis-


                                                       7
then classify each of these causes that can be consistently tracked over time according to
whether or not it can be treated with penicillin. Ultimately, this process yields 79 penicillin-
insensitive, 15 penicillin-sensitive, and 15 unclassified diseases.15 In our analysis of cause-
specific mortality we exclude unclassified deaths.
    Constructing war related destruction indicator. We measure destruction related to World
War II using the number of military and civilian deaths directly related to war causes at the
regional level that occurred between 1940 and 1945 (ISTAT 1957).16
    Constructing Rates. Finally, using death counts by region, year, and cause, we construct
mortality rates using data on regional populations in Italy over time. Specifically, to create
population denominators, we use regional population counts from Italy’s decennial popula-
tion censuses provided by ISTAT. For inter-censual years, population estimates accounting
for births and deaths provides estimates of this population construction process using several
sources of population data (Vecchi, 2017; see Appendix A for more details).17
eases; complications of pregnancy; skin and tissue diseases; bones and locomotive organs diseases; congenital
malformations; early childhood particular diseases; senility and pathologic states; accidents, traumatisms,
and poisonings. The coding system adopted during years 1924–1955 has changed from the International
Analytical Classification (IAC) to the ISTAT Intermediate Classification (IIC) adopted in subsequent years.
Moreover, from 1958 onwards, there is a higher disaggregation of diseases with respect to years 1956–1957,
due to the inclusion of new death-related causes.
   15
      The list of “penicillin-sensitive” and “penicillin-insensitive” categories of death are reported in Appendix
B.
   16
      The war victims are quantified according to the region of actual death, delivering a space/time quan-
tification of war conflicts. WWII severity indicator in Italy is provided by the official publication “Morti
e dispersi per cause belliche negli anni 1940–45” (The dead and the missing due to war causes between
1940–1945) (ISTAT, 1957). The intensity of war destruction was quantified based at the median. Regions
above-median conflict deaths are: Piedmont-Valle d’Aosta, Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Emilia Romagna,
Toscana, Umbria, Marche, Lazio. Lombardy, Trentino Alto Adige, Abruzzi and Molise, Campania, Puglia,
Basilicata, Campania, Sicilia, Sardegna. See Atella, Di Porto, and Kopinska (2017) for a detailed description
of the data used. WWII-related death rates were then computed by dividing death county by the average
regional population between 1940–1945.
   17
      Population estimates were interpolated into age bins of 0–25, 26–30, 31–35, 36–40, 41–45, 46–50, 51–
55, 56–60, 61–65, 66–70, 71–75, and 76+ by using known population data for years 1921–1927, 1931–1936,
1943–1950, 1953, 1957, and 1959–1961. To estimate missing population data, we broke the age bins into
separate individual age columns and assumed a uniform population distribution for each age within an age
bin. We interpolated missing age-specific population by taking the current year’s age-specific population
and adding the previous year’s age-specific mortality to get the previous year’s age-specific population. We
use the same methodology in the opposite direction by interpolating the age-specific population data of
the subsequent year by taking the current year’s age-specific population and subtracting the current year’s
population age-specific mortality. Afterwards, we re-aggregated the age columns into the original age bins
for the population controls of our study.

Table 1 shows descriptive statistics on all-cause mortality for penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-
insensitive diseases before and after penicillin introduction.

III.B      Human Mortality Database (HMD) Data

We also use national-level data on age-specific deaths from the Human Mortality Database
(HMD) in two ways (HMD 2017).18 First, because the regional vital statistics do not contain
information about deaths by age, precluding age-adjustment, we control for age-specific
population counts.19 Second, we directly examine changes in the age distribution of deaths
over time as an alternative strategy for studying mortality convergence.

III.C      Graphical Analysis

Mortality Decline by Cause. As Figure 1 shows, Italy’s total mortality rate fell substantially
between 1924 and 1955. However, this decline varied dramatically by cause – and in particu-
lar, by penicillin sensitivity. Panel A of Figure 2 shows that with the official introduction of
penicillin in 1947, the decline in regional mortality rates for penicillin-sensitive causes accel-
erated sharply. Moreover, the variance in regional death rates sensitive to penicillin became
markedly more compressed beginning in 1947, with substantial convergence occurring by
the mid-1950s. Panel B of Figure 2 demonstrates regional mortality rates for non-infectious
causes did not decline over the entire period – nor did their variance.20
  18
     National-level HMD estimates are constructed by HMD investigators using vital statistics, population
censuses, and population estimates directly from ISTAT and from other researchers working on behalf of
ISTAT. Death counts in the Italian vital statistics are based on the de facto population (“popolazione pre-
sente”) until 1980 and on the de jure population (“popolazione residente”) afterwards. Therefore, mortality
rates before 1981 in the HMD are based on population estimates of the de facto population, calculated from
census counts to consider this change in the coverage of vital statistics (Glei 2015). Death counts from the
vital statistics are also adjusted both to include missing military deaths during World Wars I and II and
to spatially redistribute deaths by age and calendar year (Jdanov et al. 2008). For the period 1937–51,
intercensal survival methods are used to derive population estimates using pre- and post-war census counts
(Jdanov et al. 2008).

     This data is also available online at:http://www.mortality.org/

     More work is required to address concerns about the confounding role of World War II given that
infectious disease deaths often exceed direct casualties due to conflict (Erdem et al. 2011; Zapor and Moran
2005). We address this issue later in Section VI.B. Further, one might also argue that WWII has favored
internal migration flows from poorer to richer regions, thus contributing to higher differentials among regional
mortality rates. Atella, Deb and Kopinska (2019) show that the phenomenon of migration within Italian

    Mortality Decline by Age. Figure 3 depicts the age distribution of period life table deaths
in Italy for years between 1924 and 1955. The figure reveals substantial reductions in infant
and child mortality over time (which are generally due to infectious causes, mostly penicillin-
sensitive (Vercelli et al. 2014)). As a result, deaths appear to become more concentrated at
older ages – a pattern consistent with convergence, although the timing of this compression
is less readily evident (Section VI investigates this issue more closely).
    Standard Deviation and Average Life Expectancy: Figure 4 shows both life expectancy
at birth and the standard deviation of age at death across regions (a common indicator
used in the literature to measure mortality convergence and lifespan inequality (Edwards
and Tuljapurkar 2005; Gillespie et al. 2014)) by year. Life expectancy at birth increases
from 51.5 in 1924 to 57.6 in 1939, declines abruptly during WWII until the 1943 Italian
armistice, recovers quickly to its pre-war level, and continues to increase in the post-war
years. The standard deviation of age at death declines little during the pre-war period (as
life expectancy at birth is rising), remains relatively constant during WWII, and then declines
precipitously beginning in the late 1940s (around the time that penicillin was introduced)
and throughout the post-war period. This rapid decline beginning in the latter 1940s is
suggestive of mortality convergence.
    Standard Deviation by Cause: Figure 5 shows the standard deviation of regional death
rates separately for the all-cause mortality rates, penicillin-sensitive mortality rates, and
penicillin-insensitive mortality rates over time. Before WWII, the standard deviation tra-
jectories of penicillin-sensitive and -insensitive mortality rates were similar. Both experience
disruptions during the war period, but after 1947 the standard deviation of penicillin-sensitive
mortality rates across regions converges, while the standard deviation of penicillin-insensitive
mortality rate slightly diverges.
regions began in earnest in 1951.

IV       Estimation

IV.A       Mortality Decline

Building on graphical evidence shown in Figures 2 and 4, our empirical strategy tests for
sharply-timed differential trend breaks in penicillin-sensitive mortality rates (relative to
penicillin-insensitive mortality rates) coincident with the introduction of penicillin in 1947.
Specifically, we estimate:


(1)            mict = α + γi + δt + θc + β(Itpost ∗ Sensitivec ) + Xit ϕ + γi ∗ t + ict ,


for regions i, causes of death c, and years t. mict is a region-cause-year specific death rate
(specified both in level and natural log form). Itpost is a dummy variable equal to one for
observations in years 1947 or later, Sensitive is a dummy variable for whether or not cause
c is sensitive to penicillin, and X is a vector of covariates including interpolated population
estimates in discrete age categories. We include year, region, and disease fixed effects, and
our preferred specification also includes linear time trends interacted with region dummies.
Standard errors are clustered by region, and we report p-values corresponding to block
bootstrapped standard errors.21
       We also assess the temporal dynamics of the introduction of penicillin by substituting a
vector of year dummy variables for , Itpost in Equation (1):


                                                 ρj (Sensitivec ∗ Itj ) + Xit ϕ + γi ∗ t + ict ,
                                           X
(2)           mict = α + γi + δt + θc +
                                             j



where Itj is a vector of j year dummy variables and all other variables are defined as before.
  21
    To assess the robustness of our results, we also estimate variants of specification (1), using both levels
and log specifications and including region-specific linear time trends.




                                                      11
IV.B       Mortality Convergence

To study mortality convergence at the national level, we first analyze changes in the distri-
bution of age at death (Kannisto 2000; Fries 1980; Wilmoth and Horiuchi 1999). Specifically,
we use Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests to formally assess if the timing of statistically signif-
icant changes in the distribution of age at death coincides with the introduction of penicillin
in 1947, comparing the distribution in each year between 1924-1954 with the last year in our
sample, 1955.22
       Second, we test for mortality convergence associated with the introduction of penicillin
using an econometric framework similar to the one that we use for estimating mean reductions
in penicillin-sensitive mortality rates. Specifically, we re-estimate Equation (1), stratifying
by the pre-1947 level of both penicillin-sensitive mortality rates and overall regional mortality
rates.
       Third, we test for β-convergence, or convergence in levels of mortality rates, following
the approach of Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992) to study convergence in Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) per capita across countries. This approach assesses if regions with higher
pre-1947 penicillin-sensitive and -insensitive mortality rates converged towards regions with
lower mortality rates by sub-periods (before and after the introduction of penicillin, 1929-
1946 and 1947-1955). Specifically, we estimate:

                               (mict − mict0 )
(3)                                            = α + γi + βmict0 + it
                                 (t − t0 )

where mict is the mortality rate in region i due to cause c in initial year t0 (t0 = 1924 for the
first sub-period, and t0 = 1947 for the second sub-period) and β is the parameter of interest.
       Finally, we test for σ-convergence, or convergence in the standard deviation of mortality
  22
    A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic is used to test whether two empirical one-dimensional
distribution functions (Fm (x), Gn (x)) differ from each other. The KS statistic is defined by the formula
Dmn = supx | Fm (x) − Gn (x) |. The null hypothesis that the q two samples come fromqthe same distribution
                                                               m+n
is rejected, at the level of significance α, when Dmn > c(α)   mn ,   where c(α) =    − 12 ln( α2 ) (Stephens,
1974).

rates, across regions of Italy by re-estimating Equation (1) using the standard deviation
of cause-specific mortality rates by region as the dependent variable (Janssen et al. 2016;
Young et al. 2008).

V       Results

V.A       Mortality Decline

Table 2 reports results obtained by estimating Equation (1). Conditioning on year, region,
and disease fixed effects as well as the regional age distribution, mortality rates among
diseases sensitive to penicillin relative to those insensitive fell by approximately 0.3 per
thousand (and is statistically distinguishable from zero, p < 0.01) with the introduction
of penicillin. Relative to the mean mortality rate among deaths due to these causes prior
to 1947 (0.469, see Table 1), this represents a reduction of 58%.23 Column 2 adds region-
specific linear time trends. In both cases, the estimate of β is robust, with the mortality
rate decline associated with the introduction of penicillin remaining at about 0.3 per 1,000.
Columns 3 and 4 repeat this estimation for log mortality, showing robust reductions in
penicillin-sensitive mortality rates.
       Figure 6 then examines the dynamic pattern of mortality decline associated with penicillin
introduction in Italy, showing estimates and 95% confidence intervals for each year-specific
ρj in Equation (2). Prior to the introduction of penicillin, there is little evidence of pre-
existing declines in penicillin sensitive mortality rates (relative to insensitive ones). Year-
specific estimates drop with the introduction of penicillin in 1947 and become negative and
statistically different from zero by 1948 (and in all subsequent years) with the diffusion of
penicillin. By the end of our study period in 1955, these year-specific estimates approach a
decline of 2.8 per 1,000 deaths.
  23
    To estimate this effect we divide the post-1947 mean average reduction in the cause-specific mortality
(regression coefficient in the first column of Table 2: -0.272), by the mean mortality rate for penicillin-sensitive
causes in the baseline period, between 1924–1946.




                                                        13
V.B    Mortality Convergence

Figure 7 first shows year-by-year K-S p-values for tests of differences between each year’s
distribution of age at death against the distribution in 1955 (the last year in our sample).
These p-values remain constant at nearly 0 for all years prior to the introduction of an-
tibiotics, indicating strongly significant differences from 1955 – and then beginning in 1947,
these p-values rapidly rise to 1 (indicating no difference from 1955). This sharply-timed
compression in Italy’s age distribution of deaths is highly consistent with the introduction
of antibiotics leading to convergence in mortality rates.
   Table 3 reports estimates obtained from Equation (1), stratified by level of penicillin-
sensitive mortality rates prior to 1947 (above and below the median). The first and second
columns show that after 1947, penicillin-sensitive mortality rates declined more in regions
with higher (above median) initial rates (by 0.29 per 1,000) than in those with lower (below
median) initial rates (0.26 per 1,000) – and significantly so. Compared to the mean of the
pre-1947 penicillin-sensitive cause-specific mortality, these changes represent reductions of
61% and 55%, respectively.
   Table 4 reports β-convergence estimates from Equation (3).             Comparing penicillin-
sensitive mortality rates before vs. after the introduction of penicillin, the estimate of β
is almost four times greater after penicillin introduction (-0.075 vs. -0.021). Alternatively,
for penicillin-insensitive mortality rates, the estimate is not statistically significant prior to
1947 – and is positive and statistically different from 0 afterwards, suggesting divergence in
penicillin-insensitive mortality rates.
   Finally, Table 5 (columns (1) and (2)) present estimates of sigma convergence by using the
standard deviation of deaths across regions and years for each of the two disease categories as
the dependent variable. We find that the standard deviation of penicillin-sensitive mortality
declines after penicillin is introduced (-0.113, p < 0.01) – but not the standard deviation
of penicillin-insensitive mortality (-0.004). The results remain consistent after truncating
the sample in 1950 (row 2): the standard deviation of penicillin-sensitive mortality declines

                                               14
significantly (-0.089, p < 0.01), but not for penicillin-insensitive mortality (-0.009).24

VI       Identification and Threats to Validity

In this section, we discuss two potential treats to our interpretation of the effects of the
introduction of antibiotics on infectious disease mortality. In Section VI.A, we consider the
problem of competing risks – specifically, the survival benefit of antibiotics increased the
exposure of the population to death from non-infectious causes. In Section VI.B, we discuss
how the chaotic end to World War II may have affected infectious disease mortality in Italy
during our sample period.

VI.A       Competing Risks

In our context, the competing risks problem concerns a possible increase in non-communicable
disease (NCD) mortality resulting from fewer people dying from infectious disease mortality
as a result of the introduction of penicillin. This phenomenon can influence our estimates
given that we compare penicillin-sensitive vs. penicillin-insensitive death rates over time
(Tsiatis, 1975; Peterson, 1976; Honorè and Lleras-Muney 2006). In this section we study the
influence that competing risks has on our estimation of the contribution of penicillin to the
mortality decline in Italy.25 We present a simple framework for defining the particular com-
peting risk problem inherent in our main estimating equation, and describe an alternative
approach to bound the estimates.
       Period 0: In any period, deaths can be divided into mortality from two etiologies E =
{I, N C} where I indicates infectious diseases and N C reflects non-communicable diseases.


(4)                                             D = I + NC
  24
      We use a truncated sample to test the potential treat of competing risks in the interpretation of the
effects of the introduction of penicillin on infectious disease mortality, including our interpretation of sigma
convergence – see Section VI.A.
   25
      Technically, if competing risks is a problem, it amounts to a violation of the Stable Unit Treatment Value
Assumption (SUTVA), which is necessary for unbiased estimates in a difference-in-difference framework such
as ours.




                                                      15
note that deaths from etiology E can be expressed as the mortality rate from E multiplied
by the number of susceptible from that etiology at time t: E = µe,t ∗ S E,t . We assume that
mortality rate from non-communicable disease is exogenous to penicillin and, after period 0,
there are N 0 persons surviving in this closed population without births or migration.

Period 1: At the beginning of period 1, penicillin, p, is introduced which immediately treats
and cures those afflicted with infectious diseases, leading to a direct decline in mortality
associated with diseases of infectious etiology:


(5)                                      D1 = S I,1 µI,1 (p) + S N C,1 µN C


Period 2: By period 2, there are now indirect effects of penicillin, since those weaker
individuals that otherwise would have died from infectious disease are now alive (e.g. the
harvesting effect of infections has been reduced). These spared lives increase the size of the
susceptible non-communicable disease population:


(6)                                S N C,2 = N 0 − S I,1 µI,1 (p) − S N C,1 µN C .


                    ∂µI,i                                                            ∂S N C,2
      Recall that    ∂p
                            < 0 by the pharmacology of penicillin and                  ∂p
                                                                                                > 0 by equation 6.
Hence the total effect of penicillin over time reflects both the direct effect on infectious deaths
and its indirect effect on non-communicable susceptibles.
      Our difference-in-differences estimate compares the changes in infectious and non-communicable
diseases related deaths, before vs. after the introduction of penicillin:26

                                                                                             
(7)                         S I,2 µI,2 (p) − S I,0 µI,0 − S N C,2 (p)µN C − S N C,0 µN C


Given that the first term is negative (by the direct effects of penicillin) and the second, in
   26
      Equation 7 is normalized by total population in our empirical framework. Note there is also a positive
effect on susceptibles for infectious diseases at the beginning of period 2, but we ignore that detail since
it is dwarfed by the first order effect of penicillin which is to reduce the mortality associated with many
communicable causes.


                                                         16
the absence of an overall secular decline in mortality, is positive (by the indirect effects of
penicillin), our estimates are biased away from the null.27 Yet in our setting, there may
be a very prominent secular decline in mortality for all causes – which is why a difference-
in-differences framework is preferred. Thus, estimates from both the simple and double
differences are biased, the former by a secular decline and mis-attribution of penicillin to
secular patterns, and the latter by competing risks.
       To gauge the relative importance of these two sources of bias, we zoom in on the pe-
riod very soon after penicillin was introduced (i.e. Period 1), so that our difference-in-
differences estimator is not influenced by competing risks (i.e. there is no indirect effects on
                                                                                           
non-communicable disease):             S I,1 µI,1 (p) − S I,0 µI,0 − S N C,1 µN C − S N C,0 µN C . Shortly af-
ter penicillin is introduced, we are more likely to isolate the direct effect of penicillin on the
infectious disease mortality as the harvesting and death for more chronic, non-communicable
entities would not have not had time to occur. Specifically, we estimate the effect of peni-
cillin on sensitive (i.e. infectious) and insensitive (i.e. non-communicable) causes in a pre
vs. post framework and using the full vs. a truncated time period.
       These results are gathered in Table 5. For the truncated sample, ending in the year 1950
– three years following the introduction of penicillin into Italy – the results demonstrate that
both sensitive and insensitive mortality decline (row (2) columns (3) and (4)) though the
effect is much larger for the former. The estimates point to an important secular decline
in mortality, independent of penicillin, hence the negative post coefficient in column (4).
The difference-in-differences estimate ((−0.486) − (−.0363)) is about −0.12, smaller than
the main estimates in Table 2 and a lower bound on penicillin’s effects.
       Using the full sample, with an end year of 1955, the effect of penicillin introduction on
insensitive causes is more positive, reflecting the competing risk issue. Yet the magnitude
of this change is slight and statistically indistinguishable from the estimates using the 1950
cutoff. Moreover, the fact that the difference-in-differences point estimates are increasing
  27
    In the presence of a secular decline, the second term will be less negative than in the counterfactual of
absent an indirect effect of penicillin.


                                                       17
over time as per our event study is attributable to the first term in equation 7: the direct
effect of penicillin on infectious disease mortality (see row (3)). As discussed above, this
likely reflects the technology’s diffusion. When turning to sigma convergence, there is no
major concern for competing risks in any specification: convergence is limited to infectious
causes.
       In summary, the framework and results presented in this subsection show that the com-
peting risks problem in our context is small, given that a longer time window does not greatly
bias the second term in equation 7 in a positive direction. On the other hand, controlling for
a secular decline in mortality – which is what differencing out of non-communicable causes
affords – is important for obtaining less biased estimates.

VI.B        The End of World War II

Another potential concern with our results is the influence of the end of World War II on
infectious disease rates. Because infectious disease mortality rates commonly surge during
wartime (Erdem et al. 2011; Zapor and Moran 2005), their decline relative to non-infectious
mortality rates could partly reflect the end of conflict. Figure 2 (Panel A) provides at least
some prima facie evidence that this is not an important concern in our case – mortality rates
sensitive to penicillin are declining until 1930, generally remain stable through 1945 (rather
than rising), and then resume their decline. However, we probe this issue further in two
ways.
       First, we test for differential penicillin effects in areas with varying degrees of war-related
destruction. Specifically, we re-estimate Equation (1) separately for regions with above-
and below-median degrees of war intensity, measured using conflict-related mortality rates
between 1940 and 1945.28 Columns 3 and 4 of Table 3 report estimates separately for regions
with higher and lower intensity of exposure to WWII. In general, the penicillin effect is larger
in areas with lower war intensity (0.29 per 1,000) relative to those with higher war intensity
  28
    This data is available in “Morti e dispersi per cause belliche negli anni 1940–45” (ISTAT, 1957) and is also
online at https:lipari.istat.it/digibib/causedimorte/IST3413mortiedispersipercausebellicheanni1940 45+OCRottimizz.pdf.



                                                   18
(0.26 per 1,000), and this difference is statistically significant.29
       Second, we simply exclude years 1943–1945 (the years of greatest conflict in Italy) from
our sample and again re-estimate Equation (1). Columns 5 and 6 of Table 3 show these
results – the estimates are statistically equivalent to those that include these years.

VII       Conclusion

Although technological progress in health has produced dramatic gains in life expectancy
around the globe over the past century, it can also have unintended consequences for the dis-
tribution of disease. Health technologies that are inexpensive and substitute for older, more
expensive ones may lead to population health convergence, but they could also dispropor-
tionately benefit elites, widening health disparities. Notably, there has been little empirical
evidence to date on the consequences of major new health technologies for the distribution
of health in populations.
       Studying the seminal case of penicillin and focusing on Italy using newly digitized vital
statistics over several decades, we find that the introduction of penicillin not only reduced av-
erage infectious disease mortality rates dramatically (by 58%), but it also led to a substantial
reduction in the variance of mortality rates across Italian regions. Specifically, the standard
deviation in the age of death fell by nearly eight years after the introduction of penicillin
– a decline of 27%. Our findings relate to the scholarship of researchers investigating post-
World War II health convergence across countries, such as Acemoglu and Johnson (2007)
and Deaton (2006), we find that the distribution of penicillin, at least in Italy, played an im-
portant role in such convergence and suggest an important role for point-of-care technologies
in reducing health inequalities.
  29
    We test for the significance of the difference between the coefficients obtained in the separate models by
pooling the samples used in both models, and specifying a triple interaction that includes an indicator for
high and low destruction. The coefficient for this interactions term was statistically significant (p-values <
0.01).

Note: The table presents coefficient estimates for the regressions of cause-specific mortality per 1,000 on
an indicator variable for disease specific penicillin-sensitivity after year 1947 in comparison to the pre-1947
regional mortality (columns 1-2), and in regions with high and low WWII destruction above the median
(columns 3-4). High and low cutoffs are determined respectively by being above and below the median of
the given sub sample mortality. Columns 5 and 6 present coefficient estimates for the regressions of annual
change of cause-specific mortality per 1,000 on the region-cause specific mortality at a baseline year, based
on the first sub-period (1924–1946) and for the second sub-period (1947–1955), respectively. The baseline
year is 1924 for the first sub-period, while it is 1947 for the second sub-period. The values in parentheses
represent robust standard errors (SE). We test the statistical significance of the difference between the
coefficient estimates from columns (1) vs. (2), (3) vs. (4), and (5) vs. (6) by pooling the samples from the
corresponding models and looking at the significance level of the estimate of a triple interaction term, that we
construct using the indicator variables for disease specific penicillin-sensitivity, post-47 level of mortality, and
the corresponding characteristic [e.g., for columns (1) and (2), the interaction term using the pooled sample
is Sensitive*Post*(High Penicillin-Sensitive Mortality)]. Cause-specific mortality per 1,000 is in levels. All
columns include year, region, disease fixed effects, region-specific trends, and an interpolated population
estimate for age bins 0–25, 26–30, 31–35, 36–40, 41–45, 46–50, 51–55, 56–60, 61–65, 66–70, 71–75, 76+.
Standard errors in parentheses are clustered by region. Block bootstrap p-values are indicated in curly
brackets.

     Note: OLS regressions collapsed across deaths within region-years on an indicator for post introduction of Penicillin, region fixed effects, population in
     various age categories and linear time trends. The outcome in columns (1) and (2) is the standard deviation in mortality for sensitive and insensitive
     diseases, respectively. The outcome in columns (3) and (4) is the level of mortality from sensitive and insensitive diseases, respectively. Each cell
     in rows (1) and (2) reports the coefficient on the post indicator. The sample varies by row, extending over the entire analytical time period in row
     (1) and truncating in 1950 in row (2). Row (3) reports the difference between the full and truncated sample values. If competing risks are driving
     the results, the effects in row (2) should be considerably less negative in row (1), columns (2) and (4), due to individuals in the lowest part of the
     health distribution surviving infectious disease due to the introduction of Penicillin but dying at higher rates a few years later from non-communicable
     mortality.

A.1 - The data-set on Causes of Death in Italy (1924-1955)
     In Italy data on mortality are collected routinely by the Italian National Statistical Office
(ISTAT) since 1888 and are published in the Health Statistics Yearbooks (Annuari di Statis-
tiche Sanitarie). As disease classifications have changed over time, we can identify 5 time
intervals, based on 5 different classifications: 1888-1955, 1956-1957, 1958-1967, 1968-1969
and after 1969. For our study we focus on the 1888-1955 period, although for convenience
we use the classification adopted in 1956-1957 as our reference classification (it presents
the less disaggregated set of information: 17 main causes of death and 99 more specific
pathologies) and, therefore, we have re-organized the 1888-1955 classifications to reflect the
1956-1957 classification.
     Originally, data for the period 1888-1955 were available only on paper in a single docu-
ment printed by ISTAT (ISTAT, 1958) and presented in form of time series by region and
cause of death. For our purposes all tables have been scanned and saved in form of excel
files. These row data have been further processed and double-checked in order to avoid
errors from the scanning process. During the 1888-1955 period the classification follows the
International Analytical Classification (IAC) code, which was approved in 1948 (ICD, 1948)
and adopted in Italy from 1951. The reconstruction of the time series before year 1951 has
been carried out by ISTAT. The classification adopted in 1956 and 1957 has changed from
the IAC to the ISTAT Intermediate Classification (IIC) coding system. Table A.1 provides
a detailed list of all diseases with the relative IIC code, while Table A.2 provides a link
between the IIC and the IAC coding system.
     The first column provides a brief description of the 17 main causes of death; the second
column reports the ISTAT classification used to identify causes (ranging from I to XVII)
and pathologies (ranging from 1 to 99); the third column describes the identification code
that we implemented starting from the ISTAT classification. It consists of 7 digits: the first
3 digits denote 1 out of the 17 causes of death (101 to 117); the following 2 digits denote 1
out of the 99 pathologies (from 01 to 99). The final 2 digits range from 00 to 10: they equal
zero for any of the 99 pathologies resulting from the 1956-1957 classification, and take on
different values (from 01 to 10) for further disaggregation of pathologies possibly occurred
either between years 1888-1955. In terms of regional disaggregation it is worth mentioning
that until 1923 data refers to the Italian partition of territories prior to the WWI; from 1924
to 1942, data are referred to the borders established after WWI; from 1943 onward, to the
borders after the WWII. Data prior to 1943 are referred, for each region, to the partition of
territories adopted at that time. Thus, the comparability across territories is imperfect for
those regions that have experienced border changes from 1927 (i.e., Veneto, Friuli-Venezia
Giulia, Umbria, Lazio, Abruzzi, Molise and Campania). To account for these geograph-
ical border changes and in order to have an harmonized regional disaggregation, we have
grouped together Abruzzi and Molise and Piedmont and Valle dAosta, that leads to have the
dataset disaggregated in the following 18 regions: Piedmont and Valle dAosta, Lombardy,
Trentino Alto Adige, Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Liguria, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany, Um-
bria, Marche, Lazio, Abruzzi and Molise, Campania, Apulia, Basilicata, Calabria, Sicily and
Sardinia.

A.2 - Construction of mortality rates
     Mortality rates are obtained dividing number of deaths by resident population. Unfor-
tunately, data on resident population by region is available only starting from 1922 and is
obtained through a reconstruction made by Golini, Ciucci, Caselli and ISTAT (1983). As
it is only from 1924 that Italy was organized in 18 administrative regions (with only minor
changes with small borderline municipalities changing regions after that date) we decided to
start our analysis starts in 1924. For all these reasons we limit our analysis from 1924 to 1955.
