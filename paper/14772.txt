Optimal Endowment Destruction under Campbell-Cochrane Habit Formation

                                              ABSTRACT

Campbell and Cochrane (1999) formulate a model that successfully explains a wide variety of asset
pricing puzzles, by augmenting the standard power utility function with a time-varying subsistence
level, or "external habit", that adapts nonlinearly to current and past average consumption in the economy.
This paper demonstrates, that this comes at the "price" of several unusual implications. For example,
we calculate that a society of agents with the preferences and endowment process of Campbell and
Cochrane (1999) would experience a welfare gain equivalent to a permanent increase of nearly 16%
in consumption, if the government enforced one month of fasting per year, reducing consumption
by 10 percent then. We examine and explain these features of the preferences in detail. We numerically
characterize the solution to the social planning problem. We conclude that Campbell-Cochrance preferences
will provide for interesting macroeconomic modeling challenges, when endogenizing aggregate consumption
choices and government policy.

    Campbell and Cochrane (1999, hereafter denoted C-C) formulate
a model that successfully explains a wide variety of asset pricing puz-
zles, including the high equity premium, the procyclical variation of
stock prices, and the countercyclical variation of stock market volatil-
ity. These remarkable results are achieved by augmenting the stan-
dard power utility function with a time-varying subsistence level, or
“external habit”, that adapts nonlinearly to current and past average
consumption in the economy. These preferences have been shown to
be useful in a number of additional applications. For example Moore
and Roche (2002), and Verdelhan (2008) extend the C-C framework
to explain anomalies in foreign exchange markets, and Wachter (2006)
addresses the term structure. Wachter (2005) provides efficient ways
to calculate asset prices, using these preferences and exogenously given
consumption and dividends. Bansal et al. (2007) provide an estima-
tion of the C-C model. A continuous-time version and embedding it
into a larger context of long run risk evaluation is in Hansen (2008).
Guvenen (2008) has re-interpreted these preferences as arising from
agent heterogeneity. Given the achieved breakthrough in matching
key asset pricing facts by Campbell and Cochrane and other stud-
ies using their preference specification, it is all the more important
to fully understand the implications of these modeling choices. This
paper demonstrates several unusual implications.
    We show that the assertions by Campbell and Cochrane that “more
consumption is always socially desirable,” and that “habit moves non-
negatively with consumption everywhere” are incorrect. As a conse-
quence, government interventions that occasionally destroy part of
the endowment can be welfare improving. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate
such an outcome for a one-time endowment destruction that lowers
the habit level and compares it to a conventional linear habit formu-
lation, calibrated so that the two models share the same steady state.
(Detailed explanations follow in section 2.1.) Figure 1 shows that
the decline in habit is much larger under the C-C formulation due to



                                  1
      strong nonlinearities away from the steady state. As a result, the wel-
      fare loss in the first period is more than compensated for by the welfare
      gains in future periods when consumption is so much higher than the
      reduced habit level, in contrast to the conventional linear habit for-
      mulation, see Figure 2. Figure 3 depicts the effect on overall welfare
      depending on the size of the initial endowment destruction. Under
      the C-C formulation, welfare decreases for miniscule and large endow-
      ment destructions, but it increases for moderately sized destructions.1
      Under the conventional linear habit formulation, welfare always falls
      in response to an endowment destruction at the steady state.
          The purpose of this paper is to study these surprising welfare im-
      plications of the C-C preferences and assess their quantitative impor-
      tance.
          We use the original discrete-time specification of Campbell and
      Cochrane rather than moving to a continuous-time specification as in
      e.g. Hansen (2008). Exploiting the potential for large movements of
      the surplus consumption ratio are key to the analysis here, but may
      conceivably disappear in a continuous-time formulation or in other
      alterations of the original Campbell-Cochrane framework. One way
      of reading the results in this paper therefore is that the differences
      between a continuous-time framework and discrete-time framework
      may be substantial, in this case.

                                 ∞

      where δ is the subjective time discount factor and Xt is the level
      of external habit. A conventional linear external habit formulation

model, see Figure 4 that magnifies the lower range of destructions in Figure 3.

                            Xt+1 = µXt + αCta ,                       (2)

where C a denotes average consumption by all agents in the economy,
and µ and α are parameters.
    Campbell and Cochrane (1999) proceed differently. They postulate
a process for the economy’s surplus consumption ratio, Sta ≡ (Cta −
Xt )/Cta . Using lowercase letters to indicate logs, they assume that
the log surplus consumption ratio evolves as a heteroscedastic AR(1)
process,

            sat+1 = (1 − φ)s̄ + φsat + λ(sat ) cat+1 − cat − g ,
                                                              
                                                                      (3)

where φ ∈ [0, 1), g and s̄ are parameters, and the function λ(sa ) is
given by
                     (
                         S̄ −1 1 − 2(sa − s̄) − 1, sa ≤ smax ;
                             p
                 a
           λ(s ) =                                                    (4)
                                    0,             sa ≥ smax ;

with smax = s̄ + 1 − S̄ 2 /2. The parameter s̄ is the logarithm
                              

of the steady-state surplus consumption ratio S̄, and Campbell and
Cochrane set g equal to the logarithm of the mean consumption gross
growth rate G. It can be shown that the C-C formulation and the
conventional linear habit formulation in equation (2) share the same
steady state if µ = Gφ and α = G(1 − φ)(1 − S̄).
    Campbell and Cochrane consider a pure endowment economy. Let
Yt be the per capita endowment in period t. Endowment growth is
modeled as an i.i.d. lognormal process,

          ∆yt+1 = g + νt+1 ,             νt+1 ∼ i.i.d. N (0, σ 2 ).   (5)

The equilibrium outcome in a market economy is that consumption
equals endowment, cat = yt . We shall now investigate what a social
planner would like to do under free disposal, i.e., cat ≤ yt .




                                     3
2          The social planning problem
A social planner or benevolent government, facing a population with
C-C preferences given above, maximizes the expected discounted util-
ity, subject to choosing consumption between zero and current en-
dowment. That is, the only option available to the social planner is
to let agents consume a fraction of the endowment in any given pe-
riod. Let the social planner’s choice variable at time t be denoted
ψt ≡ ct − yt ≤ 0, i.e., the logarithm of the fraction of the endowment
that is consumed. The objective function can then be rewritten as
     ∞                                  ∞
     X          (Sta Cta )1−γ − 1      X      exp ((1 − γ)(sat + ψt + yt )) − 1
E0         δt                     = E0     δt                                   , (6)
     t=0
                      1−γ              t=0
                                                           1−γ

and the law of motion for the log surplus consumption ratio can be
expressed as

                 sat+1 = (1 − φ)s̄ + φsat + λ(sat ) (ψt+1 − ψt + νt+1 ) ,      (7)

where we have used equation (5) to substitute out for g. From now
on, we will leave out the superscript a since outcomes for the repre-
sentative agent and economy-wide averages are the same to the social
planner.
    Campbell and Cochrane (1999, p. 246) report that the social marginal
utility is always positive in their model which would seem to imply
that the social planner should set ψt = 0 in all periods. However,
Campbell and Cochrane only prove that an infinitesimal destruction
of the endowment leads to a welfare loss. To illustrate our surprising
finding that noninfinitesimal destructions can increase welfare under
the C-C habit formulation, it is instructive to consider a one-time
perturbation from a steady state.


2.1         One-time perturbation from a steady state
Consider an economy in a non-stochastic steady state with endowment
and consumption growing at a constant growth rate G ≥ 1. The

                                           4
parameter restriction that ensures a bounded objective function is

                                 δG1−γ < 1 .                                 (8)

Suppose now that the social planner destroys part of the endowment
in one single period, denoted period 0. Thus, we have log(C0 /Y0 ) =
ψ < 0, and the sequences of the logarithms of consumption and the
surplus consumption ratio evolve as follows

   c0 (ψ) = y0 + ψ < y0 ,
   ct (ψ) = yt ,                                            for all t ≥ 1;
   s0 (ψ) = s̄ + λ̄ψ < s̄ ,
   st (ψ) = s̄ − φt−1 ψ λ(s̄ + λ̄ψ) − φλ̄ > s̄ ,
                                              
                                                          for all t ≥ 1;

where λ̄ ≡ λ(s̄). Evidently, the representative agent’s utility falls
in period 0 because both his consumption level and the surplus con-
sumption ratio decline relative to the steady state. But the utilities in
all future periods increase due to a higher surplus consumption ratio
that asymptotically returns to its steady-state value. The question
is whether the discounted sum of these changes in utilities produce a
welfare gain or a welfare loss.
    After eliminating the constant terms involving −1/(1 − γ) in the
preference specification and dividing through by exp ((1 − γ)y0 ), the
discounted life-time utility of the described perturbation can be ex-
pressed as
                                     ∞
        exp ((1 − γ)(s0 (ψ) + ψ))   X      exp ((1 − γ)(st (ψ) + tg))
W (ψ) ≡                           +     δt                            (9)
                  1−γ               t=1
                                                     1−γ

with the derivative

         W ′ (ψ) = (1 + λ̄) exp ((1 − γ)(s0 (ψ) + ψ))

                       ∞
                       X         h         i
                   +         δt φt−1 s′1 (ψ) exp ((1 − γ)(st (ψ) + tg)) , (10)
                       t=1


                                       5
       where

               s′1 (ψ) = − λ(s̄ + ψ λ̄) − φλ̄ − ψ λ̄ λ′ (s̄ + ψ λ̄) < 0.
                                               
                                                                               (11)

       The derivative s′1 is negative since ψ < 0 and λ is a decreasing function.
       Thus, whether welfare marginally increases or decreases at negative
       values of ψ depends on whether the first or the second term in equa-
       tion (10) dominates numerically. Appendix A shows that welfare is
       globally increasing with a conventional linear habit formulation: there,
       endowment destruction in a steady state always leads to a welfare loss.
       Appendix B shows that this is also true locally along the steady-state
       path for the C-C preferences. This should come as no surprise since
       Campbell and Cochrane (1999, p. 246) prove that the social marginal
       utility is positive in their model. More specifically, they show that the
       social marginal utility is positive for infinitesimal perturbations when
       the endowment follows a random walk. When setting growth equal
       to zero in our calculations, we have a constant endowment level or a
       degenerate random walk.
           However, the local result for the C-C preferences fails to hold glob-
       ally. Given Campbell and Cochrane’s (1999, Table 1) parameter val-
       ues as reported in our Table 1, we compute the representative agent’s
       welfare associated with one-time endowment destructions between 0
       and 25 percent.2 Figure 3 shows clearly that there exist endowment
       destructions that do raise welfare.3 To understand the mechanisms at
       work, consider as an example the five-percent endowment destruction
       in Figures 1 and 2. Under the conventional linear habit formulation in
       equation (2), habit responds with a one-period lag to the endowment
       destruction in period 0 and, as can be seen in Figure 1, the resulting
   2
     Following Campbell and Cochrane (1999), all numerical analyses in our paper are
performed at a monthly frequency.
   3
     As noted in footnote 1, one cannot discern in Figure 3 that endowment destructions
lead to welfare losses locally around the steady state under the C-C habit model, as proven
in Appendix B. But after magnifying the scale in Figure 4, we see that welfare does indeed
decrease for endowment destructions less than 0.07 percent.


                                            6
decline in habit is much less than under the C-C habit model. In ad-
dition, under the C-C habit formulation in equation (3), habit moves
contemporaneously with consumption changes and according to the
solid curve in Figure 1, the habit level now falls in response both to
the endowment destruction (period 0) and to the subsequent increase
in consumption (period 1). Hence, the loss of utility in the period with
endowment destruction is mitigated under the C-C habit formulation
because of the contemporaneous drop in habit, and future utility gains
are magnified by the additional habit decline that is triggered by the
consumption hike after the endowment destruction.
    The effects upon agents’ welfare depend on how the distance be-
tween consumption and habit change in different periods as illustrated
in Figure 5 where

     C0 (ψ) − X0 (ψ) = exp (y0 + ψ + s0 (ψ)) ;
     Ct (ψ) − Xt (ψ) = exp (yt + st (ψ)) ,              for all t ≥ 1.

For a given ψ ≤ 0, it is informative to study the marginal change in
(Ct − Xt ) when perturbing ψ,

 d [C0 (ψ) − X0 (ψ)]
                       = (1 + λ̄) exp (y0 + ψ + s0 (ψ)) ;
 dψ
 d [Ct (ψ) − Xt (ψ)]
                       = φt−1 s′1 (ψ) exp (yt + st (ψ)) ,   for all t ≥ 1.
 dψ
We can see that the derivative in period 0 gets muted at low values of
ψ, i.e., at higher levels of endowment destruction, while the opposite
is true for the corresponding derivatives in future periods. In fact, the
multiplicative term s′1 as given in equation (11) becomes arbitrarily
large and negative when ψ is driven to ever lower values and therefore,
the associated loss in (Ct − Xt ) for t ≥ 1, becomes arbitrarily large
when reducing the amount of endowment destruction in period 0. This
in turn implies that (Ct − Xt ) for t ≥ 1, must take on arbitrarily large
values when computed at ever lower values of ψ. Figure 5 depicts
the exploding outcome for (C1 − X1 ) when increasing the amount of

                                   7
endowment destruction in period 0. Behind the exploding outcome
for (C1 − X1 ) in Figure 5 lies a critical property of the C-C preference
specifiation: habit can move negatively with consumption. In our ex-
ample, the subsequent consumption hike in period 1 does not increase
but rather decreases the habit level. We will examine this property
further below in section 4.
    To calculate the effect on welfare from the higher (C1 − X1 ) and
the correlated but slowly decaying future values of (Ct − Xt ) for t ≥ 2,
one needs to take into account the curvature of the utility function and
compare it to the utility loss in period 0 from the fall in (C0 − X0 ).
Thus, while (C1 − X1 ) is ever increasing, welfare takes the hump-
shaped form depicted in Figure 3.
    The feature in Figure 3, that the log of the optimal endowment de-
struction is finite, can be shown more generally. Let ω = (ψ0 , ψ1 , . . . , s0 , s1 , . . .)
be some (stochastic) path for the decisions and consequently surpluses.
Rewrite the objective function (6) as


             exp ((1 − γ)(sa0 + ψ0 + y0 )) − 1
                                               + V (ω, (yt ))                 (12)
                          1−γ
where
                              ∞
                              X          exp ((1 − γ)(sat + ψt + yt )) − 1
          V (ω, (yt )) = E0         δt                                        (13)
                              t=1
                                                      1−γ

Assume that V (ω, (yt )) > −∞. For example, this is the case for a
never-destruct-endowment policy of ψt ≡ 0, t ≥ 1. So an agent aiming
at maximizing welfare will have no problem satisfying this assumption.
Consider now an alternative path, ω̃ = (ψ̃0 , ψ̃1 , . . . , s̃0 , s̃1 , . . .) and
suppose that it improves welfare compared to the original path. There
are two cases to consider, depending on γ.
   First, assume that γ > 1. Consider the two parts of welfare in
(12). The possible gain in the second part V (ω̃, (yt )) − V (ω, (yt )) is
bounded above by δ/((1 − δ)(γ − 1)) − V (ω, (yt )). However, the loss
stemming from current utility will be unbounded as ψ̃0 → −∞. Thus,

                                            8
       for any ω̃ improving welfare compared to the current path, the initial
       endowment destruction must not drop below some treshold ψ, which
       generally depends on the current strategy ω and the current state.
           Next, assume that γ < 1. In that case, the loss from driving ψ̃0 →
       −∞ is finite and given by (exp ((1 − γ)(sa0 + ψ0 + y0 )) − 1)/(1 − γ).
       However, the first term in the continuation value of V (ω̃, (yt )) will
       now rise without bounds in ψ0 . It is easy to see that welfare can be
       improved upon without bounds, since all subsequent terms for t ≥ 2
       are in expected sum bounded below by −δ2 /((1−δ)(1−γ)) . Therefore,
       for the problem of welfare maximization to be well-posed, we must
       have γ > 1.


       2.2    Solution to the social planning problem
       So far, we have considered only a one-time deviation from a steady
       state benchmark, and shown that the latter is not optimal for the
       numerical cases shown. What then is the optimal solution? Let us
       thus turn to calculating the solution of the social planner’s problem
       and a quantitative assessment of how much welfare can be improved
       by destroying endowments.
           To solve for the optimal allocation, we formulate a dynamic pro-
       gramming problem for the social planner. Let s and ψ be the loga-
       rithms of last period’s surplus consumption ratio and the fraction of
       last period’s endowment that was consumed. The current value of
       the endowment shock is denoted ν. The optimum value of the social
       planner’s problem is then4
                              (                                                                   )
                                  exp((1 − γ)(s̃ + ψ̃))     h                                 i
       v(s, ψ, ν) = max                                 + δE exp((1 − γ)(g + ν̃))v(s̃, ψ̃, ν̃)
                   ψ̃≤0, s̃              1−γ
   4
    As in equation (9), we have rescaled the value function by leaving out the constant
terms involving −1/(1 − γ) in the preference specification, and normalized by dividing
through by exp ((1 − γ)y) where y is the current endowment.




                                                 9
where the maximization is subject to
                                                       
                 s̃ = (1 − φ)s̄ + φs + λ(s) ψ̃ − ψ + ν ,          (14)
                 ν̃ ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) .                               (15)

Since γ > 1, and if a solution to the planning problem exists, then the
value function is nonpositive, v(s, ψ, ν) ≤ 0. Note that λ(s) ≥ 0.

Proposition 1 Let γ > 1. Assume that

                  δ exp((1 − γ)g + (1 − γ)σ 2 /2) < 1             (16)

There is a solution to the social planner’s problem. The solution for
the decision on the endowment destruction is finite, ψ̃ > −∞.

    Proof: To show that there is a solution, first consider the auxil-
liary problem, restricting the domain to s ≥ s for some lower bound
s > −∞, and truncate the normal distribution | ν̃ |< ν̄. For this
problem, we claim that the optimal solution ψ̃ is bounded from below,
ψ ≥ ψ ∗ , where ψ ∗ may depend on the current state (s, ψ, ν). To see
this, note that the first term of the objective function diverges to −∞
as ψ̃ → −∞. On the other hand, the second term, i.e. the expected
future value is bounded by zero from above. Hence, the objective
function is bounded. Furthermore, Bellman’s sufficient conditions for
a contraction mapping apply, due to condition (16). Thus, there is a
unique solution to the social planner’s problem with a restricted do-
main. As the domain is expanded, standard arguments show that the
solution converges locally uniformly to a solution of the social plan-
ner’s problem stated above. •



   We will now provide a numerical solution to this problem using
Campbell and Cochrane’s monthly time scale of their parameterization
in Table 1 but without any uncertainty, ν = ν̃ = 0. The endowment


                                      10
growth shocks will be reintroduced in the next section when we assess
the quantitative importance of policy interventions.
    In delivering a numerical solution, we had to solve a challenging
problem. Consider equation (14) without random shocks, and suppose
that ψ̃ = 0, while driving ψ → −∞. Note that then s̃ → ∞. While
we have shown, that the optimum (in the previous period) occurs for
some finite value of ψ, it still may be the case, that very low ψ’s
are desirable, and, in fact, they are (in a sense to be made precise
below). Low ψ’s result in high s̃. It then takes a long time per the
autoregression in (14) to return to a range below smax . We found that
a typical optimal solution path will occasionally increase s̃ to values
just below 16, or, put differently to values S̃ = exp s̃ = 9000000. It
should be clear that value function iterations on a grid of S-values,
using e.g. a constant step size, which also is reasonably exact for the
“standard range” of S ∈ [0, Smax ], where Smax ≈ 0.09, is numerically
infeasible (and this is the sense in which ψ is “very low”). A different
numerical strategy is required.
    We solve this problem by noting that optimal consumption is equal
to endowment for all s ≥ s∗ , where s∗ is “one step” above smax ac-
cording to equation (14), i.e., where s∗ satisfies
                             1
                      s∗ =     (smax − (1 − φ)s̄) .
                             φ
Indeed, for s ≥ s∗ , one can easily calculate the number of steps it
takes to return to the region s < s∗ , where destruction of the endow-
ment might be optimal, and calculate the utility generated during the
transition path to this region.
    We impose a grid on destruction choices (1 − exp(ψ)) at step-
size ∆ exp(ψ) = 0.02 and use interpolation for s, but “storing” all
functions, using a grid for S with step size 0.0002 for S < S ∗ =
exp(s∗ ). Above S ∗ , we use a grid on log(S), using 10 grid points
between each “step” of the AR-process (14).
    The resulting decision rule is shown in figure 6. Note the unusual
shape of the decision rule that prescribes destruction of the endow-

                                   11
ment in a triangular-shaped region, with a very steep “canyon” of
destruction for S near Smax .
    Simulations, starting at Smax and no consumption destruction quickly
settle down on a regular cycle of consumption destructions, where each
cycle typically takes somewhere around 300 periods or months, i.e. ap-
proximately 25 years. By inspecting the simulations, we find that a
cycle is typically launched as follows. Coming from a high value of s,
the surplus consumption ratio eventually drops below s∗ , per iteration
on (14). Then, there is soon a first period of endowment destruction,
and after at most two additional periods, the social planner reverts to
full consumption and “launches” s to a high range again, starting the
cycle of gradual return to the below-s∗ -region.
    Besides these typical cycles with brief phases of endowment de-
struction, there are instances of cycles with more periods of destruc-
tion and time spent in the below-s∗ -region, before launching s to a
higher range. Though, we suspect that this “slow maneuvering” into
launch position is just an artifact of our numerical approximation of
calculating a value function on a grid, rather than being a feature
of the solution to the exact dynamic programming problem. Our
conjecture is supported by the following exercise. Given an initial
s ∈ [smax , s∗ ), we let the social planner make T consecutive deci-
sions on endowment destruction, while setting consumption exoge-
nously equal to the endowment forever afterwards. Thus, conditional
on a launch of s to a higher range, the payoff is approximately the
same as in the dynamic program except that we have replaced the
future continuation value when drifting below s∗ by the value of no
more endowment destruction. Since optimal cycles are on average 25
years long, this difference in distant future behavior is heavily dis-
counted and hence, should not matter much for the optimal choice of
endowment destruction during the initial launch. The computational
advantage of this T-dimensional maximization problem is that it can
be solved with standard numerical maximization routines rather than



                                 12
calculations on a grid. When solving this problem for large values of
T , we found that the optimal length of the launch phase, i.e., the time
spent in the below-s∗ -region, never exceeded three periods.


3     Quantitative importance
The findings of the previous section indicate that the recurrent de-
struction of the endowment is optimal. We now allow for random
shocks to consumption growth, using the exact monthly parameteri-
zation of Campbell and Cochrane in Table 1. Rather than solve for
the optimal policy response, we examine the welfare gains of policies
parameterized by (ψ, p), which destroy a fixed fraction (1 − exp(ψ)) ∈
[0, 1] of the endowment every p:th period, p ∈ {2, 3, . . .}. The policy
experiment starts off with an immediate destruction in the first period
and continues in perpetuity. No upper bound on the logarithm of the
surplus consumption ratio st was imposed in the calculations.
     Concerning the initial condition S−1 , we pursue two alternatives.
First, we use the steady state S−1 = S̄. Second, we draw S−1 from
the unconditional distribution depicted in Campbell and Cochrane’s
Figure 2, derived there for the continuous-time version of the model.
We simulate 100 time series of monthly endowments, where the length
of each series is 200 years. We compare the average welfare obtained
under the policy experiments of periodic destruction to the bench-
mark “laissez-faire” average welfare measure obtained from the same
simulations, when no endowment destruction takes place. The wel-
fare comparison is measured in terms of the percentage increase in
consumption needed to make the agents in the laissez-faire economy
as well as off as under the policy (ψ, p).
     Table 2 contains the results where we find large welfare gains
(rather than welfare losses) associated with the policies of periodic
destructions. Put differently, a society of agents with Campbell-
Cochrane preferences would experience a welfare gain equivalent to a


                                  13
      permanent increase of nearly 16% in consumption, if the government
      enforced one month of fasting per year, reducing consumption by 10
      percent then. Note that the government should neither be too timid
      nor too audacious in its demands of consumption reduction while fast-
      ing: the welfare gains at 15 as well as 5 percent reductions are smaller
      than at 10 percent. Either way, these welfare gains are dramatic.


      4      Habit moves negatively with consump-
      tion
      The economic intuition for the surprising finding that the agents are
      better off with a cyclical destruction of endowments is to be found
      in the implied law of motion for the external habit. Campbell and
      Cochrane (1999, p. 212) claim that habit moves nonnegatively with
      consumption everywhere. Unfortunately, this is not so. Instead, habit
      can fall contemporaneously with a rise in consumption even locally
      around the steady state. After differentiating the law of motion for
      the surplus consumption ratio in equation (3), we obtain
                            dxt+1         λ(st )
                                  =1−                 .
                            dct+1     exp(−st+1 ) − 1
      In the steady state, st = st+1 = s̄, so the parameterization of the
      function λ(s) in equation (4) guarantees that dx/dc = 0 at the steady
      state. Next, we calculate the second derivative,
                   d2 xt+1          λ(st )2
                           = −                    exp(−st+1 ) ≤ 0,
                    dc2t+1     [exp(−st+1 ) − 1]2
      and the expression is strictly negative at the steady state. This es-
      tablishes that there is a region around the steady state in which habit
      moves negatively with consumption.5
         Based on Campbell and Cochrane’s monthly frequency of their pa-
      rameterization in Table 1, Figure 7 maps out the relationship between
5
    We are thankful to John Cochrane for suggesting this exposition of our argument.


                                         14
       consumption changes and movements in the habit level. In particular,
       for a given value of last period’s surplus consumption ratio, the figure
       depicts how contemporaneous habit responds to percentage changes in
       consumption relative to last period’s levels. As a numerical reference,
       the steady-state surplus consumption ratio is 0.057. It can be seen
       that the habit level moves negatively with consumption for a wide
       range of consumption increases. Hence, our finding of large welfare
       improvements associated with the cyclical destruction of endowments
       can be understood as “investments” in a lower habit level. That is,
       a period of endowment destruction is most likely to be followed by a
       rebounce in consumption next period and this consumption growth
       will often be associated with the strange effect of lowering the habit
       level.6


       5     Conclusions
       We have shown that the habit formulation by Campbell and Cochrane
       imply, that a social planner could reap large welfare gains by destroy-
       ing 10 percent of the endowment every 12:th month. To be indifferent
       to such a policy, the representative agent would have to be compen-
       sated by almost 16 percentage points higher consumption for the in-
       definite future under laissez-faire. These welfare results are most likely
       connected with a surprising property of the C-C preference specifica-
       tion which is that habit can move negatively with consumption.
   6
     To gauge how common this unorthodox habit dynamics is in the laissez-faire econ-
omy, we use our stochastic simulations of Campbell and Cochrane’s environment in the
preceding section to construct an indicator as follows. For any period with consumption
growth in excess of the steady-state growth rate, we compute the habit level and com-
pare it to the counterfactual habit level that would have arisen if consumption had only
grown from last period at the steady-state rate. Half of all simulated periods experience
consumption growth higher than the steady-state rate; of that 50%, roughly one quarter
exhibits unorthodox habit dynamics in the sense that the habit level is reduced relative to
if consumption had only grown at the steady-state rate.


                                           15
           Our findings imply that Campbell and Cochrane’s (1999, pp. 245–
       247) attempt to map their results into a version of the model with
       internal habit formation must be reconsidered. Households faced with
       such an internal habit would themselves choose to periodically destroy
       endowments. Thus, the optimally chosen consumption process would
       not be the same as the exogenous endowment process.
           If the C-C preferences were embedded in an economy with storage
       or production, it would rationalize outcomes of consumption bunch-
       ing either chosen by households themselves under internal habit for-
       mation or through destabilizing policies by a benevolent government
       under external habit formation.7 In calculations not reported here, we
       follow Campbell and Cochrane’s (1999, p. 210) suggestion that their
       endowment economy can alternatively be closed with a linear produc-
       tion technology. Using the randomly generated endowment sequences
       in the present paper, we then find large welfare gains from storing
       roughly 10 percent of the endowment and consuming the savings in
       a consumption binge every other month. To make the households in
       a laissez-faire economy that consumes the endowment indifferent to
       such a policy, consumption would have to be raised by more than 30
       percentage points for the indefinite future.
           In sum, given the progress made in understanding asset pricing
       puzzles with the help of Campbell-Cochrane preferences, the next nat-
       ural step will be to understand the macroeconomic implications, when
       endogenizing consumption at the aggregate level and when investigat-
       ing the scope for government intervention. Our analysis has convinced
       us, that this exercise will provide interesting challenges.

   7
    By contrast, Ljungqvist and Uhlig (2000) report on how welfare can be improved
through policies of consumption stabilization under catching-up-with-the-Joneses prefer-
ences, i.e., the conventional linear external habit formulation. In a productivity-shock
driven economy, it is shown that such a consumption externality calls for an optimal tax
policy that affects the economy countercyclically via procyclical taxes, i.e., “cooling” down
the economy with higher taxes in booms and lowering taxes in recessions to stimulate the
economy.


                                            16
Appendix A
   We show that welfare cannot increase by destroying part of the
endowment along a steady-state growth path, given that the external
habit level is governed by a conventional linear law of motion;
                                              t−1
                                              X
                         a
          Xt = µXt−1 + αCt−1 = αC0a                 µj Gt−1−j + µt X0 ,
                                            j=0

where the second equality would hold along the constant growth path.
In a steady state, habit is ensured to be less than consumption if the
parameters satisfy

                               G > µ + α,                                    (17)

and habit would then grow at the rate G and result in a steady-state
ratio Xt /Ct = α/(G − µ).
    Let {Ct , Xt } denote the sequence of consumption and habit levels
in the steady state, and consider a one-time perturbation where a
fraction △ ∈ [0, 1 − α/(G − µ)) ≡ Γ of the endowment is destroyed
in period 0: C̃0 = (1 − △)C0 , C̃t = Ct for all t ≥ 1; X̃0 = X0 , X̃t =
Xt − µt−1 α△C0 for all t ≥ 1. Let Ω(△) denote the welfare associated
with a perturbation △, i.e., the preferences in (1) are evaluated at the
allocation {C̃t , X̃t }. Since Ω′′ (△) < 0 for all △ ∈ Γ, it suffices to show
that Ω′ (0) < 0 in order to establish that Ω′ (△) < 0 for all △ ∈ Γ. We
can compute
                                        ∞
                                        X
       Ω′ (0) = −(C0 − X0 )−γ C0 +            δt (Ct − Xt )−γ µt−1 αC0 .
                                        t=1

After substituting in for the steady-state allocation, a condition for
Ω′ (0) < 0 is
            ∞
            X
     −1 +         δt G−tγ µt−1 α < 0        =⇒            Gγ δ−1 > µ + α ,
            t=1

which is guaranteed to hold under our parameter restrictions (8) and
(17).

                                       17
Appendix B
   We verify that an infinitesimal endowment destruction must also
decrease welfare under the C-C preference specification;
                                   ∞
                                   X                     h        i1−γ
      W ′ (0) = (1 + λ̄)S̄ 1−γ −         δt φt−1 (1 − φ)λ̄ S̄Gt
                                   t=1
                  1 − φδG1−γ + (1 − δG1−γ )λ̄ 1−γ
              =                              S̄   > 0,
                         1 − φδG1−γ
where the convergence of the infinite sum and the strict inequality
follow from φ ∈ [0, 1) and parameter restriction (8). Thus, in the
neighborhood around the steady-state growth path, welfare is strictly
increasing in the fraction of the endowment that is consumed.

Table 2: Expected welfare gain when switching from the laissez-faire out-
come to a government policy indexed by (ψ, p), measured by the percentage
increase in consumption needed to attain the same expected utility under
no government intervention. A government policy (ψ, p) stipulates that a
fraction 1 − exp(ψ) of the endowment is destroyed every p:th month. The
numbers without parentheses refer to unconditional welfare gains where the
initial surplus consumption ratio is drawn from its unconditional distribu-
tion, and the numbers within parentheses are welfare gains conditional upon
the initial surplus consumption ratio equal to its steady-state value.

Figure 3: Welfare gain associated with a one-time endowment destruction,
measured by the permanent percentage increase in consumption needed to
attain the same utility without any destruction. Along a non-stochastic
steady-state growth path, a fraction between 0 and 25 percent of the endow-
ment is destroyed in one single period. The solid and dashed curve depict the
welfare gain associated with such a destructive policy including the utility
loss of the initial endowment destruction under the C-C habit model and the
standard habit model, respectively. Note that utility is not defined in the
standard habit model for endowment destructions that exceed the surplus
consumption ratio in the steady state, S̄ = 0.057. (Parameter values from
