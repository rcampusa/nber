The Intergenerational Effect of Worker Displacement

                                           ABSTRACT




This paper uses variation induced by firm closures to explore the intergenerational effects of worker
displacement. Using a Canadian panel of administrative data that follows almost 60,000 father-child
pairs from 1978 to 1999 and includes detailed information about the firms at which the father
worked, we construct narrow treatment and control groups whose fathers had the same level of
permanent income prior to 1982 when some of the fathers were displaced. We demonstrate that job
loss leads to large permanent reductions in family income. Comparing outcomes among individuals
whose fathers experienced an employment shock to outcomes among individuals whose fathers did
not, we find that children whose fathers were displaced have annual earnings about 9% lower than
similar children whose fathers did not experience an employment shock. They are also more likely
to receive unemployment insurance and social assistance. The estimates are driven by the
experiences of children whose family income was at the bottom of the income distribution, and are
robust to a number of specification checks.

           It is well known that children from affluent families tend to have higher incomes as

adults than children who grow up in poor families (Solon, 1992; Zimmerman, 1992). This pattern

has convinced many social scientists and policymakers that family income plays an important

role in determining children’s life chances. Duncan and Brooks-Gunn (1997), for example,

suggest that raising the incomes of poor families “…will enhance the cognitive development of

children and may improve their chances of success in the labor market during adulthood.” Policy

discussions often invoke the legacy of growing up in a poor family as evidence of the potential

effectiveness of income transfer programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children.

Despite such claims, the process that generates the intergenerational income correlation is not

well understood. One possibility is that differences in income lead to differences in parents’

monetary investments in their children. It is just as likely, however, that differences in income

reflect differences in innate parental characteristics that parents pass onto their children.

           Certainly, the magnitude of the intergenerational correlation is hard to ignore. Solon’s

(1999) survey of the intergenerational mobility literature suggests that the correlation between

fathers’ and sons’ earnings is about 0.4. At issue is the extent to which this correlation reflects

the importance of monetary vs. non-monetary family background characteristics. High income

parents are likely to have other attributes such as high ability or motivation that independently

have a positive affect on their children’s outcomes. Cross-sectional comparisons of individuals

who grew up in families with different income levels are thus likely to overstate the degree to

which family resources matter.

           This paper examines the effect of firm closings on the next generation’s outcomes.1

Jacobsen, Lalonde and Sullivan (1993) (henceforth, JLS) and Stevens (1997) have documented

that workers displaced by such events experience substantive long-lasting reductions in earnings,

and they argue that firm closings can be thought of as exogenous employment shocks after

conditioning on pre-displacement earnings. Our estimation strategy constructs narrow treatment

and control groups of individuals whose fathers had the same levels of permanent income prior to

1982 when some of the fathers were displaced, and worked in firms of similar size and industry.

Like previous studies, we demonstrate that displacement leads to permanent reductions in family

income.

          Comparing outcomes among individuals whose fathers experienced an employment

shock to outcomes among individuals whose fathers did not, we find that children whose fathers

were displaced have annual earnings that are about 9% lower than similar children whose fathers

did not experience an employment shock. They are also more likely to receive unemployment

insurance and social assistance. The estimates are driven by the experiences of children whose

family income was at the bottom of the income distribution. The results suggest that the long

term consequences of unexpected job loss extend beyond the effect on one’s own income to the

eventual labor market outcomes of one’s children.



I. Background

          Understanding which factors contribute to the intergenerational transmission of income is

crucial to the development of successful public policies. In the United States there are a number

of programs designed to help low-income children, including Temporary Assistance to Needy

Families, Medicaid, Head Start, Food Stamps, and public education. Some of these involve

income transfers whereas others are direct-intervention programs.        Mayer (1997) notes that

throughout the history of the United States social policy has swung back and forth between the

belief that material deprivation is the primary reason that poor children have poor outcomes, and

the belief that parental characteristics that contribute to low incomes are mostly responsible for

poor children’s failure. Informed social policy depends critically on understanding which of

these beliefs is correct. If, for example, money is a key determinant of children’s outcomes then

the effects of policies on family income should be a central consideration when evaluating their

costs and benefits. On the other hand, if children’s outcomes are mostly determined by innate


                                                 2
parental characteristics that are correlated with income then social policy should be less

concerned with income redistribution and focus more on addressing deficits in the other

characteristics.

        A number of cross-sectional studies show that positive income correlations remain even

after controlling for a variety of parental characteristics (e.g. Corcoran et. al, 1992; Duncan and

Hill, 1987), but these correlations are likely to overstate the degree to which parental income

matters if some parental attributes that are positively correlated with income and children’s

outcomes cannot be observed.         It is difficult to find compelling variation in income that is

unrelated to parental characteristics that might affect child development (Duncan and Brooks-

Gunn, 1997; Haveman and Wolfe, 1995).               Shea (2000), for example, uses cross-sectional

variation in fathers’ earnings due to union status, industry wage differentials and involuntary job

loss to identify the effects of parental income, but other researchers (Dickens and Katz, 1987;

Gibbons and Katz, 1992; Lee, 1978) have argued that wage differences associated with these job

characteristics reflect workers’ innate attributes.       Dahl and Lochner (2004) also create an

instrument for income that includes family background characteristics (as well as changes in

income induced by the Earned Income Tax Credit).2 Mayer (1997) controls for unobserved

parental characteristics by adding to her regression a measure of parental income taken after the

child’s outcome is observed. She argues that future income is exogenous with respect to a

previously measured outcome, so that it can serve as a proxy for the unmeasured components of

family background. The success of this strategy requires that parental investment when the child

is still at home is not influenced by the anticipation of future income, however. Blau (1999),

Duncan, et. al. (1998) and Levy and Duncan (1999) all compare outcomes across siblings with

different age-specific family income levels, but this approach can only identify the effect of




2
 The extent to which Dahl and Lochner’s identification is driven by the EITC vs. these other family
background characteristics is unclear to us.


                                                    3
transitory changes in family income and it has been well documented that permanent income has

a much stronger relationship with children’s long-term outcomes (Solon, 1999).3

         Most existing studies that explore the effects of family resources on offspring’s outcomes

have been based on longitudinal datasets such as the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the

National Longitudinal Study of Youth, which are relatively small. It has turned out to be difficult

to precisely identify parental income effects with so little data. The confidence interval around

Shea’s IV estimate of the effect of father’s earnings on children’s earnings, for example, includes

effects ranging from approximately -30% to 30%. Solon’s (1999) comparison of sibling and

intergenerational earnings correlations suggests that no more than 40% of the similarity in

brothers’ outcomes is likely due to factors related to their parents’ income. While this leaves open

the possibility that family income plays an important role in children’s development it also

suggests that when the data are limited to only a few thousand observations the effect may not be

strong enough to estimate precisely.

         This paper makes several contributions to the growing literature on intergenerational

income mobility. First, by exploiting variation that is induced by firm closings, we can separate

the effect of a long-lasting income shock from the effect of innate parental attributes. While

cross-sectional differences in fathers’ labor market characteristics are likely to reflect individual

attributes, our longitudinal data allow us to construct narrow groups of “treatment” and “control”

children whose families look identical before 1982, when some of the fathers lost their jobs. We

base our analysis on a sample of children whose fathers worked continuously for the same firm

between 1978 and 1981, and control for average family income, regional location, industry, and


3
  A very different approach is taken by Acemoglu and Pischke (2001) who use long-run trends in earnings
levels at different points in the U.S. earnings distribution (and in different geographic regions) to generate
exogenous income variation. They find that demographic groups with more sharply rising incomes also
experienced larger increases in their children’s educational attainment. One puzzle with these results is
that, in their preferred specification, the return to education has no significant effect on college enrollment
decisions. This may reflect the fact that their framework makes it difficult to control for both the current
return to education and the change in parental income, since both are driven by the same national trends in
returns to skill. The rise in return to skill should affect children’s education directly, and so their strategy
may not provide a valid instrument for changes in parental income.


                                                        4
firm size during those four years. Thus, we are able to compare outcomes across children whose

families would likely have had the same level of permanent income if the treatment fathers had

not been displaced.           A second advantage of our study is that it makes use of a longitudinal

dataset that contains earnings and income observations on almost 60,000 father-son pairs. The

sheer magnitude of this dataset substantially increases the precision with which intergenerational

relationships can be estimated.



II. Empirical Strategy

           We conduct our analysis in two stages. In the first stage, we use methods developed in

the displacement literature to demonstrate that displacement has a substantive and long-lasting

effect on a family’s resources. The purpose of this part of the analysis is to make a convincing

case that displacement produces an exogenous shock to family income. In the second stage, we

use this information to identify the intergenerational effect of a family income shock.



II.A. Estimating the Effect of Displacement on a Family’s Resources

           We begin by following the empirical strategy introduced by JLS, and demonstrate that

displacement has a large, persistent effect on a family’s monetary resources.                    We start by

regressing annual measures of family income, father’s income and father’s earnings on a full set

of father’s age fixed effects and a set of province by year dummy variables.4 The residual from

this regression provides an annual estimate of family resources that is purged of life-cycle effects,

province specific business-cycle effects and province-specific trends in earnings. We then regress

this residual on a set of dummy variables indicating whether the father left his firm because the

firm closed in a current, future or previous year. Specifically, given longitudinal data on fathers’

labor market experiences, the effect of displacement on a family’s resources is modeled in the

following way:

4
    The province fixed effect is determined in the initial year the father is observed (1978).


                                                         5
ln I ipt = Dipt δ + α i + u ipt                                      (1)

where ln Iipt is the log of the residual of family i’s resources in province p and year t, and Dipt is a

vector of dummy variables indicating that a displacement has taken (or will take) place in a

future, current, or previous year. The error term has two components, a family-specific fixed

effect, α i , and a random component, u ipt . Since the model includes fixed effects, individual

characteristics that do not vary over time, such as race and education, are not included.

         The vector of displacement indicators (Dipt) contains three types of variables: dummy

variables that equal one in the years prior to the displacement, a dummy variable equal to one in

the year that the father loses his job, and a series of dummy variables indicating that a

displacement took place in a previous year. The first set of indicator variables captures the

possibility that the father’s wages may begin to deteriorate prior to the actual displacement. This

might happen if wages are cut when the firm hits difficult times: failure to include these

dummies would lead to a biased estimate of the effect of the displacement. Our model, therefore,

includes a dummy variable for each of the three years before the job loss occurs. The dummy

variable indicating the year of the displacement captures its immediate effect on family resources,

whereas the coefficients on the set of variables indicating that a displacement occurred in a

previous year will reflect the persistence of the displacement effect over time. We follow the

post-displacement period for eight years, including a dummy variable indicating that eight or

more years have elapsed since the displacement took place. An eight year reduction in family

resources comprises a significant fraction of the time a child is growing up, though most of the

children in our sample will no longer be living at home at the end of the eight year period.

         The error term in the above equation contains a time-invariant family-specific effect, α i ,

which measures average resources net of displacement. By including this fixed effect, we are

able to separate variation in resources that is likely to be correlated with unobserved parental

characteristics from variation due to a random shock.             At the same time, the series of



                                                   6
displacement dummies allows us to trace out the economic consequences in each year following

the job loss and to estimate both the short-term and long-term effects, which may differ.

        As will be discussed in Section III.B. the results from this exercise show that

displacement substantively reduces family resources for many years. In order to facilitate our

subsequent analyses, we will also estimate the effect of displacement using a version of equation

(1) that replaces the individual fixed effect with the average of family income between 1978 and

1980 (which is at least two years before any displacements occur) and replaces the vector of

displacement dummies with a single indictor for whether or not a displacement has occurred in

the last five years or will occur in the next two years:

ln I ipt = Shock ipt δ + φAvgInc78−80 + u ipt                                     (2)

where AvgInc is the family’s (or father’s) average income or earnings between 1978 and 1980,

and Shock is a dummy variable equal to 1 if a displacement occurs during the displacement

window described above. The coefficient on the Shock dummy indicates the average effect of

displacement on family income over the years we study. The estimates produced by equations 1-

2 will inform us about the magnitude and persistence of the economic losses that result from

displacement.



II.B. Estimating the Effect of Displacement on Children’s Outcomes

        After documenting that job loss leads to a large, persistent decline in resources, we next

use information about whether a child’s father lost his job to identify the effect of an income

shock on children’s long-term economic outcomes. In this part of our analysis, we regress a

measure of the child’s economic well-being on average family income between 1978 and 1980

and the Shock dummy.

Oi = a + bAvgInc78−80 + cShock i + ε i                                            (3)




                                                   7
where Oi represents an economic outcome for child i.                Thus we compare outcomes across

children whose parents experienced a job loss to outcomes for those whose parents did not,

controlling for family income in the pre-displacement years. We also include a number of

additional firm, region, and industry control variables that will be discussed in the next section.

The key to this identification strategy is the assumption that after conditioning on fathers with

similar income, in similar firms, industries, and regions, the families that experienced a

displacement were ex ante no different from those who did not.



III. Data

         Our analysis is based on data from the Intergenerational Income Database (IID), which is

maintained by the Family and Labour Studies Division of Statistics Canada. The IID links tax

information on children born between 1963 and 1970 to data on their parents, for all years

between 1978 and 1999. The links were made possible using the T1 Family File (T1FF) of the

Small Area and Administrative Data Division of Statistics Canada.

         The T1FF is a data set of individual tax records that has been processed in a way that

matches members of each tax filer’s family. The primary way in which children are matched to

their parents is through their name and address. In order to be identified as living in the same

family, the child must file from the same address as the parent at least once during a five year

period beginning when the child is 16-19 years of age. Evidence presented in Oreopolous (2003)

suggests that this matching process picks up most adolescents in Canada. Younger children are

more likely to be living at home, but less likely to file a tax return.5 All Canadians must file a tax

return if they pay income tax in that year, and if they claim unemployment insurance benefits, a

nonrefundable tuition tax credit or the monthly deduction for enrollment in a full-time education

program. Since a child need only file once over a five year period in order to be included in the

5
  Note that a child may live away from home but still file from a parent’s address, and thus be included in
the IID. Children who are away at college fall into this category.


                                                     8
sample, the vast majority of children make it into the IID. From the 1981 Canadian census, 96

percent of 17 year olds lived with a parent and 53 percent received non-transfer income in the

previous year. Over 80 percent of 20 year olds lived with a parent, for and 73 percent of them

received non-transfer income. Oreopoulos reports that the database includes 72 percent of youth

who were 16-19 in 1982, 1984 or 1986 (the years in which the matches took place).

        One way of exploring the representativeness of our sample is to compare the income

distribution for children later in life to the income distribution for the same cohorts in the Census.

Figure 1 plots 1995 income distributions for 25-33 year olds in the IID and the 1996 Census. It is

clear that the IID misses a fraction of children who ultimately end up at the low end of the income

distribution. In Section IV, we show that this is the group for whom our results are strongest,

however, so it is likely that, if anything, this omission biases our estimates towards zero.

        We have also examined whether there are differences in family size between those

households with fathers who worked in firms that closed vs. those that did not. If there is

selection into our treatment and control groups we might expect to see a correlation between

family size (based on the number of children matching to the parents) and the corresponding

father’s displacement category. We do not find this. In 1982, the average number of children

aged 12 to 19 per family is 1.81 among those whose fathers are classified as displaced, and 1.82

among those whose fathers are not.

        The IID provides detailed administrative data on the incomes of children and their

matched parents from 1978 to 1999. It also includes information on their age, gender, marital

status, family composition, and residential address as well as an identification number for the firm

at which the individual is employed. This ID number is used to match fathers in the IID to

information about their firms from Statistics Canada’s Longitudinal Employment Analysis

Program database (LEAP). LEAP is a company-level database that includes all employers in

Canada, both corporate and unincorporated. The database tracks the employment and payroll




                                                  9
characteristics of individual firms from their year of entry to their year of exit.6 Employers in

Canada are required to register a payroll deduction account and issue a T4 slip to each employee

that summarizes earnings received in a given fiscal year. The LEAP database includes every

business that issues a T4 taxation slip.

        Only those already in the IID are matched to the LEAP firm identification number. Firm

size is calculated as the number of fathers in the same firm in a given year. An internal match to

the full LEAP database at Statistics Canada indicates the average ratio between total firm size and

total father firm size for firms identified in the IID is 9.9. Thus, on average, the IID contains

approximately a one-in-ten (non-random) sample of all employees in firms matched in both the

IID and the LEAP database. Our sample also includes a 3 digit industry code for each firm and

province location of firm’s head office.

        The longitudinal nature of the matched IID allows firm entry and exit to be identified on

an annual basis. A firm closure is assigned in a given year if there are no IID fathers working at

the firm in any following year (through 1999).7 In order to distinguish true closures from

company reorganizations that lead to new identification codes, however, we do not count a firm

as being closed if 35% or more of its workers move to the same “new” firm.8 9

        Our main sample is limited to individuals who were between the ages of 12 and 14 in

1982. Information on older children is available in the IID, but we do not include these children

because they are likely to have left home shortly after the displacement occurred. Information on


6
  Self-employed persons who do not draw a salary are not included on the LEAP database. In addition,
businesses comprised solely of individuals or partnerships who do not draw a salary are also excluded from
the LEAP.
7
  This may lead to some misclassifications. For example, if a firm disappears in 1983, we will identify the
closing year as 1982. In some cases, the firm may have closed early enough in 1983 that it did not file T-4
slips.
8
  We examined the sensitivity of the results around this threshold using alternative values of 15 and 50
percent. Coefficient estimates for the main tables were similar. The standard errors were somewhat larger
for the 15 percent threshold.
9
  We also explored displacement through mass layoffs. Identifying mass-layoffs is more difficult than firm
closures because we can only observe what fraction of the firm leaves in between years, and this fraction
depends on the firm’s size. Firms can choose who leaves and for this reason we chose to focus on firm
closures.


                                                    10
younger children is not available. Children whose fathers are missing tax data are eliminated

because without the tax data we cannot observe fathers’ earnings, place of employment or labor

market status. This restriction reduces the sample of fathers by about 11 percent. We also restrict

the sample to children whose fathers were between the ages of 30 and 50 in 1978. This ensures

that we are focusing on fathers whose incomes would have been relatively stable: earnings of

young workers tend to be more volatile than those of workers who are over 30, and Stevens

(1997) shows that the long-term effects of displacement are largest for workers with more years

of tenure.

        We also restrict our main sample to fathers who are initially working at firms that

employed between 2 and 500 men (in the IID). We require that the firm employ at least 2 fathers

because one-father firms will include self-employed fathers, and in order to reduce the possibility

of mislabeling as displaced, men who voluntarily left small firms. An upper bound of 500 is

chosen because closures at larger firms are extremely rare, and we were concerned that including

such firms would introduce heterogeneity across the treatments and controls. Wage premiums are

associated with large firms. Finally, we eliminate children whose fathers earned more than

$1,000,000 (measured in 1999 dollars) in a single year, in order to be sure that our estimates are

not driven by outliers.

        The treatment group consists of 12 to 14 year olds whose fathers experienced a

displacement in 1982. Our primary control group consists of individuals whose fathers stayed

with the firm through 1982, but who may have left after that. Fifty-six percent of fathers in this

control group remained at the same firm until at least 1988. As part of our sensitivity analysis,

we explore the consequences of including early leavers in our sample. We also show that the

early exit rate (before 1982) is not correlated with closure in 1982, a finding similar to that of

Hamermesh and Pfann (1996).

        Our analysis focuses on the effects of displacements that occurred in 1982. Choosing this

date allows us to base our sample on the children of fathers who had at least four years of tenure


                                                11
at the firm, while maximizing the number of years the children would be likely to be living at

home after the displacement occurs.          Another advantage of focusing on displacements that

occurred in 1982 is that it was the beginning of a substantial and prolonged recession in Canada

so that the number of displacement events is high.

         The IID includes information on three socioeconomic outcomes: earnings, receipt of

unemployment benefits, and receipt of social assistance.           We use information that is available

between 1995 and 1999 to create three dependent variables: the log of a five-year earnings

average, an indicator for whether the individual received unemployment insurance during the five

year period, and an indicator for whether the individual received social assistance during the five

year period. Since earnings generally increase with age, we adjust our earnings measure by

regressing it on a set of age dummies and use the residual as our dependent variable.



IV. Results

IV.A. Summary Statistics

         Sample summary statistics are shown in Table 1.                 Appendix Table A.1 includes

additional information about the firms in our sample. As described above, most of our analysis

focuses on children whose fathers were employed at firms with between 2 and 500 fathers. Our

sample contains 54,145 fathers, 1,541 of whom experienced a firm closure in 1982. These men

worked at 14,857 different firms, 509 of which closed during 1982.10 Control fathers remained

with the same firm between 1978 and 1982.

         Table 1 shows separate statistics for our treatment and control groups. Fathers’ average

age, income and earnings are initially very similar across the two groups, but by 1988, six years

after treatment fathers have lost their jobs, the labor market characteristics of the two groups are

10
  The control group in the main sample may include fathers displaced after 1982. The fraction of
displaced workers in the control, however, is likely to be small. We also considered an alternative control
group that remained in the same firm between 1978 and 1988 and produced similar results with this group
than with the control group we use here. The control group in our main sample is free to leave old and
enter new firms, whether such a move occurs for positive or negative reasons.


                                                    12
quite different.      Average earnings of displaced fathers are roughly $43,000, while the average

earnings of the control fathers are roughly $49,000. Not surprisingly, the displaced fathers are

also much more likely to be receiving unemployment insurance.11                 Table 1 thus provides some

initial evidence that firm closings generate substantial shocks to a family’s economic status. At

the same time, these shocks do not appear to affect other family background characteristics:

fathers’ marital status and mothers’ income, for example are very similar for the treatment and

control groups in both 1978 and 1988.

           Table 1 also shows that treatment and control children have somewhat different labor

market outcomes. For example, average earnings between 1995 and 1998 are about $21,000

among those whose fathers experienced a job loss and $23,000 for those whose fathers did not.

Similarly, treatment children have higher rates of UI and SA receipt than the controls.

           The last column of Table 1 provides these descriptive statistics for all individuals in the

IID who were 12-14 years old in 1982. Average family income is comparable, though slightly

higher for these children. Otherwise, the samples are very similar.



IV.B. The Monetary Costs of Displacement

           In this section we document that displacement leads to a substantive long-term reduction

in family resources. We begin by graphing the average earnings trajectories of treatment and

control fathers. Our earnings measure is the residual from a regression of earnings on age and

province/year fixed effects, which allows us to abstract from life-cycle trends and province-

specific business cycles. Figure 2A makes clear that prior to 1982 the two groups experienced

virtually identical earnings trajectories, lending weight to our hope that the treatment and control

children come from similar backgrounds. At the same time we see that displacement produces a

large and persistent shock to earnings. Both of these findings are necessary to our identification

strategy. Figure 2B tells a similar story. Here we plot kernel density estimates of the earnings

11
     Information on social assistance receipt is not available prior to 1992.


                                                        13
distributions for the two groups.       The distributions are very similar prior to 1982, but after 1982

the distribution among displaced fathers is shifted substantially to the left.
                                                                                           12
           We see a similar pattern when we look at receipt of UI (Figure 2C).                  As expected,

displaced fathers experience a spike in benefit receipt in 1982, and by 1983, almost 40 percent of

displaced father’s are receiving UI benefits. UI use falls thereafter, but gradually, and never to

the average levels of the non-displaced group. We also note that UI receipt rises in 1982 and

1983 among the control fathers. Some of these fathers may have been displaced from firms that

did not meet our definition of a closure, or they may have claimed UI without being laid off.

           Table 2 presents the results from our regressions of fathers’ annual earnings and income

on the displacement dummies. Columns 1 through 3 show estimates based on equation (1) using

father’s earnings, father’s income, and parental income as the dependent variables. Like previous

studies, we find that family resources decline substantially when a job loss occurs. For example,

in the year following a job loss, father’s earnings fall by 30%, father’s income falls by 19%, and

parental income falls by 13%.13        14
                                            Family resources recover somewhat over time, but even 8

years later earnings are approximately 15% lower than they would have been if the displacement

had not occurred. Similarly, the two income measures are reduced by 8 and 9 percent. These

estimates are all statistically significant, and indicate that displacement produces substantive and

persistent economic losses. They are similar to the estimates produced by JLS.

           The first 3 rows of Table 2 also show what happens to family resources in the years prior

to the displacement. As foreshadowed in Figure 1, there is no evidence that earnings or income

begin to deteriorate prior to the job loss. The coefficient estimates are small and precisely

estimated.      This suggests that pre-displacement income can be included in our subsequent

analysis as a control for permanent income.

12
     UI receipt is zero between 1978-1981, when the father was working at the same firm.
                                                       δ
13
  The percentage effect on earnings is computed as e − 1.
14
  A firm closure can occur anytime during the year. The fathers in our sample may, therefore, lose their
job anytime between early January and late December. As a result, spells of unemployment and earnings
losses may be larger in the year following the displacement than in the displacement year itself.


                                                     14
         The last three columns of Table 2 provide the estimates produced by estimation of

equation (2).      This paired-down version of equation (1) summarizes the monetary effect of

displacement in a single coefficient, which is convenient for the second stage of the analysis.

Similar to the first three columns of the table, the estimates suggest that men who lost their jobs

in 1982 experienced permanent reductions in earnings and income of about 14%.15



IV.C. Intergenerational Effects of Displacement

         Having established that displacement substantially reduces family resources, we now

investigate whether it produces intergenerational effects. Table 3 displays the results from this

second stage of our analysis. Dependent variables include the log of average earnings between

1995 and 1999, a dummy variable indicating whether the child filed for unemployment benefits

between 1995 and 1999, and a dummy variable indicating whether she filed for social assistance

between 1995 and 1999. Column 1 shows the results produced by an OLS regression of the log

of child’s earnings on the log of father’s income between 1978 and 1980. Sample variation in

this variable is likely to reflect variation in other family background characteristics though Figure

1 suggests that characteristics correlated with family income are unlikely to differ much between

the treatment and control children. The estimated coefficient of 0.38 is consistent with the

intergenerational correlations literature, which generally finds that the correlation between

American fathers’ and sons’ earnings is about 0.40.16




15
   The estimates presented in Table 2 could be biased if displaced workers have unobserved characteristics
that not only lower their earnings levels, but also their rate of earnings growth. In order to address this
concern, we have also re-estimated equation (1) including father-specific time trends (equation 2). The
results are very similar. Since the inclusion of person-specific trends does not appear to alter our estimates,
we exclude these trends from the rest of our analyses.
16
   The correlation is significantly higher than that estimated for Canada by Corak and Heisz (1999). Some
of the difference can be explained by our more selective sample of fathers in medium-sized firms for at
least 5 years. Our correlation falls to 0.35 without this selection. Our correlation further reduces to 0.30
when keeping only sons and daughters aged 29 to 31 (which corresponds to Corak and Heisz’ sample), and
falls further to 0.28 when only looking at sons. Corak and Heisz find a correlation of about 0.25.


                                                     15
        In the next column we include only a dummy variable indicating whether the father lost

his job due to a plant closing. This variable has a powerful effect on the child’s earnings, which

are 8% lower than the earnings of those whose fathers were not displaced.            Remarkably, this

estimate barely changes even when we control for father’s pre-1981 income (column 3).

Furthermore, the point estimate on the log of pre-1981 income is robust to the inclusion of the

displacement dummy. Taken together, these results suggest that our treatment and control groups

are well-matched.

        Column 4 adds firm-level controls to our model, including a quartic in father’s firm size,

the median wage, and 11 industry fixed effects. If the inclusion of these controls alters the

estimated displacement coefficient then we should be concerned about the possible influence of

family background characteristics. We also include 36 dummies indicating region of residence

and urban/rural status, since firm closings that occur in company towns may have long lasting

effects on local labor market conditions (Flint, Michigan comes to mind). If individuals tend to

stay in the same location where they grew up then the displacement coefficient may partly reflect

the fact that firm closings depress wages in the local economy.          The estimated displacement

coefficient is not changed by the addition of these controls, however. Furthermore, the estimates

are robust to the inclusion of fixed effects that capture even more finely defined industry

categories, such as at the three digit industry level.

        The remainder of Table 3 shows what happens when we replace the dependent variable

with indicators for whether the child received unemployment benefits or social assistance. These

specifications also suggest that children whose parents experienced a job loss have worse

economic outcomes than those whose parents did not. We find that children whose fathers were

displaced are two percentage points more likely to receive unemployment benefits (though this is

not statistically significant), and 3 percentage points more likely to receive social assistance as

adults than those whose fathers remained at the same firm through 1982. The mean level of

social assistance receipt in the second generation is 0.10, so this estimated effect is very large.


                                                  16
        We have also repeated the analysis separately for boys and girls. While the results are

not shown, they are very similar to those for the full sample, though the point estimates for girls

are much less precisely estimated. The noisiness of the girls’ estimates is undoubtedly driven by

the fact that many women in their 20’s and 30’s choose not to work, or to work fewer hours while

they are raising children, and not because they have poor labor market options. Women with no

earnings between 1995 and 1999 are not observed.

        Table 4 shows the sensitivity of the base line results from including more detailed region

and industry fixed effects at the time of displacement. These estimates explore whether the main

results simply capture local or region-specific shocks that affect everyone in these categories, not

just those displaced. The analysis focuses on displacement effects within detailed region-industry

groups. Keeping observations where at least one displaced father is matched to another non-

displaced father within a region-industry category produced similar results.

        The baseline estimates for the intergenerational effects of displacement on earnings,

unemployment receipt, and social assistance receipt are shown again in columns 1, 4, and 7

respectively. These results include 1-digit initial industry and initial province by urban-rural

status fixed effects. The second set of columns (2, 5, and 8) include 317 3-digit industry

categories. The estimated displacement effect increases slightly from -.086 to -.103 (while the

standard error increases slightly). If we further condition on 180 local regions by controlling for

the first 2-alphanumeric digits of the father’s postal code of initial residence, the point estimate

stays about the same, at -.094, although the effect is significant only at the 10 percent level. The

coefficients from estimating the displacement effects separately by fathers in rural or urban

(Census Metropolitan Areas) also leads to similar point estimates.

        The fall in annual income for children appears too large to attribute solely to the decline

in family income from displacement.        Table 2 suggests that the average effect of father’s

displacement on his own log earnings is approximately .14. The corresponding reduction in the

second generation’s earnings is about .08. This would imply that a one dollar reduction in


                                                17
father’s permanent earnings leads to a subsequent reduction in his son’s earnings of 34 cents.

This is a very large effect, although the standard error estimate is also large.

        Job loss is likely to impact the family in other ways than on income. Displacement

disrupts the routine of everyday family life and may increase feelings of stress and anxiety.

Spouses may try to compensate for the loss in income by working more. Lower income levels or

subsequent re-employment could also be associated with residential moves, which are thought to

have a negative impact on children (McLanahan and Sandefur, 1994). We explore some of these

possibilities in Table 5 by estimating the effects of displacement on father’s marital status and

unemployment, mother’s earnings, and residential mobility. We can also examine whether the

inclusion of these variables affects the estimated effect of displacement on children’s outcomes.

        Column 1 provides, at best, weak evidence that fathers who lost their jobs are more likely

to be divorced than fathers who did not lose their jobs. Two years after a firm closure, treatment

fathers are 1.5 percentage points more likely to have divorced than control fathers, but the gap

soon disappears, as the divorce rate among the control group rises for other reasons. We find

stronger evidence of effects of displacement on residential mobility. Compared to children whose

fathers are able to keep their jobs, displaced children are about 4 percentage points more likely to

have moved in the short run and about 2 percentage points more likely to move in the long run.

Unemployment insurance use is clearly higher among fathers displaced in 1982, even 8 years

later. There is no evidence of a change in mother’s earnings following the father’s displacement.

        Table 6 shows that divorce and residential mobility do not seem to explain any part of the

displacement effects we estimate. Here we report results of regressions of kid’s outcomes on

family income prior to the job loss, the displacement dummy, and indicators for whether the

parents divorce or move. The displacement effects are very similar to those shown in Table 3,

suggesting that they are not driven by either divorce or residential mobility in the aftermath of

displacement.




                                                  18
           An alternative way of investigating the possibility that our displacement effects are

generated by factors unrelated to income is to add the log of average earnings between 1982 and

1988 to our basic specification:

     Oi = β 1 + β 2 AvgInc 78 −80 + β 3 AvgInc82 −88 + β 4 Shock i + ε i .      (4)

The estimates of β 3 and β 4 allow us to separate the displacement effect into an income

component and a part that is unrelated to income. The results of this exercise, which are

displayed in Table 7, suggest that the displacement effect is driven almost entirely by changes in

income. The inclusion of post-displacement income leads to a dramatic fall in the estimated

displacement coefficient, which is no longer statistically different from zero. At the same time,

the estimated effect of post-displacement income on child’s earnings is substantive. One needs to

be careful in interpreting this coefficient because differences in father’s 1983-1988 income,

controlling for displacement, may be driven by variation in unobserved characteristics. The

estimates in Table 7, however, are not consistent with a large portion of the displacement effects

being driven by non-monetary factors.

           Next, we consider how the displacement effects vary across the income distribution.

Since the financial constraints and associated stress that accompany a job loss are likely to be

larger for low income families, we expect that the intergenerational displacement effects will be

largest for individuals who grew up in less affluent families.17 An advantage of basing our

analysis on such a large dataset is that we can investigate this issue directly. In Table 8 we

present displacement estimates separately by the family’s (initial) income quartile.                   The

displacement effects appear to be concentrated among those families for whom father’s earnings

are in the lowest quartile. Among children in this group subsequent earnings are 17% lower than

they would have been if the father had not been displaced, and the probability of social assistance


17
   For example, Coelli (2004) finds that low income teenagers whose parents experience a job loss are less
likely to attend college, and virtually all of this affect is concentrated among parents with only a high
school education or less


                                                      19
and UI receipt are 4 and 6 percentage points higher. In contrast, there is no evidence that there is

any intergenerational effect among families in the top two quartiles. This finding may provide

some insight as to why previous studies have failed to find income effects on the next generation:

small sample sizes make it difficult to estimate nonlinear effects, yet virtually all of the action

appears to be at the bottom of the income distribution.



IV.D. Robustness Checks

        In the remainder of the paper we discuss several exercises that are designed to examine

the sensitivity of our results to model specification and variable definitions. First, we investigate

whether job losses that occur after children have left home have the same intergenerational effects

as those that occur when the children are younger.         A father’s displacement should have a

smaller psychological and financial effect on individuals who are no longer living in the

household, so estimates of the same magnitude may be a sign that the displacement coefficient is

picking up the effects of unobserved family background characteristics.

        We investigate this possibility by aging our sample of children to 1989 and estimating the

intergenerational effects of parental displacements that occur in that year. By 1989 our sample

of children is between the ages of 19 and 21 and should be less sensitive to a parental job loss. In

Table 9 we see the results from this exercise. Labor market outcomes are measured for the same

cohorts of children whom we followed in Table 3, but by 1989 these children were 19-21 years

old. As in Table 3, children’s earnings and benefit receipt are measured between 1995 and 1999.

Unlike Table 3, however, we see no evidence that parental job loss affects the next generation’s

outcomes: the estimated coefficient on the displacement variable is 0.008, which is dramatically

lower than the estimated displacement effect at younger ages, and it is not statistically different

from zero.       Similarly, the estimated effect on children’s social assistance receipt is not

statistically significant. This finding is particularly noteworthy because father’s earnings losses

following a 1989 displacement are even larger than those following a job loss in 1982: fathers


                                                 20
who were displaced in 1989 experience short term earnings declines that are nearly double those

experienced by fathers who lost their jobs in 1982.

        Finally, we consider the possibility that our results are driven by heterogeneity across

workers who leave firms before they close and those who are displaced at the time the firm shuts

down. Our sample includes the latter, but not the former. One concern is that those who leave a

firm before it closes are more able to obtain alternative jobs than those who stay until the firm

shuts down. In this case our estimates would reflect only the experiences of children whose

fathers are least likely to recover from displacement. We explore this possibility in Tables 10 and

11, where we extend our sample to include children whose fathers left the firm after 1979. Table

10 compares demographic characteristics in 1978 for those fathers who left the firm before it shut

down in 1982 to those who were displaced by the firm closure. There is no evidence that “early

leavers” have higher incomes, are of different ages, or have different marriage propensities than

those who remain in the firm until it closes. Table 11 shows the results of IV regressions in

which we use an indicator for whether or not the firm closed in 1982 as an instrument for whether

the father was displaced in 1982.        As we would expect, this instrument has strong predictive

power: the first stage coefficient estimate is highly significant, and indicates that working in a

firm that closes in 1982 increases the probability of leaving the firm in 1982 by 80%. Also as

expected, the reduced form regressions (not shown) of the child’s outcome on whether the firm

his father worked at in 1978 closed in 1982 produces smaller coefficient estimates than the

estimated effects of displacement, but the IV estimates are of similar magnitude to those in Table

3, and retain their statistical significance.



V. Conclusions

        This paper provides new evidence on the transmission of economic status across

generations. While the existence of large intergenerational income correlations has lead many

researchers to conclude that family income is an important determinant of children’s eventual


                                                  21
economic success, the evidence in support of this hypothesis is surprisingly limited. Previous

research has been hampered by small sample sizes and the difficult task of controlling for

unobserved parental attributes. Because we exploit longitudinal variation that is induced by firm

closings we are able to separate the effect of a long-lasting income shock from the effect of innate

parental attributes. Our access to a dataset that contains nearly 60,000 father/child pairs aids our

ability to identify this effect.

         We find that the adult earnings of children whose fathers were displaced are 8% lower

than earnings of similar individuals whose fathers did not experience an employment shock, even

after we account for fathers’ pre-displacement earnings, initial region of work, industry and firm

size. Relative to children whose fathers did not lose their jobs, children of displaced workers are

also more likely to receive unemployment insurance and social assistance. Our estimates are

driven almost exclusively by the experiences of individuals whose family income during

childhood was in the bottom quartile of the income distribution. The results suggest that the long

term consequences of unexpected job loss extend beyond the effect on one’s own income to the

eventual labor market outcomes of one’s children.

         The interpretation of these results relies on the quality of the control group. Our analysis

assumes that the labor market experiences of control fathers provide an appropriate counterfactual

for what would have happened to the treatment fathers if the displacement had not occurred. Put

differently, we assume that conditional on 1978-1981 earnings and the other firm characteristic

and region control variables, the likelihood that a job loss occurs is the same for the treatment and

control groups. The fact that pre-displacement labor market characteristics are virtually identical

for the two groups is a promising sign that we have successfully controlled for innate family

background characteristics, but if treatment and control families differ in ways that affect the

second generation’s economic outcomes without affecting the economic outcomes of the parents,

then our displacement effects will not be identified.          It is hard to imagine what such

characteristics would be, however.


                                                 22
        Finally, it is important to note that our estimation strategy captures the full effect of

displacement. We have demonstrated that job loss leads to large, long lasting reductions in a

family’s monetary resources, but it may also impose non-monetary costs (such as stress, or

residential mobility) on the family that affect the children’s long-run outcomes. If the non-

monetary costs of displacement are substantial, our results could overstate the effect of a pure

income shock. Suggestive evidence points to income as the major avenue through which

displacement affects families, however.

        The intergenerational effects of displacement estimated here point to the possibility that,

particularly among the lowest income families, lasting reductions in family income can have

substantial negative effects on children.     This has not been a common finding in previous

investigations of the causal link between parental income and children’s outcomes.               The

qualitative difference between our findings and those in the earlier literature are likely to be

related to three factors: our use of a large sample that allows for precise estimation of effects; the

fact that displacement produces quite large and persistent reductions in family resources; and our

ability to look at differential effects of the income shock across the income distribution.

Note: Sample consists of all father-child pairs for which the child was between
12 and 14 in 1982 and the father worked at a firm with between 2 and 500
fathers in the IID. Fathers must have worked at the same firm for four years
(between 1978 and 1981) and received no unemployment insurance during that
time. The 'closures' sample includes fathers displaced from a firm that closes in
1982. Standard Deviations are in parenthesis.

Note: Sample consists of all father-child pairs for which the child was between 12 and 14 in
1982 and the father worked at a firm with between 2 and 500 fathers in the IID. Fathers mus
have worked at the same firm for four years (between 1978 and 1981) and received no
unemployment insurance during that time. The 'closures' sample includes fathers displaced
from a firm that closes in 1982. Standard Deviations are in parenthesis.

Note: Columns 1 through 3 show regressions using as dependent variables log father's annual earnings
and log total income (both demeaned by age and year). The regressors are individual fixed effects and
indicator variables for years since job displacement for fathers in firms that closed (the omitted category is
not displaced or displacement in at least 3 years. Columns 4 through 6 show results from regressing the
same dependent variables on average log earnings between 1978 and 1981, and a dummy variable for
whether a father is displaced in 1982.

 Note: The dependent variable in columns 1-4 is child's log real earnings averaged between 1995 and 1999 after de-meaning by age. All regressions include fixed effects for birth cohort interacted
 with gender. The initial firm characteristic controls include fixed effects for regional location of firm (18 possible characters that identify provinces and smaller regions in large provinces)
 interacted with an indicator variable for whether the firm is in an urban or rural location. The controls also include 11 industry categories and the median log wage of the initial firm in 1978. Huber-
 White standard errors are shown from clustering by father ID.

 Notes: The dependent variable in columns 1-4 is child's log real earnings averaged between 1995 and 1999 after de-meaning by age. All regressions include fixed effects for birth cohort interacted with gender. The
 initial firm characteristic controls include fixed effects for regional location of firm interacted with an indicator variable for whether the firm is in an urban or rural location. The controls also include 11 industry
 categories and the median log wage of the initial firm in 1978. Huber-White standard errors are shown from clustering by father ID.
