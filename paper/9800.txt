                                           ABSTRACT

This paper first provides an overview of the levels of minimum wages in Latin America and their

true impact on the distribution of wages using both numerical measures and kernel density plots. It

identifies “numeraire” effects higher in the wage distribution and “lighthouse” or reference effects

in the unregulated or “informal” sector. The final section then employs panel employment data from

Colombia, a country where minimum wages seem high and very binding, to quantify the effects of

an increase on wages and employment. The evidence suggests that in the Latin American context,

the minimum wage has impacts beyond those usually contemplated in the advanced country

literature.

       Minimum wages have again surfaced as a central issue in labor market policy in

the region. In countries such as Mexico and Brazil, the real level of the minimum wage

became so eroded over the 1980s that there is pressure to provide a “living” income for

those at the lower tail of the distribution. On the other hand, high rates of unemployment

in some countries and the premium that more open trade postures put on labor market

flexibility has made policy makers wary of introducing new rigidities.

       This paper first provides an overview of the levels of minimum wages in Latin

America and their true impact on the distribution of wages using both numerical

measures and kernel density plots for eight countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,

Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, and Uruguay). In particular, it attempts to identify effects

higher in the wage distribution and for effects in the unregulated or “informal” sector.

The central message is that the minimum wage has impacts on wage setting far beyond

those usually contemplated and likely beyond those found in the industrialized countries.

The final section then employs panel employment data from Colombia, a country where

minimum wages seem high and very binding, to quantify these effects and their impact

on employment.



I. The Importance of the Minimum Wage.

       The redistributional effects of the minimum wage may have the potential to

reduce poverty, and even foster growth (see Freeman 1992 for a summary of the US

debate), but the larger concern in the literature is that the secondary effects through the

creation of new rigidities in the labor market and the potential decrease in employment

opportunities may offset these gains. The simplest textbook models suggest that putting a




                                            2
wage floor above the equilibrium level will lead to a fall in employment. These effects

have traditionally appeared to be weak in the US, perhaps with the exception of young

workers (see, for example, Brown 1988, Brown, Gilroy and Kohen 1983, Card, Katz and

Krueger 1992). Dickens, Machin and Manning (1999) argue that their finding from the

UK of important impacts on wages, but none on employment is consistent with the fact

that employers generally have some monopsony power in contrast to the usual textbook

competitive model.

        However, other work does find important adverse effects on employment. Currie

and Fallick (1996), Abowd Kramarz and Margoliz(1999), and Neumark, Schweitzer and

Wascher (2000), Neumark and Wascher (1992) report sharp disemployment effects for

those constrained by the minimum with employment elasticities of between .4 to 1.6 (in

absolute value).1 Comparing the US to France, Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1997,

1999) find strong negative impacts on employment in the latter on those workers around

the minimum wage. Using a pooled cross-section-time series panel from the OECD,

Neumark and Wascher (1999) find evidence of employment losses for youth although the

magnitude of the impact diminishes where subminimum wages exist for youth and where

employers have some discretion in adjusting non-pecuniary characteristics of jobs.

        The evidence from Latin America overall suggests large effects. Freeman and

Castillo-Freeman’s (1991) analysis of the imposition of US minimum wage norms on

Puerto Rico in 1977 leads them to argue that the weak US evidence results primarily

from the fact that the minimum wage is so low as to “nibble” rather than “bite” at the

1
  They argue that the Card Katz and Krueger findings of no impact results from misspecification both in the
omission of a school enrollment effect and lagged dependent variable and incorrect estimation approach
that when corrected, removes the inconsistency in their findings. Card, Katz and Krueger (1993) take




                                                    3
wage distribution. When the minimum in Puerto Rico was raised to 63% of the average

manufacturing wage, the elasticity of employment to the minimum wage became .91 and

raising the wage led to massive job loss on the island. Card and Krueger (1995),

however, argue that these results are not robust and, in fact, once they correct for the over

weighting of very small firms they find that employment increased.2 Nonetheless, the

presence of adverse employment effects appears to be supported by Bell (1997) in her

study using manufacturing panel data from Mexico and Colombia. She finds no impact

of the minimum wage in Mexico where it was not binding. However, in Colombia, she

finds an employment elasticity of unskilled workers on the order of .15-.33 and for

skilled workers .03-.24 with the effect on workers paid near the minimum wage between

.55 to 1.22. She concludes that, across the period 1981-1987, the 10% rise in the

minimum wage from 1981-1987 reduced low-skilled, low wage Colombian employment

in the range of 2%-12%.

         The potentially very high elasticities of those earning near the minimum wage

makes the overall impact on poverty potentially ambiguous: an elasticity over 1 implies

that total income transfers to the target group fall with a rise in the wage. In the US, the

evidence is ambiguous.           As examples, Card and Krueger find weakly significant

improvements in poverty, while Neumark, et. al. (2000) find that earned incomes of low-

wage workers decline in response to minimum wage increases and poverty actually

increases.3 The debate arguably becomes more relevant in LDCs where enforcement of

labor norms is thought not to extend to the unprotected or “informal” sector. Standard


issue with the latter set of findings on several counts although in addressing these issues Neumark and
Wascher (1993) find their original conclusions strengthened.

dualistic models ranging from the earliest (Harris and Todaro 1970) to some of the most

recent (Agenor and Aizenman 1999) assume a labor market segmented by nominal wage

rigidities such as the minimum wage. Here, the worker who loses his job has no access

to unemployment insurance and instead takes refuge in the informal sector whose wage

adjusts to accommodate supply. In this case, a rise in the minimum wage forces some

workers into jobs earning below what they did before. The available empirical evidence

for Latin America is ambiguous. Morely (1992) and de Janvry and Sadoulet (1996) find

that poverty falls with a rise in the minimum wage, but only for periods of recovery in the

former study and only in periods of recession in the latter. Using world wide LDC data,

McLeod and Lustig (1996) confirm a negative effect on employment and poverty.

        The minimum wage also enters strongly into debates about the impacts of

mandated non-wage benefit payments and other regulations have on labor demand. If,

for instance, the worker fully values the health insurance provided by the employer, then

in a market with no rigidities his or her wage will fall by an equivalent amount.

However, in the presence of a wage floor, the mandated benefit raises total costs to the

worker and hence reduces total demand. In reality, most regulation can, be imagined as a

tax on firms whose incidence depends partly on how much workers value it and partly on

rigidities in the nominal wage. As an example, restrictions on firing implicitly deprive

the firm of an “option” to divest itself of an asset (the worker) and therefore a tax equal to

the option value. This, could be passed down to the worker as the cost of job security if

the worker is risk averse, but not if the minimum wage is binding.                     The adverse

  Their evidence suggests that the pressure for implementing minimum wages comes from unions seeking
to reduce wage competition.


                                                  5
employment effects of poorly designed labor market policies thus can become more

extreme in the presence of minimum wages.

        A final consideration is how minimum wages may affect how economies adjust to

shocks, whether through employment or wages. In the 1994-95 Tequila crisis, Mexico

allowed real wages to be eroded over 25% and saw only moderate increases in

unemployment.        The Colombian Constitution, on the contrary, insists on a “salario

minimo mobil” which has been interpreted dictating indexation to past inflation and this

has arguably contributed to the high rates of unemployment experienced in response to

the financial crisis of 1998.




II. Numerical Measures of the Incidence of Minimum Wages


        Raw comparisons of the real minimum wage across countries are of limited use.

From both the perspective of improving equity and minimizing labor market distortions,

what is of interest is the level of the minimum wage relative to the distribution of

remuneration in the individual country. To argue that the minimum is “too low” in Brazil

because it is a fraction of that in Argentina is irrelevant if overall labor productivity

differs by similar magnitudes.

        As a first cut at international comparison, Figure 1 ranks various Latin American

and OECD countries by the minimum wage standardized by the mean wage (SMW).4

Latin America spans the range with Uruguay, Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and

Mexico with the lowest values and Venezuela, El Salvador, Paraguay and Honduras with

among the highest. 5

        While informative, standardizing by the first moment is not sufficient to tell us

whether the minimum wage is binding for two reasons. First the number of workers

affected will depend on the higher moments of the distribution as well: more disperse

endowments of human capital (variance) or a particularly large fraction of poorly

endowed workers (skewness) would lead to more workers being affected by a given

SMW. Second, if the minimum wage is not enforced, very high SMWs are irrelevant.

        As a second cut, Table 1 offers several additional measures that attempt to

provide a more rounded view. The first column presents the SMW and the second

standardizes by the wage at the 50th quantile (median). The median is a better measure of

the central tendency since it is less sensitive to extreme values in the upper tail and to

compression of the lower tail by the minimum wage. Using it to standardize reverses the

SMW rankings of Argentina and Brazil.                 This effect is even more dramatic if we

standardize by the wage at the 10th quantile of the distribution, arguably the range that is

of more concern than the center. 6 Brazil suddenly appears among the countries with the

most potentially binding minimum (excluding Honduras), and far above Argentina and

Uruguay. This makes sense when it is noted that Brazil shows the highest wage variance

among countries overall, and among countries for whom the sample is purely urban.

  The analysis uses the Permanent Household Survey (EPH) from Argentina, the Continuous Household
Survey (ECH) from Bolivia, the National Survey from the Sample of Households (PNAD) from Brazil, the
(CASEN) from Chile, the Multi-purpose Permanent Survey (EPHM) for Honduras, the National Urban
Employment Survey (ENEU) from Mexico. We restrict the sample to those 16-65, working between 30-
50 hours a week for informal salaried workers (those working for firms of five employees or below) and
formal salaried workers (six workers and above).

  10% of the sample earns below this wage and 90% above.

III. Graphical Analysis-Kernel Density Plots


        However revealing theoretically, the 10th quantile, variance and skewness

measures are problematic since they describe the distribution after the imposition of the

minimum wage. A graphic approach, however can reliably reveal how the distribution is

distorted. The first panels of Figure 2 are kernel estimates of the density function with a

vertical line to mark the location of the minimum wage.7 Kernel Density estimators

approximate the density f(x) from observations on x. The estimator calculates the density

at the center of the weighted x’s found within a rolling interval or “window”. They

differ from histogram both in allowing the windows to overlap and by the possibility of

different weighting schemes on the x’s

The function K, that determines the weights is termed the “kernel”.                    This has the

advantage of giving a clearer idea of the shape of the distribution, but it is sensitive to the

bandwidth chosen to smooth. This is particularly important for detecting the impact of

minimum wages since an excessively large bandwidth will smooth exactly the “cliff”

where the minimum wage is binding. Some adjustments away from the default were

necessary to present the most revealing plot.

        The second panels are the cumulative distributions of wages. These require no

judgements about bandwidths and the vertical “cliffs” indicate where the minimum wage,

or multiples, may be influencing. Both the informal and formal wage distributions are

plotted in light and dark lines respectively.8               In each graph, a “piling up” of the

probability mass around the minimum wage, represented in all figures by a vertical line

suggests that the policy has, in effect, forced a change in the distribution.

Interpretation


         What is immediately clear is that minimum wages do have the capacity to

strongly alter the distribution of wages. Colombia provides an extreme example: the

dramatic cliffs in the plots occurring around the minimum wage line, the low standard

deviation, and high skewness (Table 1) likely reflect the impact of the minimum wage

rather than the underlying distribution of human capital confirming the more detailed

findings of Santamaria (1998).             Somewhat in contrast to common wisdom, of the

Mercosur countries, Brazil and Chile appear to have more binding minimum wages in the

formal sector than either the allegedly very rigid Argentina, or Uruguay.

         More generally, enforcement varies widely across the region and SMWs appear to

be somewhat deceptive measures of the efficacy of the minimum wage to affect

distribution or a measures of labor market distortion. Chile and Colombia have SMW far

below that of Honduras, yet the distortion of the wage distributions in the first two seems

dramatic in comparison. This suggests that a country’s location in the range of SMWs

(Figure 1) is insufficient to indicate the impact of a rise in minimum wage and that

empirical work with only the statutory measures may give a misleading picture of what’s

going on.

  Informal sector is defined in each country either by whether a salaried worker is un-affiliated with social
security systems, or works in very small firms ( around 6 or less). The Colombian survey, in particular,

The impact on the informal sector.

        In virtually all countries, there is evidence of what has been termed in Brazil the

“Efeito Farol” or lighthouse effect on the informal distribution.9 That is, the formal

sector minimum wage serves as a reference throughout the economy, including sectors

not legally bound by it. In fact, the influence seems far stronger on the informal sector

than the formal in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Uruguay, countries where the wage

appears largely irrelevant to the formal distribution. In each of these cases, the lighter

shaded informal wage distribution to the left of the formal sector distribution shows

greater distortions around the minimum than is the case in the formal sector. It may be

argued that the minimum wage is simply a signal of the wage level in high inflation

countries, but the evidence is not supportive: Brazil, Colombia and Mexico have very

moderate rates of inflation in the sample period. Though probably not enforced by law,

the minimum wage appears to be an important benchmark for “fair” remuneration.

        This would seem to turn conventional conceptions of the relationship between the

informal and formal sectors on their heads-- the binding wage floor is now in the

informal sector-- and raises new questions about the razon de ser of the informal sector.

If it is an inferior unprotected sector, why do workers receive some benefits and not

others? Why does some concept of fairness dictate that informal workers should get the

minimum, but not benefits? One possibility is that forwarded by Maloney (1999) that the

sector is as much a way of avoiding the inefficiencies of labor market regulation as the

regulations themselves. As discussed earlier, where there is no wage floor in the formal

sector, the costs of benefits to employers may be largely passed down to workers in the

form of lower wages. If this implicit tax is higher than the perceived benefits, then there

is an incentive to evade and seek informal employment. Given that informal workers are,

on average, substantially younger than formal workers, it may be that many are still

covered by their fathers’ health insurance or are recurring to less formal forms of social

protection and hence, would resist paying the implicit tax again. Further, the often gross

inefficiencies in benefits provision drive another wedge between benefits and implicit

taxes.

         This finding also suggests that the standard dualistic model that sees the flexible

informal sector wage as permitting the absorption of workers rationed out from the rigid

formal sector is seriously incomplete. It is not clear why we shouldn’t also expect a

downward sloping demand curve in the informal sector, and hence that the binding

minimum wage leads to job loss there and reduced capacity to absorb the unemployed.

Again, the present Colombian situation comes to mind.10 The historically unprecedented

unemployment rates may partially arise from the shock to formal production due to the

collapse of the financial sector, but also the jobs lost in the informal sector with the sharp

rise in the minimum wage over the last several years.



The minimum wage as a reference for other formal wages.

         Throughout the region it is common to use the minimum wage as a more general

unit of account or “numeraire,” for instance in quoting wages or monetary contracts in



10
  Fiess, Fugazza and Maloney (1999) for example find that the Mexican and to a lesser degree, the
informal and formal sectors behave across the business cycle as if they were integrated sectors-earnings
relative to the formal sector rise with share of the workforce in informality. Colombia, on the other hand,
the traditional dualistic view seems more supported with informal self employment serving as a last resort
and unemployment dramatically rising. See also Maloney (2002,2003) and Cunnigham and Maloney
(2001) for further discussions of the desirability of the informal sector.

general. In Brazil, for example, Neri, Gonzaga and Camargo (2000) find strong evidence

of this effect throughout the wage distribution finding that 9% of formal sector workers

received exactly one minimum wage, but another 6% received exactly a multiple.

Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Uruguay appear to show regular “cliffs” across the

distribution that are synchronized between both the formal and informal sectors. The

next section will test more explicitly for these effects.




IV. Econometric Evidence on the Impact of the Minimum Wage from Colombia

       In this section, we follow Neumark, Schweitzer and Wsscher (2000) in employing

rotating panel data from Colombia to test the impact of a rise in the minimum wage on

wages and the probability of becoming unemployed, and for numeraire effects in both.

The existence of the panel, as well as the impression from the previous section that the

minimum wage is high and binding made Colombia an obvious case study.

       Since 1997, the National Statistical Agency (DANE) has created a rotating panel

by re-interviewing 25% of households interviewed in the previous round of the Encuesta

Nacional de Hogares (ENH-National Household Survey) yielding a set of two

consecutive quarterly observations on the same households. Individuals were identified

by household and then on the basis of gender, age, marital status, relation with the head

of household, schooling level and years of education, variables which do not change

between quarters. The Euclidian distance from each individual with respect to the rest of

the inhabitants of a house, is calculated and the match accepted if the distance is below a

predetermined threshold. Roughly 15% of the individuals in a survey can be linked to the

past one in 11 rotating surveys. As table 2 shows, when we restrict to that used in the



                                              12
kernel density plots- men working 30-50 hours per week, we have a total of 10,633

observations who are employed in the first period. Slightly over 19% of these will

become unemployed in the second period. Of these, 66% report being salaried workers

and 34% report being self-employed. Although the year chosen to estimate the kernel

density plots permitted separating “formal” from “informal” wage earners in every

period, this is not the case in other years and we combine the two in the “salaried” sector.

Roughly 25% earn below the minimum wage. However, the vast majority of these, as

suggested in the kernel density plots, are informal.

        We examine the self-employed as a control that can help separate general price

indexing effects from “true” minimum wage effects. If the minimum is simply an

economy wide mechanism for coordinating prices, we might see the self-employed using

it to fix their product prices. If this were not the case, we would expect that their incomes

would be determined by the profitability of their enterprise and they would not raise their

implicit “wage” at the risk of becoming uncompetitive.

        The panel nature of the data permits identifying the impact of the two annual

changes in the minimum wage that occurred between 1997 and the end of the of the

available sample in 1999.11 We estimate the determinants of the percentage change in the

real hourly wage worker i receives, (dw) or the probability of becoming unemployed

(prob z=1) across two quarters as

  This period corresponds to what is widely acknowledged as the country’s worst employment crisis in the
post war period.

where mw is the real minimum wage respectively in the two periods.12.

         Though it is common to examine the impact of the minimum wage on wages and

employment at the minimum wage, the kernel density plots suggest that there are

numeraire effects throughout the distribution. If we are interested on the total effect of

the MW on distribution and employment, we need to look for these effects as well.

Further, there may be general equilibrium effects through changes in the relative demand.

For these reasons, a vector of j dummy variables, R, for position ranked by real hourly

wage in year 1, of the wage of individual i with respect to the minimum wage (Table 2).

That is, we can capture the impact of a change in the minimum wage at multiples of the

minimum wage throughout the distribution. The first term on the right-hand-side of the

equation captures the effects of a change in the minimum wage on different regions of the

wage distribution. The second permits the level of wage growth to change by each cohort

in the wage distribution, independent of minimum wage effects. The third allows us to

capture (or control) changes within each region or changes in higher levels than those

defined by vector R.13

education, etc., T and A are a set of quarterly and regional dummy variables which

        Previous papers find that low income families receive a short run benefit when the

minimum wage increases but are negatively affected over the longer term (Neumark and

Wascher, 1997; Neumark et al., 1998; Neumark et al., 2000). This is because short run

adjustments are made via prices and long run adjustments via quantities: firms must

follow the law at first but then, if required, they fire workers. For this reason, the lagged

minimum wage ( SM 1 − SM 0 ) SM 0 is introduced. From the point of view of measuring

these longer run impacts, it would be preferable to have, as Neumark et. al. did, a full

year span rather than the two quarter panels the ENH offers. This limitation may not be

as serious as appears at first for measuring the impact on wages since higher inflation

rates erode more quickly any mandated increase in the MW than in the US. It has also

been argued (Brown et al. 1982) that the high turnover in low skilled workers may imply

that employment adjustment in the most critical ranges around the minimum wage may

be relatively rapid. Further, Maloney (2001) shows that average manufacturing tenure in

Latin America is roughly 70% of the OECD so the quantity adjustment might occur more

rapidly. Nonetheless, we put less weight in our analysis on the lags and do not follow

Neumark in generating “representative” worker responses to lagged minimum wages. 14

   Neumark argues that generally speaking, the lag has the usual interpretation as long as long as the
individual history is not relevant, that is, that the contemporary effect of a change in the MW does not
depend on past wages. The problem that he highlights is that a rise in the minimum wage in the previous
period may have “swept up” a worker into a different category. Therefore, the correct total effects
(contemporaneous plus lagged) needs somehow to compensate for individuals changing classification that
involves generating a set of representative workers in each cell.



                                                  15
Effects on wages

       Table 3a reports the effects on real wages of a change in the real minimum wage.

on salaried workers. The results are broadly consistent with Neumark et. al’s. Around

the minimum wage, those earning .7-.9 minimum wages, the effect is high for salaried

workers, .87 of the rise in minimum wages is communicated to wages. Moving up the

income scale, the effect remains significant up to 4 minimum wages, although with

decreasing coefficients and falling to only .16 for those earning more than 4 minimum

wages. What is remarkable is that the effect dies off much more slowly than in the US.

Between 2-3 minimum wages, Neumark et al found an impact of only .06 % whereas in

Colombia at 4 minimum wages the impact is .38. This suggests a far greater numeraire

effect and hence substantially greater impact of the minimum wage on the overall

distribution. As Neumark et. al found, very large effects are found below the minimum

wage and we also do not have an obvious explanation for this. The self-employed show a

significant effect below the minimum wage, but overall, there appears to be little impact

on the distribution above. This suggests that the impact is not through the minum wage

acting as a general signal of price rises throughout the economy.

       The effect of a one quarter lag suggests two interesting effects. First, that across

the wage distribution there is a significant, and broadly uniform (~17%) erosion of the

first period effect, perhaps due to inflation. This suggests that we cannot take the impact

effect as the wage rise that firms will use in making employment decisions. Second,

again the impact on the self employed is virtually never significant and the magnitudes

are roughly a third of those for salaried workers. This suggests that not only do the self

employed not respond strongly to lighthouse effects, but that they may update their




                                            16
“wages” frequently to avoid inflation erosion. This, in fact, may be one of the advantages

of being self-employed vs. salaried in high inflation environments.




Effects on Employment

       Table 3b shows the consequent effects on employment. Equation (2) is run again,

but this time as a logit where if the individual is assigned a value of 1 if he retains his job

and a 0 if he is without a job in the second quarter.

       The results are consistent with the wage regressions. A rise in the minimum wage

has a statistically very significant impact on the probability of becoming unemployed that

again decreases with a rising position in the wage distribution. The lags echo this pattern

and suggest that, as might be expected, the adjustment does not take place

instantaneously. On average, the contemporaneous effect is roughly twice that found by

Neumark for the US and, again, extends far higher in the distribution. Corresponding to

the apparent impact on the wages of the very lowest ranges of the self-employed

distribution, there are negative impacts on employment as well as some impacts higher

in the distribution. Figure 3 graphs both the impact on wages and unemployment

probability by position in the distribution.

       The regressions, therefore, suggest statistically very significant effects on

employment and magnitudes of effect far larger than those seen in the US. However,

since they measure the impact on the flow out of employment, they cannot answer the

question of what happens to the total stock of jobs. As a very rough first approximation,

we run equation 2 again, but eliminating the R dummies so as to get the “average” effect

(integrating under the wage distribution in table 3a) of the minimum wage. The average



                                               17
contemporaneous impact is .64 and lagged is -.17 leaving a total effect of .47 % rise in

wages. We then multiply this by Fajnzylber and Maloney (2000) estimate of the LR own

wage elasticity of blue collar manufacturing employment of .32. If there is no further

inflationary erosion, this would imply an elasticity of employment with respect to

minimum wage of .15. This is quite consistent with Bell’s estimates and suggests that the

9% rise in minimum wage in 1999 would have had the effect of reducing employment by

1.4%.




V. Conclusion

        The Colombian case confirms the evidence offered by the kernel density

estimates.   First, the minimum wage can have an important impact on the wage

distribution in the neighborhood of the minimum wage. Second, the effects echo up the

wage distribution in a way that suggests important “numeraire” effects. That this effect

is far stronger than found by Neumark et al in the US suggests that the minimum wage

induces farther-reaching rigidities in the labor market and that the trade off between any

possible effect on poverty and reduced flexibility is likely to be more severe in Latin

America. The employment effects are shown to be large as a result. The data did not

allow testing of the impacts on informal salaried sector wages, but the kernel density

plots speak convincingly about the light-house effect and the potentially greater impact

on the informal sector.    In sum, the minimum wage has impacts both in the higher

reaches of the formal distribution and in the informal labor markets that magnify its

distortionary effects beyond that previously thought.
