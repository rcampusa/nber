Pollution and Mortality in the 19th Century

                                               ABSTRACT

Mortality was extremely high in the industrial cities of the 19th century, but little is known about the
role played by pollution in generating this pattern, due largely to a lack of direct pollution measures.
I overcome this problem by combining data on the local composition of industries in Britain with information
on the intensity with which industries used polluting inputs. Using this new measure, I show that pollution
had a strong impact on mortality as far back as the 1850s. Industrial pollution explains 30-40% of
the relationship between mortality and population density in 1851-60, and nearly 60% of this relationship
in 1900. Growing industrial coal use from 1851-1900 reduced life expectancy by at least 0.57 years.
A back-of-the envelope estimate suggests that the value of this loss of life, expressed as a one-time
cost, was equal to at least 0.33-1.00 of annual GDP in 1900. Overall, these results show that industrial
pollution was a major cause of mortality in the 19th century, particularly in urban areas, and that industrial
growth during this period came at a substantial cost to health.

1     Introduction

In the 19th century, urban areas were incredibly unhealthy places to live. For example,
Figure 1 describes the relationship between age-standardized mortality and district
population density for 580 districts in England and Wales in 1851. Similar patterns
have been shown for the United States (Cain & Hong (2009)), France (Kesztenbaum
& Rosenthal (2011)), and other locations.


          Figure 1: The Urban Mortality Penalty in England in 1851-1860




             Mortality data for 580 districts in England and Wales, excluding Lon-
             don, averaged over 1851-1860 from the Registrar General’s reports.




    What caused the urban mortality penalty in the 19th century? One leading answer
to this question is based on the disease environment. With a large population crowded
closely together, the theory goes, infectious disease transmission increased. Particular
emphasis has been placed on transmission through unsanitary water (Troesken (2002),
Cutler & Miller (2005), Ferrie & Troesken (2008), Kesztenbaum & Rosenthal (2012),
Alsan & Goldin (2014), Antman (2015)). A recent review suggests that the impact
of the urban disease environment was so significant that, “The preponderance of the
evidence suggests that the lack of improvement in mortality between 1820 and 1870
is due in large part to the greater spread of disease in newly enlarged cities” (Cutler
et al. (2006), p. 102). A second potential cause may be poor nutrition, a channel
emphasized by McKeown (1976), Fogel (2004), and Fogel & Costa (1997). If residents
of larger cities were also poorer, or had less access to quality food, then poor nutrition

                                              1
may explain part of the urban mortality penalty.1
    This paper highlights a third important determinant of mortality in the 19th cen-
tury: industrial pollution. Pollution, particularly air pollution from coal burning in
factories and homes, was a characteristic feature of British cities in the 19th century.2
News reports complained that, “There was nothing more irritating than the unburnt
carbon floating in the air; it fell on the air tubes of the human system, and formed a
dark expectoration which was so injurious to the constitution; it gathered on the lungs
and there accumulated.”3 A large literature studying pollution in modern economies
has highlighted substantial health and mortality effects, primarily using data from the
U.S. and Europe, where pollution levels are much lower than in the historical setting
I consider.4 Despite this evidence, pollution is often overlooked as an important de-
terminant of mortality during the 19th century because we lack credible estimates of
the magnitude of the impact of pollution during this period. This is largely because,
outside of a few special cases, no direct pollution measures are available.
    This paper makes four contributions to our understanding of the relationship
between pollution and mortality. First, I construct a measure of local industrial
pollution for Britain in the 19th century. The measure is based on data describing the
local industrial structure together with information on the use of the main polluting
input – coal – by each industry. This approach, which could be applied in a variety
of settings, allows me to overcome the lack of direct pollution measures.
    Second, I use this measure in order provide the first broad-based and well-identified
estimates of the impact of industrial pollution on mortality in the 19th century. My
baseline estimates, from 1851-1860, show that industrial pollution substantially raised
mortality in the 19th century. A lower-bound estimate suggests that a one standard
deviation increase in industrial pollution raised mortality by at least 0.8 percent.
This impact is roughly similar to the total effect of major infectious diseases such as

   1
     Nutritional deficiency may have been further exacerbated by the extra calories needed to fight
infectious disease.
   2
     Contemporary reports and the work of historians suggest that air pollution levels were extremely
high in British cities during this period. Brimblecombe (1987) estimates that air pollution levels in
London reached over 600 micrograms per cubic meter. For comparison, modern readings from Delhi,
India are generally under 400 micrograms per cubic meter (Fouquet (2011)). Additional qualitative
evidence comes from Mosley (2001), Thorsheim (2006) and others.

     This literature is far too large to review here. Graff Zivin & Neidell (2013) provides a recent
review of some of the literature in this area.

smallpox or diphtheria. This lowered life expectancy by at least 0.24 years. In heavily
polluted cities, such as Manchester or Sheffield, the impacts would have been much
larger.
    Third, I show that industrial pollution explains roughly 40% of the urban mortality
penalty in 1851-1860. Put another way, the impact of industrial pollution is about 70
percent as large as the impact of all other factors associated with population density,
including infectious diseases. By 1900, industrial pollution explains nearly 60% of
the urban mortality penalty, with an impact that is twice as large as other factors
associated with density. These results show that one simply cannot understand urban
mortality in the 19th century without accounting for industrial pollution.
    Finally, this study provides evidence on the costs associated with rising industrial
coal use from 1851-1900. Over this period, coal use increased by just under one ton
per worker. Using long-difference regressions, I show that this reduced life-expectancy
by 0.57 years. Back-of-the envelope estimates suggest that the monetary cost of the
increased mortality associated with the increase in coal use intensity from 1851-1900
(a wealth effect) was equal to 0.33-1.00 of annual GDP in 1900. Thus, industry growth
during this period came with important health costs.
    In order to produce well-identified estimates, this study must address issues re-
lated to population sorting and omitted variables. One approach to dealing with
these issues relies on the detailed cause-of-death information available in the data. In
particular, I analyze the impact of industrial pollution on mortality due to respiratory
diseases (bronchitis, asthma, etc.). Respiratory diseases are closely associated with
the effects of airborne pollution and were also an important and growing cause-of-
death in 19th century Britain. I define excess respiratory mortality as the percentage
increase in respiratory mortality due to industrial pollution in excess of the percent-
age increase observed across all cause-of-death categories. This excess respiratory
mortality will be free of selection concerns as long as those who select into more
polluted areas are less healthy across a range of disease categories. Similarly, it will
be free of omitted variables concerns unless those omitted variables specifically affect
respiratory mortality.
   As a second approach to dealing with population sorting issues, I look at variation
in mortality patterns for workers holding the same occupation, using over 300 detailed
occupational categories. Because occupation is a good reflection of income, educa-


                                           3
tion, and social class, looking within occupational categories should deal with most
selection issues. Even within detailed occupational categories, I find strong evidence
that mortality was higher in more polluted locations.
    I also apply long-difference regressions over the 1851-1900 period. These allow me
to estimate the impact of rising pollution on health while controlling for any fixed local
features that may have influenced mortality in the cross-section. To deal with the
possible endogeneity of local industry growth, I instrument for increasing industrial
pollution intensity at the local level using each location’s industrial composition in
1851 and national industry growth rates, as in Bartik (1991). This approach can
be applied to both total mortality and excess respiratory mortality, allowing me to
simultaneously address sorting and omitted variables concerns.
    These results provide a new perspective on the sources of mortality during this
important period of history. While current work emphasizes the role of the disease
environment, my findings suggest that the impact of pollution should be given more
weight. The evidence I provide fills an important hole in the historical literature and
connects our understanding of historical mortality patterns to the substantial modern
literature documenting the health effects of pollution.
    Beyond improving our understanding of history, there are at least four reasons
that the results documented in this paper are important. First, historical mortality
experiences are regularly used to inform modern debates over pollution and health
(see, e.g., Cutler et al. (2006) and Deaton (2013)). Second, when industrialization has
substantial negative health effects, there may be important differences between mea-
sured GDP growth and actual welfare gains (Nordhaus & Tobin (1973)). In Britain,
this will affect our assessment of the gains from increasing industrialization during
the period I study, as well as the benefits of environmental improvements associated
with the loss of heavy industry later in the 20th century. Documenting the health
costs of rising industrialization in the 19th century is a first step towards a full ac-
counting of these costs and benefits. Third, my results show that industrial pollution
had an important impact on the spatial variation in health outcomes and may have
generated population sorting. These historical patterns may be useful for understand-
ing the roots of modern spatial inequality, a topic of current importance (see, e.g.,
Chetty et al. (2014)). Fourth, this study provides new evidence documenting the
impact of pollution through both acute and chronic disease, over the long-run, in a


                                            4
high-pollution environment. This differs from most existing studies, which tend to
focus acute effects and relatively low-pollution environments, though there are some
important exceptions.5
    This paper builds on a relatively small set of studies investigating the impact of
pollution during the 19th and early 20th century. The closest of these, Troesken &
Clay (2011), looks at the evolution of pollution in London in the late 19th century.6
There is also an older line of related research debating the importance of pollution
in 19th century cities ((Williamson, 1981b,a, 1982; Pollard, 1981)). For the mid-20th
century, Barreca et al. (2014) show that the use of bituminous coal for home heating
substantially increased mortality, while Clay et al. (2015) study the local impact
of coal-fired power plants. In addition, a number of studies investigate the health
impacts of particular pollution events in the 20th century (Townsend (1950), Logan
(1953), Greenburg et al. (1962), Ball (2015)). Relative to existing contributions,
this study extends our knowledge by providing evidence for an earlier period over a
broad set of locations while accounting for a number of potential identification issues.
My focus on industrial pollution also complements existing work, which has largely
focused on residential pollution sources.
    The next section provides background information on the empirical setting. Sec-
tion 3 introduces the data. The analysis is presented in Section 4. Section 5 concludes.




2       Empirical Setting

2.1     Pollution in Victorian England

In England, pollution – particularly air pollution from coal burning – was a problem
reaching back at least to the 17th century, when Evelyn published his Fumifugium
(1661) decrying the smoke of London. This problem became much more acute in the
19th century, as industrialization took off and steam-driven factories expanded across

    5
     Examples of studies looking at high-pollution environments include Greenstone & Hanna (2014)
in India, Almond et al. (2009) and Chen et al. (2013) in China, Jayachandran (2009) in Indonesia,
and Arceo et al. (Forthcoming) in Mexico. Studies investigating the effects of pollution through
chronic disease channels include Chen et al. (2013) and Anderson (2015).
   6
     Other work focusing on pollution in the 19th century includes Fouquet (2011, 2012).


                                               5
the country.7
    In this study, much of the focus will be on pollution related to coal use. Coal
was the main source of power during this period and the most important cause of
industrial pollution. Domestic coal consumption in Britain rose from 60 million tons
in 1854 to over 180 million tons in 1900.8 Most of this coal was burnt by industry;
data from Mitchell (1988) show that industrial consumption accounted for 60-65%
of domestic coal use over the study period.9 In addition to being the largest user of
coal, industry was also geographically agglomerated, leading to substantial variation
in industrial coal-use levels across locations.10 Moreover, prior to electrification, power
used in industry had to be generated on-site, so that most industrial coal use took
place in urban areas. While industrial coal use tended to be less polluting, per ton,
than other uses, the combination of concentrated production in urban locations and
the high overall level of coal burnt suggests that industrial pollution was likely to
have been an important contributor to overall pollution levels, particularly in urban
areas.11
    Of course, coal was not the only source of industrial pollution, nor was air pollution
the only form that pollution took. Motivated by this, I will also consider a second
approach to measuring industrial pollution, based on employment in a list of heavily
pollution industries, which is not directly tied to coal use.
    Despite high levels of pollution, regulation of polluting industries was limited
(Thorsheim (2006), Fouquet (2012)). This feature was due to a combination of the
strong laissez faire ideology that dominated British policy-making during this period


   7
     Appendix A.1.1 describes estimated pollution levels in London starting in 1700 from Brimble-
combe (1987) and Fouquet (2008).
   8
     Coal prices in London and the main exporting ports were fairly constant over this period. This
was despite increases in the pithead price of coal starting in the 1880’s, which presumably were offset
by falling transport costs. Graphs of coal consumption and prices are available in Appendix A.1.2.
Data from Mitchell (1984) and Mitchell (1988).
   9
     The 65% figure covers the industries included in my coal use measure, which span manufacturing
and mining. Residential coal use accounted for roughly 25% of domestic coal consumption, while
the remainder was used in utilities and transportation. See figure in Appendix A.1.2.
  10
     It is worth noting that there was relatively little variation in the type of coal available across
locations in England so we should not expect coal from different areas to imply substantially different
levels of pollution. In contrast, in the U.S. some areas had large deposits of anthracite coal, which
was cleaner than the bituminous coal available in other areas.
  11
     Industrial use was cleaner relative to residential use because combustion was often more efficient
and factory smoke-stacks deposited smoke at a higher altitude.


                                                  6
and the influence of local industrialists.12 One consequences of lax regulation, together
with generally low coal prices, was that industrial users had little incentive to invest in
more efficient machinery or processes. As a result, contemporary sources such as the
1871 Coal Commission report suggest that there was substantial waste in industrial
coal use through poor combustion, heat loss, and other channels (for details see
Appendix A.1.3).




2.2     Mortality in Victorian England

Figure 2 describes the trend in overall mortality in England over the study period, as
well as mortality due to the major infectious diseases and mortality due to respiratory
diseases.13 There are a couple of important patterns here. First, starting in the
1870s, overall mortality began to fall substantially, a pattern that continued through
1900. The reduction in overall mortality was driven by the fall in mortality due to
infectious diseases, particularly tuberculosis, typhus, scarlet fever, and diarrhea &
dysentery.14 In contrast, mortality due to respiratory diseases, the category most
closely associated with industrial pollution, was rising over most of the study period.
This increase was particularly pronounced in the period before 1880, a period that
also saw the greatest increases in coal use intensity (see Appendix A.1.2). By the
1891-1900 decade, respiratory mortality was accounting for as many deaths as all of
the major infectious diseases combined.
    It is important to note that the increase in deaths attributed to respiratory diseases
was rising from 1851-1870, before the major reductions in infectious diseases. This
suggests that the rise in respiratory deaths was not a consequence of the fall in
infectious disease mortality.


  12
     While national acts regulating pollution were passed during this period, including the the Sani-
tary Act of 1866, the Public Health Act of 1875 and the Public Health (London) act of 1891, historical
sources suggest that these measures had limited effectiveness, though there is some evidence that
they began to influence outcomes in the last two decades of the 19th century.
  13
     The respiratory disease category contains a variety of diseases, the most important of which
are bronchitis, asthma, pneumonia, pleurisy, and influenza. This category may contain both non-
infectious and some infectious diseases.
  14
     A more detailed breakdown of the mortality patterns in specific cause-of-death categories is
available in Appendix A.1.4.

                    Figure 2: Mortality in England & Wales, 1851-1900




           The infectious diseases included are cholera, diarrhea & dysentery, diphtheria,
           measles, scarlet fever, smallpox, tuberculosis, typhus and whooping cough. The
           respiratory disease category includes a variety of diseases of the respiratory
           system, including bronchitis, pneumonia and asthma.




3      Data and Measurement
One unique feature of the historical setting I consider is that detailed mortality data
are available from the Registrar General’s reports. The data I use come from the
decennial supplements and provide mortality averages by decade, from 1851-1900.15
The data were collected by an extensive system aimed at registering every birth,
marriage, and death in England and Wales. Of the data collected by the Registrar’s
office, those on mortality are considered to be the most accurate and comprehensive,
the “shining star of the Victorian civil registration” (Woods (2000)).16 While not
  15
     These data were obtained from Woods (1997) through the UK Data Archive. The analysis ends
in 1900 because after that point the cause of death categories change, making it difficult to construct
consistent cause-of-death series beyond that point.
  16
     For every death, registration with the local official (the “Registrar”) was required within five days
before the body could be legally disposed of. The Registrar was required to document the gender,
age, and occupation of the deceased, together with the cause of death. The Registrar General’s office
put a substantial amount of effort into improving the registration of causes of death in the 1840s. This
included sending circulars to all registrars and medical professionals, constructing a standardized
set of disease nosologies, and providing registrars and medical professionals with standardized blank


                                                    8
perfect, relative to other mortality data available for the 19th century, these data
provide a unique level of comprehensiveness, detail, and accuracy.
    This study will focus primarily on all-age mortality. When doing so, I adjust for
differential mortality patterns at different ages in order to generate age-standardized
mortality values. The formula is M ORTd = G
                                               P
                                                 g M Rgd P Sg where M ORTd is the age-
standardized mortality rate for district d, M Rgd is the raw mortality rate in age-group
g in district d and P Sg is the share of population in age-group g in the country as a
whole. Thus, this formula adjusts a location’s mortality rate to account for deviations
in the age distribution of residents from the national age distribution.
    In general, London is excluded from the analysis because it represents a substantial
outlier in many ways. London was much larger than other British cities and extremely
dense, with very high death rates in some parts of the city. In the robustness exercises
I consider estimates obtained while including London and I find that this does not
substantially impact the results.
    The second key ingredient for this study is a measure of local industrial pollution.
The pollution measures that I construct are based on the industrial composition
of local areas. Data on the industrial composition is available from the Census of
Population, which collected data on the occupation of each person (a full census,
not a sample). The occupational categories generally correspond closely to what we
think of as industries.17 These data are reported for workers aged twenty and older
for over 600 districts covering all of England and Wales 1851, and for 55 counties in
each decade starting in 1851.18 To obtain consistent series over time, I collapse the
reported occupations into 26 industry categories covering nearly the entire private
sector economy, including manufacturing, construction, services, and transportation,
following Hanlon & Miscio (2014).19

cause-of-death certificates. These efforts paid off with more accurate data in the 1850s and beyond.
Thus, while there is surely some measurement error in the cause-of-death reporting, the error rates
are not likely to be too large, particularly in the broad cause-of-death categories used in this analysis.
Woods (2000) suggests that the statistics most prone to reporting error were live births and infant
deaths. This is one motivation for focusing on all-age mortality in this study.
  17
     Examples include “Cotton textile worker” and “Boot and shoe maker.”
  18
     District-level occupation data are reported only in 1851-1871, after which reporting at this level
of detail was discontinued. There were around 600 districts in England and Wales, divided into 55
counties, with Yorkshire divided into the West Riding, East Riding, and North Riding.

tails about the Census of Population Occupation data.


                                                    9
    My primary measure of local pollution is based on industrial coal use. I model
coal use at the district level in a particular year t as made up of three components:
local employment in industry i in district d and year t, denoted Lidt , the coal use
intensity in that industry θi , and a time-varying term representing efficiency gains in
coal use, which I denote ψt . Putting these together, the overall level of coal burnt in
a district in a year is,

                                                       X
                                     COALdt = ψt           θi Lidt ,                                (1)
                                                       i

District employment in industry i is available from the Census of Population occu-
pation data, while industry coal use per worker is obtained from the 1907 Census of
Production. The third term, ψt , reflects growth in coal use per worker over time.
This is calculated by comparing data on national coal use to the coal use measure
based on industry employment and industry coal use intensity.20 Note that the ψt
term will not play a role in cross-sectional regressions, where it will be absorbed into
the constant, but it will matter in the long-difference regressions.
    Implicit in this approach is the assumption that the relative coal intensity per
worker across industries did not change substantially over time. In Appendix A.2.1,
I provide evidence that this assumption is reasonable by comparing industry coal use
intensity in 1907 and 1924.21 As an additional test of the coal use measure, I use data
on county-level industrial coal use in 1871 from the Coal Commission Report and
show that my approach does a reasonable job of reproducing county-level industrial
coal use in that year. Details of this check are available in Appendix A.2.2.
    As a second measure of local pollution, I use a list of polluting industries con-
structed for the modern period by the Chinese government.22 This list is consistent

  20
     To beP specific, this term is calculated using national-level data. The formula is ψt =
COALt / i Lit θi , where COALt is national industrial coal use data obtained from Mitchell (1984),
Lit is national employment in industry i, and θi is industry coal use intensity.
  21
     Similar data are not available before 1907, so it is necessary to run this test on data after 1907.
However, if anything we should expect larger changes between the 1907-1924 period than in the
1851-1907 period. This is because the sources of industrial power were fairly stable from 1851-1907,
while the introduction of electricity means that we should see more changes in the 1907-1924 period.
Thus, the fact that I find stable patterns in the 1907-1924 period suggests that the patterns were
also likely to have been stable before 1907.

     Williamson (1981b) uses a somewhat similar methodology in which he focuses on only employ-
ment in mining and manufacturing. See Hanlon & Tian (2015) and the online appendix to that
paper for further details.

with qualitative historical evidence on the main polluting industries during the period
I study and also corresponds fairly closely to the set of heavy coal-using industries
based on the 1907 Census of Production. Given the set of dirty industries D, this
measure of pollution in a district is the level of district employment in these “dirty”
                                  P
industries, i.e., DIRT Y empct = i∈D Lict .
    Table 1 describes the polluting industries included in the database, their national
employment, coal use per worker, and an indicator for whether they are on the list
of heavily-polluting industries. Coal use per worker varies substantially across indus-
tries. The most intensive users, such as Earthenware & Bricks, Metal & Machinery,
and Chemicals & Drugs, are often those that use coal to provide heat, for example
to melt iron or fire bricks. Moderate coal-using industries such as Textiles, Mining,
and Leather, use coal primarily to run engines for motive power. Industries such as
Apparel, Tobacco, and Instruments & Jewelry, use very little coal per worker. Ser-
vices, which are not on this list, are assumed to have a negligible amount of coal
use per worker.23 The last column of Table 1 shows that the list of heavily polluting
industries corresponds fairly well to the list of coal-intensive industries.
    The large variation in industry coal intensity means that locations specializing in
industries such as iron and steel production will have much higher overall coal use
than those specializing in services, trade, or light manufacturing. This variation is
illustrated in Table 2, which describes various pollution measures for a set of districts
with similar populations but widely varying levels of heavy industry. Coal use was
substantially higher in districts specializing in heavy industry, such as Stoke-on-Trent,
where pottery was a major part of the economy, and Durham, a coal mining and
metals center. Districts such as Macclesfield and Norwich, which specialized in textiles
and other light manufacturing, show moderate levels of pollution intensity. Bath, a
resort district with an economy largely specialized in services, shows much lower levels
of pollution intensity than the others.




  23
    I also exclude public utilities when constructing the pollution measures. Some public utilities,
particularly gas, were important coal users and did create local pollution. However, by converting
coal into gas which was then pumped into cities, this industry may have actually decreased pollution
in city centers. Thus, these industries are excluded because of their ambiguous effects on local
pollution and local health.

   I have also collected variables describing population density, district location, and
several other factors that may have influenced health during this period.24 Because of

the importance of clean water in influencing mortality during this period, I construct
a control for the water services provided in each district. This variable is based
on the number of persons employed in providing water services, either public or
private, per 10,000 of district population, based on occupation data from the Census
of Population. Similarly, I construct a variable representing the number of persons
employed in medical occupations, per 10,000 of district population.25 I also construct
a control variable for the tonnage of imports passing through the major ports of
Britain, based on data from the Annual Statement of Trade and Navigation for 1865.
This is an important control because international trade played a role in the spread of
disease. Summary statistics for all of these variables are reported in Appendix A.2.3.



4     Analysis
This section begins with a discussion of the main identification issues that must be
addressed in the analysis and how I will deal with them. Next, I present baseline cross-
sectional results using district-level data from 1851-1860. I then look at evidence on
mortality for workers sharing the same occupational category, followed by an analysis
of the causes-of-death. Last, I study the evolving relationship between pollution and
mortality from 1851-1900 using county-level panel data.


4.1     Discussion of analysis issues

Selection: One potential issue in this analysis is the selection of less-healthy pop-
ulations into more polluted areas.26 This study offers two alternative approaches
These reflect the latitude and longitude for the main population or administrative center of each
district. For a few very rural districts, where there was no clear population or administrative center,
the geographic center was used.
  25
     The occupations included in this category are physicians, surgeons, other medical men, dentists,
nurses (not domestic) and midwives.
  26
     Selection is a common identification concern in this literature. This issue is particularly impor-
tant for the urban districts I study, which saw substantial in-migration from rural areas, as well as
Ireland and Scotland. One approach for dealing with selection issues is to take advantage of sharp
changes in local pollution levels and then look at the impact on health in the short-run, before
the population has time to re-sort. Examples of studies of this type include Chay & Greenstone
(2003) and Currie & Neidell (2005). However, it is difficult to capture the chronic effects related
to long-term exposure with an approach of this type. A unique alternative approach is offered by
Lleras-Muney (2010), who looks at health in military families, where compulsory relocation reduces
selection concerns. A third approach, taken by Chen et al. (2013), is to study China, where gov-


                                                  13
to addressing potential selection issues. First, I analyze death patterns within oc-
cupation categories (Section 4.3). Since occupation is a good indicator of income,
education, and class, this should substantially reduce selection issues. Second, I use
information on causes-of-death and compare the increase in respiratory mortality,
the category most closely associated with airborne pollution, to mortality due to all
other causes (Section 4.4). These estimates will be free of selection concerns under
the assumption that if less healthy populations select into more polluted areas, they
will be unhealthy across a range of disease categories.27
   Omitted variables: We may also be concerned that there are omitted variables
that are correlated with the local presence of polluting industries and also affect
mortality. One way to deal with this issue is by exploiting the cause-of-death data.
The cause-of-death results I present will be robust to omitted variables unless they
specifically affect respiratory disease mortality. Further evidence against omitted
variables is provided by the long-difference regressions (Section 4.5).
    Acute vs. chronic effects: Pollution can have both chronic effects, such as
lung diseases caused by long-term exposure to air pollution, and acute effects, such
as heart attacks related to a particularly bad pollution day.28 The mortality patterns
documented in this study will reflect both of these channels. Separating the chronic
and acute effects of pollution is an important direction for future research, but is
beyond the scope of this study.
    Migration: Migration and travel can potentially affect the results if people are
exposed to pollution in one location but die in another. In general, migration will bias
the estimated impact of pollution towards zero.29 As a result, the estimates described
in this study should be thought of as providing a lower bound on the true impact of
pollution on mortality. A related issue is that people from healthy areas may travel
into a more polluted area, die as the result of short-term pollution exposure, and

ernment restrictions reduce mobility between areas. For further discussion of selection issues in the
modern pollution and health literature, see Graff Zivin & Neidell (2013).
   27
      The use of cause-of-death data to address selection and omitted variables concerns in this context
is similar to the approach taken in previous work by Galiani et al. (2005).
   28
      A recent paper highlighting the acute effects of air pollution is Schlenker & Walker (2014).
   29
      To see why, suppose that regardless of the location of exposure, the location of death is random.
In that case I would estimate no relationship between pollution and mortality. In contrast, if the
location of death matches the location of exposure exactly then there will be no bias in the estimated
effects. In reality, my data will fall somewhere in between, implying that the estimated impact of
pollution will be biased towards zero.


                                                  14
be counted in the mortality figures for that district. This would be captured in the
estimated relationship between pollution and mortality, and rightly so, as it reflects
the acute effects of pollution.
    Income: We may be concerned that wage levels were lower in more polluting
industries, which could influence mortality. This concern will be dealt with along
with other selection effects. Moreover, evidence suggests that polluting industries
tended to pay high wages, and that, even within occupation, higher wages were paid
as a compensating differential in more polluted areas.30 Thus, if anything income
effects will exert a downward bias on the pollution effects I estimate.
   On-the-job mortality: We may be concerned that the results are picking up
other effects of industrial composition on mortality, such as on-the-job accidents.
This concern will be addressed by both the analysis of mortality within occupation
categories and by the cause-of-death results. A related issue is whether pollution
exposure occurs on-the-job or elsewhere. In this study I do not seek to differentiate
between these two types of exposure to pollution, though some evidence, such as
mortality for the very young, will reflect only exposure outside of the workplace.
    Residential pollution: Pollution from residential sources made a substantial
contribution to overall pollution during this period, particularly in London. However,
the results in this study are focused only on industrial pollution and should not be
interpreted as including the impact of residential pollution. The impact of residential
pollution will largely be captured by control variables, particularly population density,
as well as controls for region and latitude, which will capture a variety of factors that
can influence residential pollution levels including weather and local coal prices.



4.2     Baseline analysis, 1851-1860

The first step in the analysis is to decide upon the specific functional form used to
represent the relationship between pollution and mortality. An ideal measure should
reflect the intensity of the pollution exposure experienced by district residents. In
the main analysis, I will use two main measures of local industry pollution inten-
  30
     Wage data from Bowley (1972) are available in Appendix A.2.4. Evidence from (Williamson,
1981b, 1982) and Hanlon (2014) suggests that, even within occupations, workers were compensated
for living in more polluted locations with wages that were higher relative to the local cost of living,
though both of these studies find that the compensating differential was not too large.


                                                  15
sity: the log of coal use in a district and the log of dirty industry employment in a
district.31 Figure 3 describes the relationship between these pollution measures and
age-standardized mortality at the district level. For both pollution measures we ob-
serve a strong positive relationship to mortality. Moreover, the relationship appears
to be close to linear, suggesting that modeling pollution in this way is reasonable.
In addition, I will examine a range of alternative pollution measures and show that
these deliver similar results.

               Based on coal use                      Based on polluting industry employment




The pollution measures are based on the industrial composition of the districts in 1851. The mor-
tality rate is age-standardized and calculated using data from 1851-1860. The two outliers in the
top right of the graph are Liverpool and Manchester. The outlier in the top left of the graph is
Hoo, a rural district at the mouth of the Thames, directly downstream and downwind from London.
Districts in London are not included.



   Figure 4 provides maps of district-level age-standardized mortality, population
density, coal use, and dirty industry employment, the key ingredients in the present
study. All of these variables display similar geographic patterns, with high levels in
the industrial districts of Northwest England, as well as the areas around London,
Birmingham, Cardiff, Bristol, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and in Cornwall.

  31
    Because the pollution measures are in logs, this suggests a concave relationship between pollution
and mortality, which is consistent with existing evidence from Pope III et al. (2011) and Clay et al.
(2015).

Colors correspond to quantiles of each variable, where darker colors indicate higher values. I am
grateful to the Cambridge Project on The Occupational Structure of Nineteenth Century Britain
(funded by the Economic and Social Research Council) for their generosity in providing me with
shapefiles for the 1851 Registration Districts.




   Next, I undertake some simple cross-sectional regressions using pollution measures
based on the industrial composition of districts in 1851 and mortality data for 1851-
1860. The regression specification is,

                                               17
        M ORTd = β0 + β1 ln(DEN SIT Yd ) + β2 ln(P OLLd ) + Xd Λ + Rd + d ,                     (2)


where M ORTd is the average age-standardized mortality rate over a decade in thou-
sands of people per year in district d, DEN SIT Yd is the population density, P OLLd
is one of the measures of local pollution, Xd is a vector of control variables, and Rd
is a set of region indicator variables.32
    To ease the interpretation of the results, I standardize the ln(DEN SIT Yd ) and
ln(P OLLd ) variables, as well as the control variables for employment in water pro-
vision or medical services, to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one.
Because spatial correlation may be an issue here, I allow correlated standard errors
between any pair of districts within 50km of each other, following Conley (1999).33
    There may be a lag between the time at which pollution took place and when
the effect on mortality appeared. In the cross-sectional regressions presented in this
subsection this issue can largely be ignored because both pollution and mortality levels
are fairly stable from one decade to another. Also note that, because the variables
are in logs, the ψt term from Eq. 1 will be absorbed into the constant in Eq. 2.
    Table 3 presents baseline cross-sectional results. The first three columns look
separately at population density and the two pollution measures. Individually, each
of these has a positive and statistically significant relationship to mortality. Columns
4 and 5 each combine the population density variables with one of the pollution
measures. Columns 6-7 add in additional control variables for water and medical
services in each district, the amount of seaborne trade, latitude, and a set of region
indicator variables.
   The results with the full set of control variables, in Columns 6-7, suggest that
industrial pollution is associated with a mortality rate that is higher by just under
one death per thousand. For comparison, the average age-standardized mortality rage
across all districts (excluding London) was 19.6 deaths per thousand. The impact of
  32
     The regions are Southeast, Southwest, East, South Midlands, West Midlands, North Midlands,
Northwest, Yorkshire, Northern England, South Wales and North Wales.
  33
     I implement this using code provided by Hsiang (2010). I have explored allowing spatial corre-
lation over alternative distances and the results are not sensitive to reasonable alternatives. As an
alternative, I have also calculated results clustering by county. This does not have any meaningful
impact on the statistical significance of the results.


                                                 18
a one standard deviation increase in population density is just over 1.8 deaths per
thousand. This suggests that the impact of industrial pollution is more than half
as large as all of the other factors associated with density. Moreover, note that
the coefficient on population density drops from 2.5 when industrial pollution is not
included (Column 1) to 1.7-1.8 when industrial pollution is included in the regression
(Columns 4-7). This suggests that industrial pollution is explaining roughly one third
of the relationship between mortality and population density across districts. It is also
worth highlighting that including just the population density and industrial pollution
variables in the regression explains a substantial portion of the spatial variation in
mortality rates during this period.

    In the regressions described in Table 3, each district is treated as one observa-
tion with equal weight, regardless of district size. Alternatively, we may want to put

                                                19
greater weight on districts with larger populations. Appendix A.3.1 provides regres-
sion results obtained while weighting districts based on their average population size
over the decade. Weighting has relatively little impact on the results, due largely to
the fact that districts do not vary too much in size (as opposed to counties, where
variation is more important). Given the similarity between weighted and unweighted
regression results when using district data, for the remainder of this subsection I
present only results from unweighted regressions.
    In the results presented thus far, districts in London have been excluded because
they represent substantial outliers along a number of dimensions relative to the rest
of the country. In Appendix A.3.1 I present results mirroring those shown in Table
3 but including London. Results obtained when including districts in London are
similar to the results described above. I have also generated results allowing more
flexible population density controls. This does not substantially affect my findings.
    We may be concerned that the strong relationship between industrial pollution
and mortality observed in Table 3 is dependent on choices about the functional forms
used for the pollution variables. To check this, Table 4 presents estimates based on
a variety of alternative functional forms. Column 1 uses coal per worker. Column
2 uses the share of employment in heavily-polluting industries. Columns 3 and 4
use the log of coal use per acre and the log of dirty industry employment per acre,
respectively. Columns 5 and 6 include, separately, variables representing employment
in heavily polluting industries and in all other industries (“Clean emp.”).34
    All of these alternative functional forms suggests that industrial pollution had a
significant impact on mortality. In general, the magnitudes are all similar to those
obtained in Table 3, except that the results are particularly strong when using coal
per acre or dirty industry employment per acre. This may be because these are bet-
ter measures of pollution exposure in a district; however, because these variables are
highly correlated with population density there is some concern that the pollution
variables in Columns 3-4 are picking up some population density effects. In Columns
5 and 6, it is particularly interesting to see that, while employment in heavily pol-
luting industries is associated with increased mortality, employment in relatively less
polluting industries is strongly associated with lower mortality. This is consistent
with the reduction in mortality that we would expect to be associated with increased
  34
   Clean and dirty employment do not sum to district population because there is a substantial
unemployed population in each district, including children, elderly, and non-workers.

  Pollution measures are based on each district’s industrial composition in 1851. Other control
  variables include employment in water services per 10,000 population in 1851, employment in
  medical services per 10,000 population in 1851, latitude and seaport tonnage in 1865. Popula-
  tion density and all of the pollution measures are standardized.




     Regressions for specific age categories show that pollution effects are found among
both adults and young children (see Appendix A.3.1). One way to summarize the
impact of industrial pollution on mortality at different ages is by calculating the
impact on life expectancy. To do so, I begin by estimating the impact of industrial coal
use on mortality in the available age categories and then use the results to calculate
life expectancy given the average level of coal use in the data and life expectancy when
coal use is one standard deviation above the mean.35 This exercise suggests that in a
  35
    The nature of the data means that these life expectancy calculations are somewhat rough. Data
are only available at either five or ten-year age intervals. Also, I consider only years lived up to age
75 because the available mortality data become less reliable at older ages.

district with industrial coal use that is one standard deviation above the mean, life
expectancy at birth is lower by 1.27 years while life expectancy at age twenty is lower
by 0.18 years.36
    The results presented in this section reveal a strong relationship between industrial
pollution and mortality. This relationship may be due to the direct effects of pollution
on health or to the selection of less healthy populations into more polluted areas. We
may also be concerned about the role of omitted variables in this analysis. In the
next two subsections I offer two approaches that help me deal with these concerns.


4.3       Mortality within occupational categories

One way to deal with potential selection issues is to look at the geographic variation
in mortality for workers sharing the same occupational category. Information on mor-
tality by occupation and location is available from a special section of the Registrar
General’s report for 1851. This report lists the number of living workers and number
of deaths for 304 occupation categories for male workers aged twenty and above in 44
English & Welsh counties.37 These occupational categories are quite detailed.38
       To analyze these data I use the following regression specification,


               M Ric = β0 + β1 ln(DEN SIT Yc ) + β2 ln(P OLLc ) + Ii + ic ,                         (3)

where M Ric is the ratio of deaths in occupation i and county c per thousand liv-
ing workers in that occupation, Ii is a full set of occupation effects, and the other
variables are defined as before. Standard errors are clustered at the county level.39
These data do not include age information, so the dependent variable is not age-
  36
     The difference between these values reflects the substantial impact of pollution on child mortality,
as suggested by Table 20.
  37
     The number of counties available in these data is smaller than the number available in some
of the other county-level data sets because the Welsh data are reported only for North Wales and
South Wales, rather than for specific Welsh counties. London is not included in the analysis.
  38
     Some examples can be useful for illustrating this point. Within the legal profession, for ex-
ample, the data differentiate between Barristers, Solicitors, Other Lawyers, Law Clerks, and Law
Court Officers & Stationers. Among construction workers there are ten different categories, includ-
ing Carpenters & Joiners, Bricklayers, Plumbers & Painters, Paperhangers, Slaters, Masons, and
Plasterers. Among iron & steel workers there are separate categories for Anchorsmiths, Filemakers,
Cutlers, Needle makers, Boilermakers and numerous others.
  39
     Given the large sizes of the counties, using spatially correlated standard errors makes less sense
in this context than when dealing with the district-level data.


                                                   22
standardized. The regressions are weighted based on the population of living workers
in each occupation-county cell to account for the fact that observations will be noisier
in cells with fewer workers.
    Regressions are run on the full set of occupation data as well as on a more lim-
ited list of 89 non-industrial occupations that are found in substantial numbers in all
locations. This list include various agricultural workers, national and local govern-
ment workers, professionals (lawyers, doctors, teachers), businessmen, shopkeepers,
innkeepers, domestic servants, and messengers & porters.40 These occupations were
less related to local industrial structure, yet these workers were still be exposed to
the effects of local pollution.
    Table 5 presents results using all occupations, in Columns 1-2, and the set of non-
industrial occupations, in Columns 3-4.41 These results suggest that, even within
occupational categories, mortality was higher in counties with higher levels of indus-
trial pollution. When all occupations are included I find that a one standard deviation
increase in pollution raised mortality by 0.42-0.48 deaths per thousand among working
men twenty and over, which is equal to over 3% of mortality for this population. My
preferred results, in Columns 3-4, suggest that a one standard deviation increase in
pollution was associated with an increase in occupation-specific mortality of 0.86-0.92
deaths per thousand. Thus, a one standard deviation increase in industrial pollution
is associated with an 8% increase in overall mortality within these non-industrial oc-
cupations. In contrast, I find no evidence that density increased mortality among this
working adult population. This is consistent with the age results, which show that
most of the impact of density is concentrated among children and the elderly.
    To assess the impact of population sorting in these findings, we can compare to
results obtained while pooling workers from all occupations. These results, in Table
6, show that ignoring occupation leads to estimated pollution effects that are around
three times as large as those estimated within occupational categories. Thus, the
sorting of different types of workers into different locations has a substantial impact
on the estimated relationship between pollution and mortality.

    The occupation mortality data are explored in more detail in Appendix A.3.2.
In particular, I provide estimates of the pollution effect for 19 groups covering the
non-industrial occupation categories used in Columns 3-4 of Table 5. While data at
the occupation level are noisy, for a number of occupations I find a statistically sig-
nificant positive relationship to local industrial pollution, while none of the 19 show
a statistically significant negative relationship. Some occupation groups provide par-
ticularly interesting examples. Among clergy, for example, I find strong evidence
of higher mortality rates in counties with more industrial pollution. Similar results
are found for a number of professional occupations including lawyers, teachers, local
government employees, and businessmen. I also find statistically significant pollution
effects in a number of working-class occupational categories, including domestic ser-
vants, agricultural laborers, and gardeners. Thus, the impact of industrial pollution
does not appear to be confined only to the upper or the lower occupational classes.
   A second set of data describing mortality rates within occupational categories is
available for two types of workers, innkeepers and general laborers, for 1891-1900.
These data are particularly interesting because they report the cause-of-death for
these workers, information that is not available in the 1851 data. The data also
indicate whether the worker was located in an industrial area of the country.42 Thus,
they allow me to look at how mortality patterns differed between industrial regions
and the rest of England and Wales for workers within the same occupational category,
by cause-of-death.
   Using these data, I calculate the share of overall mortality for each cause-of-
death and then plot the difference between the share represented by that cause in
the industrial districts and the share due to that cause in England and Wales as a
whole. The results are shown in Figure 5. We can see that, even within occupations,
two respiratory-related causes of death – bronchitis and pneumonia – accounted for
a much larger share of overall mortality in the industrial districts of the country
than in the country as a whole. These results foreshadow the cause-of-death analysis
presented next.




  42
   These data were published in a special supplement included in the Supplement to the Registrar
General’s 65th Annual Report (1891-1900).

       Data from a special supplement to the Registrar General’s 65th Annual Report, Supplement
       II cover males aged 25-65. For two occupations, Innkeepers and General Laborers the data
       are reported for the industrial districts and the country as a whole. To generate this figure
       I calculate the share of total mortality represented by each cause of death in these two
       occupations, separately for the industrial districts and the country as a whole. I then
       plot the difference between the share of mortality represented by each cause of death in the
       industrial districts to that cause-of-death’s share in the country as a whole for each available
       cause-of-death category.




4.4        Cause-of-death analysis

In this section, I use cause-of-death data in order to isolate one of the channels through
which industrial pollution affected mortality in the 19th century. Specifically, I focus
on excess mortality due to respiratory diseases, the category that is the most closely
associated with the effects of airborne industrial pollution.43 The first step in this
analysis is to estimate the percentage increase in overall mortality associated with
industrial pollution:

             ln(T OT mortd ) = a0 + a1 ln(DEN SIT Yd ) + a2 ln(P OLLd ) + Xd Λ + Rd + d ,                (4)

  43
    See Rückerl et al. (2011) for one recent review of literature on this topic. For example, Pope III
(1989) studies the impact of the opening and closing of a steel mill in Utah Valley, in central Utah,
on particulate pollution and health. He finds that elevated particulate pollution levels (PM10)
were associated with increased hospital admissions for pneumonia, pleurisy, bronchitis, and asthma.
These diseases are the most important components of the respiratory mortality category in my data.


                                                     26
where the T OT mortd is the overall age-standardized mortality rate in district d. This
increase may be associated with the direct effects of pollution, selection effects, or
omitted variables.
       Next, I estimate the increase in the respiratory mortality category only, using,

            ln(RESP mortd ) = b0 + b1 ln(DEN SIT Yd ) + b2 ln(P OLLd ) + Xd Λ + Rd + d ,         (5)



where the RESP mortd is the age-standardized mortality rate in district d due to
respiratory diseases. I then define the difference b2 − a2 as the excess increase in
respiratory mortality due to the direct impact of pollution, i.e., the increase in res-
piratory mortality in excess of what we would expect given the patterns observed in
all cause-of-death categories.44
   In interpreting these results, it is important to remember that they reflect only
one potential channel through which pollution affects mortality. However, they are
valuable in that they allow us to isolate causal effects occurring through one important
channel. They also provide a very conservative lower-bound estimate of the causal
impact of industrial pollution on mortality during this period.
    Results are presented in Table 7. Columns 1-2 show that industrial pollution was
associated with an increase in respiratory mortality of 11.9% and an increase in mor-
tality in all cause-of-death categories of 5.3%. The difference between these implies
an excess increase in respiratory mortality of 6.6%. The average impact of respiratory
mortality across all districts is 2.36 deaths per thousand. Given this, the implied di-
rect effect of a one standard deviation increase in industrial pollution through excess

  44
     An alternative approach would be to compare the increase in respiratory mortality to the increase
in all non-respiratory causes of death. This would suggest larger effects than those described in this
section. The reason that I compare to total mortality rather than to non-respiratory mortality here
is that we may be concerned that increases in respiratory mortality could have resulted in a decrease
in other types of mortality, because people who died of respiratory diseases could not die from other
causes. By including respiratory deaths in the comparison group, the results I report are not subject
to a potential of upward bias through this channel. This is related to a larger issue of competing
risks. The competing risks concern is that the increase in respiratory mortality may be due entirely
to reductions in other types of mortality. This is a very difficult issues to fully address, however,
given that pollution is associated with increased mortality across many cause-of-death categories this
is unlikely to be a major concern in the context I study. The issue of competing risks is revisited in
Section 4.5.


                                                 27
respiratory mortality alone is equal to 0.16 additional deaths per thousand, or 0.8
percent of overall mortality. The results in Columns 3-4 suggest impacts of a simi-
lar magnitude. Similar results are obtained using alternative measures of industrial
pollution (see Appendix A.3.3).

         data are from 1851-1860. Pollution measures are based on each district’s in-
         dustrial composition in 1851. Other control variables include employment in
         water services per 10,000 population in 1851, employment in medical services
         per 10,000 population in 1851, seaport tonnage in 1865, and latitude. The
         population density and industrial pollution variables are standardized.




    I have also investigated the impact of pollution on respiratory mortality at dif-
ferent age levels (see Appendix A.3.3). For children under five, I find that industrial
pollution was associated with an excess increase in respiratory mortality of 8.8%. For
adults twenty and over, the effect is 7.6%. Using age-specific estimates of excess respi-
ratory mortality, I also calculate the impact of industrial pollution on life expectancy
through the excess respiratory mortality channel only. These estimates suggest that
a one standard deviation increase in industrial coal use reduces life expectancy at
birth by 0.24 years through this channel, and reduced life expectancy at age twenty
by 0.11 years. I will think of these figures as conservative lower bounds on the causal
impact of industrial pollution on life expectancy during this period.
   The results presented in this section isolate one direct channel – respiratory dis-

                                              28
eases – through which pollution effects mortality. Under reasonable assumptions,
these results will be free of bias due to population sorting or omitted variables. Even
when focusing solely on this channel, the implied impact of industrial pollution in lo-
cations such as Birmingham and Manchester, relative to the average district, amount
to three quarters of a year of life expectancy at birth.


4.5     Changing patterns over time, 1851-1900

Next, I examine how the impact of industrial pollution evolved over the second half of
the 19th century. To study this evolution I draw on county-level panel data covering
54 English and Welsh counties from 1851-1900.45 These data allow me to construct
a complete panel of pollution measures, mortality, and additional control variables.
    The analysis begins with cross-sectional regressions for each decade from 1851-
1900. These regressions are similar to the district-level results shown previously
except that, because of the smaller number of observations available, I apply a more
parsimonious expression that does not include region effects. Regressions are weighted
by county population to account for the substantial heterogeneity in county size. To
allow some serial correlation, standard errors are clustered by region.46
    Results obtained using the coal-use measure of industrial pollution are presented
in the top panel of Table 8.47 These results show that the impact of population
density on mortality was consistently declining across this period. By 1900, the impact
of population density on overall mortality had fallen by more than half, reflecting
substantial gains in improving health in British cities. In contrast, the impact of
industrial pollution does not show a clear pattern of decline over the period. There
is some evidence that the impact of pollution rose between 1851 and 1880 and then
began slowly falling.48 The bottom panel of Table 8 shows the estimates obtained
  45
     London is excluded because it is a substantial outlier during this period. Robustness results
including London are reported in the Appendix.
  46
     The eleven regions are the Southwest, Southeast, South Midlands, West Midlands, North Mid-
lands, East, Northwest, Yorkshire, North, South Wales and North Wales. Regions were official
designations for sets of similar and geographically proximate counties so this seems like a reasonable
unit for clustering. Calculating spatially correlated standard errors based on the location of the main
population or administrative center makes less sense in the context of counties, which are larger,
often contain multiple cities, and vary in size more than districts.
  47
     Results using the dirty industry employment measure are available in Appendix A.3.4.
  48
     This inverse U-shape is suggestive of an environmental Kuznets curve. However, this pattern is
dependent on the pollution measure used.


                                                  29
when I do not control for local industrial pollution. These estimates show the urban
mortality penalty falling across this period. Comparing the estimated effect of density
in the top and bottom panel shows that accounting for local industrial pollution
explains just under 40% of the relationship between mortality and population density
in 1851-1860 and nearly 60% of this relationship in 1891-1900.

    It is also possible to use cause-of-death patterns to identify the direct impact of

ity and respiratory mortality, respectively.50 Column 3 gives the difference between

       the overall mortality rate in each decade.




    In all decades there is evidence of a direct impact of industrial pollution on mor-
tality through respiratory causes, even after adjusting for the increase in all other
cause-of-death categories. The impact through this direct respiratory channel ap-
pears to have fallen only slightly over time, while the share of total mortality due to
excess respiratory mortality was stable across this half-century.51
  51
    These findings provide evidence against the concern that respiratory mortality may have been
over-reported in locations that were more polluted. If this type of misreporting were behind the
respiratory disease patterns I observe, then the impact of respiratory disease should be falling over
time as improved medical practice led to better cause-of-death reporting. The fact that the impact of
respiratory disease as a share of overall mortality was fairly stable over this 50 year period, which saw
huge improvements in medical practice, suggests that misreporting is not driving the cause-of-death
patterns I observe.


                                                    31
    The patterns described in Tables 8-9 can help us think about the relationship
between pollution and infectious diseases, and the role of competing risks, in this
setting. There are two ways that falling infectious disease mortality can interact with
pollution. On one hand, if respiratory diseases due to pollution and infectious diseases
are competing risks, then a fall in infectious disease mortality should increase the
impact of pollution through respiratory deaths. On the other hand, it may be the case
that encountering infectious diseases increases people’s susceptibility to pollution-
related respiratory diseases later in life (or vice-versa), so that falling infectious disease
rates should reduce the impact of pollution. The patterns described in Tables 8-9 are
more consistent with the latter of these two alternatives, i.e., pollution and infectious
diseases are likely to be complementary factors in generating mortality.
    Next, I exploit the time variation available in the data in order to assess the
impact of rising industrial coal use on mortality from 1851-1900 while controlling for
fixed locational features. The regression specification is,


               ∆t−τ,t M ORTdt = α0 + α1 ∆t−τ,t P OLLdt + ∆t−τ,t Xdt Γ + edt                     (6)

where ∆t−τ,t is a difference operator between periods t − τ and t, P OLLdt is the
industrial pollution measure, and Xdt is a set of control variables. Ideally, τ should
be as large as possible to limit the impact of P OLLd,t−τ on M ORTdt , which could bias
estimates of α1 . Thus, I run this regression using the longest available difference, so t
indicates the decade 1891-1900 and t − τ indicates the decade 1851-1860. Regressions
are weighted by county population and standard errors are clustered by region. I
consider only the pollution measure based on coal use in this analysis because it is
the only measure that allows for changes in pollution intensity within industries over
time.
    I use pollution per capita as the key explanatory variable in these regressions.
This is because, if I were to include separate coal use and population variables in
the long-difference regressions, these are both certain to be endogenously affected
by the change in the mortality rate.52 This issue will be less severe when focusing
on local pollution intensity per capita, where both the numerator and denominator
will be affected in a similar way. Moreover, as I will discuss below, it is possible to

  52
    The link between mortality and population growth is clear, while mortality will also affect coal
use by impacting local labor supply (Hanlon (2014)).


                                                32
construct a sufficiently strong instrument for pollution per capita, while no reasonable
instrument is available when the level of coal use and the level of population are
included separately.53
    To deal with potential endogeneity issues, I use an instrumental variables approach
following Bartik (1991). The instrument is,

                                               P redCOALd1891     COALd1851

where COALd1851 is coal use in county d in 1851, W ORKP OPd1851 is the working
population of the county in 1851, and the predicted coal use and working population
variables are given by,

                                                    X

Here Lid1851 is employment in industry i in county d in 1851 and GRi,−d is the growth
rate of industry i from 1851-1891 in all counties other than d. The first-stage regres-
sion results shown in Table 10 show that this procedure generates a sufficiently strong
instrument.

  53
     As suggested by Hanlon (2014), the Bartik approach does not provide a valid instrument when
the level of population in a county and the level of coal use are included as separate variables because
coal use generates an endogenous disamenity that negatively affects city growth, which in turn has
consequences for the growth of polluting industries.


                                                  33
    Table 11 presents the long-difference regression results. Column 1 provides basic
OLS estimates of the impact of rising coal use on overall mortality. These results
suggest that rising coal use intensity from 1851-1900 had a statistically significant
impact on overall mortality. Column 2 presents results for respiratory mortality
only. These estimates suggest that the impact of industrial pollution on respiratory
mortality, in percentage terms, was much stronger than the impact on all other causes
of death. Columns 3-4 present similar results but adding in controls for the change in
water and medical services employment at the county level. Adding these additional
controls has a negligible impact on the results.
    Column 5-6 present IV results using the Bartik instrument for the change in
county coal use intensity.54 The results in Column 5 suggest that rising coal use had
a somewhat stronger impact than the OLS results suggested. The fact that the IV
estimates are larger than the OLS estimates suggest that there were omitted factors,
such as local regulation, that generated a negative relationship between mortality
and local coal use intensity. Column 6 presents IV results for respiratory mortality.
The coefficient estimate suggests that industrial pollution had a larger impact on
respiratory mortality than on overall mortality, but this estimate is not precise enough
to draw strong conclusions. However, when I estimate results for respiratory mortality
in specific age categories I observe statistically significant increases in mortality at
every age from 25 to 75. Additional results are available in Appendix A.3.5.
   To interpret the magnitude of these estimated effects it is helpful to know that the
population-weighted rise in county coal use per person over this period was 0.91 tons.55
Thus, my preferred results, from Column 5, imply that rising coal use increased overall
mortality by 8%. The overall reduction in mortality over this period was 22%. This
suggests that the fall in overall mortality could have been substantially larger in the
absence of the increase in coal use intensity.




  54
     It is not possible to include controls for water or medical services in these regressions because
these variables are likely to be endogenous and no instrument is available. However, the results in
Columns 1-4 suggest that omitting these controls is not likely to have a substantial impact on the
estimated pollution coefficient.

 the county level. Good instruments are not available for the change in water or medical services so
 these are not included in the IV regressions. Regressions are weighted by 1851 county population.




    An alternative way to look at the impact of rising coal use is to consider life
expectancy. A rough estimate suggests that life expectancy at birth increased by 4.9
years between 1851-1900, while life expectancy at age twenty increased by 1.8 years.56
Using the estimated impact of coal use on mortality by age category obtained from
long-difference regressions, we can compare these figures to the gains that might have
been achieved had the increase in coal use been smaller.57 If Britain had managed to
hold coal use per capita at the levels observed in 1851 while all other factors affecting
health remained unchanged, estimates based on the IV specification suggest that life
expectancy at birth would have risen by 5.7 years while life expectancy at age twenty
would have increased by 3.1 years. Put another way, the IV results suggest that
eliminating the growth in coal use per worker, all else equal, would have increased life
  56
     I refer to these as rough estimates because they use only the mortality rates for ages available
in each of those years, which are often only available in ten year intervals. These calculations also
do not include life expectancy gains at ages over 75, where the mortality data are less reliable.
  57
     The estimated coefficients by age category that go into these calculations are available in Ap-
pendix A.3.5.


                                                 35
expectancy at birth by an additional 0.77 years and life expectancy at age twenty by
an additional 1.26 years. Most of these effects are due to respiratory disease mortality.
     If, instead, I consider only the impact of coal use through excess respiratory mor-
tality, I estimate that holding coal use intensity at 1851 levels would have increased
life expectancy at birth by an additional 0.57 years and life expectancy at age twenty
by an additional 0.35 years, on top of the gains actually achieved from 1851-1900.
This suggests that rising coal use offset over ten percent of the life expectancy gains
that might have been achieved during this period. These estimates should be largely
free of concerns related to selection and omitted variables.
     Of course, it may be unrealistic to consider a counterfactual in which the growth
of coal use intensity was eliminated while assuming that health was not affected
through other channels, such as rising income. A full accounting of the health effects
of reducing industrial coal use requires an estimate of the impact through these other
channels, something that is beyond the scope of this study. However, as the 1871
Coal Commission Report makes clear, there was substantial scope for efficiency gains
in industrial coal use during this period (see examples in Appendix A.1.3). While the
costs required for such gains were modest, this report argues that manufacturers had
little incentive to invest in more efficient processes and technologies because of the
cheapness of coal and lack of effective pollution regulation.
    Finally, it is possible to construct a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation of the
monetary cost of the additional mortality associated with rising industrial pollution.
As a starting point, I draw on value of life estimates for 1900 from Costa & Kahn
(2004) and Kim & Fishback (1993). These studies suggest a value of life ranging from
1,180-3,529 in 1900 GBP.58 Given a life expectancy of 44 years in 1900, this implies
a value of a life-year of 27-80 in 1900 GBP, equal to 60-175% of GDP per capita
in that year. Given my estimates for the causal effect of the increase in industrial
pollution intensity through excess respiratory mortality alone, this implies that the
monetary cost of the increase in coal use intensity from 1851-1900 was equal to at
least 0.33-1.00 of annual GDP in 1900. Note that this cost is equivalent to a wealth
effect, while GDP is a flow variable. If instead I use the estimate of the relationship

  58
    To be more specific, these studies suggest a value of life in 1900 ranging from 100,000 to 300,000
in 1990 US dollars. I convert these to 1900 GBP using the CPI deflator and taking the average of
the values obtained using the average annual exchange rate in each of the intervening years. The
deflators are available from measuringworth.com.


                                                 36
between industrial pollution and total mortality, the cost ranges from 0.45-1.35 of
annual GDP in 1900.



5    Conclusions

Due in part to lack of evidence, recent surveys of health and mortality during the 19th
century have largely ignored the role of pollution. Cutler et al. (2006), for example,
discusses the health effects of urbanization in Britain, but never directly addresses
pollution. In Deaton (2013), pollution merits only a passing remark (p. 94). Szreter
(2005) spends just one out of four hundred pages (p. 126) discussing the role of
pollution, and draws primarily on anecdotal evidence. Focusing on the U.S., Costa
(2013) describes Pittsburgh skies darkened by pollution, but argues that the lack of
reliable particulate data limit our ability to measure the impact of pollution, or to
assess the benefits generated as air quality improved. This study fills this gap in
the literature by providing broad-based and well-identified evidence of the impact of
industrial pollution on mortality in the 19th century. I find that industrial pollution
substantially increased mortality in 1851-1860, and that these effects grew as coal use
intensity rose from 1851-1900.
    How do the effects I measure compare to those observed in modern studies? In
general, it is difficult to answer this question because I do not observe direct measures
of pollution, the main explanatory variable in most modern work. However, it is
possible to conduct a rough comparison to the impacts found by Chen et al. (2013),
one of the few studies available for a highly-polluted environment. They estimate
that increased coal use for heating north of the Huai River in China from 1990-2000
reduced life expectancy by 5.5 years, which is equal to roughly 7.8% of total life
expectancy in China. Using my estimates for the relationship between industrial
pollution and total mortality in 1851-1860, a one s.d. increase in coal use lowered life
expectancy by 1.27 years, or 3.3% of total life expectancy. A three s.d. increase, as
was found in cities such as Manchester and Birmingham, lowered life expectancy by
3.8 years, or 9.8% of total life expectancy. Thus, these figures seem to be of similar
magnitude to those observed by Chen et al. (2013) for China. However, these figures
may be influenced by substantial sorting effects; if I focus only on excess respiratory
mortality, the impact of a one s.d. increase in coal use is equal to .24 years or 0.6%

                                           37
of total life expectancy. A three s.d. increase in coal use is associated with a loss
of 0.72 years of life, or 1.8% of total life expectancy. Relative to these conservative
causal estimates, the findings of Chen et al. (2013) seem high.
    While this paper documents the effects of local pollution, it is also likely that
pollution in one area may have affected mortality in other nearby districts. This
could have further implications for population sorting and the political economy of
pollution regulation. Understanding these spillovers is one promising direction for
future research.

A.1.1      Estimated pollution levels in London from 1700

While broad direct measures of pollution are not available for the historical period,
Brimblecombe (1987) has produced estimates of smoke concentrations for London
starting in 1700.59 These have been converted to total suspended particulate (TSP)
values, a standard pollution measure, by Fouquet (2008). Figure 6 plots these values.
These show that the period covered by this study covers the highest pollution decades
for London.

A.1.3   Details from the 1871 Coal Commission Report


The 1871 Coal Commission report, which stretches to over 1300 pages, was com-
missioned by Parliament in response to fears of a coal shortage in the early 1870s
(which ultimately turned out to be unfounded). This appears to be by far the most
comprehensive and detailed study of British coal mining and use undertaken during
the period I study. While much of this report is dedicated to estimating available
coal reserves, Committee B was chosen to, “inquire whether there is reason to believe
that coal is wasted by carelessness or neglect of proper appliances for its economical
consumption” (p. 93). Below I describe some of the most relevant findings of this
report.
   This Committee’s report begins by reviewing the substantial progress that had
been made in improving coal use efficiency among iron and steel producers, the largest
coal users in Britain. The report that substantial progress was made in this area:

                                           46
      All the evidence collected from the witnesses examined...go to prove, that
      in one way and another a saving of not less than 20 per cent. has been
      effected in the smelting of iron during the last ten years, and all the
      indications are, that yet increased economy will be effected in the future.
      (p. 99)


   At the same time, one witness, Mr. William Siemens, a civil engineer, suggests
that there was still huge scope for improvement through adoption of more efficient
technologies:


      ...there appears to be a saving of fuel [from using regenerative furnaces],
      which amounts in many cases to nearly 50 per cent. The cost however,
      of erecting the regenerative gas furnace is rather more than double that of
      the ordinary furnaces...it must be remembered, that of the 6,243 puddling
      furnaces at work in 1869 a very small number of them had adopted any
      arrangement for utilizing the waste heat, consequently even at the lowest
      estimate the loss of heat must be enormous. (p. 101)


   The committee then turns to the use of coal for generating steam power, which
was the main industrial use outside of the metal trades. Here the committee finds
substantial evidence of waste and inefficiency:


      ...we feel called upon to notice the enormous waste of heat, and conse-
      quently wasteful consumption of fuel, in a very large majority of the steam
      boilers used in this country; most especially such as are used in collieries
      and iron workers, through their being left to the influence of every change
      in the atmospheric conditions, quite exposed to winds, rains, and snows,
      when a slight covering of a non-conducting substance would, by protect-
      ing them, improve their steam producing power, and save a considerable
      quantity of coal. (p. 103)


They go on to state that,

                                          47
        The careless and wasteful manner of stoking in most of the coal-producing
        districts is not only a source of vast waste, but of extreme annoyance to
        all the surrounding neighborhood. Coal is piled upon the fire without any
        discretion, producing dense volumes of the blackest smoke, which is so
        much fuel actually thrown away; nor is the waste the worst part of it;
        vegetation is destroyed, or seriously injured, for miles, and that which
        acts so seriously on the plant cannot fail to be injurious to man. (p.103)

They also find that efficiency gains could have been achieved given the technologies
available at the time. Simple changes in the procedure for generating combustion
could have important effects:

        Without traveling beyond known principles, it was thought that a con-
        siderable saving of fuel could be effected. Imperfect combustion must be
        regarded as the first essential loss. The air is supplied so unskillfully that
        much passes into the chimney as hot air, carrying with it the vast quan-
        tity of unconsumed carbonaceous matter which we see escaping in black
        clouds from the top of the chimney. This imperfect combustion may be
        traced to the bad construction of the fireplaces, and to the reckless way
        in which coal is thrown into, and over, the mass of ignited matter in the
        fireplace. (p. 104)

Gains could also be achieved through insulating steam engines so to limit heat loss
and through improved boiler construction. For example, another witness, Mr. John
Hicks, M.P., provided evidence that (p. 104), “careful construction and a good system
of steam jacketing, a saving of something like 30 per cent. is said to be effected.”


A.1.4     Mortality background

Additional details on the changing mortality patterns in the second half of the 19th
century are provided in Table 12, which is adapted from Woods (2000). The first two
columns describe the number of deaths in England & Wales in different categories.
The third and fourth columns describe the number of years of life that would have
been gained had the cause of death been completely eliminated, which takes into
account both the number of deaths associated with the cause and the age at which
these deaths occurred. Some of the causes listed in Table 12 are specific to major

                                             48
diseases, such as tuberculosis, typhus, scarlet fever and measles. Many of the re-
maining deaths are gathered into general categories related to the systems that they
affected, such as respiratory diseases, neurological diseases, cardiovascular diseases,
and gastrointestinal diseases. These categories will include a variety of non-infectious
causes of mortality and they may also include some infectious diseases. For example,
the respiratory disease category includes bronchitis, pneumonia, influenza, etc.

         Data adapted from Woods (2000) p. 350.




   One important message from Table 12 is that, while the major infectious diseases
were important causes of mortality, they are not the whole story. Other causes,
particularly respiratory diseases, were also important.


A.2     Data appendix

A.2.1    Assessing the stability of relative industry coal use

This subsection provides an analysis of the stability of relative coal use intensity
across industries. This is done by comparing industry coal use intensity in 1907 to
values from the next Census of Production, which was taken in 1924. Using these
two Census observations, Figure 12 looks at how much the relative coal intensity of

                                           49
industries changed over time. We can see that coal use per worker has shifted down
for all industries, but that the slope is indistinguishable from zero, suggesting that
there has been no clear change in relative industry coal use intensity over this period.
I.e., while efficiency gains were made in overall coal use, the relative coal intensity of
industries was remarkably stable over time.

A.2.2    Comparing to 1871 county-level coal use

As an additional check of the coal use measure I have constructed, I compare county-
level industrial coal use calculated using my methodology to estimates for 1871 based
on data from the House of Commons, Report of the Commissioners Appointed to
Inquire into the Several Matters Relating to Coal in the United Kingdom. That report,
which was prompted by fears of a coal shortage in the early 1870s, included a survey

                                           50
of industrial coal use in a selection of English counties. Within each county, circulars
were sent to firms asking them about their coal use. Using the resulting reports,
and adjusting for the number of circulars returned in each county, I am able to
calculated industrial coal use levels in the counties surveyed, though these figures
will be imperfect because only major industrial establishments were surveyed. I then
compare these estimates to results obtained by applying my methodology to county-
level industrial employment data from the 1871 Census of Population combined with
industry coal use intensity measures from the 1907 Census of Production.
    Figure 13 describes the results for the set of available counties. In this graph, the
y-axis describes county-level coal use constructed from the 1871 Coal Commission
report while the x-axis gives the county coal use estimated using the methodology in-
troduced in this paper. In general, the points lie close to the 45 degree line, suggesting
that my methodology does a reasonable job of matching the estimates obtained using
the data from the Coal Commission report. The methodology used in this paper does
particularly well for the larger and more industrial counties. The greatest differences
occur in the more rural counties with low levels of coal use, where my methodology
overestimates industrial coal use relative the the figures from the 1871 Coal Com-
mission report. However, these are also the counties where the figures from the Coal
Commission report are most likely to understate county coal use because smaller in-
dustrial establishments, which were omitted from the Coal Commission report, are
likely to form a more important coal user in less industrialized counties. Overall,
these results provide additional evidence that the methodology used to calculated
industrial coal use in this paper delivers reasonable results.

              Figure 13: Comparing county industrial coal use in 1871




   Another way to compare these two measures of coal use is to look at their relation-
ship with mortality. This is done in Table 13, where I run cross-sectional regressions
of mortality in 1871-1880 on each of the two coal use measures. Because of the
small number of available observations, I do not include additional controls in these
regressions.
    Columns 1-2 present results for total mortality using, respectively, the coal use
measure introduced in this paper and coal use based on the 1871 Coal Commission
Report. We can see that these two coal use measures deliver very similar results.
Note that these estimates differ somewhat from those shown in Table 8 because we
observe only a subset of English & Welsh counties. Columns 3-4 present results for
respiratory mortality only. Again, the results are very similar. Overall, these findings
suggest that regressions run using the coal use measure introduced in this paper
deliver results that are very similar to those obtained using coal use estimates based
on the 1871 data.

A.2.4    Industry wage data

Table 16 contains data from Bowley (1900), Wages in the United Kingdom in the
Nineteenth Century (p. 132), describing relative industry wage levels over time. We
can see that the most polluting industries on this list, iron and mining, paid relatively
high wages compared to less polluting industries.

A.3.1    Additional results for district mortality in 1851-1860

Table 17 presents regression results where each district is weighted by district popu-
lation (Columns 1-2) or the log of district population (Columns 3-4). In general we
can see that these results suggest pollution impacts that are fairly similar, though
slightly larger, than those reported in the main text.

          data for the decade 1851-1860. Pollution measures are based on each district’s
          industrial composition in 1851. Analytical weights are based on average district
          population over the decade. The population density, coal use, dirty industry
          employment, water services, and medical services variables are standardized.




    Table 18 presents results in which I include both population density and popu-
lation density squared terms. These results suggest that controlling for population
density in a more flexible way has little impact. This is consistent with the pattern

                                               55
observed in Figure 1, which suggests that the relationship between mortality and
population density is close to linear.

    Table 19 presents estimates from cross-sectional regressions on data from 1851-
1860 while including London districts in the data. In general these results are quite
similar to those reported in the main text, suggesting that my findings are not sensitive
to excluding London from the analysis. Also note that the standard errors in these
regressions tend to be larger, reflecting the fact that several of the London districts
are substantial outliers in the data.

    Table 20 provides additional results looking specifically at the impact of pollution
on children under age five and adults aged twenty and over. These results show that
pollution was associated with higher mortality both for children and adults. The
increase in mortality per thousand is much larger for children, who have much higher
mortality overall. Relative to the average overall mortality rate for children (54.8
per thousand), a one standard-deviation increase in local coal use is associated with
roughly a 16% increase in mortality. For adults, where the average age-standardized
mortality rate is 16.9, the same increase in coal use is associated with a 6% increase
in overall mortality.

    Figure 14 presents the estimated coefficients on the coal use and density terms from

pollution increased mortality both for children and for adults over 35. Population
density shows a similar pattern of effects, but with larger impacts for the very young.

This subsection presents additional results for mortality within occupational cate-
gories. Table 21 presents results for a number of specific non-industrial occupation
groups that are found in substantial numbers across most locations. Because mor-
tality in these categories comes from only one year, there will be substantial noise
in the data. Despite this, a number of these non-industrial categories display statis-
tically significant increased mortality in locations with more industrial coal use. At
the same time, not one of them shows a statistically significant lower mortality rate
associated with industrial pollution. Also, once I control for occupation, I find very
little evidence that density substantially affected mortality among the working age
males in these data.
    The effects of pollution appear among low-skill occupation categories, such as
agricultural laborers and domestic servants, as well as high-skill categories such as
clergy, lawyers, teachers, and local government officials. This suggests that the effects
of pollution were not limited only to the lower classes.
    From the coefficients estimated on the constant terms we can see that the underly-
ing level of mortality varies substantially across these different groups. One factor that
will contribute to this variation is the fact that it is not possible to age-standardize
the data. Variation in the average age across occupations can help explain why we
observe such low mortality rates in occupations like agricultural laborers and domes-
tic servants, where most of the workers would have been young men, and higher rates
among occupations requiring more years of education, such as lawyers and doctors.
    Table 22 and 23 provide some additional results calculated while including London
in the data. The magnitude of the estimated pollution effects are reduced in these
results, but the basic patterns are unchanged. This is likely due to the fact that, while
London had very high death rates, the level of industrial pollution was low compared
to what we would expect given the population size.

A.3.3    Additional cause-of-death analysis results

This subsection presents some additional regression results related to the analysis of
causes-of-death. In Table 24, I look at the impact of industrial pollution on respiratory
and other mortality causes separately for adults twenty and over and children under
five. For both of these age groups, industrial pollution had a stronger impact, in
percentage terms, on respiratory mortality than on other mortality causes.

         for the decade 1851-1860. Pollution measures are based on each district’s in-
         dustrial composition in 1851. Other control variables include employment in
         water services per 10,000 population in 1851, employment in medical services
         per 10,000 population in 1851, seaport tonnage in 1865, and latitude. The
         population density and pollution variables are standardized. Adult mortality
         is age-standardized.




    Figure 15 presents age-specific estimates of the effect of pollution on respiratory
and total mortality. Together, these values are used to obtain the age-specific excess
respiratory mortality effect of pollution which is then used in calculating the impact
of excess respiratory mortality on life expectancy.
   Table 25 describes results for total mortality and respiratory mortality obtained
using an alternative pollution measures.

These figures present coefficient estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the estimated
coefficient on Ln(Coal use) in age-specific regressions. The top panel presents results when
the dependent variable is Ln(Respiratory mortality) while the bottom panel presents results
when the dependent variable is Ln(Total mortality). The difference between these two
coefficients is age-specific excess respiratory mortality.

A.3.4    Additional cross-sectional results for each decade from 1851-1900

This subsection presents additional results looking at the evolution of the mortality
effects of pollution from 1851-1900 using cross-sectional regressions. Table 26 presents
regression results for each decade from 1851-1900 using county level data and the
pollution measure based on dirty industry employment. As in the main results, we
observe a consistent decrease in the impact of population density on mortality over
time. The impact of industrial pollution remains stable over this period, but unlike
the results presented in the main text, we do not observe evidence of an inverted
U-shaped relationship in the impact of industrial pollution over time.

A.3.5     Additional long-difference regression results


This subsection presents additional long-difference regression results. Table 30 pro-
vides results when London is included in the data. In general these result are similar
to those described in the main text, though I now find statistically significant ev-
idence that respiratory mortality increased as a result of rising industrial coal use
when using the IV specification.

    Figure 16 describes age-specific long-difference regression results. These estimates
show that increasing coal use raised mortality, and that these effects were concentrated
in older age categories. It is somewhat surprising that we don’t see any evidence that
rising coal use intensity affected mortality among young children. The most likely
explanation for this pattern is that one of the main impacts of coal use on the mortality
of children was through increasing their vulnerability to infectious diseases. Because
infectious diseases fell dramatically over the 1851-1891 period, the impact of coal
use on child mortality through this channel would have been substantially reduced.
Some support for this hypothesis is provided by Figure 17, which focuses only on
mortality due to respiratory diseases. The estimates in Figure 17 provide evidence
that rising coal use did increase child mortality due to respiratory diseases, though
the IV estimates for child mortality are imprecise.
   The estimates shown in these figures are used to calculate the impact of rising coal
use on life expectancy through either total mortality or excess respiratory mortality.
