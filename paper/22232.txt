Non-durable Consumption and Housing Net Worth in the Great Recession: Evidence from
Easily Accessible Data

                                          ABSTRACT

In an influential paper, Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2013) exploit geographic variation to measure the
effect of the fall in housing net worth on household expenditures during the Great Recession.
Their widely-cited estimates are based on proprietary house price and proprietary expenditure
data and therefore not easily replicable. We use alternative data on a subset of non-durable goods
and on house prices, which are more easily accessible, to replicate their study. When estimating
their same specification on our data, we obtain values for the elasticity of expenditures to the
housing net worth shock that are virtually indistinguishable from theirs. However, our robustness
analyses with respect to alternative model specifications yield more nuanced conclusions about
the separate roles of house prices and initial housing exposure/leverage for the drop in
expenditures. Moreover, the estimated elasticity is consistent, theoretically and quantitatively,
with a simple calibrated model with wealth effects where leverage and credit constraints play no
role.

1   Introduction

One of the most distinctive features of the Great Recession was that the drop in household
consumption expenditures was sharper, broader, and more persistent than in other recent
downturns. Virtually all components of consumption expenditures, not just durables,
dropped substantially (Petev, Pistaferri, and Eksten, 2012). The leading explanation for
these aggregate dynamics is the extraordinary decline in housing net worth that occurred
during this period: aggregate real house price indexes fell by around 30 percent. How-
ever, other factors could have simultaneously affected expenditures over that same pe-
riod, including a depressed labor market, a spike in economic uncertainty, and a tighten-
ing of consumer credit.
    To what extent was the drop in housing wealth alone responsible for the decline in
US household consumption expenditures during the Great Recession? A reliable an-
swer to this question helps shape the way that economists think about key issues such
as consumption insurance, the sources of aggregate fluctuations, and the role of policy in
mitigating the costs of business cycles.
    In a widely influential paper, Mian et al. (2013) — hereafter referred to as MRS — ex-
ploit geographic variation in house price declines over the period 2006-2009 and in initial
household balance sheets in 2006 to estimate the elasticity of consumption expenditures
to changes in the housing share of household net worth. Their estimates are derived from
both OLS regressions and IV regressions that use the local housing supply elasticity index
constructed by Saiz (2010) as a source of variation in the exposure of different geographi-
cal areas to a common aggregate housing shock.
    House price data in the MRS empirical analysis are obtained from CoreLogic. Their
key source of expenditure data is the R.L. Polk dataset on new vehicle registrations, which
reflects a durable good. They also report estimates using credit-card spending from a 5%
random sample of MasterCard holders. From this latter source of data, they can quantify
the effect of the shock on a range of non-durable goods and services.
    All of the data used by MRS come from proprietary sources. This feature has im-
peded other researchers from replicating their findings and verifying the robustness of
their estimates. A consensus is emerging in economics that empirical research should be
as transparent and replicable as possible, especially in the context of important conclu-
sions (Burman, Reed, and Alm, 2010; Cochrane, 2015, 2016; Card, Chetty, Feldstein, and
Saez, 2010). Given the enormous influence that the MRS estimates have had on academia
and policy, the main goal in this paper is to revisit the MRS findings.


                                            1
    The first part of our replication exercise consists of constructing alternative data on
housing net worth and expenditures, which is either publicly available or more easily
accessible, and re-estimating their same specifications on these new data. This exercise is
as close as we can get to pure replication, in the language of Hamermesh (2007).
    To construct our measure of local housing net worth, we use house price data from Zil-
low, which is freely available online. For expenditures, we use store-level sales of a sub-
set of non-durable goods from the Kilts-Nielsen Retail Scanner Dataset (KNRS), a panel
dataset on quantities sold and sale prices at the UPC (barcode) level for around 40,000
geographically dispersed stores in the US. Subscriptions to KNRS data are now held by
nearly 100 academic institutions worldwide and are available for academic research for a
non-prohibitive fee.
    Despite the data differences, our findings are incredibly reassuring. When we estimate
the MRS specification using our data sources, we obtain an OLS estimate of 0.24 and an
IV estimate of 0.36 for the elasticity of non-durable expenditures to housing net worth
shocks. When we use the KNRS expenditure data together with a measure of the change
in the housing share of net worth provided by MRS, we obtain an OLS estimate of 0.34
and an IV estimate of 0.37. Using MasterCard data on only non-durables, MRS report
OLS estimates of 0.34-0.38 – essentially the same elasticity that we find when using the
same data on housing net worth. Our lower baseline estimate can, therefore, be attributed
to our use of Zillow house price data, which shows a somewhat different cross-regional
pattern of house price growth than the CoreLogic house price data. Overall, we find
it very encouraging that two very different measures of household spending yield such
similar elasticity estimates.
    We conclude this first part by leveraging a key advantage of the KNRS expenditure
data relative to transaction-level data, i.e., the ability to separate changes in price from
changes in quantity. The price component, as noted by Stroebel and Vavra (2014), can
be interpreted as the outcome of demand shocks on local mark-ups. The quantity com-
ponent measures the impact of shifts in household wealth on the real demand for non-
durable goods, including the substitution and income effects that result from the equilib-
rium change in prices. We estimate an elasticity of quantities to housing net worth that is
20% smaller than our baseline estimates using nominal expenditures.
    In the second part of our exercise, we assess the sensitivity of the MRS findings to
alternative empirical specifications. Namely, we propose specifications where we can
distinguish the effect of changes in house prices from the effect of initial exposure to
housing, i.e., the initial housing share of net worth, and initial leverage. Much of the


                                             2
narrative and the interpretation of the results in MRS is linked to the role of household
debt and leverage. We find that the expenditure elasticity with respect to house prices is
always statistically significant. In contrast, the expenditure elasticity with respect to initial
housing exposure and initial leverage is at most weakly significant, after controlling for
the direct effect of the fall in local house prices. There are several possible interpretations
for this result that we discuss at length in the paper.
    Empirical macroeconomics is grounded in theory. Replication in empirical macroeco-
nomics should, therefore, also reassess the structural interpretation of the original spec-
ification used by the authors. Following Berger, Guerrieri, Lorenzoni, and Vavra (2015)
closely, we use conventional consumption theory to derive a structural interpretation of
the reduced form regression specification proposed by MRS. Our theoretical analysis in-
dicates that the MRS specification can be interpreted as a pure housing wealth effect,
without any role for leverage or credit constraints. This micro-foundation also provides a
back-of-the-envelope calculation for the value of the elasticity of consumption to housing
net worth shocks. This alternate measurement yields values for the elasticity in agree-
ment with the micro estimates.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the issue of
replication in empirical macroeconomics. Section 3 describes our data. Section 4 ana-
lyzes robustness of the MRS estimates with respect to alternative data and Section 5 with
respect to alternative model specifications. Section 6 concludes.


2   Replication in empirical macroeconomics

There is a growing consensus among economists that transparency of empirical research
should be an important goal for the profession, particularly when it concerns high profile
findings that become influential in both academic and policy circles (Burman et al., 2010;
Cochrane, 2015, 2016; Card et al., 2010). This view is in line with the recent recognition of
the importance of replicability in the physical sciences and other social sciences (Begley
and Ioannidis, 2015; Munafò, Nosek, Bishop, Button, Chambers, Du Sert, Simonsohn, Wa-
genmakers, Ware, and Ioannidis, 2017; Nosek, Alter, Banks, Borsboom, Bowman, Breck-
ler, Buck, Chambers, Chin, Christensen et al., 2015).
     There are different meanings of replicability and various types of replication stud-
ies. Hamermesh (2007) draws a useful distinction between pure replication, in which the
same data and methods are used to verify the findings of existing research, versus sci-
entific replication, in which the key idea or conclusion put forth in existing research is


                                               3
re-examined using either different data or different methods.
    With respect to scientific replication, Alm and Reed (2015, p. 141) emphasize the im-
portance of reproducing the findings of the original study by using the same methods
and data used by the original authors. This is a key component of replication because it
gives readers confidence that any failure to confirm the results of the original study are
not due to the inability of the replicating authors to implement the original authors’ ap-
proach correctly. The well-known work of Young (2019) on the robustness of estimated
treatment effects in RCTs is a prominent example of this type of exercise. After replicating
the findings of the original study, Young explores robustness with respect to regression
design, in particular the role of outliers.
    Our exercise falls under the category of scientific replication, for two reasons. First, the
data used in the original MRS study is proprietary, and thus a pure replication would be
difficult, if not impossible, to implement. To circumvent this issue, we combine various
sources of alternative data, all freely or easily accessible, and replicate the analysis of
MRS on these alternative data. The data on house prices and expenditures, which we
discuss in the next section, are of comparable quality, with some advantages and some
disadvantages relative to the data used by MRS. One notable advantage of the KNRS
expenditure data compared to the credit card transaction data used in MRS is that they
allow disentangling price (e.g., mark-ups) vs. quantity effects, which is an important
distinction for interpreting the findings.
    Moreover, for research in economics —- particularly those concerning macroeconomic
issues –– often the main findings concern the relative importance of different economic
mechanisms, rather than the magnitude of particular estimated parameters. Such conclu-
sions are often arrived at by combining empirical estimates with a particular theoretical
framework adopted by the authors. Indeed, it is often the case that the chosen theoretical
framework guides the choice of empirical methodology and the specification. For this
type of research, we view scientific replication even more broadly. We view replication
to include using alternative theoretical frameworks to interpret the same empirical esti-
mates and to suggest different empirical specifications consistent with such alternative
frameworks. In the context of our replication, we argue that from the point of view of
standard consumption theory, the MRS specification and the estimated values of the elas-
ticity of expenditure to housing can be reconciled with an economic mechanism based on
wealth effect, without any role for leverage and credit constraints which, instead, featured
prominently in the narrative surrounding the MRS findings.
    Finally, we note that one of the central issues in the debate around the MRS estimates

is the validity of the Saiz (2010) housing supply elasticities as an instrument for regional
differences in house prices. We abstract from this point in our analysis. Although we
think that this is an extremely important issue, a number of existing papers have already
discussed potential endogeneity problems (Davidoff, 2013).


3     Data sources

3.1     Expenditure data
We use data on store-level sales from the Kilts-Nielsen Retail Scanner Dataset (KNRS) as
our measure of non-durable expenditures. The KNRS is a weekly panel dataset of total
sales at the UPC (barcode) level for around 40,000 geographically dispersed stores in the
United States. The survey records both quantities and prices. From this weekly-UPC level
data, we construct an annual store-level panel of total sales. We also aggregate sales across
all stores in each Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA) to obtain a measure of CBSA-level
expenditures.1
    Table 1 shows the breakdown of goods sold at stores in the KNRS sample by depart-
ment code in 2006.2 The KNRS bundle is mostly composed of non-durables and is over-
weighted in food, but also contains non-food grocery (e.g., detergents and laundry sup-
plies), health and beauty aids (e.g., cosmetics and drugs), and a residual category called

general merchandise that includes some small household durables (e.g., cookware, elec-
tronics, office supplies).3
    The type of goods covered by the data is unchanged when we restrict attention to
stores present in both 2006 and 2009 and to stores located in CBSAs for which we have
data on housing net worth (i.e., the sample used for our baseline estimates). According
to the KNRS data manual (Kilts Center for Marketing, 2014), in 2011, the expenditures
reflected in the raw data cover 53% of total sales in food, 55% of drugs, 32% of mass
merchandise and 1% of liquor.
    Retail sales in KNRS are a good proxy for non-durable spending in terms of aggre-
gate time-series variation and geographic cross-sectional variation.4 The left panel of
Figure 1 shows a time-series plot of annual expenditures in the KNRS sample for the
subset of stores that are always present in the data, together with various categories of
consumption expenditures from the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA, Ta-
ble 2.3.5). Between 2006 and 2009, nominal growth in KNRS sales lies between growth
in Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) in non-durables goods and growth in PCE
in non-durables goods and services (excluding gasoline and other energy goods, whose
price plummeted in the recession). Growth during 2010-11 is also aligned well with these
measures. The only significant discrepancy occurs in 2009-10 when KNRS expenditures

   3 Nielsen  also collects information on goods that do not have UPCs (known as Magnet data). These
goods are excluded from our analysis.
   4 In Section 4.1, we also show that the KNRS bundle accounts for roughly 40 percent of expenditures in

non-durable goods and services.

                                                                             6
are flat whereas NIPA expenditures rise.5
    The right panel of Figure 1 shows a scatter plot of the state-level 2006-09 change in
expenditures in the KNRS data versus the NIPA data (state-level is the finest level of
geographic aggregation for expenditure data that is published by NIPA). The correlation
between these growth rates is 0.54.
    Since we conduct our analysis using store-level changes in sales, we effectively con-
trol for changes in the composition of stores in a given region across years. None of our
findings are affected by restricting attention to stores that are present for all intermediate
years. There is still the concern that variation in entry and exit of stores —especially exit,
over this recessionary period — differentially affects sales growth of continuing stores
across areas and generates an attenuation bias in our estimates. For example, areas with
the largest drop in house prices may be those with the sharpest rise in store exit, which,
in turn, mitigates the drop in sales in continuing stores as households shift their shop-
ping towards surviving stores. To verify whether this is a serious concern, we have also
repeated our analysis by aggregating store sales at the broader CBSA-level. None of our
main results are affected.6

3.2    From the KNRS bundle to total non-durables
A possible concern throughout our empirical analysis is that our measure of expenditures
obtained from the KNRS data may be rather narrow. One may worry that these categories
could display different dynamics from total non-durable expenditures. In this section,
we use the Consumption Expenditure survey (CE) to estimate the elasticity of total non-
durables to a subset of expenditures that is as close as possible to the KNRS bundle.
This number can then be used to rescale the various expenditure elasticities to changes
in housing net worth estimated in the previous sections. The implicit assumption we are
making is that the unconditional correlation between total non-durables and the KNRS
bundle that we estimate is close enough to the correlation conditional on the housing net
worth shock.




   5 Our  analysis focuses almost exclusively on the period 2006-09, during which the trends in KNRS ex-
penditures and NIPA expenditures are closely aligned.
    6 That our results are not affected by aggregating to the CBSA-level also mitigates any potential concerns

about store-switching among continuing stores. Such store-switching would at worst lead to measurement
error in the dependent variable which would affect the precision of our estimates but would not introduce
additional bias.

bundle. Source CEX.


    Our aim is to estimate

                               log citND = Dt + β00 Xit + β 1 log citKN + ε it ,                            (1)

where Dt are time dummies, Xit are a set of controls, and citND and citKN are expenditures
on non-durables and the KNRS bundle, respectively. The elasticity of interest is β 1 .
    Our starting point is the sample constructed from the Diary Survey (DS) of the CE
by Attanasio, Battistin, and Ichimura (2005).7 The DS is a cross-section of consumer units
asked to self-report their daily purchases for two consecutive one-week periods by means
of product-oriented diaries. Each diary is organized by day of purchase and by broad
classifications of goods and services. Compared to the more commonly used Interview
Survey (IS), where households are retrospectively asked for their usual expenditure in
the last quarter, the key advantage of the DS component of the CE is that expenditures
on the goods we are interested in — specifically, the KNRS bundle which is the indepen-
dent variable of regression — are much more accurately measured.8 This is an important
consideration for us since the attenuation bias from measurement error tends to artifi-
cially reduce the estimate of the elasticity of total non-durables to KNRS expenditures,
the coefficient β 1 in (1).
    The sample in Attanasio et al. (2005) covers a large set of items belonging to non-
durable goods and services for survey years 1986-2001, i.e. the period preceding the
boom-bust. Based on their detailed classification, we define KNRS consumption as the
sum of food and non-alcoholic beverages at home, alcohol, personal care, and housekeep-

    7 We refer the reader to their paper for a description of the data.  For an even more detailed presentation,
see Battistin (2003). We thank Erich Battistin for sharing the data.
    8 The insight of the Attanasio et al. (2005) paper is precisely that of using the DS measures for frequently

purchased goods and the IS measures for more durable goods and services in order to measure changes in
consumption inequality over time more accurately.

ing products. This definition is close to the aggregate of the items included in the KNRS
data described in Section 2. For total non-durables we use two definitions. ND goods in-
clude, in addition to the KNRS goods, clothing and footware, tobacco, books, newspapers
and magazines. This set of goods is close to the NIPA definition of non-durable goods,
excluding energy (NIPA Table 2.4.5). The second variable we construct, ND goods and
services, also includes food away from home, clothing services, entertainment, communi-
cation services, and transportation.9
    In our DS sample, median KNRS expenditures are 72 (39) percent of median spending
in ND goods (ND goods and services). For comparison, the same calculation from the
NIPA Table 2.4.5 for 2000 yields 70 (39) percent.
    In the regression (1) we control for year dummies (which capture changes in the rel-
ative price of the KN bundle to total non-durables) as well as an equivalence scale, a
polynomial in age, and indicator variables for family type, race, education, and region.
    The estimates in Table 2 suggest that the elasticity of non-durable expenditures to the
KNRS bundle varies between 0.68 and 0.90, depending on how broad the definition of
non-durable expenditures is. Thus the estimated elasticities of expenditures to housing
wealth obtained in the following sections should be reduced by around 10 to 30 percent
when interpreting them in terms of the effects on total non-durable expenditures.

3.3    Housing and financial net worth data
The second important variable in our analysis is household net worth, which we construct
for the years 2006-2010. We define household net worth in region i at date t as

                                      NWti = Hti + Fti − Mti − Dti

where Hti is housing wealth, Fti is financial assets, Mti is mortgage debt, and Dti is non-
mortgage household debt.
   We now explain how we construct each of these variables. Each region i is a county,
which we later aggregate into CBSAs.
   Financial assets: We follow the corresponding calculation in MRS. From the quarterly
IRS Statistics of Income (SOI) data, we obtain the fraction of non-wage income (Adjusted
Gross Income - wages and salaries) coming from interest and dividends for each county.

   9 With  respect to the NIPA definition of total services, we therefore exclude expenditures on housing,
health care, education, financial and insurance services. As pointed out by Attanasio et al. (2005) and
Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston (2008), these services are more durable in nature and more closely resemble
investment and saving activities than non-durable expenditures.

                                                     9
Next, we allocate total financial assets from the Flow of Funds (FoF) Balance Sheet of
Households to each county/quarter based on the fraction of interest and dividends in
each county/quarter. The implicit assumption is that the representative household in
each county/quarter holds the market index for stocks and bonds.
    Housing wealth: We compute the total number of houses by county from the Ameri-
can Community Survey (ACS) and generate housing wealth by multiplying them by the
Zillow Home Value Index for All Homes. We verify that total housing wealth lines up
well with its FoF counterpart for this period.
    The Zillow data are publicly available from http://www.zillow.com/research/data.
In constructing housing wealth, MRS use the CoreLogic house price price index, which
is based on proprietary data. This is the most important discrepancy between our data
sources and those in MRS for the construction of household net worth. The main differ-
ence between CoreLogic and Zillow is that the former is a repeat-sale index, whereas the
latter is a hedonic price index that also includes sales of new homes. There are pros and
cons to both approaches, as discussed in Fleming and Humphries (2013). The left panel
of Figure 2 shows a strong time-series correlation between the two aggregate house price
indexes, although the CoreLogic data show both a larger boom and larger bust than the
Zillow data. The right panel of Figure 2 shows annual house price growth for selected US
states according to the two price series for the year ending 2013. For some areas, there are
sizable differences in price growth between the two series.
    Liabilities: Our main source of data on household debt by county is the quarterly
FRB-NY Consumer Credit Panel (CCP). The underlying source of these latter data is
Equifax, which is the data source used by MRS, so this portion of the data construction
is also very comparable. The CCP has information on levels of mortgage debt and non-
mortgage debt (auto loans and revolving consumer credit) in each county. Since the CCP
does not have data on student loans, we do an imputation for each county based on the
aggregate fraction of total household debt represented by student loans from the FoF. We
then define other debt (Dti ) as the sum of auto and student loans and revolving consumer
credit. Finally, we rescale debt in each county proportionately, so that the total in the CCP
in each quarter equals the FoF total household liabilities.10




  10 The   CCP data by county we use here was publicly available at the time of our study.

          4                      Replication I: Alternative data

          In this section, we focus on the robustness of the MRS findings with respect to alternative
          data. In particular, we adopt the same regression specification as in MRS. We define
          the housing share of net worth as the ratio between housing wealth and household net
          worth, Hti /NWti , and the log-change in this variable between date t and t + τ induced by
          changes in house prices – referred to as the ‘housing net worth shock’ – as ∆HNWt,t   i
                                                                                                  +τ =
          ∆ log pit,t+τ × Hti /NWti .
                                   

              In our baseline model, we regress three-year changes in store-level annual sales from
          2006 to 2009 on the CBSA-level housing net worth shock over the same time period. We
          focus on 2006-09 since this corresponds roughly to the period of the sharpest house price
          declines (Figure 2), and is the three-year period studied in MRS. However, since Figure
          2 also shows that house prices were still rising in early 2006 and still falling in 2010, we
          also present results for other periods that exclude 2006 and include 2010 and 2011.

change in housing net worth. Right panel: Log change in housing net worth from 2006-
2009 versus housing supply elasticity. Linear and non-linear fit lines. Size reflects CBSA-
level sales in 2006.


(alternative weighting possibilities have little impact on the results), and we cluster by
CBSA when computing standard errors.
     In the left panel of Figure 3 we show a scatter plot of the change in CBSA-level sales,
i.e., ∆ log C06
              i             i         s,i
                −09 where C = ∑s∈i C , against the CBSA-level change in the housing share
of net worth, together with linear and non-linear fitted lines. The size of the circles reflects
the weight of each CBSA in the regression. There is a clear positive slope that is strongest
in areas that experienced the smallest declines in the housing share of net worth. Among
areas with large declines (below −10 pct), there is essentially no relationship between
spending and the log-change in the housing share of net worth.
     Our IV regressions follow the specification closely in MRS. We use the estimates of
housing supply elasticities from Saiz (2010) to instrument for the housing net worth
shock. This instrument is provided at the CBSA level and is not available for all of the
CBSA’s in which we observe store-level changes in expenditure because not all CBSAs
are covered by the Saiz (2010) data. As a result, the OLS and IV samples differ.12 The
right panel of Figure 3 shows a scatter plot of the first stage of this regression, i.e., the
change in the CBSA-level housing share of net worth against the Saiz (2010) instrument,
together with linear and non-linear fitted lines. The figure is suggestive of a strong first
stage, but also reveals a marked degree of non-linearity in the strength of the relationship.
In particular, the relationship between changes in the housing share of net worth and the
instrument is much stronger among low elasticity areas than among high elasticity areas.

       Table 3: Elasticity of non-durable expenditures to housing share of net worth


Given the poor fit of the linear specification, particularly for high elasticity areas where
the reduced form relationship is strongest (Figure 3, right panel), we use a quartic polyno-
mial in the Saiz housing supply elasticity as our instrument. The use of a non-linear first
stage represents another difference with MRS, who use a linear first stage, and sharpens
the estimates without having a large impact on the value of the coefficients.13
    Table 3 reports our main results. For the three-year period 2006 to 2009, we obtain a
baseline elasticity estimate of 0.24 (0.03) using OLS, and of 0.36 (0.08) using IV (Table 3,
first two columns). Both estimates are significant at the 1% level. The corresponding IV
estimate with a linear first stage is 0.41 (0.09) (Table 3, third column).
    In Table III, MRS report an estimated elasticity of 0.63 (0.12) using OLS, and of 0.77
(0.24) using IV for their measure of durable spending (vehicle registration). These are
larger numbers compared to ours, which is intuitive as durables are much more cycli-
cal. In Table 2 of their Online Appendix not for publication, the authors report elasticity
estimates using data on non-durable and services expenditure from MasterCard, a pro-
prietary dataset of purchases using either debit or credit cards that are part of the Mas-
terCard network. This proxy for expenditures is closer to ours and to a representative
bundle of non-durable goods.
    Their OLS estimates for non-durables vary from 0.34 (0.11) to 0.38 (0.10), depending on
the exact definition, and are therefore remarkably similar to ours.14 One possible concern
may be that MRS use county-level data rather than CBSA-level data in these regressions.
When we re-estimate (2) using the county-level equivalent of our measure of the housing
net worth shock, we obtain an OLS estimate of 0.21 (0.03) and an IV estimate of 0.19
(0.08) (Table 3, fourth and fifth columns). Hence the difference in the level of geographic
  13 For  all specifications, instrumenting with a quartic polynomial of the elasticity results in uniformly
marginally lower IV estimates and smaller standard errors than the corresponding estimates that restrict to
a linear first stage.
    14 MRS do not report the IV counterpart of these estimates for non-durable expenditures.



                                                       13
aggregation has only a minor effect on the OLS estimates. The impact on IV estimates is
somewhat larger, but the discrepancy between county- and CBSA-level estimates is not
statistically significant.
    Although MRS are not able to make their county-level measures of the housing share
of net worth available for other researchers due to the proprietary nature of their sources,
they do make an analogous CBSA-level measure available that replaces Equifax data for
debt with the FRB-NY CCP data (the same source that we use), and replaces CoreLogic
data on house prices with the house price index produced by the FHFA. When we use this
one as our independent variable, we obtain an OLS elasticity estimate of 0.34 (0.05) and
IV of 0.29 (0.12) (Table 3, sixth column). It is very reassuring that two completely different
sources of data on non-durable expenditures generate essentially identical estimates for
the elasticity with respect to changes in the housing share of net worth, provided that the
latter variable is consistently measured.
    Our estimates of the elasticity of non-durable spending to changes in the housing
share of net worth are relatively insensitive to the particular choice of the time period. In
Table 4 we report corresponding estimates for alternative time periods around the Great
Recession. Since the decline in expenditures typically lagged the fall in house prices, in-
cluding 2010 and/or 2011 leads to larger estimates (since house prices had mostly leveled
off by 2010, but consumption was still declining), and excluding 2006 leads to smaller
estimates (since house prices were falling through most of 2006 but the largest declines in
consumption were still to come).
    We conclude this section by noting that most of our regressions (and those in Mian
et al. (2013) as well) yield IV estimates that are larger than OLS coefficients. This may
appear puzzling, given that the role of the IV is to purify the housing net worth shock of
a component that drives both house price movements and expenditures, such as changes
in income or unemployment: the presence of a common factor would lead to an upward
bias in the OLS estimates.
    A possible explanation of why IV estimates are larger is that idiosyncratic variation
in house prices is more transitory than the variation in the common component of house
prices isolated by the instrument. More persistent house price movements should have
a bigger effect on expenditures. Figure 3 suggests a different, but related, interpretation.
As we pointed out, the relation between changes in expenditures and housing net worth
is weaker in areas where house prices collapsed. Perhaps, households there perceived
a larger share of this drop to be temporary (an over-reaction). The presence of these
observations lowers the OLS elasticity toward zero. The change in housing net worth

  predicted by the instrument is much smaller in those areas (see the right panel of Figure
  3), which increases the elasticity estimated by IV. Finally, the most pessimistic explanation
  for the downward bias in the OLS is that the Saiz instrument is also correlated with a
  number of other factors driving local housing demand and are thus invalid (Davidoff,
  2016). We are open to this as a possible explanation.

  4.1      Advantages of KNRS data: Expenditures versus consumption
  Our results have so far focused on nominal consumption expenditure. This measure is
  of first-order importance for understanding the transmission of house price shocks to
  fluctuations in aggregate economic activity. However, it provides an imperfect measure
  of the change in the real consumption of goods by households (e.g., Aguiar and Hurst,
  2005, document that changes in food expenditures are not equivalent to changes in food
  consumption). Since it is real consumption that matters for household welfare, under-
  standing the effect of changes in housing wealth on the quantity of non-durable goods
  consumed is also of interest. One advantage of the KNRS data compared to, for example,
  the Mastercard data used by MRS is that we separately observe nominal sales and prices.
      We construct a series for store-level real sales by aggregating product-level sales (at the
  bar-code level) using product-level prices that are common across stores at a fixed date.
  In our baseline measure, we use the 2012 economy-wide average price for each product
  (or the last year for which we have price data for discontinued products) – and is thus
  close to a Paasche index.15
      When using real consumption as the dependent variable, the elasticity estimates are
  uniformly around 20% lower than the corresponding estimates in which expenditure is
     15 We have tried various alternative choices, and our results are barely affected. Our results are also
  robust to using a weighted (across stores) average price for each product, or to restricting attention to
  products that are present in every year of the Nielsen data.

the dependent variable (Table 5).
   These findings suggest that a significant portion of the drop in consumption expendi-
tures is due to equilibrium prices falling in response to the negative demand shock. This
conclusion is in line with the findings in Stroebel and Vavra (2014), who argued that a
decline in mark-ups is responsible for these price dynamics.


5     Replication II: Specifications and interpretation

5.1    Alternative specifications
In this section, we discuss the sensitivity of the MRS results with respect to alternative
regression specifications. In the original MRS regression specification (2), the right-hand
side variable is the housing net worth shock, i.e., the change
                                                              in thehousing share of net

                                                                            H06

specification because they want to emphasize that the initial heterogeneity in household
balance sheets across geographical areas is a strong source of variation in the degree of
exposure to the drop in house prices.
    According to this narrative, one would expect two regions experiencing the same de-
cline in house prices to differ in the size of the shock (and its impact on expenditures) de-
pending on the initial share of housing net worth for households living in those regions:
regions where the housing share is larger should experience larger shocks. Similarly, re-
gions where households initially have higher housing leverage should experience larger
shocks. This is what MRS call the household balance sheet channel.

    In Table 6 we report estimates of alternative specifications based on equation (3). The
estimate of the elasticity of non-durable expenditures with respect to house prices, β̂ 2 , is
0.17 (0.02) using OLS, and 0.26 (0.06) using IV. Since the housing share of net worth at the
CBSA-level is typically far below unity, the elasticities with respect to house prices in the
first two columns of Table 6 are necessarily smaller than the elasticities with respect to the
house price induced changes in the housing share of net worth in the first two columns
of Table 3. However, the R2 from these regressions are slightly higher than the corre-
sponding regressions in Table 3. When we include the interaction term as an additional
regressor, either with or without the initial level of the housing share of net worth, the
OLS estimate of β 2 is barely affected while the OLS estimate of β 1 is statistically indis-
tinguishable from zero (columns 3 and 4). Interestingly, when we use a direct measure

                                                                              i

                              ), the interaction term has the correct sign and is statistically
significant at the 5% level (columns 5 and 6).16
    Taken at face value, the results in Table 6 offer at best weak support to the view that
the degree of initial exposure to the shock in 2006 was a key determinant of the drop in
expenditures that occurred between 2006 to 2009. However, several caveats are in order.
    First, Table V in Mian et al. (2013) separates the effect of the change in house value from
the interaction with initial housing leverage and find that the interaction is statistically
significant in determining the response of auto spending.17 Thus, our finding of a weak
balance sheet effect could be due to the fact that our dependent variable is non-durable
expenditures.18
    Second, estimating the partial elasticities β 1 , β 2 , and β 3 requires significant variation in
house price growth and initial balance sheet position in the cross section of regions. One
may worry that the lack of strong significance of the interaction terms in our regressions
is due to the fact that there is not enough variation at the CBSA level. Indeed, in their
Handbook chapter (see, in particular, Table 3), Mian and Sufi (2016) show that these two
variables are much less correlated at the ZIP-code level when including county fixed-

   16 We report only OLS estimates for the specifications that include both changes in house prices and the
interaction between changes in house prices and initial net worth since estimation by IV would require
additional instruments.
   17 Also Baker (2017) finds that higher levels of leverage are significantly related to a higher sensitivity of

expenditures to income using a measure of total expenditures that includes durables.
   18 Mian et al. (2013) do not separate the direct effect of house prices from the interaction term in their

regressions on MasterCard spending.

                                                                                                        18
effects and advocate that this type of empirical analysis be done at the ZIP-code level.
Figure 4 contains a scatterplot of the change in house prices and initial housing share
of net worth across CBSAs in our sample. The correlation between the two variables is
strong, but there is a substantial amount of variation. In addition, the standard errors in
Table 6 do not blow up, suggesting that the collinearity problem is not too severe in our
data. In the end, whether our result that the effect of initial leverage is weaker for non-
durables than for durables is a genuine finding or an artifact of excessive geographical
aggregation (and hence low power) is a question that can only be properly answered
with highly disaggregated data on non-durable expenditures, data that at the moment
are not available.
    Third, there could be greater measurement error in H/NW or H/( H − M ) compared
to ∆ log p. There are two potential sources of measurement error here: (1) The assump-
tion that the representative household in each county/quarter holds the market index for
stocks and bonds. Some support for this explanation comes from the last column of Ta-
ble, where the interaction term measured as housing leverage, and hence without data on
financial wealth, remains mildly significant. (2) Mismeasurement of the level of H. It is
possible, for example, that changes in housing values may be more accurately measured
than levels. Put differently, the fact that there is some amount of orthogonal variation in
Figure 4 doesn’t help much if that orthogonal variation is primarily measurement error.
The implied attenuation bias could explain our findings.
    Finally, the regressions in Mian et al. (2013) are specified in levels as opposed to loga-
rithms as they are interested in measuring MPCs rather than elasticities. Elasticities have
the advantage of being scale-invariant, whereas measuring MPCs requires correctly mea-
suring the absolute level of spending, assets, and liabilities in each geographical area.
This can only be achieved by making certain proportionality assumptions about the rela-
tion between the level of each variable in the regional sample and the national aggregates
from NIPA or Flow of Funds data.
    For completeness, we conclude this section by reporting elasticities with respect to
gross and net housing wealth directly, rather than to house prices or the housing share of
net worth. Future quantitative studies of consumption and housing in the Great Reces-
sion may be interested in these elasticities. Which independent variable is most relevant
will differ depending on the specifics of the mechanism being investigated. These alter-
native elasticity measures are contained in Table 7. The estimated elasticities with respect
to gross housing wealth H i are 0.12 (OLS) and 0.18 (IV) (first and second columns). These
estimates are lower than the corresponding elasticities with respect to house prices in Ta-

investment).

5.2    Structural interpretation of different specifications
The discussion in the previous section demonstrated that, without any guidance from
theory, it is unclear what the right regression specification is and whether one should ex-
pect initial exposure or initial leverage to play any role. To make progress, in this section
we build on the analysis of Berger et al. (2015) to show that the elasticity of expenditures
to both house prices and the housing net worth shock can be given a structural interpre-
tation and expressed in terms of observables. A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation
yields values for these elasticities that are very much in line with those of Mian et al.
(2013) and our estimates from the previous sections.
    Consider a household that solves the following problem:
                                                             1− σ
                                      T        Citα Q1it−α
                      max          ∑
                   {Cit ,Qit ,Ait t=0
                                 }
                                     βt
                                                   1−σ

                   Cit + pt [ Qit − (1 − δ) Qi,t−1 ] + Ait = Yit + (1 + r ) Ai,t−1

where Cit is non-housing consumption expenditures, Qit is the housing stock that yields
some utility flow proportional to the stock, pt is the aggregate house price, δ is housing
depreciation, Ait is holdings of financial wealth, and Yit is income. Note that the model is
frictionless: there is no debt, no binding borrowing constraints, nor transaction costs for

housing.
   Denote human wealth as Υ∗t , financial wealth including current interest as A∗t , housing
quantity net of depreciation as Q∗t and housing wealth as Ht∗ , i.e.

                                              T
                                   Υit∗ =    ∑ (1 + r)t−τ Yiτ
                                             τ =t
                                  Ait∗   = (1 + r ) Ait
                                  Qit∗   = (1 − δ) Qit
                                  Hit∗   = pt Qit∗ .

   We assume that β (1 + r ) = 1, the path of income {Yit } is deterministic and pt = p for
every t. In Appendix A, we show that:
                                                   ∗
                             ∆ log Cit          Hi,t −1
                                       =                                                      (4)
                             ∆ log p     Υit + Hi,t−1 + Ai,t
                                          ∗     ∗        ∗
                                                             −1

   Equation (4) states that the elasticity of expenditures with respect to house prices is
simply the initial housing share of total wealth, including human wealth. Households
that are “overweight” on housing should respond more to house prices.
                                                 ∗         ∗        ∗
   Dividing and multiplying equation (4) by Hi,t   −1 / ( Hi,t−1 + Ai,t−1 ) yields:

                            ∆ log Cit     H ∗ + Ai,t ∗
                                      = ∗ i,t−∗1       −1
                                                              ,                               (5)
                            ∆HNWit     Υit + Hi,t−1 + Ai,t
                                                        ∗
                                                           −1

which states that the elasticity of expenditures with respect to the housing net worth
shock is the share of non-human wealth over total wealth.
    In sum, both elasticities we estimated in Sections 4 and 5 have a structural interpre-
tation. However, it isn’t clear that there is any advantage to using the MRS specification
(5) relative to (4). In particular, (4) also captures the role of initial exposure to housing net
worth transparently. It does so not through the size of the shock as in specification (5), but
through the degree of transmission to expenditures, i.e., the magnitude of the elasticity
itself. There are, instead, some major disadvantages of using (5). First, house prices are
measured directly, while the disaggregated housing net worth variable needs to be con-
structed using additional data by making strong assumptions. In addition, HNWit might
introduce spurious variation that has nothing to do with the housing market. Suppose
that nothing at all happens to house prices. We might nevertheless measure a shift in
HNWit because of a stock market shock that moves Ait or a labor market shock that af-

                                                  21
fects Υit . This makes the reduced form correlation between consumption and the housing
value variable even more difficult to interpret. Finally, the housing supply elasticity gives
an instrument for house prices, not for housing net worth, so that the IV specification
relates far more directly to the specification in (4).
    This structural model also provides a way to check ex-post whether the empirical es-
timates of the elasticities based on geographical variation obtained in Sections 4 and 5
are reasonable. Consider the following simple calculation. Average household net worth
H ∗ + A∗ in 2007 (from the Survey of Consumer Finances) was around $500, 000, the hous-
ing share of net worth was around 1/2, and average household labor income was around
$70, 000. To compute human wealth, a rough back of the envelope calculation for a 45-
year-old household with 20 years left in the labor market paying an average tax rate of
20% and receiving an earnings replacement rate of 0.4 in social security benefits over its
residual lifetime of 15 years in retirement, all discounted at 3% per year, gives approxi-
mately $1M for the term Υit∗ = ∑τT=t (1 + r )t−τ Yiτ .
    Combining these pieces together gives a value for the elasticity with respect to house
prices of around 250/(1, 000 + 500) = 0.165. This calculation, which does not rely on
identifying empirically exogenous sources of variation for house prices, compares well
with our estimates in Tables 6.
    Since the housing share of net worth is around 1/2, our stylized model suggests the
elasticity with respect to the housing net worth shock should be roughly two times larger
than that with respect to house prices, or 1/3. This second back of the envelope calcula-
tion also compares reasonably well with the estimates in Tables 3 and 4.
    An important final point is that these specifications are derived from a deterministic
frictionless model in which the consumption function is linear. Thus, elasticities of ex-
penditures to housing net worth of the size estimated on micro data around the Great
Recession are entirely consistent with a pure housing wealth effect and do not require
any role for debt, leverage and credit constraints.


6   Conclusions

Transparency in empirical work and the ability to replicate and verify the robustness of
widely influential results should be a pillar of applied economic research. In this paper,
we reassess the findings of Mian et al. (2013) — findings that have been instrumental in
guiding the academic and policy debate on the role of the collapse of housing in the Great
Recession. Our replication exercise is developed in two parts.


                                             22
    First, we overcome the hurdle imposed by the fact that Mian et al. (2013) used expen-
sive and hard to access proprietary data by combining public and easily accessible data
that allow us to perform their same empirical study. Our analysis using these alternative
data largely confirms their results, therefore ruling out the possibility that the strong co-
movement of expenditures and house prices in the Great Recession is due to peculiarities
of their data sources. In addition, we can estimate the effect of the collapse separately in
housing wealth on prices and quantities: real consumption drops approximately 20 per-
cent less than nominal expenditures, implying a sizable demand-induced fall in producer
prices.
    Second, we explore the robustness of the Mian et al. (2013) results to alternative spec-
ifications. One of our key conclusions is that, after controlling for the drop in house
prices, we do not find much of an independent effect of initial housing exposure and ini-
tial leverage on non-durable expenditures. We offer several possible explanations for this
result. We also show that it is possible to interpret the estimated elasticity, theoretically
and quantitatively, as a pure housing wealth effect, with no role for leverage and credit
constraints. This is, we believe, a useful observation given the strong emphasis put on
debt and leverage in the narrative surrounding the findings of Mian et al. (2013).

The Lagrangian of the household problem, dropping the i subscripts, is:

                                                                                                       
                                                                                                      

    The FOCs are:

                              α(1−σ )−1     (1−α)(1−σ)
                           αCt            Qt              = λt
                                α(1−σ ) (1−α)(1−σ )
                    βt (1 − α) Ct      Qt                 = β t λ t p − β t +1 λ t +1 (1 − δ ) p
                                              βt λt       = β t +1 λ t +1 (1 + r )

    Rearranging, we obtain

                                       1−α                      1−δ

                                                   Ct
                                                       = p 1−                                      (A1)

                                                   λ t = λ t +1

where the first condition sets the optimal shares of expenditures between the two goods
and the second is the Euler equation. Both conditions use the assumption β (1 + r ) = 1.
It follows that Ct = Ct+1 which is the perfect consumption smoothing result of the PIH
with β (1 + r ) = 1. As a consequence of ( A1), we also have that Qt = Qt+1 .
    Iterating forward on the budget constraint:

                        Ct + pQt = Yt + (1 + r ) At−1 + p (1 − δ) Qt−1 − At

we obtain

             1−δ
                                                     
                      1                         Yt+1
Ct + pQt 1 −       +     (Ct+1 + pQt+1 ) = Yt +           + (1 + r ) A t −1 + p (1 − δ ) Q t −1
             1+r     1+r                        1+r
                                             1
                                         −     A t +1 .
                                           1+r

    Continuing iterating, using the optimality condition ( A1), and exploiting the property

   For T sufficiently large, we can approximate the geometric sum on the left-hand-side
with the infinite sum and obtain

   Differentiating equation ( A2) with respect to p, to capture the effect of an unexpected
permanent change in house prices p on consumption gives
