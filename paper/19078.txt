CEO Pay and Firm Size: an Update after the Crisis

JEL No. G3,J2

                                              ABSTRACT

In the "size of stakes" view quantitatively formalized in Gabaix and Landier (2008), CEO compensation
is determined in a competitive talent market, and reflects the size of firms affected by talent. This paper
offers an empirical update on this view. The years 2004-2011, which include the recent crisis, were
not part of the initial study and offer a laboratory to examine the theory as they include new positive
and negative shocks to the size of large firms. Executive compensation at the top (ex ante) did closely
track the evolution of average firm value during those years. During the crisis (2007 - 2009), average
total firm value decreased by 17%, and CEO pay decreased by 28%. During 2009-2011, we observe
a rebound of firm value by 19% and of CEO pay increased by 22%. These fairly proportional changes
provide a validity check in favor of the "size of stakes" view.

1.     Introduction

Executive compensation remains very much at the center-stage of academic and policy debates.

A relative lack of consensus seems to prevail regarding the origins of the large rise of executive

compensation observed in the US since the 70s. According to some scholars (see e.g. Bebchuck and

Fried (2004) for a summary of this view), rising compensation is due to a higher ability of CEOs to

extract rents from shareholders, e.g. by capturing their board (Shivdasani and Yermack (1999)) or

appointing compensation consultants that cater to their interests (Murphy and Sandino (2008)).

Hermalin (2005) argues instead that the rise in CEO pay reflects tighter corporate governance:

pay increases to compensate CEOs for the greater risk of being fired. Others argue that the very

function of CEOs has changed over time: they are now more often poached from outside firms

than before (Murphy and Zabojnik (2004) and Frydman (2005)); shareholders have become more

convinced of the importance of financial incentives (Jensen et al. (2004)). By contrast, Gabaix and

Landier (2008, henceforth GL) argue that the bulk of variations in CEO compensation across time

and across companies can be explained as the result of competitive market forces. They show that

under fairly general assumptions, in a market where the impact of CEO talent is scaled linearly

by firm size, and where matching CEOs with firms is frictionless (as in Sattinger 1993 and Tervio

2008), one should expect the compensation of CEOs to follow the following formula:



                                   w(n) = DS(n∗ )β/α S(n)1−β/α                                   (1)

where w(n) is the dollar compensation of the CEO of the nth biggest firm by decreasing size, n∗

denotes the index of the reference firm (e.g. the 250th largest firm); α is given by the distribution

of firm size at the top: S(n) = An−α ; and β depends on the distribution of talent at the top. GL

calibrate β/α ' 2/3. In particular, this formula predicts that if all firm sizes rise (resp. decline)

over time by a factor x, compensation should rise (resp. decline) by that same factor. We call

the theory of managerial pay proposed by GL the “size of stakes”view, because it implies that as

the size of large firms has increased over time, executive compensation has increased by a similar

factor, as all firms have a higher willingness to pay for talent. GL, using data from 1970-2003,

provide evidence consistent with the size of stakes view.

     In this paper, we examine whether the size of stakes view of executive compensation, proposed

                                                 2
by GL, passes the test of time.1 The years 2004-2011, which include the great recession, were

not part of the initial study and provide the opportunity to run an informative “out-of-sample”

assessment of the theory. During the financial crisis, the market capitalization of large companies

was strongly negatively impacted. Between 2007 and 2009, the average firm market total value

of the largest 500 US firms decreased by 17.4%, which represents the largest two-year drop over

the last forty years. This offers an exceptional laboratory to potentially reject the size of stakes

view, which predicts that changes in average CEO compensation in the largest firms should follow

the changes in the average size of these firms. In line with the theory, we do find that executive

compensation at the top did closely track the evolution of average firm value during those years.

The recent data thus tend to be supportive of the equilibrium model developed in GL; the estimates

that we find for β/α are very close to those of our original study and we confirm the constant linear

scaling of talent impact with size. Note that what is particularly non-trivial is the one-to-one

relationship between firm size and CEO pay.

      Our focus on the years 2004-2011 is also motivated by a number of recent developments that

affected CEO pay practices, potentially “distorting” the economic link between CEO pay and firm

size identified in GL.2 In 2004, the end of “free” accounting for stock options has been followed by

a shift toward restricted stock and then, toward the use of performance-based vesting conditions

in equity grants (see Bizjak et al. 2013). In 2006, the SEC promulgated new executive pay disclo-

sure rules. Those rules required the disclosure of compensation consultants, which has potentially

affected the incentives of a key player in the pay-setting process (Murphy and Sandino, 2010; Cad-

man et al. 2010). They also required the disclosure of peers used for benchmarking compensation,

another key driver of pay levels (Faulkender and Yang 2012, Albuquerque et al. forth and Bizjak,

Lemmon and Nguyen 2011). Moreover, after the Enron-type scandals and the burst of the dotcom

bubble, there has been a “change in sentiment” over the usefulness of option-based pay – also related

to the option backdating scandal – and an increase in compensation-related shareholder activism

through shareholder proposals and vote-no campaigns against compensation committee members

(Ertimur, Ferri and Muslu 2011). As a result of the above activism, the mandatory adoption of

“say on pay” in 2011 leads firms to change their pay practices both before and after the vote, in

     Of course, any short time sample does not allow to accept or reject a theory. It simply updates a Bayesian
estimate of its predictive power.

an attempt to obtain a favorable voting outcome (Ertimur, Ferri and Oesch, 2013 and Larcker et

al. 2012). Finally, incentive pay has been viewed as a potential reason for the excessive risk-taking

underlying the financial crisis.

   To evaluate the theory, we update the two compensation indices used in GL: between 1980

and 2011, the Jensen - Murphy - Wruck (JMW) compensation index increased by 569% while the

Frydman - Saks (FS) compensation index increased by 341% (here, as everywhere in this article,

increases are in real, inflation-adjusted quantities). By taking the average, we obtain a rise in

CEO pay of 405%. In the same period, the average firm market value of the largest 500 US firms

increased by 425% while the average equity value of the largest 500 US firms (in terms of equity

value) increased by 467%. Thus the evidence supports the broadly proportional evolution of pay

and firm size in the period 1980-2011.

   Interestingly, over the recent period 2004 - 2011, firm size successively sharply dropped and

then rebounded. This offers a fairly strong test for the size of stakes view. According to this

view, proportional changes in compensation should be observed as markets drop and rebound. We

find that movements in CEO compensation did indeed closely track movements in firm size: over

2007-2009, average total firm values decreased by 17.4%, equity values by 37.9%, and compensation

indices by 27.7%. During 2009-2011, we observe a rebound of firm values by 19%, equity values by

27%, and compensation indices by 22%.

   We want to highlight that the size of stakes view does not hinge on the fact that stock-markets

are perfectly efficient. Even if market values were a poor proxy for fundamental values of firms,

the market view developed in GL still applies; it states that the market for talents and the market

for assets are deeply intertwined. If shareholders overvalue asset prices, it is a natural market

outcome that talent be overvalued by the same factor (this is because in a frictionless framework,

shareholders, who are the owners of assets, also have control over hiring decisions). If they overvalue

assets, they will exhibit a higher than normal willingness to pay for talent.

   It is difficult to assess whether the recent years, that are the focus of the present study, are

compatible with the “rent-extraction view” of compensation. Indeed without a specific form for

the “stealing technology” used by managers, it is not possible to predict how rents should vary

over time. If one believes that the “outrage constraint” faced by managers is tighter in downturns

(see Bebchuk and Grinstein (2005)), then one should expect rents to fall as aggregate market

                                                  4
performance is negative, but it is hard to know by what factor. By contrast, our prediction that

pay in the largest firms should change over time in the same proportions as the size of large firms

is easy to reject.

     Our results are very much in line with Kaplan (2012), who documents that the ratio of average

CEO pay to average firm market capitalization has been constant over time since 1960. Kaplan

(2012) uses market capitalization whereas our benchmark approach uses total firm value (i.e. debt

plus equity market value). We revisit whether total firm value is a better proxy for firm size

in our theory than other measures of size such as market capitalization or sales. Total firm value

(debt+equity) yields estimates that are theoretically more appealing (as it is independent of leverage

choice), but pure equity has a good explanatory power, especially for short-term movements (see

Figure 1). Perhaps firms that are riskier and that have more upside potential choose to have less

debt (to avoid bankruptcy costs). Then, equity is likely to be a better proxy than debt+equity for

how much a CEO can impact the firm.



2.     Data Description

We incorporate the recent period in the regressions and graphs presented in GL. For this, we

follow the methodology of GL. However, there are two noteworthy differences. First, we restrict

our attention to US-based firms. The original study took all firms in Compustat. However, since

Compustat has been including many more foreign firms, an additional filtering is in order. Second,

the procedure followed to construct total firm value in GL unwittingly excluded some banks because

the item Deferred Taxes is often missing in Compustat for these firms.3 As shown below, we thus

set deferred taxes to 0 when missing before computing total firm value. As a novelty with respect

to GL, prompted by interesting results in Kaplan (2012), we introduce equity market value as an

alternative measure of firm size. We first describe in details the data, and then present the results.


2.1    Datasets

We use two datasets. Execucomp provides us with data on CEO compensation. Regressions

presented in this paper were performed with Execucomp data extracted from WRDS in September
   3
     This effect was noted by Nagel (2010). We obtain very similar results in what follows when Deferred Taxes are
excluded from the computation of total firm value.

2012. We use Compustat to retrieve information on the size of US-based firms. US-based companies

are identified with Compustat variable FIC.


   CEO Compensation. The Execucomp panel provides data on compensation of the five best

paid executives of the largest US firms from 1992. We identify the CEO of each firm-year in

Execucomp with the dummy variable CEOANN. However, using the CEOANN variable, some

firm-year observations have no CEO in Execucomp. We are however able in some cases to infer

the CEO’s identity from the BECAMECEO variable indicating the date at which the individual

became CEO. Specifically, when the CEOANN variable indicates no CEOs for a given firm-year,

we consider an executive as the CEO of the firm in year t when (i) the BECAMECEO variable

indicates that the executive was appointed as the CEO in year t or before and (ii) the dummy

variable CEOANN indicates the executive as the CEO of the firm in year t + 1 or after.

   CEO compensation is then measured with Execucomp variable, TDC1, which includes salary,

bonus, restricted stock granted and the Black-Scholes value of stock-options granted. Finally, CEO

compensation is converted into 2000 constant dollars using the GDP deflator of the Bureau of

Economic Analysis.


   Firm size. We will use different proxies for firm size, namely total firm value, earnings before

interest and taxes, sales and equity value. We construct these variables from Compustat. Total

firm value is the sum of the market value of equity, defined as number of shares outstanding (item

CSHO) multiplied by the end-of-fiscal-year stock price (item PRCC F), and the book value of

debt, defined as total assets (item AT) minus the sum of book value of equity (item CEQ) and

deferred taxes (item TXDB); we set deferred taxes to 0 when missing. Earnings before interest and

taxes is (item OIBDP-item DP). Sales is measured with Compustat item SALE. Equity value is

(item CSHO*item PRCC F). All quantities are converted into 2000 constant dollars using the GDP

deflator of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Finally, we construct the 48 Fama-French industry

dummies from the conversion table in the Appendix of Fama and French (1997) using the firm’s 4

digit SIC industry code.




                                                6
2.2   Compensation indices

To evaluate changes in CEO pay over the long run, we rely on the same compensation indices used

in GL, namely the JMW and FS compensation indices.

   The FS compensation index is based on Frydman and Saks (2010). Total Compensation is

the sum of salaries, bonuses, long-term incentive payments, and the Black-Scholes value of options

granted. The data are based on the three highest-paid officers in the largest 50 firms in 1940, 1960,

and 1990. The data appendix in Frydman and Saks (2010) provides detailed information on the

sample selection.

   The JMW Compensation Index is based on the data of Jensen, Murphy, and Wruck (2004).

Their sample encompasses all CEOs included in the S&P 500, using data from Forbes and Execu-

Comp. CEO total pay includes cash pay, restricted stock, payouts from long-term pay programs,

and the value of stock options granted from 1992 onward using ExecuComp’s modified Black-Scholes

approach. Compensation prior to 1978 excludes option grants and is computed between 1978 and

1991 using the amounts realized from exercising stock options.

   Reproducing Figure 1 and Table III of GL for the period 1970 - 2011 requires extending both

compensation indices over the recent period, i.e. 2004 - 2011. We proceed in the following way :

for every year between 2005 and 2011, the FS compensation index (respectively, the JMW com-

pensation index) in year t equals the FS compensation index (respectively, the JMW compensation

index) in year t − 1 times the annual percentage increase in the mean CEO compensation of the

largest 500 US-based firms.

   Specifically, we first rank for every fiscal year between 2005 and 2011 US-based companies in

terms of total firm value, computed at the end of the previous fiscal year. For every year between

2005 and 2011, we then merge Compustat and Execucomp with the GVKEY identifier and keep

the largest 500 US companies for which we can retrieve CEO compensation in Execucomp. We

use the procedure mentioned above to identify CEOs in Execucomp. Before computing the annual

percentage increase in the mean CEO compensation, we deflate it using the Bureau of Economic

Analysis GDP Deflator.

   Figure 1 compares the evolution of CEO pay and firm size over the period 1970-2011. We

again restrict our attention to firms with non-missing information on CEO pay in Execucomp

                                                 7
when computing the average market total value of the largest 500 US-based firms between 1992

and 2011. Before 1992 (the earliest date for the Execucomp database), we simply compute the

average market total value of the largest 500 US-based firms present in Compustat. Finally, using

a symmetric procedure, we compute the average equity value of the largest 500 US-based firms in

terms of equity value. After 1992, as above, we again exclude firms for which Execucomp does not

provide information on CEO compensation.

       Figure 2 plots the firm size distribution confirming a fat-tailed distribution of firms, consistent

with a Zipf’s law for firm size (Simon 1955, Axtell 2001, Gabaix 1999, Luttmer 2007), here firm

size being firm total market value rather than the usual “size” expressed by number of employees.



3.       Results

3.1       CEO Pay and Proxies For Firm Size

As in GL, we first consider three proxies for firm size - namely total firm value, earnings before

interest and taxes (EBIT) and sales. We then regress the logarithms of CEO compensation of

the largest 1000 US-based companies in terms of firm value on the logarithms of the different size

proxies, controlling for year and industry.4



                                                 [Table 1 here]

       In the GL model, the most relevant measure for size depends on the nature of the CEO’s job. If

the impact of the talent of the CEO hired for year t is to induce a temporary shock on productivity

(e.g. via leadership) or sales (e.g. via better marketing), then size can be measured by sales or

earnings during that year. However, if one believes that the impact of the CEO hired at time t is

long-lasting and affects all future profits, then, the relevant measure of size is the net present value

of future profits, i.e. firm total market value (i.e. the value of its debt and its equity). This view is

coherent if one believes that an important role of the CEO is to take strategic decisions that affect

the future growth path of the firm, to implement technological (or organizational) innovations that
   4
    Note that the selection criterion is not the same as in GL, where CEO compensation of the 1000 highest paid
CEOs is regressed on the size proxies each year. Running the regression for the largest 1000 US firms is motivated
by the fact that in GL theory, firm size is a more exogenous object than CEO pay.




                                                        8
push the firm’s product line (or productivity) to a new level (and thus affect all future generations of

products (resp. profits)). Such view of the CEO’s job could be for instance formalized in a vertical

quality ladder model of innovation à la Aghion-Howitt, in which a new innovation permanently

impacts productivity. In addition, the full firm value is a measure of size that is neutral to the

choice of capital structure: the impact of a CEO should not depend directly on whether the firm is

financed with debt or equity. We include results with equity value as a proxy of size because it is a

popular measure of firm size – it is used notably by Kaplan (2012). A possible rationale for using

equity value, rather than full firm value (equity + debt) may be as follows. It involves a theory of

the capital structure; debt largely reflects the “safe” assets of the firm, whose value the CEO does

not directly affect – because those safe assets back debt, while equity reflects the “risky assets”,

which the CEO does affect.

   Table 1 presents the results. The three size proxies have positive and significant coefficients

when used together to predict compensation (column (1)). Moreover, as shown in columns (2) to

(4), total market value, EBIT and sales have similar predictive power when used alone to predict

compensation, as can be seen by comparing R2 , with a slight edge for firm value. In column (5),

we introduce equity value as an alternative measure of firm size. Again, equity value turns out to

be a valid proxy for firm size.


3.2   Panel Evidence, 1992 - 2011

As in GL, we estimate:



                           ln(wi,t ) = d + e × ln(Sn∗ ,t−1 ) + f × ln(Si,t−1 )                      (2)

where wi,t is CEO compensation in firm i and year t, Sn∗ =250,t−1 is market total value of the firm

number n∗ = 250 in the sample at the end of fiscal year t − 1 and Si,t−1 is firm i total market value.

We cluster standard errors at either the firm level or at the year level. The sample consists of either

the top 500 or top 1000 US-based companies in terms of firm value for which we can retrieve CEO

compensation in Execucomp (using the procedure mentioned above). The sample period is from

1992 to 2011.




                                                   9
                                           [Table 2 here]



   Columns (1) to (3) (respectively columns (4) to (6)) in Table 2 present the results for the

largest 1000 (respectively 500) US firms. Columns (2) and (4) include industry fixed effects while

columns (3) and (6) include firm fixed effects. The results obtained over the sample period 1992

- 2011 remain consistent with the size of stakes theory. For all specifications, the coefficients (and

standard errors) are similar to those in GL. Moreover, p values for the null hypothesis that e+f = 1

are above 0.1 in specifications (1), (2) and (5), which is consistent with the constant returns to

scale hypothesis in firm size.




                                           [Table 3 here]



   Then, we reestimate equation 2 using equity value as an alternative proxy for size. Specifically,

wi,t is CEO compensation in firm i and year t, Sn∗ =250,t−1 is market equity value of the firm number

n∗ = 250 (in terms of market equity value) in the sample at the end of fiscal year t − 1 and Si,t−1

is firm i market equity value. Taken together, regression results presented in Table 3 are also

consistent with the constant returns to scale hypothesis in firm size.


3.3   Times-Series US Evidence, 1971 - 2011


Figure 1 shows the evolution of CEO pay and firm size for the largest US-based firms between 1971

and 2011.



                                           [Figure 1 here]

   Between 1980 and 2011, the JMW compensation index has increased by 569% while the FS

compensation index has increased by 341%. By taking the average, we obtain a rise in CEO pay of

405%. In the same period, the average firm market value of the largest 500 US firms has increased

by 425% while the average equity value of the largest 500 US firms (in terms of equity value) has


                                                 10
increased by 467%. Thus the evidence supports the broadly proportional evolution of pay and firm

size in the period 1980-2011. Note that since the levels of compensation reflect dollar values on

an ex-ante basis (e.g. values of stock-options are evaluated at time granted, as opposed to time

exercised), there is no hard wired link between compensation and stock-market values.



                                            [Table 4 here]



   As shown in Table 4, over the recent period 2004 - 2011, movements in CEO compensation

closely follow movements in firm size. In particular, CEO pay and firm size have both decreased

during the crisis (2007 - 2009): average total firm values decreased by 17.4%, equity values by

37.9%, and compensation indices by 27.7%. During 2009-2011, we observe a rebound of firm values

by 19%, equity values by 27%, and compensation indices by 22%. We see these fairly proportional

changes over successive episodes of market drops and market rebound as a strong validity test for

the size of stakes view.


   It is important to notice that the size of stakes view does not hinge on the fact that stock-

markets be perfectly efficient. Even if market values were a poor proxy for fundamental values

of firms, the market view developed in GL still applies; it states that the market for talents and

the market for assets are deeply intertwined. If shareholders overvalue asset prices, it is a natural

market outcome that talent be overvalued by the same factor (this is because in our frictionless

framework shareholders have control over hiring decisions).


   As in GL, we estimate:



                                    ∆t (ln wt ) = γ̂ × ∆t ln S∗,t−1                              (3)

where w is either the JMW index or the FS index and S∗ is the mean firm total value of the top

500 largest US-based firms. Again, we restrict our attention to US-based firms for which we can

retrieve CEO compensation in Execucomp. The sample period is 1971-2011.



                                            [Table 5 here]

                                                  11
   GL find estimates γ̂ = 1.14 using the JMW compensation index and γ̂ = 0.87 using FS compen-

sation index over the period 1971 - 2003. As shown in Table 5, we find extremely close estimates

between 1971 and 2011: γ̂ = 1.01 using the JMW compensation index and γ̂ = 0.82 using FS

compensation index.



                                           [Table 6 here]

   Table 6 presents the result of the estimation of equation 3 when S∗ is the mean firm equity

value of the top 500 largest US-based firms in terms of equity value. The fit is rather less good.

This may be because the method puts all the weight on the contemporaneous changes in firm size

and pay. Of course, while the economics predicts that pay will track size one-for-one, there could

be some delay in that relation. Kaplan (2012) has proposed a graphical device that captures the

medium-frequency relation between pay and size (represented by firms size) better than regression

(3). Interestingly, he finds good support for a stable ratio between average pay and average firm

size since 1960.



3.4   Application of the model to non-CEO executives

We see the GL model as particularly adapted to studying CEO pay because the top job in a

firm clearly has firm-wide implications: this makes the hypothesis that the impact of CEO talent

increases in firm size particularly natural. The question of how the impact of other high-paid

executives depends on firm size is highly interesting but opens several debates on the production

function of these executives: the relevant size variable for the impact of non-CEO talent might

be that of a division that the executive is managing; in the cross-section, it might be that some

positions that are held by a single individual in small firms are transformed into two distinct

positions in larger firms; last, in the time-series, organizational trends might have changed the

composition of the executive suite, such as the elimination of intermediate hierarchical layers (e.g.

the elimination of the COO function in many firms: see Rajan and Wulf 2006). But, beyond

these caveats, we find that estimating the GL model on non-CEO executives is an interesting and

natural empirical question. Thus, we provide a version of our benchmark regression on non-CEO

                                                 12
executives (see Tables 7 and 8 below). To do this, we simply compute for each firm the average

non-CEO compensation as reported in execucomp; we use the same definitions of compensation

and market value as those used in the CEO comp regressions. We find results that are highly

similar to those on CEOs: in particular, we do not reject the fact that the sum of coefficients on

firm total value and reference firm value is one. In the time series, it turns out that non-CEO pay

has followed an evolution strikingly similar to that of CEO pay: between 1992 (which is the first

year in Execucomp) and 2011, it has increased by a factor of 2.5, while CEO pay has increased by

a factor of 3 (see Figure 3). These results suggest that the GL model can be used to describe the

market of non-CEO executives.



3.5      Robustness checks

In the online appendix, we present robustness checks of the regression results in Tables 2 and 3.5


3.5.1      Sticky Equity Awards

Some firms follow a“fixed number”policy for the design of the CEO long term incentive plan (see

e.g. Hall 1999) – i.e, the same number of, say, options is granted to the CEO over a certain

number of years. For these firms, an increase in the stock price mechanically increases the value

of equity grants. Accordingly, part of the association between CEO pay and firm size presented in

Table 2 might be “mechanical”. We address this concern by excluding the observations for which

we suspect the presence of a “fixed number” policy. For this, we look at the number of options

(execucomp variable OPTION AWARDS NUM), the number of performance shares (execucomp

variable SHRTARG in the pre-2006 format, and EQ TARG in the new format) , and the number of

shares granted under non-performance-based plans (execucomp variable SHARES GRT, available

only from 2006) to capture “fixed number” policies.



                                              [Tables 9 and 10 here]

      Specifically, we exclude from the estimation of equation 2 the observations for which the number

of options (respectively performance shares, shares granted under non-performance-based plans)
  5
      We thank the referee for suggesting to us these robustness checks.


                                                          13
granted to the CEO in year t is positive and the same as in year t − 1. This criterion excludes

around 9% of the observations. As shown in Tables 9 and 10, the coefficients remain very similar

to those in Tables 2 and 3.


3.5.2    Changes in the definition of TDC1

Execucomp changed in 2006 the definition of TDC1 to reflect new reporting rules mandated by the

SEC. FAS 123 (R) required equity compensation to be based on the ex ante value of the awards.

In the pre-2006 format, the execucomp variable TDC1 included the ex post value of performance

shares. To deal with this problem, we follow Walker (2009) and construct a consistent definition

of CEO pay over the whole sample period: when measured in its pre-2006 format, we subtract

from TDC1 the amount paid under the company’s long-term incentive plan (execucomp variable

LTIP). We then add the ex ante value of performance shares by multiplying the target number of

performance shares granted (execucomp variable SHRTARG) by the stock price at the end of the

fiscal year. When missing, the variable SHRTARG is replaced by 0.6



                                          [Tables 11 and 12 here]

     Tables 11 and 12 reproduce the regressions presented in Tables 2 and 3 when TDC1 is adjusted

as mentioned above. Again, the coefficients turn out to be very similar.



4.      Conclusion and Some Open Questions

The crisis offered new events to see the reaction of compensation to firm size, and the GL theory

appears to pass the test. We wish to highlight that there are still many things about this view to

explore, enrich, or perhaps correct. For instance, behavioral factors in the perception of CEO talent

could be important (Malmendier and Tate 2009). Because of this possibility, GL works out how

contagion effects could potentially strongly affect CEO pay. Bereskin and Cicero (2013) present

some evidence in support of that effect.

     On the theoretical side, it would be good to extend the model to incentives (see Edmans, Gabaix
  6
    Unfortunately, the variable SHRTARG is often missing. We thus do not know whether this adjustment introduces
more or less bias in the estimation of equation 2.



                                                      14
and Landier (2009) and Edmans and Gabaix (2011) for static models that integrate well with GL,

and Dittmann, Maug and Spalt (2011) for a behavioral approach), in particular with dynamic

incentives and CEO turnover (see Jenter and Kanaan forth. and Eisfeldt-Kuhnen 2012). This

remains difficult, though perhaps within reach.

     Also, integrating the CEO market with other talent markets (as in Kaplan and Rauh 2010 and

the spirit of Rosen 1981) would be good. Conceptually, we would expect some integration with

the market for CEO of private companies and for hedge fund managers, for instance. It is likely

that studying this integration might shed light on the increase in inequality, particularly with the

rise of top incomes (Piketty and Saez 2003, Lemieux, MacLeod and Parent 2009). In that respect,

relatedly, progress in the measurement of “talent” and “CEO skill” is encouraging (Bertrand and

Schoar 2003, Custodio, Ferreira and Matos forth., Falato, Li and Milbourn 2012, Bennedsen et al.

2012).

     Kaplan (2012), building on Frydman and Saks (2010), finds that the GL theory works well in

the 1960-2010 sample, but less so before. Why is that? One reason is that stock market values

were depressed, so perhaps the full firm value (debt + equity) was higher than pure equity (which

is what Kaplan uses). Another important under-researched channel is the supply of skills. One

possibility that would be reasonably researchable would be that the supply of skills was lower before

1960 (perhaps because of technology, GI bill etc.), and that supply of MBA and college graduates

increased after World War II. That hypothesis seems researchable as more data becomes available

(Goldin and Katz 2008).

     Finally, as many countries now have started forcing the disclosure of pay, investigating pay in

those countries seems both doable and informative.

6.     Appendix: Summary of Gabaix-Landier (2008)

We summarize the GL model here, paraphrasing in part earlier expositions in GL and Edmans,

Gabaix and Landier (2009).

     A continuum of firms and potential managers are matched together. Firm n ∈ [0, N ] has size

S (n) and manager m ∈ [0, N ] has talent T (m). Low n denotes a larger firm and low m a more

talented manager: S 0 (n) < 0, T 0 (m) < 0. n (m) can be thought of as the rank of the manager

(firm), or a number proportional to it, such as its quantile of rank.




                                                 19
   We consider the problem faced by one particular firm. The firm has a “baseline” value of S.

At t = 0, it hires a manager of talent T for one period. The manager’s talent increases the firm’s

value according to

                                           S 0 = S + CT S γ ,                                     (4)

where C parameterizes the productivity of talent. If large firms are more difficult to change than

small firms, then γ < 1. If γ = 1, the model exhibits constant returns to scale (CRS) with respect

to firm size.

   Let w (m) denote the equilibrium compensation of a CEO with index m. Firm n, taking the

market compensation of CEOs as given, selects manager m to maximize its value net of wages:


                                    max CS (n)γ T (m) − w (m) .                                   (5)
                                     m



   The competitive equilibrium involves positive assortative matching, i.e. m = n, and so w0 (n) =

CS (n)γ T 0 (n). Let wN denote the reservation wage of the least talented CEO (n = N ). Hence we

obtain the classic assignment equation (Sattinger (1993), Tervio (2007)):

                                           Z   N
                               w (n) = −           CS (u)γ T 0 (u) du + wN .                      (6)
                                            n


   Specific functional forms are required to proceed further. We assume a Pareto firm size distri-

bution with exponent 1/α: S (n) = An−α . Using results from extreme value theory, GL use the

following asymptotic value for the spacings of the talent distribution: T 0 (n) = −Bnβ−1 . These

functional forms give the wage equation in closed form, taking the limit as n/N → 0:



              N
                                           Aγ BC h −(αγ−β)                    Aγ BC −(αγ−β)
          Z                                                           i
w (n) =           Aγ BCu−αγ+β−1 du + w =          n        − N −(αγ−β) + wN ∼        n      .
           n                               αγ − β                             αγ − β
                                                                                         (7)

   To interpret equation (7), we consider a reference firm, for instance firm number 250 – the

median firm in the universe of the top 500 firms. Denote its index n∗ , and its size S(n∗ ). We obtain

Proposition 2 from GL, which we repeat here.

   Proposition (GL 2008). In equilibrium, manager n runs a firm of size S (n), and is paid


                                                      20
according to the “dual scaling” equation


                                     w (n) = D (n∗ ) S(n∗ )β/α S (n)γ−β/α                                      (8)


where S(n∗ ) is the size of the reference firm and D (n∗ ) = −Cn∗ T 0 (n∗ ) / (αγ − β) is a constant

independent of firm size.

    There are strong reasons to have γ = 1, which is the classic constant returns to scale case, which

is useful in most firms studies (e.g. Luttmer 2007). The Zipf’s law for firms sizes leads to α = 1.

Calibrating in the cross section, like in Table 1, yields γ − β/α ' 1/3, hence β = 2/3. There is no

“intrinsic” reason why we should expect β = 2/3. It would be very interesting to find some reason

(perhaps based on the inference from past performance) for it. This calibration yields:


                                       w (n) = D (n∗ ) S(n∗ )2/3 S (n)1/3                                      (9)


    Hence, in the cross section, we have w (n) ∝ S (n)γ−β/α = S (n)1/3 : log wage is proportional to

log firm size, with a mild slope of 1/3.

    However, in the time-series, the average wage behaves like the wage of the reference firm, which

satisfies w (n∗ ) ∝ S (n∗ )γ = S (n∗ )1 . The time-series slope of log wage on log size is higher, at 1.

    The reason is that in the cross-section, the “effective supply” a given firm faces is quite elastic:

if it grows, it can just poach a better CEO from an other firms. However, in the “time-series”, the

supply is not elastic: if all firms grow, they can’t poach new CEOs from elsewhere.7




   7
     That’s because by assumption we assume a zero elasticity of labor supply from CEOs; but the more general point
of a higher elasticity in the cross-section than in the time-series is generally valid.


                                                        21
                  Figure 1: Executive Compensation and Size of the Top 500 Firms


    FS compensation index is based on Frydman and Saks (2010). Total Compensation is the sum of salaries,

bonuses, long-term incentive payments, and the Black-Scholes value of options granted. The data are based on the

three highest-paid officers in the largest 50 firms in 1940, 1960, and 1990. The JMW Compensation Index is based

on the data of Jensen, Murphy, and Wruck (2004). Their sample encompasses all CEOs included in the S&P 500,

using data from Forbes and ExecuComp. CEO total pay includes cash pay, restricted stock, payouts from long-term

pay programs, and the value of stock options granted from 1992 onward using ExecuComp’s modified Black-Scholes

approach. Compensation prior to 1978 excludes option grants and is computed between 1978 and 1991 using the

amounts realized from exercising stock options. Both compensation indices are available until 2004. From 2005 to

2011, the FS compensation index in year t equals the FS compensation index in year t−1 times the annual percentage

increase in the mean CEOs compensation – defined as ExecuComp variable TDC1 – of the top 500 largest US-based

firms (in term of total market firm value, i.e. debt plus equity). We use the same methodology to extend the JMW

Compensation Index. The formula we use for total firm value is (CSHO*PRCC F+AT-CEQ-TXDB), computed at

the end of the previous fiscal year. Deferred Taxes (item TXDB) is set to 0 when missing. TOP 500 Firm Value is

the mean firm value of the top 500 largest US-based firms (in terms of firm value). TOP 500 Equity Value is the

mean market equity value – defined as (CSHO*PRCC F) – of the top 500 largest US-based firms (in terms of equity

All indices are normalized to be equal to 1 in 1980. All quantities were first converted into constant dollars using the

GDP deflator of the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

                         Figure 2: Size Distribution of the Top 500 Firms in 2010


    In 2010, we take the top 500 US-based firms by total firm value with non-missing data on CEO compensation,

order them by size, S(1) ≥ S(2) ≥ ... ≥ S(500) , and plot ln S on the horizontal axis and ln(Rank − 12 ) on the vertical

axis. Gabaix and Ibragimov (2011) recommend the − 21 term and show that it removes the leading small sample bias.

Regressing ln(Rank − 12 ) = −ζln(S)+constant yields a Pareto exponent ζ = 0.915 (standard error 0.057), R2 = 0.99.

ζ close to 1 is indicative of an approximate Zipf’s law for firm total value.

                  Table 1: CEO PAY AND DIFFERENT PROXIES FOR FIRM SIZE

The sample consists of all US-based firms between 1992 and 2011 for which we can retrieve both firm size in Compustat
and CEO compensation in Execucomp. We select each year the top 1000 largest firms (in term of total market firm
value, i.e. debt plus equity). We then regress the log compensation of the CEO – using the ExecuComp total
compensation variable TDC1, which includes salary, bonus, restricted stock granted, and the Black-Scholes value of
stock-options granted – in year t on the log of the firm’s size proxies at the end of year t − 1. All nominal quantities
were first converted into 2000 constant dollars using the GDP deflator of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The
formula we use for total firm value is (CSHO*PRCC F+AT-CEQ-TXDB). Deferred Taxes (item TXDB) is set to 0
when missing. Income is measured as earnings before interest and taxes, defined from Compustat as (OIBDP-DP).
Sales is measured with Compustat item SALE. Equity value is (CSHO*PRCC F). The industries are the Fama French
[1997] 48 sectors. We report standard errors clustered at the firm level (first line) and at the year level (second line).

The formula we use for firm value is (CSHO*PRCC F+AT-CEQ-TXDB), computed at the end of the previous fiscal
year. Deferred Taxes (item TXDB) is set to 0 when missing. Quantities are deflated using the Bureau of Economic

            Figure 3: Non-CEO Executive Compensation and Size of the Top 500 Firms




CEO compensation in year t is the mean CEO compensation of the top 500 largest US-based firms (in terms of
firm value). Non-CEO compensation in year t is the average non-CEO compensation of the top 500 largest US-
based firms (in terms of firm value). We compute non-CEO compensation for each firm-year by taking the average
compensation of non-CEO executives present in ExecuComp. TOP 500 Firm Value is the mean firm value of the top
500 largest US-based firms (in terms of firm value). TOP 500 Equity Value is the mean market equity value – defined
as (CSHO*PRCC F) – of the top 500 largest US-based firms (in terms of equity value). All indices are normalized to
be equal to 1 in 1992. All quantities were first converted into constant dollars using the GDP deflator of the Bureau
of Economic Analysis.

The sample consists of all US-based firms between 1992 and 2011 for which we can retrieve both firm size in Compustat
and the identity of the CEO in Execucomp. We select each year the top n (n = 500, 1000) largest firms (in term
of total market firm value, i.e. debt plus equity). The formula we use for total firm value is (CSHO*PRCC F+AT-
CEQ-TXDB). Deferred Taxes (item TXDB) is set to 0 when missing. We retrieve for each executive present in
ExecuComp the total compensation variable, TDC1 in year t, which includes salary, bonus, restricted stock granted
and the Black-Scholes value of stock-options granted. All nominal quantities are converted into 2000 dollars using
the GDP deflator of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The industries are the Fama French [1997] 48 sectors. We
regress the log of the average compensation of non-CEO executives in year t on the log of the firm value (debt plus
equity) at the end of the year t − 1, and the log of the 250th firm market value at the end of the year t − 1. We report
standard errors clustered at the firm level (first line) and at the year level (second line).

2006

                                                Size is market total value



The sample consists of all US-based firms between 1992 and 2011 for which we can retrieve both firm size in Compustat
and CEO compensation in Execucomp. We select each year the top n (n = 500, 1000) largest firms (in term of total
market firm value, i.e. debt plus equity). The formula we use for total firm value is (CSHO*PRCC F+AT-CEQ-
TXDB). Deferred Taxes (item TXDB) is set to 0 when missing. ExecuComp total compensation variable, TDC1,
is adjusted as follows: when measured in its pre-2006 format, we substract from TDC1 the amount paid under the
company’s long-term incentive plan (execucomp variable LTIP). We then add the ex ante value of performance shares
by multiplying the target number of performance shares granted (execucomp variable SHRTARG) by the stock price
at the end of the fiscal year. When missing, the variable SHRTARG is replaced by 0. All nominal quantities are
converted into 2000 dollars using the GDP deflator of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The industries are the Fama
French [1997] 48 sectors. We regress the log of total compensation of the CEO in year t on the log of the firm value
(debt plus equity) at the end of the year t − 1, and the log of the 250th firm market value at the end of the year t − 1.
We report standard errors clustered at the firm level (first line) and at the year level (second line).
