                                             ABSTRACT

We examine how consumption responds to changes in sentiment regarding government economic
policy using cross-sectional variation across counties in the ideological predisposition of constituents.
When the incumbent party loses a presidential election, individuals in counties more ideologically
predisposed toward the losing party experience a dramatic and discontinuous relative decrease in optimism
on government economic policy. Using the interaction of constituent ideology in a county with election
timing as an instrument, we estimate the impact of government policy sentiment shocks on consumer
spending, and we find a very small effect that cannot be statistically distinguished from zero. The small
magnitude of the effect is estimated precisely. For example, we can reject the hypothesis that pessimism
regarding government economic policy effectiveness during the Great Recession had as large an effect
on consumption as the negative shock to household net worth coming from the collapse in house prices.

1        Introduction

Theory suggests that sentiment shocks, or shocks to consumer beliefs that are orthogonal to eco-

nomic fundamentals, could at times impact spending and output independently.1 However, esti-

mating the effect of sentiment shocks on consumer spending has proven difficult because sentiment

shocks are often correlated with changes in fundamentals such as revised expectations of income

growth.

        This paper introduces a new empirical methodology to estimate how consumption responds to

a specific type of sentiment shock: a shock to sentiments regarding government economic policy.

We exploit variation across U.S. counties in the constituent response to the outcome of presidential

elections. We show that ideological predisposition of residents in a county is a strong predictor

of changes in sentiments regarding government policy whenever a new party wins the presidency.

Specifically, partisans become very pessimistic about economic policy when their party loses the

White House.

        The idea that views on government economic policy might affect economic activity has been

proposed by academics and policy-makers alike. For example, in January 2015, the incoming Senate

majority leader Mitch McConnell suggested that rising strength in the U.S. economy toward the

end of 2014 was related to the expectation of a new Republican Congress. Nobel laureate Edward

Prescott is reported to have attributed the Great Recession to the election of Barack Obama in

2008 and the expectation of higher future taxes. Consumer confidence dropped sharply during the

“fiscal cliff” standoff in December of 2012, sparking worries of an effect on spending.2

        Figure 1 uses data measuring optimism on government economic policy from the University of

Michigan survey of consumers, and shows that there is indeed a strong correlation between govern-

ment economic policy optimism and consumption growth in quarterly data (correlation coefficient

of 0.57). However, it is not clear from Figure 1 whether government economic policy views have a

causal impact on growth in consumption, or whether the growth in consumption and views about

government economic policy are jointly determined by some common factors such as productivity

shocks.

   In order to estimate the causal effect of government economic policy views on consumption,

we begin with the observation that a change in the party with control of the White House affects

people’s sentiments very differently depending on their ideological predisposition. For example,

the defeat of the incumbent Republican party in the presidential election of 2008 leads to an

increase in optimism regarding government economic policy among liberal voters but worsens the

outlook among conservatives. We use this variation across U.S. counties to test whether a change

in sentiments about government economic policy has an effect on spending.

   We implement our methodology by matching each individual in the University of Michigan

Survey of Consumers to county-level data on presidential voting, a voter ideology score developed

by Tausanovitch and Warshaw (2013) [TW score henceforth], and consumer spending. Our final

data set covers the period from 2000 to 2013, and includes four presidential elections.

   A change in party control of the White House results in a huge relative increase in pessimism

about government economic policy for individuals who are predisposed against the winning party.

Views on whether the government is doing a good job or not in controlling inflation and unemploy-

ment fall by 1.4 standard deviations for a county voting against the winning party with probability

0 relative to a county voting with probability 1 for the winning party.

   A concern with our finding may be that the shift in sentiment about government policy is not

driven by the interaction of ideological differences and the change in control of the White House,

but some unobserved economic shock that happens to be correlated with constituent ideology and

emerges at the same time as the elections. However, this concern is unlikely given that the shift

in government economic policy sentiment occurs precisely around the news of election results.

Moreover, the relative shift in sentiment occurs only around the 2000 and 2008 elections that

resulted in a change in the party controlling the White House. There is no significant relative shift

in sentiment around the 2004 and 2012 elections that resulted in incumbent victories.

   The impact of party-changing elections on government economic policy sentiment is robust to

demographic controls, county-level industry exposure, and state fixed effects. We also examine

income, tax, and transfer growth around 2000 and 2008 elections, and we find no significant dif-

ferences in Republican-leaning counties versus Democrat-leaning counties. These facts justify our

interpretation of the relative movement in views on government economic policy as a sentiment

                                                 2
shock that is orthogonal to fundamentals.

       We then estimate the effect of ideology-driven change in sentiment regarding government policy

on consumer spending using both self-reported spending plans in the Michigan survey, as well as

actual county-level consumer spending data. For actual spending, we utilize a new data set that

tracks credit card purchases, and a separate dataset on new auto purchases – both at the county

level.

       Across all measures, we find no effect of government economic policy sentiment shocks on

consumer spending around the Bush 2000 elections, and the estimates are reasonably precise.

There is no significant effect of the sentiment shock on either self-reported spending plans, or actual

spending as measured by the purchase of new automobiles. The IV estimate rejects at the 5% level

that the effect of a one standard deviation increase in sentiment about government economic policy

is greater than a seven percentage point increase in new automobile spending growth.

       There is a significant effect of the sentiment shock on survey-reported spending plans on au-

tomobiles after the Obama 2008 election. However, there is no significant effect of sentiment on

actual spending on the purchase of new automobiles. Similarly, there is no significant effect of

sentiment on credit card spending. The IV estimates can reject at the 5% level that the effect of

a one standard deviation increase in sentiments is greater than seven percentage points increase

in new automobile sales, or 3.4 percentage point increase in credit card spending. We contrast

the small magnitude of the impact of government policy sentiment on spending during the 2008

Obama-McCain election with the magnitude of the impact of falling house prices on spending es-

timated in Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2013). We can easily reject the equality of the two effects. The

housing net worth shock has a dramatic effect on all measures of spending, whereas the change in

sentiment about government policy has close to a zero effect.

       It is useful to put our empirical approach in the context of the extant literature on sentiments

and consumer spending. A large empirical literature posits that sentiments, noise, or animal spirits

shocks matter for consumption.3 But the literature has struggled to find instruments that move

sentiment independently of fundamentals. In the absence of such shifters, the empirical work has

adopted two approaches: (i) control for as many of the fundamental shocks as possible treating the
   3
     See, for example, the studies by Blanchard (1993) and Hall (1993) which were in part motivated by the 1990-
1991 recession. A related literature measures the effect of news about economic fundamentals on business cycle
fluctuations. See for example, Cochrane (1994), Beaudry and Portier (2006), and Jaimovich and Rebelo (2009).


                                                       3
residual variation in measures of confidence as sentiment shocks or (ii) use a structural model to

separate the effect of news or fundamentals from the direct effect of sentiments.4

       Methodologically, our paper differs from the existing empirical literature on sentiments and

consumer spending in two ways. First, instead of using aggregate time-series data to tease out the

effect of sentiments on spending, we use county-level panel data. This allows us to absorb unob-

served economy-wide supply and demand shocks that jointly affect both sentiments and consumer

spending. The granularity of county-level data also enables us to control for possibly spurious

shocks at the industry or state level. For example, sentiments and spending may be jointly affected

by a boom in the oil industry, or certain counties may be more exposed to swings in the construction

sector. Further, we use independent measures of actual spending at a microeconomic level instead

of only using survey responses to measure spending.5

       Second, our methodology does not rely on residual variation after controlling for fundamental

shocks to identify sentiment shocks. Instead we specify an exact channel, namely the interac-

tion of ideological predisposition with election news, to identify the effect of sentiments regarding

government policy on consumer spending.

       The results of our paper our similar in spirit to the recent paper by Barsky and Sims (2012),

who use a structural decomposition of the innovation in sentiments into a “news’’ and an “animal

spirits’’ component to argue that the forecasting power of consumer confidence is mostly driven by

news, not sentiments. Our paper differs from Barsky and Sims (2012) in that we use cross-sectional

variation driven by ideological predisposition as an instrument for change in sentiments. A second

difference is that our focus is on sentiments regarding government policy, and not the broader

consumer sentiments index.6

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the empirical framework

we use to estimate the effect of sentiment shocks on consumption. Section 3 presents the data and
   4
     Carroll, Fuhrer, and Wilcox (1994) control for as many of the observable news shocks as possible (e.g. labor
income growth, productivity), and assume that the residual variation in sentiments is driven by non-fundamental
factors.
   5
     A blossoming recent literature uses microeconomic data from the Michigan survey to explain inflation expec-
tations. See for example, Bachmann, Berg, and Sims (2012), Burke and Ozdagli (2013), Malmendier and Nagel
(2009). We are unaware of any research using microeconomic data on consumer confidence from the Michigan data
to explain household consumption. A recent FEDS Note from Aladangady and Sahm (2015) use the micro-data from
the Michigan survey to examine how views on gasoline prices affect views on spending.
   6
     There is also a growing literature on policy uncertainty and its potential effect on investment and GDP (e.g.
Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2015)). However, “uncertainty” is often associated with second moments of the data such
as stock market volatility and as such is different from the measure of sentiments used in this paper.

2     Empirical Framework

2.1   Fundamentals and Sentiment Shocks

We motivate the empirical analysis with the framework in Lorenzoni (2009). In his model, a

representative consumer maximizes expected utility over consumption and labor, and the technology

of the economy evolves over time. More specifically, the representative consumer maximizes:

                                           ∞
                                           X
                                       E         β t ∗ U (Ct , Nt )
                                           t=0


Technology allows consumers to convert labor into income according to a linear production function:


                                            Yt = At ∗ Nt


where at = ln(At ). The only source of uncertainty is the evolution of productivity. Productivity

has a permanent component xt and a temporary component ηt :


                                            at = xt + ηt


where ηt is an i.i.d. shock, normal, with zero mean and variance ση2 . The permanent component of

productivity is a random walk process given by:


                                           xt = xt−1 + t


where t is also i.i.d., normal, with zero mean and variance σ2 . Agents observe current produc-

tivity at each period in addition to a noisy signal wt regarding the permanent component of the

productivity process, given by:


                                            wt = xt + ψt



                                                     5
where ψt is i.i.d., normal, with zero mean and variance σψ2 .

   The shock ψ plays a crucial role in our framework, because it represents noise that affects signals

on the permanent component of productivity. What exactly does ψt capture? Lorenzoni (2009)

refers to realizations of ψt as “noise shocks” which distort the true information from public signals

and “induce consumers to temporarily overestimate or underestimate the productive capacity of

the economy.” We refer to ψt as sentiment shocks in the rest of this study.

   Consumers update their beliefs on productivity using both at and wt . Using a Kalman filter,

the expected value of xt at time t follows:


                           xt|t = ρ ∗ xt−1|t−1 + (1 − ρ) ∗ (δwt + (1 − δ)at )                     (1)


As this equation shows, consumer beliefs on the evolution of productivity depends on wt , which is

itself a function of the sentiment shock ψt . Fundamental shocks ηt and t also affect beliefs about

productivity through their effect on at , but the consumer cannot delineate whether sentiment or

fundamentals move xt in any period.


2.2   Effect on Consumption

Our goal in this study is to estimate the effect of sentiment shocks on consumption. Equation 1

represents household beliefs on the evolution of productivity. Whether or not revised beliefs about

productivity affect consumption and output is a function of many other factors, such as preferences,

nominal rigidities, adjustment costs, and the stochastic properties of the shocks. Our setting is more

reduced form, and as such it is better to view equation 1 as describing household beliefs about the

evolution of permanent income rather than productivity. Under this alternative interpretation,

sentiment shocks ψt affect wt which in turn informs households about their permanent income.

Our approach is to estimate the direct effect of sentiment shocks on consumption, allowing for a

flexible functional form to capture the timing and magnitude of the effect.

   Using aggregate data, a natural test would be a regression of change in log consumption (ct )

on the shocks. Let Θ be a t x 2 matrix of fundamental shocks:

                                                          
                                              Θt = ηt t


                                                   6
We could then estimate the following time-series regression:


                                        ∆ct = ψt γ + Θt Λ + ζt


The problem with such an approach is that we don’t observe ψt or Θt in the data. Instead, the most

common measure used in the literature is survey-based answers to consumer confidence questions,

what we call ∆St . As has long been recognized in the literature, answers to consumer confidence

questions likely reflect both sentiment shocks and fundamental shocks, neither of which can be

separately observed by the econometrician:


                                           ∆St = f (ψt , Θt )


The core identification problem in estimating the effect of sentiment shocks on consumption growth

is separating out shocks to sentiments (ψt ) from shocks to fundamentals (Θt ).


2.3   Cross-Sectional Variation

Previous research has used either structural methods (Barsky and Sims (2012)) or control variables

(Carroll, Fuhrer, and Wilcox (1994)) to tease out the independent effects of ψt and Θt on consump-

tion. Our approach differs by focusing on the cross-sectional variation in sentiment shocks across

U.S. counties.

   Formally, let each U.S. county be an island i that consumes its own income and has no commu-

nication with other islands. Each island receives shocks ψi and Θi at period 1. The consumption

impulse response function between period 0 and τ ≥ 1 can be written down as:


                                     ∆ciτ = γτ ∗ ψi + Θi Λτ + νiτ                                    (2)


where γτ allows for a flexible response of consumption to sentiment shocks over time, and exploits

cross-sectional variation across islands in sentiment shocks at t = 1 to identify the effect of sentiment

shock on consumption.

   Let ∆Si be the change in consumer sentiment as measured in consumer surveys between t = 0

to t = τ on island i. The key problem is that ∆Si reflects both sentiment shock ψi and fundamental


                                                   7
shocks Θi . The cross-sectional approach does not solve the core identification problem of separating

sentiment shocks from fundamental shocks, unless we can find an instrument zi that is correlated

with with sentiment shock but is uncorrelated with the fundamental shocks, i.e. ψi = f (zi ), and

Θi ⊥ zi .

    Such an instrument zi moves ∆Si but is orthogonal to fundamental shocks occurring on island

i. With such an instrument, two-stage least squares provides a consistent estimate of γτ , or the

effect of sentiment shocks on consumption growth:


                                    ∆Siτ = δτ ∗ zi + Xi Πτ + uiτ                                 (3)




                                  ∆ciτ = γτ ∗ ∆S
                                              diτ + Xi Λτ + ωiτ                                  (4)

where Xi represents a set of variables that proxy for possible fundamental shocks, such as industry

employment share in county i, state fixed effects, demographics, or income level. There are a number

of advantages to this approach. First, given control variables Xi , the orthogonality condition can

be weakened to say that the instrument is orthogonal to fundamental shocks after partialling out

the variation due to observable control variables. Second, using a specific instrument zi takes an

explicit stand on the source of variation being used to isolate sentiment shocks. This is a more

transparent approach than relying on residual variation that may still be driven by fundamental

shocks.

    However, the use of an instrument comes at the usual cost that the consumption response

estimated in equation 4 is a local average treatment effect. This implies that our estimates refer

to the effect of sentiments on consumption that is driven by a change in sentiments through the

instrument zi . The next section explains the appropriate interpretation of the sentiment shock

isolated by our instrument.


2.4    IV Strategy: Isolating Sentiment Regarding Government Economic Policy

Our instrument zi is county-level ideology, where we use two measures for ideology. The first is

the share of the population in a county voting for the Republican candidate in the election being



                                                 8
examined. The second is from Tausanovitch and Warshaw (2013) which we refer to as the TW

score. The latter variable is meant to capture the policy preferences of constituents in a county,

and is extracted from a large number of surveys with 275,000 participants in total.7 We use the

ideological predisposition instrument to isolate sentiment shocks coming from presidential elections

that result in a change in party in control of the White House in 2000 and 2008.

    As we will show below, the instrument has a very strong first stage. Constituent ideology in a

county has an enormously powerful and statistically robust effect on views on government economic

policy right after presidential elections where the party in control of the White House changes.

We refer to the predicted effect of constituent ideology on government economic policy views in

equation 3 above) as government policy sentiment shocks, and the coefficient γτ in equation 4

capture the effect of government policy sentiment shocks on consumer spending.



3     Data and Summary Statistics

The analysis employs individual level data and county level data. The individual level data on

consumer confidence comes from the Thomson Reuters University of Michigan Survey of Consumers.

The county-level data set includes data from a variety of sources. Below, we provide more details

and summary statistics.


3.1    Data

The individual level survey of consumer confidence is from Thomson Reuters University of Michigan

Survey of Consumers. This survey is a nationally representative survey of about 500 individuals

every month. On average two-thirds of the individuals surveyed in a month are interviewed a second

time after six months. The remaining third are only surveyed once. An important advantage of the

Michigan survey is that we can match individuals to the counties they live in. The county match is

possible in the survey for data after the year 2000 and as such we focus on the period 2000 to 2013

in this study. There are 81,691 individual survey responses in the Michigan Survey of Consumers
   7
     In a robustness test reported in the appendix, we also use the fraction of the population who are members of
Evangelical, Latter-day Saints, or mainline Protestant churches. As we will show, church membership among these
groups strongly predicts changes in views on government economic policy around elections.




                                                       9
data between January 2001 and September 2013.8

    The counties in our final sample are a subset of all U.S. counties, where the main sample

restriction is the availability of Michigan survey data. We impose the restriction that respondents

to the survey in counties both before and after each election in order to estimate the effect of

sentiment shocks on consumer spending.9 For the four elections in our sample, we have on average

about 1,000 counties which represent on average about 80% of the population. The number of

survey responses per county is highly correlated with the population of the county, with a univariate

regression giving an R-squared of 0.90. Given the highly skewed distribution of population - and

hence survey counts - across counties, we weight regressions by total number of survey respondents

behind each observation.

    We merge a number of additional county-level variables to our data set from various sources.

Our main measure of ideology in a county is the fraction of total votes going to the Republican

candidate in the four presidential elections that fall during our sample period: 2000, 2004, 2008

and 2012. However, as mentioned above, we also employ the TW score as a measure of constituent

ideology. Both measures are increasing in conservatism.

    To measure shocks to economic fundamentals Xi , we use income and wage data from the IRS

and employment data from the County Business Patterns data set published by the U.S. Census

Bureau. The CBP data are used to construct county-level share of employment in each 2-digit

NAICS industry. We use these variables to control for possible industry specific shocks hitting a

county at a point in time.

    To measure spending at the county-level, we utilize three data sets. First, we use new auto

purchases from R.L. Polk. These data are derived from new car registrations and are based on

the county where the buyer lives. The data are described in detail in Mian and Sufi (2012), and

are available over our entire sample period. Second, we use a previously unused data set on credit

card spending from Argus Information and Advisory Services, a Verisk Analytics company. Argus

specializes in credit card and deposit benchmarking. The benchmarking data is collected from

individual issuers at the account and transaction level, and then aggregated at the county level
    8
      This data is restricted to individuals with information on the county that they live in, so we can match the
individual level data to county level data.
    9
      Since the underlying individual level data is a nationally representative random sample, restricting attention to
counties that have responses in both pre and post election year does not introduce any particular bias. The only cost
of this restriction is the loss of some statistical power.


                                                          10
to construct an annual measure of spending through credit cards. The Argus spending data is

available from 2006 onwards, so we can only use it for the 2008 election. Third, we use answers to

questions in the Michigan survey, which asks respondents whether it is a good time to spend on

household items or autos.

   In addition to these variables, we add county-level information on demographics from the U.S.

decennial census. We also utilize house price data from CoreLogic, and the housing net worth shock

variable from Mian and Sufi (2014). The latter variable represents the percentage decline in total

household net worth coming from the decline in house prices from 2006 to 2009.

   The income and spending variables are constructed in per capita terms. Income is normalized

by dividing total income in a county by the number of returns, while spending is normalized by

dividing by total population in a county. There is a secular trend in relative population growth

throughout the 1990s and the 2000s, with Republican leaning counties growing at a faster pace.


3.2   Summary Statistics

Table 1 contains summary statistics for the two main presidential elections we examine. The con-

sumer sentiment index from the Michigan survey is one of the most common consumer confidence

measures used by academics and financial press alike. It is computed as the relative favorability

score on five broad questions in the survey: current financial well-being, current buying attitude, ex-

pected financial well-being, expected business conditions, and expected broad economic conditions.

The first two questions are also separately summarized by the sub-index of current economic con-

ditions, whereas the last three questions are separately summarized by the sub-index of consumer

expectations. We average these indices for all individuals within a county-year.

   Views on government policy, which are the focus of our analysis, are measured with the response

to the question: “As to the economic policy of the government – I mean steps taken to fight inflation

or unemployment – would you say the government is doing a good job, only fair, or a poor job?”

We code the variable as 0 if the response is poor job, 0.5 for only fair, and 1 for good job.

   In Table 1, all measures from the Michigan survey are normalized to be mean zero and standard

deviation one, and counties are weighted by the average number of survey respondents during the

time period examined. On average, there is a decline in measures of consumer confidence from 2000

to 2001, which likely reflects economic weakness and the terrorist attacks of September 2001. New

                                                  11
auto purchases also fell from 2000 to 2001.

    On average, there is a rise in consumer confidence measures from 2008 to 2009, which partially

reflects the very low levels reached in 2008. There is a decline in both new auto purchases and

credit card spending from 2008 to 2009, which reflects the severity of the recession and the weak

recovery at the end of 2009. The three main measures of ideology are the Republican vote share

fractions in 2000 (48%) and 2008 (45%) along with the TW ideology score.

    The last panel provides county-level summary statistics on variables we use as controls. It also

shows the housing net worth shock is on average 10%. In other words, the decline in household

net worth driven by the decline in house prices from 2006 to 2009 is on average 10% across U.S.

counties in the sample.



4    First Stage: Government Policy Sentiment Shock

We can estimate equation 3 around presidential elections in 2000 and 2008, that resulted in a

change in party in the White House, to test if ideology predicts a change in sentiments regarding

government economic policy. We do so by first estimating equation 3 in levels instead of first-

differences because this allows us to estimate the entire pre- and post-election trajectory of relative

sentiments in counties that are ideologically aligned with the winning party. In particular, we

estimate the equation:

                             τX
                              =T                            τX
                                                             =T
                                      τ        0
                     Siτ =           α ∗ dτ + γ ∗ zi +                 γ τ ∗ (dτ ∗ zi ) + νiτ      (5)
                             τ =−T                       τ =−T,τ 6=0


where dτ is an indicator variable for quarter τ , τ = 0 is the “omitted” quarter and refers to the

quarter of the election (e.g., 2000Q4 or 2008Q4), ατ represents quarter fixed effects, and γ τ are

the coefficients of interest that tell us about the relative shift in government economic policy view

among counties that lean conservative.




                                                   12
4.1      Ideology and Views on Government Economic Policy

Figure 2 presents estimates from equation 5 for both the Bush-Gore 2000 election and the Obama-

McCain 2008 election.10 The measure of county-level ideology is the share voting for the Republi-

cans in each respective election, and the outcome variable is views on government economic policy,

normalized to be mean zero and standard deviation one. The coefficient estimates of γ τ tell us

the relative shift in government economic policy view among counties with a higher vote share for

Republicans.

       Both panels show a dramatic relative shift in government economic policy view that occurs in

the quarter after the election. There is almost no pre-trend prior to the quarter of the election, and

the response is immediate. This helps to ensure that the change in views on government economic

policy are not due to some other factor. Given that the left hand side variable is normalized,

magnitudes are easy to interpret. Moving from a county with zero share voting for the Republican

to everyone voting for the Republican moves views on government economic policy by about 1.5

standard deviations. The magnitude is similar across both elections. Republicans become much

more optimistic about government policy after the Bush victory in 2000, and much more pessimistic

after the Obama victory in 2008.

       The first column of panels A and B of Table 2 show the first difference regression version of this

result, where we explicitly estimate the first stage equation 3 from Section 2. We use the change

in views over two years in the regression, but the full time series of the effect can be seen in Figure

2. Both estimates show a strong effect of the Republican vote share on the change in government

economic policy view. The magnitudes show that moving from 0 to 1 Republican vote share moves

views on government economic policy by 1.3 and 1.5 standard deviations for the Bush and Obama

election, respectively. Column 4 uses the alternative definition of ideology based on the TW-score,

and we find the same result.

       Sentiment is measured at the individual level, so in principal we could have run equation 5 at the

individual level if we could observe an individual’s ideology or the party for which she voted. While

we do not have this information at the individual level, we can use race as a proxy for ideology. It is

well-known that whites are significantly more likely to vote Republican. For example, whites were

    We do not include any control variables in the figures; we add controls in the first difference specifications reported
in the tables.



                                                            13
13 percentage points more likely to vote for Bush in the 2000 election, and 12 percentage points

more likely to vote for McCain in the 2008 election.

      Appendix Figure 1 uses an indicator variable for white as zi in equation 5 at the individual

level. It shows a very similar pattern when estimating the differential views on government eco-

nomic policy among whites and non-whites. In relative terms, whites become more optimistic after

the Bush 2000 election in terms of their views regarding government economic policy, and more

pessimistic after the Obama 2008 election.

      The results in this section strongly indicate that ideological predisposition moves sentiments re-

garding government economic policy depending on election outcomes. One of our instruments was

the TW-score that is directly based on survey evidence regarding constituents’ ideological prefer-

ences. As additional evidence, we use church attendance as an instrument for the sentiment shock.

We use data from the Association of Religion Data Archives on church membership, and calculate

the share of the population that are members of Evangelical, Latter-day Saints, or mainstream

Protestant churches.11

      Appendix Tables 1 shows the first stage of regressing the change in sentiments regarding govern-

ment economic policy around elections on the fraction of the population that is a member of one of

these churches. Counties with higher church membership see a large relative increase in optimism

on government economic policy after the Bush election and decrease in optimism after the Obama

election. It is less likely that people in counties with higher membership in these churches vote

Republican because of pure economic interests, and yet these counties see optimism on government

economic policy move strongly after elections.


4.2      Do Shifting Views Reflect Fundamental Shocks?

Figure 2 and columns 1 and 4 of Table 2 show that the ideological pre-disposition of a county

has very strong predictive power for the change in views regarding economic policy. However,

could the relationship between ideology and the change in sentiments around elections be driven

by unobserved spurious factors? In the language of the model presented earlier, there is a concern

that the shift in government policy view may be driven by some unobserved fundamental shocks

Θi as oppoed to sentiment shocks ψi .

                                                     14
   The ideological pre-disposition of a county is correlated with a number of factors, and one

may be concerned that some of these factors - and not ideology per se - are responsible for the

shift in sentiments. Table 3 explores the factors that are correlated with ideology. The first row

shows that the Republican vote shares in both 2000 and 2008 are highly correlated with the TW

ideology score, which suggests that vote shares do a good job capturing ideological differences across

counties in the perception of what good policy is. However, Table 3 also shows that ideology is

not randomly distributed. Republican leaning counties tend to be more white and have higher

homeownership rates. While median income is not strongly correlated with ideology, there is a

larger fraction of the population in poverty or unemployed in Democrat leaning counties. There also

are important differences in industry employment shares in Republican versus Democrat leaning

counties. Republican leaning counties have more jobs in the manufacturing, retail trade, and

construction industries. Democrat leaning counties have higher employment shares in finance,

education, and other professional services. The housing net worth shock, which Mian, Rao, and

Sufi (2013) show has a strong effect on consumption growth from 2006 to 2009, is uncorrelated with

the Republican vote share in 2008 after controlling for state fixed effects.

   Could one of the factors correlated with ideology be driving the key result shown in Figure 2?

Columns 2, 3, 5, and 6 of Table 2 show that this is unlikely to be the case. The inclusion of control

variables based on correlations in Table 3 has almost no effect on the responsiveness of government

economic policy view to ideology. Columns 2 controls for demographics and employment shares

in 2-digit NAICS codes. The demographic controls include fraction of population that is white,

log of median household income, homeownership rate, fraction less than high school education,

fraction with exactly high school education, unemployment rate, poverty rate and fraction urban.

All values are as of year 2000. The 2-digit employment share controls include the fraction of total

county employment that is employed in each of the 23 2-digit NAICS industries. The industry

share controls thus account for changes in sentiments that might be driven by conservative counties

differing in their industry mix.

   The results in column 2 show that while the R2 increases by 0.05, the coefficient on the Re-

publican vote share is almost identical. This is true for both the Bush 2000 victory (Panel A) and

the Obama 2008 victory (Panel B). Adding state fixed effects in column 3 increases R2 further but

has almost no effect on the coefficient estimate for Republican vote share. The results are similar

                                                 15
using the TW ideology score instead of the Republican vote share in columns 5 and 6.

   The absence of a pre-trend in relative sentiment shift and the sharp rise in relative sentiment at

the news of election results in Figure 2, coupled with the robustness to extensive controls in Table

2 make it unlikely that ideology affects views on government economic policy for some reason other

than the change in the Presidency. We perform one additional placebo test to confirm this result.

If the relative shift in sentiments is driven by a change in party in the White House, then we should

not find this effect around the 2004 and 2012 presidential elections that resulted in incumbent

victories.

   Figure 3 and Table 4 conduct this placebo experiment and find no significant shift in sentiment

around the election news. In both the Bush victory in 2004 and the Obama victory in 2012, we

see no relative shift in views on government policy among conservatives. There is a slight negative

reaction by Democrat leaning counties in 2004 that is seen in Figure 3, which may reflect dashed

hopes of a possible Kerry victory. However, as Table 4 shows, the change is not statistically

significant and is estimated close to zero with the inclusion of control variables. Moreover, the

coefficient on Republican vote share also switches signs depending on which control variables are

included. The placebo tests help ensure that there is nothing spurious about presidential elections

and changes in views on government economic policy across the ideological spectrum.


4.3    Do Elections Directly Affect Fundamentals in a Partisan Fashion?

So far we have addressed the concern that fundamental shocks - such as shocks to permanent income

- that independently move sentiments may be spuriously correlated with ideological predisposition

of counties exactly around the timing of presidential elections. The placebo tests, evidence on

timing, and the statistical robustness of the government policy view shift makes this unlikely. An

alternative concern is that the election result directly affects fundamentals, and does so differentially

for supporters versus opponents of the winning candidate. For example, if policies implemented by

President Obama after his inauguration disproportionately hurt Republican-leaning counties, then

the shift in views on government economic policy in Republican-leaning counties may be a response

to a fundamental shock.

   We evaluate this concern in Tables 5 and 6. Table 5 examines income growth at the county

level from before to after the 2000 (Panel A) and 2008 (Panel B) elections. Income is measured at

                                                   16
the county level using data from IRS returns. Columns 1 through 3 use growth in adjusted gross

income from tax returns as the dependent variable, while columns 4 through 6 use growth in wages

and salaries alone as the dependent variable. There is no evidence of a differential income shock in

counties that lean Republican in either of the elections. There is some slight evidence that wage

growth falls disproportionately in Republican leaning counties following the Bush 2000 election,

but this goes in the opposite direction and cannot explain our key finding that Republicans become

much more optimistic regarding government economic policy. In summary, there is no evidence

that a switch in White House control hurts income growth in the counties that voted for the losing

party.12

         While Table 5 looks at income, there may be a concern that transfer payments to and from

the government are affected differently for Republicans versus Democrats depending on election

outcomes. Table 6 tests for this particular concern using state-level data on taxes, the tax rate,

and government transfer payments. These data come from the IRS and the Consolidated Federal

Funds Report reported by the Census. For both elections that result in a change in party at

the White House, we look for any evidence that taxes paid, tax rates, or transfer payments change

differentially for counties that lean Republican. There is no such evidence. The coefficient estimates

are typically small and insignificant.

         As a final note, our results in the next section suggest that government policy sentiment shocks

have almost no effect on household spending. If one believes that shift in views on government

economic policy are partially capturing a shock to fundamentals, our null result becomes even more

notable.



5         Second Stage: Consumption Response to Sentiment Shocks

Armed with a strong first stage effect across U.S. counties of ideological predisposition on views of

government economic policy, we are now ready to estimate whether government policy sentiment

shocks affect spending. The results overall suggest that the shocks have almost no effect on con-

sumption. Despite partisans reacting strongly in their views toward government policy, they do

not seem to adjust actual household spending in response to their updated views.
    12
    Picking a wider window around election times, for example using 2-year income growth, does not change the
result in Table 5.


                                                      17
5.1      Consumption Response after Bush 2000 Victory

We begin by evaluating the Bush 2000 election victory. Figure 4 presents results from the re-

duced form equation 5 where the outcome variables are consumer responses to the Michigan survey

question of whether it is a good time to buy household items (left panel) or a car (right panel).

The outcome variables are normalized to be mean zero and standard deviation one. Given this

normalization, we have kept the y-axis scale of Figure 4 the same as that for Figures 2 and 3,

so the magnitude of the reduced form equation can be visually compared with the magnitude of

the first stage. As Figure 4 shows, there is almost no effect whatsoever on consumer attitudes

towards spending. Republican-leaning counties are no more likely to answer that it is a good time

to buy household items or cars despite the strong first-stage effect of becoming more optimistic on

government economic policy.

   Figure 5 presents results from the same specification but with the logarithm of new auto pur-

chases as the outcome variable. These are actual new auto purchases, not a response to a survey

question. As before, we normalize the left hand side variable to be mean zero and standard devia-

tion one in order to make the coefficient magnitudes comparable. We examine new auto purchases

at an annual frequency because quarterly auto purchases are extremely noisy given differential

seasonality patterns across counties. The coefficient estimates of γ τ reveal a negligible effect of the

Republican vote share on new auto purchases. There looks to be some differential effect of the

Republican vote share on new auto purchases in 2000 relative to 1999 and 2001. We will take this

into account by using the change from 1999 to 2001 when running first difference specifications

below.

   Table 7 presents the reduced form specification relating views on spending with ideology. As

in Figure 4, the outcome variable is based on consumer responses to the Michigan survey question

of whether it is a good time to buy household items (left panel) or a car (right panel). For each

county, we calculate the difference in the answer to these questions from 2000 to 2001 or 2000 to

2002, and we relate this difference to the Republican vote share in the county as of 2000. The left

hand side variables are normalized to be mean zero and standard deviation one. The results are

consistent with the pattern shown in Figure 4: we find no significant effect of ideology on whether

it is a good time to spend on household items or cars.



                                                  18
   Table 8 evaluates the growth in purchases of new autos. Panel A presents reduced form estimates

and panel B presents instrumental variables estimates from estimation of equation 4 from Section

2. The reduced form estimates in columns 1 and 2 of panel A show some evidence of an increase in

new auto purchases in counties leaning Republican following the Bush 2000 election. However, as

mentioned above, there appears to be a temporary downward blip in 2000 that drives this result.

If we examine 1999 to 2001 or 1999 to 2002, we see no effect of the 2000 Republican vote share on

growth in new auto purchases.

   The instrumental variables estimates in panel B generally show no strong effect of the gov-

ernment policy sentiment shock on new auto purchases. As is the norm when using instrumental

variables, the standard errors are larger than in the reduced form. However, despite the larger

standard errors, we can reject at the 5% level of confidence that a one standard deviation increase

in the government policy sentiment shock leads to a 7 percentage point or larger increase in new

auto sales.


5.2   Consumption Response after Obama 2008 Victory

Figure 6 shows the analogous coefficient estimates as in Figure 4 but for the Obama 2008 victory.

The left hand side variable is the answer to survey questions on whether now is a good time to

spend on household items (left panel) or a car (right panel). Here is the only setting in which we

see an effect of government policy sentiment shocks. Respondents in Republican leaning counties

become relatively more pessimistic about spending after the Obama election victory at exactly the

same time they report becoming relatively more pessimistic on government economic policy. Table

9 shows that the survey-reported pessimism on car purchase plans is robust to control variables

and state fixed effects, but the result on household items is not.

   However, when we examine actual spending, we cannot replicate this finding. In Figure 7,

we use new auto purchases and credit card spending, and we see almost no differential effect for

counties with a high 2008 Republican vote share. Following the Obama victory in 2008, respondents

in Republican leaning counties say in surveys that it is a bad time time to purchase autos. But

actual measures of household spending do not decline disproportionately in Republican leaning

counties. There appears to be a gap between what people say in survey responses relative to what

they actually spend.

                                                 19
   Tables 10 and 11 present the reduced form and second stage estimation relating household

spending growth on government policy sentiment shocks. Consistent with Figure 7, we see no

evidence that the powerful government policy sentiment shocks isolated in the first stage estimation

affect household spending in a significant manner. The standard errors are small enough that we

can be reasonably precise in estimating a null effect. For example, we can reject at the 5% level

of confidence that a one standard deviation increase in government policy sentiment leads to a 7

percentage point or larger effect on auto purchases, or 3.4 percentage point increase or larger in

credit card spending.

   Another way we can evaluate the precision of the null result is to compare it with other shocks

that we know from extant literature affect household spending. The shock we examine in compari-

son is the housing net worth shock in Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2013). Their study shows that counties

experiencing a sharp decline in net worth coming from the collapse in house prices saw a dramatic

decline in household spending form 2006 to 2009.

   In Figure 7, we directly compare the two shocks. As already mentioned, we measure the effect

of the government policy sentiment shock by examining how spending differentially evolves in

Republican leaning counties after 2008. Year 0 is 2008 for the reduced form sentiment shock. The

housing net worth shock is the decline in household net worth coming from the collapse in house

prices from 2006 to 2009; therefore, year 0 is 2006 when evaluating the housing net worth shock.

In order to directly compare magnitudes, both the 2008 Republican vote share and the housing net

worth shock from 2006 to 2009 are normalized to be mean zero and standard deviation one.

   Figure 7 replicates the Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2013) result that counties experiencing a more

negative housing net worth shock from 2006 to 2009 see a much bigger drop in spending. A

negative housing net worth shock of one standard deviation leads to a 12 percentage point decline

in new auto purchases and a 6 percentage point decline in credit card spending.

   Recall from above that we can reject at the 5% level of confidence that a one standard deviation

change in government policy sentiment shocks leads to a 7 percentage point or larger effect on auto

purchases or a 3.4 percentage point or larger effect on credit card purchases. These magnitudes

together with the results from Figure 7 imply that we can reject at the 5% confidence level that a

one standard deviation change in government policy sentiment shocks has as large an effect as the

housing net worth channel identified in previous research.

                                                20
6    Discussion of Null Result

The cross-sectional variation across counties in ideology strongly predicts shifts in opinion on the

effectiveness of government economic policy, and yet these shifts have almost no effect on household

spending. How do we interpret this null result? We started with the assumption that the change

in views regarding government economic policy is a function of both sentiment and fundamental

shocks, i.e. ∆Si = f (ψi , Θi ). Let ∆S
                                     di be the part of ∆Si driven by sentiment shocks (ψi ) alone.

Then our central result is that ∆ci 6= f (∆S
                                          di ): consumption is not affected by changes in government

economic policy views that are orthogonal to fundamentals.

    One potential worry with this interpretation is that there is something wrong with the cross-

sectional specification we run. For example, perhaps there is not enough power in county-level

analysis or perhaps variables from the Michigan survey are too noisily measured. We address this

concern in the first three columns of Table 12. In particular, we examine cross-sectional variation

across U.S. counties in a fundamental shock: the shock to housing net worth from 2006 to 2009.

Column 1 shows that the Michigan index of consumer sentiment reacts strongly to the shock,

with areas seeing a decline in housing net worth also reporting pessimism about future economic

conditions. Further, measures of consumption are correlated with the change in consumer sentiment

from 2006 to 2009 in the expected direction. The first three columns show that a fundamental shock

moves the index of consumer sentiment in the expected direction, and has the expected effect on

consumption growth. County-level regressions can detect the effect of a fundamental shock.

    We believe that we find no effect of changes in government economic policy views on con-

sumption because most of the variation in answers to this question reflect sentiments that do not

affect permanent income directly. We present two results to support this view. First, in columns

4 through 6 of Table 12, we report OLS estimates of the change in consumption directly on the

change in views regarding government economic policy, and find that there is a zero effect even in

the OLS specification. This suggests that observed changes in government economic policy views,

even in the absence of an instrument, purely reflects shifts in sentiment, not shifts in fundamentals.

That is, ∆Si = f (ψi ).

    In cross-sectional analysis, variation in views on government economic policy are not even corre-

lated with changes in consumption growth, which suggests that survey respondents are not changing


                                                 21
their views on government economic policy because of fundamental changes in their economic well-

being.

      We can provide further support to this view by examining aggregate correlations. In Table 13,

we provide correlations between aggregate real consumption growth, government policy views, and

the index of consumer sentiment.13 The latter two variables come from the same Michigan survey.

      The first column shows that both government policy views and the index of consumer sentiment

are strongly correlated with consumption growth. The aggregate correlation between the index of

consumer sentiment and consumption growth explains why a large amount of research focuses on

consumer confidence and economic fluctuations. We already know from Figure 1 that there is a

strong correlation between government policy views and consumption in the aggregate. Further,

the index of consumer sentiment and government economic policy views are highly correlated with

each other: when survey respondents are pessimistic about the overall economy, they are also

pessimistic about government economic policy.

      However, the correlation of government economic policy views with aggregate consumption

growth is not robust. To show this, we first regress government economic policy views on the wider

index of consumer sentiment to obtain the predicted residuals. By construction, the residuals are

the time series component of shifts in government economic policy views that are orthogonal to the

index of consumer sentiment. As we show, there is almost zero correlation between consumption

growth and the residual variation in government economic policy views that is orthogonal to the

broader index of consumer sentiment. This is consistent with the argument above that the pure

sentiment part of government economic policy views does not affect consumption.

      For the last row, we do the converse: we regress the index of consumer sentiment on govern-

ment economic policy views and use the predicted residuals. The part of the index of consumer

sentiment that is orthogonal to government economic policy views remains strongly correlated with

consumption growth. In other words, aggregate changes in government economic policy views add

very little power to understanding changes in consumption growth. Aggregate consumption growth

is largely independent of views on government economic policy once general consumer confidence is

taken into account. This aggregate finding is very much consistent with our cross-sectional analysis.

7         Conclusion

We highlight a novel empirical methodology for estimating the effect of sentiment shocks, or shocks

that are orthogonal to economic fundamentals, on household spending. Our methodology uses

cross-sectional variation across U.S. counties in government economic policy sentiment shocks to

estimate the elasticity of spending with respect to such shocks. Our specific setting is the reaction

to presidential elections in the United States in 2000 and 2008 which led to a different political

party controlling the White House.

         We show that individuals in counties predisposed against the winning party see an immediate

and large decline in views on government economic policy when the election outcome is realized.

Our central result is that government policy sentiment shocks have small and reasonably precisely

estimated effects on household spending. Despite individuals becoming quite pessimistic on gov-

ernment economic policy when their party loses the White House, it does not appear to affect

household spending in a significant manner. We interpret this null result as showing that the vari-

ation in views on government economic policy that is orthogonal to fundamentals has a limited

effect on consumption.

         One example to show the importance of these findings is the 2012/2013 fiscal cliff impasse. There

was a dramatic decline in views on government economic policy in December 2012 when the impasse

materialized. The financial press pointed to the decline driven by the fiscal cliff as particularly

worrisome.14 Our findings suggest caution in interpreting changes in views on government economic

policy as reflecting beliefs about the future of the economy that lead consumers to cut spending.

         Our results do not imply that sentiment shocks more broadly defined are unimportant for overall

economic activity. Our focus in this paper is limited to sentiments regarding government economic

policy and its impact on consumer spending. The fact that we do not find a significant effect of

government economic policy sentiment on consumer spending does not imply that other types of

consumer sentiment shocks are irrelevant for consumer spending. For example, using high frequency

spending data, Taylor (2009) documents a sharp decline in consumer spending in the last week of

September 2008 that accelerates into October. It may be possible to use a cross-sectional empirical
    14
    For example, Business Insider reported on December 31, 2012 that “the consumer confidence report shows that
the fiscal cliff is hurting the consumer’s assessment of economic conditions.” See “Hard evidence that the fiscal cliff
negotiations are hurting consumer confidence,” Walter Kurtz, 2012.

strategy to see whether this very sharp decline was caused at least in part due to sentiment shocks

regarding the financial crisis.

   Alternatively, Blanchard (1993) in his discussion of the 1990-1991 recession points out that

“the first large decline in confidence in August 1990 was associated with an important but largely

noneconomic event, the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.” A potential empirical strategy could use cross-

sectional variation across individuals or geographic units in exposure to news about this event to

see if it affects household spending. More generally, it might be the case that sentiments associated

with a boom in asset prices are associated with a rise in consumer spending. We look forward to

research on other settings, and are open to findings that show sentiment shocks matter in alternative

environments.

This figure plots coefficient estimates of the effect of the Republican vote share in 2008 in a county and the housing net worth shock
from 2006 to 2009 in a county on measures of household spending. For the housing net worth shock, the shock year is 2006. For the
Republican vote share, the shock year is 2008. The specific regression is estimated separately for the housing net worth shock and for
the Republican vote share, and takes the following form:

    Table 2: First Stage: Republican Vote Share and Government Economic Policy View Shock
This table presents the first stage regressions relating the change in views on government economic policy to the
Republican share of votes in a county. Panel A examines the 2000 presidential election and Panel B examines
the 2008 presidential election. The industry controls are employment shares in 2-digit NAICS indsutries, the
census controls are fraction white, natural log of median household income, fraction with less than a high school
education, fraction with exactly a high school education, the unemployment rate in 2000, the poverty rate in 2000,
and the fraction of the county that is urban. Government economic policy view is normalized to be mean zero
and standard deviation one. Standard errors are clustered by state, and regressions are weighted by the number
of respondents to the Michigan survey in the county.

This table examines whether people living in counties voting Republican in 2000 increasingly say it is a good time
to spend on either durables or cars. The industry controls are employment shares in 2-digit NAICS indsutries,
the census controls are fraction white, natural log of median household income, fraction with less than a high
school education, fraction with exactly a high school education, the unemployment rate in 2000, the poverty rate
in 2000, and the fraction of the county that is urban. All measures from the Michigan survey are normalized to
be mean zero and standard deviation one. Standard errors are clustered by state, and regressions are weighted by
the number of respondents to the Michigan survey in the county.

This table shows the aggregate correlation between year over year real consumption growth, the index of consumer sentiment, and views
on government economic policy. The last two rows of the correlation matrix examine the variation in the index of consumer sentiment and
views on government economic policy that are orthogonal to one another. More specifically, orthogonal government policy view represents
the residuals from a regression of government policy view on the index of consumer sentiment, and orthoginal index of consumer sentiment
represents the residuals from a regression of the index of consumer sentiment on government policy view.

A     Appendix Figures and Tables

In Figure A.1, we use individual level data from the Michigan survey to estimate how views on

government economic policy change around the 2000 and 2008 election depending on the race of

the survey respondent.

    In Tables A.1 and A.2, we use the fraction of the population who are members of Evangelical,

Latter-day Saints, or mainstream Protestant churches as an instrument for changes in government

economic policy views around elections. The church membership data were downloaded from the

Association of Religion Data Archives, www.TheARDA.com.

This specification is based on individual data, where W hitei0 is an indicator for whether the survey respondent is white. The left panel
is focused on the Bush-Gore election of 2000 (t = 0 is 2000q4) and the right panel is focused on the Obama-McCain election of 2008
(t = 0 is 2008q4). The omitted quarter in both figures is the quarter of the election. Government economic policy view is normalized to
be mean zero and standard deviation one.

Table A.1: Using Church Membership as Instrument for Change in Government Economic Policy Views
         This table presents the first stage of a specification using the fraction of the population in a county
         that are members of evangelical, Latter-day Saints, or mainline protestant churches. The industry
         controls are employment shares in 2-digit NAICS indsutries, the census controls are fraction white,
         natural log of median household income, fraction with less than a high school education, fraction
         with exactly a high school education, the unemployment rate in 2000, the poverty rate in 2000, and
         the fraction of the county that is urban. Government policy view is normalized to be mean zero
         and standard deviation one. Standard errors are clustered by state, and regressions are weighted
         by the number of respondents to the Michigan survey in the county.

This table presents the IV specification using the fraction of the population in a county that are members of evangelical, Latter-day
Saints, or mainline protestant churches as instrument for the change in views regarding government economic policy. The industry
controls are employment shares in 2-digit NAICS indsutries, the census controls are fraction white, natural log of median household
income, fraction with less than a high school education, fraction with exactly a high school education, the unemployment rate in 2000,
the poverty rate in 2000, and the fraction of the county that is urban. Government policy view is normalized to be mean zero and
standard deviation one. Standard errors are clustered by state, and regressions are weighted by the number of respondents to the
Michigan survey in the county.
