Regeneration, Labour Supply and the Welfare Costs of Taxes

                                            ABSTRACT

This paper sets out alternatives to the traditional model of labour supply used to analyse the welfare

costs of income and/or sales taxes when preferences are defined over goods and leisure and the

market wage yields the slope of the budget constraint. The innovation in our work is to assume that

some or all of non market time is used to regenerate the productivity of labour through rest and

relaxation. This model has no closed form solution, but we can work with the first order conditions

numerically for specific functional forms using non linear solution software. We generate a number

of alternative parameterizations of this model through a series of calibrations to the same synthetic

base case data set. Across the resulting parameterizations the welfare costs of taxes vary

substantially (by a factor of twenty fold in some counterfactual analyses), even though they all

involve calibration to the same base case data and labour supply elasticity. These results thus suggest

that a small and seemingly plausible departure from a standard model (even if not in closed form)

that has dominated the economic literature for many years can yield substantial change for

perspectives on policy interventions.

1.       Introduction
       This paper sets out an alternative to the standard model of labour supply in which
preferences are defined over goods and leisure and the slope of the budget constraint is
given by the wage rate. This allows us to explore how the composition of non market
time can influence both labour supply responses to tax and wage rate changes, and the
welfare cost of labour income or sales taxes. These are ideas that have seemingly been
neglected in analytical work since the days of Marshall and Fisher when physical
regeneration and degeneration of the human body entered discussion of labour markets
(see quotes above).
       In its most simple form regeneration is the use of non market time to improve the
efficiency or quality of labour (i.e. regeneration of labour productivity) rather than the use
of time as leisure to directly yield utility. In this case preferences are defined only over
goods consumption. The allocation of time to non market activities is still endogenously
determined but this reflects income rather than utility maximization (which has only one
argument; consumption). Choices between market and non market time allocation are
undistorted by taxes in this case, since either form of time allocation generates a taxable
income return (which, in turn, is used to buy consumption goods). This yields two
observationally equivalent models (traditional and regeneration models) each with
endogenously determined market time allocation but with different implications for the
distortionary costs of taxes. One dominates the literature, the other seems to be little
discussed.1
       We then develop a generalization which blends both traditional and regeneration
models into a combined model which includes both leisure in the utility function and
regeneration possibilities from the use of non-leisure time. This model does not yield
closed form solutions to either individual or household optimisation problems, but we can
work with it numerically solving the first order conditions for agent constrained utility
maximizing behaviour. Changing share parameters on leisure (from smaller to larger)

  Widely cited pieces on the welfare costs of labour income taxes using the traditional framework are
Hausman (1984) and Blundell and MaCurdy (1999). See also Blundell, Duncan and Meghir (1998), and
Ham and Reilly (2002). See, however, the paper by Biddle and Hammermesh (199)) which discusses sleep
and the allocation of time which has a formulation of labour supply decisions related to our approach. A
recent real business cycle piece by Fisher (2001) discusses cases where household capital affects market
productivity and is also related to our discussion. Neither of these pieces discusses welfare effects of taxes.

affects how of additional regeneration time influences labour efficiency and this allows
us to move between the two extreme forms (traditional/pure regeneration) of the model.
      Treating only market time as observable and regeneration time as unobservable, we
show how many parameterizations can be constructed for this generalized model each of
which is consistent with the same base case data on time allocated to market labour
supply and consumption of goods as used in traditional models of labour supply and the
same point estimate of the (uncompensated) supply elasticity of market time (labour)
with respect to the wage. Since regeneration time is not directly observable there is no
test available to discriminate between alternative parameterizations, generated in this way
on any objective basis. However, the notion that there is non market activity regeneration
seems intuitively plausible. It is a formulation of human behaviour with respect to labour
supply seemingly closer to that used by to psychologists in their studies of behavioural
response than is the conventional economics approach. It is also an approach used in
business literature on the management of human resources.
      For observationally equivalent parameterisations of this model there are different
welfare costs of the same tax when parameterizations which are calibrated to different
values of unobservable regeneration time are used in counterfactual mode. For model
parameterizations that are observationally equivalent in the sense above, we are able to
compute ranges of estimates of the welfare costs of the same tax (the ranges are 20 to 1 in
some cases).
      We also use a number of elaborations on this structure and approach to take the
analysis further. We discuss two of these in detail in the text. One is where some market
provided goods enter the regeneration process while others directly provide utility. In
this elaboration, the usual presumption for a broadly based VAT breaks down and an
added tax distortion between market provided goods and non market time enters the
analysis. Here, the optimal tax on the market provided good entering regeneration is
zero, but we can still evaluate the welfare costs of alternative configurations of tax rates
across market goods. A second elaboration is a household model where time spent by
one household member with others in the household regenerates both household
members; effectively cross regeneration between the members of a household. For both




                                             3
of these model variants, we again compute a range of welfare cost estimates for the same
tax across alternate combinations of data/elasticity admissible parameterizations.
      We conclude by briefly discussing empirical implementation of the regeneration
approach and its wider implications both for empirical work on tax distortions of labour
supply and for policy.     We note that direct observation of regeneration time (i.e.
separately from time devoted to pure leisure) appears to be difficult if not impossible at
present. Time use survey data allows for no simple division of time between leisure and
regeneration activities since all time allocation seemingly has both leisure (consumption)
and regeneration (production) elements (sleeping, for instance).
      Empirical implementation of regeneration based models for now may thus be hard
to undertake. But the findings we report are disturbing since they seem to provide a
plausible recasting of analysis of the effects of taxes on labour supply yielding wide
ranges of estimates of welfare costs and yield contrasting implications for policy from
standard analysis. Even if a model is hard to operationalize it is not clear that it should
play no role in economic policy debate. Here the model is simple, plausible, neglected
and with differing predictions to the literature dominant model. Also, simple labour
supply elasticities as conventionally estimated have a different interpretation under this
approach, seemingly also with implications for econometric studies of labour supply
behaviour we do not discuss here in detail.
      The broader theme of the paper, therefore, is that a range of observationally
equivalent (even if non operational) models are available for one of the classical issues in
the public finance literature (the effects of taxes on labour supply) for which the welfare
implications of policy interventions are sharply different. Some of these models have no
simple closed form solution and may seem unappealing to theorists if there are no general
results or properties, but they are plausible, relatively simple to use, and can be worked
with numerically. Importantly they seem to yield quite different results compared to
those generated by models conventionally used in the literature and also appear to be
unexplored. This raises the issue of why economists should adhere so strongly to simple
analytic structures with closed form solutions giving strong results when closely related
and seemingly equally (or even more) plausible models incorporating relatively small




                                              4
departures from the simple structure (even if not yielding results in closed form) seem to
change policy perceptions significantly.


2.      The Neutrality of Taxes in a Simple Regeneration Model
       The conventional labour supply model considers a single individual or household
who maximizes utility defined over consumption, (C), and leisure, (L), subject to a
budget constraint in which the wage rate, w, and the goods price, p, are given, i.e.
              max u (C , L )                                                                           (1)

              s.t. p ⋅ C = w(L − L )

where L is the labour or time endowment.
       A tax on labour supply at rate t distorts individual behaviour by changing the slope
of the budget constraint, and problem (1) becomes,
              max u (C , L )                                                                           (2)

              s.t. p ⋅ C = w(1 − t )(L − L ) + R
where R is tax revenue recycled in lump sum form to the individual paying the tax. The
tax distortion of labour supply decisions in this model has a welfare cost associated with
it.
       Now suppose that non market time is instead treated as devoted to regenerating the
efficiency of labour, such that with more rest labour becomes more efficient2. While a
decision by the individual or household on how much time to allocate to market labour
supply must still be made, leisure will no longer enter the utility function if this is the
only permissible use of non market time (our simplest regeneration case).
       In this case, we can use the alternative simple household optimisation problem
              max u (C )                                                                               (3)

              s.t. p ⋅ C = w(LR )(L − LR )
to determine labour supply decisions, where w(LR ) reflects the feature that the wage rate
of the individual is now an increasing function of time devoted to regeneration, LR. This


2
 An alternative formulation not explored here would be where labour productivity progressively
degenerates the more time is spent each day in the work force. Fisher’s formulation of degeneration cited
above involved physical degeneration from particular non market activities (consumption of alcohol).


                                                    5
can be interpreted as implying that time spent on regeneration today increase the number
of efficiency units of labour an individual can supply each hour the next day3.
       This formulation implies income maximizing behaviour since only goods appear in
the utility function. From (3) the first order condition is
              w(LR ) = w′(LR )(L − LR )                                                           (4)
or the wage obtained by supplying labour to the market equals the marginal return to
regeneration time in the form of the higher wage times labour supply. In this event, a tax
on labour supply applied to the budget constraint in (3) is neutral and has no impact since
the individual simply income maximizes and both forms of time allocation (market and
non-market labour supply) imply a taxable return. Thus, rest and relaxation improve
labour efficiency and after some point diminishing returns to regeneration occur. In such
a model, the amount of time devoted to market labour supply will still be endogenously
determined, but in the simple case above seemingly distortionary labour income taxes are
non distorting.
       While identifying time devoted to regeneration is difficult in practice since time use
survey data and other sources only report time devoted to particular activities (sleeping,
eating, personal care, etc.) which may be interpreted as part leisure-part regeneration, the
point remains that how we interpret time spent on non market activity affects model
implications for policy. The alternative approach suggested here appears to have been
little discussed in contemporary literature whether in the simple form of out early
discussion or in the more complex forms that follows.




3
  This idea is discussed at some length in Marshall’s Principles (1895) (see p.694, Chapter XIII, 8th
Edition), and is also implicit in Irving Fisher’s well known calculation of the large benefits to the US
economy from prohibition (Fisher (1926)). Since these writings by these two eminent economists, the idea
that non market time regenerates labour through rest and relaxation seems to have disappeared from the
literature. One could argue that it is implicit in human capital literature, where time invested raises
productivity, and these formulations are clearly closely related, although it should be noted that Marshall
also discusses human capital (see P. 561, where the heading is “investment of capital by parents in
children”) and treats this discussion as entirely distinct from regeneration as do we. Here, there is no
intertemporal structure, and time input every day is needed to maintain or enhance labour productivity. The
more recent literature on efficiency wages also seems relevant to this discussion (see Akerloff and Yellen
(1986)), but typically in this literature there is only an exogenous distribution of efficiencies across
workers, different to the formulation employed here of one individual with endogenously determined
labour productivity.

3.     A Generalized Model of Labour Supply and Taxes
      The two models set out in section 2 can be combined to yield a generalized (or
combined) model of labour supply and regeneration in which taxes still have distorting
effects but these effects vary with leisure parameters in preferences and the strength of
regeneration effects. For this generalized model we can construct parameterizations such
that each is consistent with the same base case data and target (literature based point
estimates of) labour supply elasticities. These parameterizations all meet a requirement of
observational equivalence in the sense that they are each the result of calibration to the
same base case data set and each have the same model labour supply elasticity as a point
estimate around the base case model solution. But each parameterization yields different
welfare cost estimates for the same labour income or sales tax rate (and in some cases
sharply) even though in the absence of direct estimates of labour efficiency regeneration
parameters there seems to be no clear procedure to distinguish between these
specifications on empirical grounds.
      This generalized model cannot be solved in closed form and so we use particular
functional forms for preferences and the regeneration function and work with it
numerically using GAMS4 solution software. We assume preferences over goods and
                                                                           (        )
leisure are CES and the regeneration function w(LR ) can be written as w + βLαR , where

β and α are parameters. (w + βLαR ) is the hourly wage rate received by the individual and
consists of two components; a base case wage rate w if labour quantity is not
regenerated, and a regeneration component βLαR which is increasing in LR but at a
decreasing rate α (α < 1) . β is a units term denominated in dollars per unit time. We

use this form for the regeneration function as convenient and easy to work with
numerically in the absence of any prior literature that we are aware of.
      In this case, the optimizing problem for the household can be written, , as

                 [                        ]

                           R               R

      Given exogenous parameters γ, ρ, α, and β, this system of four equations can be
solved numerically for the four unknowns C, L, LR, and λ. The hourly wage rate the
                       (           )
individual faces, w + βLαR , is endogenously determined. Even though the individual is a
price taker in market transactions, the endogeneity of the individual specific hourly wage
reflects the endogeneity of LR. Unlike in the simple regeneration model set out above, if
we introduce a tax on labour income at rate t into this model, this tax will be distorting
since leisure enters the preferences of the individual (or household).
      The consumption possibilities (for budget) set for this model is no longer linear as
implied by the budget constraint for the simple labour supply model. As drawn in Figure
1 this set has a shape for which (as leisure falls) there is a segment of the budget set
convex to the origin and then concave. This occurs since as more time is progressively
devoted to regeneration, the resulting increase in the wage rate for the individual applies
to a smaller amount of market time. As drawn, optimal behaviour involves the tangency
point A. As ρ changes the curvature of the budget set changes, and beyond some critical
value of ρ the budget set can become more steeply sloped than preferences in its portion
which is convex to the origin resulting in problems in computation of optimal solutions.
These problems are discussed below.
      The equation system (7) does not yield a closed form solution, and hence wage
elasticities of labour supply cannot be derived analytically.                           We can, however,
parametrically vary w and/or β (and hence the market wage), and numerically determine

                                                                 8

        R

We use this method to determine a point estimate this elasticity for this model, i.e. the
response in market labour supply with respect to the hourly wage rate. We compute this
in the neighbourhood of the model solution implied by this equation system, even though
the wage rate is endogenously determined and not exogenous in the elasticity calculation
and the elasticity is not constant. We use this to relate the model’s behaviour to existing
literature on labour supply.

      Relative to the simple optimizing structures used in existing labour supply
literature, this equation system will tend to generate lower values of labour supply
elasticities for given values of ρ, because wage increases generate a positive response in
time devoted to regeneration as well as increased market labour supply as leisure
consumption falls. Current labour supply elasticity estimates only measure the market
time response not the regeneration response, which appear in available data as a higher
hourly wage rate. The interpretation of existing estimates of labour supply elasticities
thus needs to be qualified if one accepts that regeneration activities do in fact occur.




                                              9
     The equation system (7) can also be used to calculate the welfare costs of a labour
income or sales tax using numerical simulation methods. We calibrate to a base case
model solution and analyse a counterfactual solution under a tax change as in the applied
equilibrium modelling literature (see Shoven and Whalley (1992)), except that for now
we do not use an empirically based model admissible base case data set for an actual
economy. We do this both because time spent on regeneration is unobservable, and also
because our paper is expository rather than seeking to provide actual estimates of welfare
costs of taxes for real economies. We construct a synthetic base case data set (in model
admissible form) which we argue has loose empirical plausibility given the non
observability of regeneration time.
                                                            (         )
     Specifically, we take w , C, p, the market wage rate w + βLαR and labour supply

(L − L − L ) as observables and treat them as reflecting a base case optimisation solution
          R

in the presence of a given labour income tax rate we then set values for ρ and LR to
identify the equation system used in calibration.      We assume LR, time devoted to
regeneration, to be unobservable and set LR at some arbitrary specified value. This allows
us to calibrate the equation system (7) to the resulting synthetic base case data set and
determine values for the model parameters γ, α, β, and λ. Since ρ is also unobservable it
can be iteratively adjusted to be consistent with values adopted for estimates of labour
supply elasticities (from a literature survey). The resulting calibrated model parameter
values determine a point estimate for the wage elasticity of labour supply in the
neighbourhood of the base case model solution and we can adjust our choice of ρ so as to
yield our target value for the labour supply elasticity.        We can then compute a
counterfactual model solution in the absence of the tax using a model parameterization
generated in this way.
     Table 1 presents an example of both a calibrated and counterfactual solution for this
model for both tax and no tax cases. Here we have chosen (somewhat arbitrarily) the
values of base case observables to reflect a 40 hour work week, 70 hours as the weekly
time endowment, goods prices of 1, w of 1.3, and a market hourly wage of 2 for the
individual in the presence of a 10% labour income tax with revenues recycled to the
consumer in lump sum form. We calibrate the generalized model set out above to this

data to determine the model parameter values γ, α, and β and then compute the welfare
costs of a 10% labour income tax by comparing the base case data to a counterfactual
model solution for a zero tax rate. In this case, ρ has been chosen such that the point
estimate of the labour supply elasticity implied by the calibrated model parameters is 0.3.
This is in the range of second generation labour supply elasticity parameter values
suggested by Killingworth (1984) and is also consistent with more recent literature
estimates discussed in Blundell and MaCurdy (1999) and Ham and Reilly (2002). The
money metric measure of the welfare cost of a 10% income tax for this model
specification is 0.116% of market labour income.

4.     Computing a Range of Welfare Cost Estimates for the Same Tax from
       Observationally Equivalent Model Parameterizations
      Because both ρ and LR are prespecified in the calibration procedures set out in
Section 3 and LR is unobservable, the generalized model set out in the previous section
can be calibrated so as to yield a range of observationally equivalent model
parameterisations. We limit ourselves to those parameterizations that are observationally
equivalent in the sense that they each reproduce the same base case data as a model
solution in the presence of the same tax, and also each imply the same point estimate of
the labour supply elasticity around the same base case model solution. This allows us to
generate a range of estimates of the welfare cost of a given labour income or sales tax by
iteratively generating pairs of values for ρ and LR under observational equivalence. This
means that we calibrate the model to the same base case data for any (ρ , LR ) pair such
that both the base case model solution and the implied point estimate of the labour supply
elasticity are unchanged.
      For each of these (ρ , LR ) pairs and the associated model parameterizations, we can
remove the 10% labour income tax and compute the welfare cost of the tax in terms of
the Hicksian equivalent variation as a % of base case labour income. These welfare cost
estimates will differ as we change parameterisations, even though they all remain
consistent with the same base case solution and the same point estimate of the labour
supply elasticity at this model solution.         For these observationally equivalent
parameterizations estimates of the welfare cost of the same tax on labour supply can
differ and potentially sharply.
      To explore how large these differences in cost estimates can be we take different
values for LR and recalibrate the model, iteratively adjusting ρ in each case so as to
preserve the point estimate of the labour supply elasticity at its initial value at the base
case solution.   This yields us a range of alternative model parameterizations, each
generated by different ρ and LR combinations and each observationally equivalent in the
sense of being consistent with the same base case data and elasticity estimates. We then
compute the welfare costs of a 10% labour income tax using each of these
parameterisations, yielding ranges of welfare cost estimates for a series of observationally
equivalent model parameterisations which we report below.


                                            12
      We begin by assuming that we have a target labour supply elasticity of 0.3 (again
set somewhat arbitrarily). We again use a base case value of the market wage of 2, the
same base case values for C, (L − L − LR ) and L as in Table 1, and assume an initial tax
on labour income of 10%. We then vary both ρ and LR, and for each pair maintain
observational equivalence in the sense set out above, and compute the welfare gain from
removing the 10% tax for each (ρ , LR ) pair. We report the Hicksian Equivalent
Variation as a % of base case labour income in Table 2, both for this case and alternatives
where w changes. This yields a range of LR and ρ values for a given w value for which
we can compute welfare cost estimates for the same tax. In computing these ranges,
when we increase ρ beyond some critical value the problems discussed above with regard
to the convexity of the budget set arise and we stop computation at this point.

      Table 2 reports ranges of welfare cost estimates for the same 10% labour income
tax for 6 cases, generated as set out above, and which only differ in the value used for w .
These cases imply ranges of welfare cost estimates which vary by a factor of up to 5 (case
1). We view these results as suggestive of difficulties in both interpreting existing
estimates of welfare costs of labour income taxes and labour supply elasticities, since
what is usually accepted in most models as leisure might equally well be time devoted to
regeneration. Estimates of both welfare costs or taxes and labour supply elasticities
obtained from conventional models should thus seemingly be viewed as subject to some
unknown variation due to regeneration effects. These ranges behave differently across LR
as w changes across cases. In some cases welfare costs behave monotonically in LR (e.g.
rising in case 4, 5 and 6), in behaving non monotonically in others (cases 1, 2 and 3).
      For the case where w = 1 (column 3 of Table 2) we have used a grid over LR and
again computed welfare costs to yield a welfare cost function over the LR value used in
calibration. This is set out in Figure 2 which shows the behaviour of the welfare cost of
the 10% labour income tax as LR varies in case 3 (where w is set equal to one). As LR
approaches zero we asymptotically approach a conventional labour supply model. As
both LR approaches 30 (no leisure consumption) and ρ approaches zero we move to a
model in which there is no substitution in preferences between leisure and goods case 1
LR = 27 is the maximum computable LR value in this case. Results from these extreme
cases are also set out in Table 3, and all welfare cost estimates reported in Table 2 lie
between these ranges. These results thus suggest that welfare cost estimates of taxes in a
generalized model of labour supply that includes regeneration effects should be thought
of as bounded from above by estimates from traditional no regeneration models and from
below by zero (as implied by a pure regeneration model).
      In Figure 2 the welfare cost of the tax first increases then falls as the LR value used
in calibration increases.    This occurs because the generalized regeneration model
incorporates two channels through which tax distortions of leisure and consumption
operate rather than one as in the traditional simple model. These are directly of labour
leisure decisions through changed leisure consumption, and indirectly through changed
regeneration activity. Depending on the parameters in the regeneration generated by
calibration, tax distortions of the latter can be either more or less costly per dollar of


                                             14
revenue raised, and increasing the LR value used in calibration can increase or decrease
the distortionary costs of taxes in some cases, as Figure 2 shows.

5.     Results from Some Elaborations on the Generalized Leisure-Regeneration
       Model
      We can also work numerically with a number of elaborations on the generalized
leisure-regeneration model presented in the last section and for these cases similarly
determine ranges of welfare cost estimates for the same tax from observationally
equivalent model parameterizations.            These cases serve to further highlight the
ambiguities in predictions of the welfare effects of taxes using information only on base
case allocations of time to market and non-market activities in a conventional labour-
leisure model and estimates of labour supply elasticities. More generally, these results
are suggestive of the general characterization that for any given issue a hierarchy of
models of increasing complexity exists, each plausible and each incorporating
unobservable characteristics and each yielding differing implications as to their outcome.
While this may perhaps not be surprising, what this implies as to the interpretation of
existing empirical estimates of welfare costs of taxes and labour supply elasticities seems
both disturbing and little appreciated in existing literature.


Multiple Commodities
      The first such elaboration we consider involves the additional specification of a
market supplied commodity as an input into regeneration. This commodity is assumed to
be distinct from the consumption good which along with leisure once again directly
yields utility. Thus, if there are two goods C, R; only one of the goods, C, directly
provides utility and the other, R, combines with LR to yield regeneration services. In this
case, the optimal tax structure across the two goods will have a zero tax rate on R, since
on efficiency grounds the tax system should not distort between direct labour supply and
regeneration activity as a mechanism for generating income. A broadly based sales or
value added tax will thus no longer be optimal in this case.
      Here, if regeneration involves a similar functional form with R and LR as Cobb
Douglas inputs to regeneration, the individual optimisation in (7) becomes

      In contrast to the model set out in section 4 above, this now implies a system of five
equations in five unknowns, C, R, L, LR, and λ. The exogenous parameters are now γ, ρ,
α1, α2, and β. We can again calibrate this model in the presence of a labour income tax
and then eliminate the labour income tax and compute the welfare cost of the tax. This
tax will now be distorting both since leisure is in household preferences and two inputs,
one market provided and the other non market provided, enter regeneration activities as
inputs. An added tax distortion thus enters relative to the model used in the earlier
section.
      We have executed similar experiments to those which we report on in section 4
above with this model. We calibrate to a similar base case data set and labour supply
elasticity estimate for assumed values of ρ, LR and R. We can once again change the
values of LR or R and iteratively change values of ρ so as to preserve a particular value of
the point estimate of the labour supply elasticity in the neighbourhood of the base case.
      Table 4 reports estimates of ranges of welfare costs for the same 10% labour
income tax using this elaborated version of the leisure-regeneration model. Here we can
explore more combinations of variations in observationally equivalent parameterisations
than in the case of the earlier model. We report two. In one, we vary w and R given
values for LR and C. These results suggest considerably larger ranges of welfare cost
estimates because of the added input distortion and its effects in distorting optimizing

exceed 20:1.

      The optimal commodity tax structure for this version of the generalized model
involves a zero tax rate on R5, but we can still use this model to compute the welfare costs
of non uniform tax structures. We consider 3 cases involving different tax rates for R and
C, each of which raises the same revenue in the base case. We report a range of welfare
cost estimates for these 3 tax rate configurations, using similar ranges of adjustment in LR
to those set out in Table 4 in each case. Results from these are reported in Table 5. The
varying ranges of estimates of welfare costs of taxes adds further ambiguity to any policy
prescriptions based on these structures.

Household Behaviour
        A second elaboration on the generalized leisure-regeneration model set out above
considers regeneration within the household such that there are also cross effects between
household members. In this case, the time devoted to regeneration by each household
member also regenerates the labour (in efficiency terms) of the other household members.
In this case, members of the household benefit positively from each other’s company
(negative effects could also be considered).
        Thus, if regeneration activity for each household member involves a similar
functional form to that used for LR in (7) and the household optimisation problem
involves a CES utility function defined over each individual’s consumption of goods and
leisure, optimisation implies

                     [                                                  ]

                         p c C1 + p c C 2 = w1 (L − L1 − LR1 ) + w2 (L − L2 − LR 2 )
              s.t.                  (
                         w1 = w + β 1 LαR11 LαR22           )
                         w2       = (w + β   2

where the parameters α2, and α4 reflect cross regeneration effects, and LR1 and LR2 are
time devoted to regeneration activities by household members 1 and 2.

  This is because, as discussed above, all returns to regeneration activity are fully taxed as additional labour
income.

                               w2        = (w + β                    2    LαR32 LαR41  )
        This yields a system of seven equations in seven unknowns, C1, C2, L1, L2, LR1, LR2,
and λ. This system has 11 parameters γ1, γ2, γ3, γ 4 , ρ1, α1, α2, α3, α4 and β1, β2 (10 if we
                                         4
normalize such that                  ∑γ
                                     i =1
                                                      i    = 1 ). For this model to be identified and useable in calibration

mode identifying restrictions must be used. For simplicity, we have again assumed a
value for ρ and then arbitrarily assumed that α’s and β’s are related in ratio form i.e. we
assume a ratio of α2/α4, α1/α3 and β1/β2. These identifying restrictions can be set as
desired so as to yield stronger or weaker cross regeneration effects, but affect the ranges
of welfare cost estimates we can generate.
        This model form is more complex to work with numerically than the single agent
formulations set out above since two elasticities are involved with cross effects. Thus
changes in ρ affect the labour supply elasticity of the second household member and vice




                                                                                                20
versa, and hence iterations on ρ must be made with corresponding variations in LR for
both household members.
     Results using this model variant are presented in Table 6 using a variant with data
similar to above but now for a two member household.6 In this case calibration to two
separate labour supply elasticities, one for each household member, is involved (we
assume these are both 0.3). These results show ranges of welfare cost estimates for a
10% labour income tax on both household members. These ranges are smaller than for
Table 2 since cross effects between household members now enter.

6.     Empirical Implementation of Regeneration Models
      While the numerical results we report above are only suggestive rather then
definitive, they are in our view disturbing. We have been able to use seemingly plausible
modifications and extensions to the traditional model of labour supply widely used to
estimate labour supply elasticities and compute a range of welfare cost estimates for the
same tax from observationally equivalent model specifications. While not yielding a
closed form solution, the model we work with can nonetheless be used numerically and
yields differing results from conventional models. In its more general form, we are able
to show how there can be a wide range of estimates of the welfare costs of the same tax
for observationally equivalent specifications of the same model, in which calibration
replicates both base case data and elasticity responses.
      The response from an empirically trained economist may be that there must surely
be some way of discriminating among these estimates and thus narrow the range. There
must surely be an empirical test which can be used for deciding which estimate to accept.
To us, the disturbing feature of our analysis seems to be that, while plausible,
regeneration based labour supply models seem also to be non-operational on empirical
grounds. The notion that a certain amount of non-labour time goes to regeneration rather
than pure leisure seems appealing, but no data seems to exist which allows regeneration
and leisure attributes of time use to be distinguished. Sleep, for instance, seemingly has
both attributes. Eating food similarly likely has both. Time use survey data as currently
collected yields no direct information as to how time is employed in regeneration, nor its
effects on households and market productivity. Short of direct estimation of the labour
productivity effects of time devoted to various regeneration type activities there seems to
be no data that can be directly used to parameterise the model.
      Snippets of data seemingly exist in the efficiency wage literature for developing
countries, where daily caloric intake is related to labour productivity at performing
various tasks.   But for developed countries such information is, to our knowledge,
unavailable and so for now we conclude that the regeneration labour supply model should
be viewed as important but effectively non-operational.
      Should a non operational model of labour supply yielding different implications for
the welfare costs of taxes be rejected as lacking any empirical basis, and work in the area



                                             22
only concentrate on conventional implementable models? Our contention is that there is
no basis for this conclusion. The model we present seems plausible and interesting. It
generalizes the existing literature dominant model. The reaction we have received to our
work from other economists is that this model is both plausible and interesting. In
implicit form it is in both Marshall and Fisher. The differences in results we report are
striking. Our conclusion, therefore, is that conventional estimates of welfare costs must
be evaluated as reflecting a subjective judgement call that other plausible structures
which could potentially yield sharply differing results are rejected. The basis for such
rejection seems to us unclear and unproven relative to the scientific standards to which
much of modern economics aspires.


7.     Concluding Remarks
      In this paper, we present a model of labour supply behaviour in which the
allocation of time to non market activity reflects the impact of time on the regeneration of
labour productivity. This can be in place of time which enters preferences as leisure or
coexist with leisure time. In a simple model in which all non market time goes to
regeneration because households now income maximize a labour income tax has no
impact on either welfare or labour supply even though labour supply is endogenously
determined. This is in contrast to the conventional model of labour supply in which
utility is defined over goods and leisure and no regeneration occurs.
      Between these two extremes is a generalization of both conventional leisure based
and regeneration models which nests both models time is devoted both to leisure and to
regeneration activity. This model has no closed form solution, but we can work with the
resulting analytical structure numerically. To do this we assume that time separately
allocated to leisure and regeneration are unobservable and by varying weights on leisure
and elasticities in CES preferences we generate a series of model parameterizations
which are observationally equivalent in the sense that they all yield the same optimizing
behaviour and all have the same implied point estimate for the labour supply elasticity
around this model solution. Importantly, however, in combination they generate a range
of welfare cost estimates for a given tax on labour income.




                                            23
      We also consider several generalizations of the joint leisure/regeneration model the
first of which incorporates separate market provided consumption goods and goods which
only enter regeneration as inputs. We also incorporate regeneration activities by multiple
members of a household into a household based model.             Similar exercises can be
performed and further ranges of welfare costs computed for those model variants. The
same themes of results remain but quantitative dimensions of ranges change.
      We conclude by briefly discussing the empirical operationality of regeneration
based models. We suggest they are analytically appealing, but little or no data exists in
which regeneration and leisure are separated (sleep, for instance, involves both). We also
highlight the dilemma that such models, while seemingly non operational, are hard to
reject since they generalize conventional models while giving different numerical
predictions of outcomes under tax or market wage changes ( w ).
      We conclude by posing the wider dilemmas this work raises for modern economic
analysis.     Should non operational but appealing generalizations of simple standard
models be used to guide policy debates when their model predictions can differ sharply
from those of simple models. What form of data should now be collected to guide model
parameterizations of models in this light?         How can subjectivity in model use in
economics be dealt with? None of these questions have easy answers in our view, and
nor does the question what is the welfare cost of a labour income (or sales) tax.
