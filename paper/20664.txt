Intrinsic Motivation in Public Service: Theory and Evidence from State Supreme Courts

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of the intrinsic preferences of state appellate
court judges. We construct a panel data set using published decisions from state supreme court cases
merged with institutional and biographical information on all (1,636) state supreme court judges for
the 50 states of the United States from 1947 to 1994. We estimate the effects of changes in judge employment
conditions on a number of measures of judicial performance. The results are consistent with the hypothesis
that judges are intrinsically motivated to provide high-quality decisions, and that at the margin they
prefer quality over quantity. When judges face less time pressure, they write more well-researched
opinions that are cited more often by later judges. When judges are up for election then performance
falls, suggesting that election politics take time away from judging work – rather than providing an
incentive for good performance. These effects are strongest when judges have more discretion to select
their case portfolio, consistent with psychological theories that posit a negative effect of contingency
on motivation (e.g. Deci, 1971).

1       Introduction
This paper provides a theoretical and empirical study of the intrinsic motives of state supreme
court judges. We have constructed a panel data set that matches institutional and judge
biographical information with published decisions for all state high courts in the United
States from 1947 until 1994. This data is matched with information on institutional changes
in judicial employment conditions, which either increased or decreased the constraints faced
by judges when doing their work. The within-judge estimates of the behavioral responses
to these changes are consistent with the hypothesis that judges are intrinsically motivated
to choose higher-quality opinions when given more time, and that they intrinsically prefer
quality over quantity at the margin.
    Epstein et al. (2013) observe that judges are paid on fixed salaries to reduce pecuniary
motivation that may bias their decision-making. This naturally leads to the question of the
impact that such low-powered incentives have on judicial performance, and the extent to
which judges are motivated to provide high-quality decisions. Second, there is the contro-
versial issue of how judges should be retained and in particular whether they should take
an active part in fund-raising for re-election (see Spottswood, 2007). Using a within-judge
design that measures the dynamic effect of electoral demands, we find that judges reduce
effort in the year they are up for electoral review, suggesting that they are spending time
campaigning rather than judging.
    The presence of intrinsic motivation is consistent with White’s (1959) theory of profes-
sionalism. According to White, professionals are individuals who become personally invested
in their skills and are motivated by the challenge of doing a job well. If judges have a pref-
erence for working on influential cases, then constraining their choices can be demotivating
and lead to lower performance. As shown in Section 3, this prediction follows from a sim-
ple model of a utility-maximizing judge who allocates time across cases, outside activities,
and leisure. It is also consistent with work on contingency and motivation developed in
the psychology literature (Deci, 1971), and with recent work in economics on how monetary
incentives can crowd out intrinsic incentives (Frey and Oberholzer-Gee, 1997; Gneezy and
Rustichini, 2000).1
    The job of an appellate court judge is to review trial cases and ensure that the law
    1
    The career concerns literature (e.g. Dewatripont et al. 1999b, Francois 2000, and Prendergast 2007) has
shown that the conclusions of the simple intrinsic motivation model developed here can also be derived with
standard preferences in a more complex dynamic setting. However, concerns about future promotion have
limited importance in our setting, where promotion to a higher court (the U.S. Supreme Court) is extremely
rare, and almost all judges keep their job until retirement unless they lose election.


                                                    2
is properly applied. For empirical purposes this is an attractive setting because the basic
functions of the job have not changed much in the last 200 years. Litigants appeal cases
where they feel there has been an error. The judges choose which cases to hear and then
write decisions regarding the merits of each case. From these written decisions one can build
a number of performance measures, such as the number of decisions written in a year, the
length of a decision, and how often a decision is cited by later judges.2 Section 7 reports
estimates of the effect of changes in employment conditions on these performance measures
using judge fixed effects.
    Much of the previous empirical work on appellate judging has focused on federal judges.
In terms of the work requirements, state appellate judging and federal appellate judging are
very similar, the main difference being that state judges mostly interpret state law rather
than federal law. Our results therefore have relatively strong external validity for predicting
the effects of institutional reforms on federal judges. The advantage of studying state judges
consists in the substantial variation across states and over time in the rules for appointing,
compensating, and retaining judges. This allows for a more credible identification of the
effect that employment conditions have on performance than is possible with federal judges.
    To organize the data and interpret the results, Section 3 extends the legal-realist model
in Epstein et al. (2013) to allow for intrinsic rewards from high-quality decision-making.3 In
the model, judges prefer working on important cases that can influence the law in the future.
This additional ingredient is sufficient to reproduce Deci’s (1971) result in the judicial setting
– namely, giving a judge more discretion over the cases they hear increases effort in cases
they consider important, while reducing effort in less important cases. Besides providing
micro foundations for how extrinsic incentives might crowd out intrinsic motivation, the
model leads the empirical inquiry toward institutional reforms that give judges more time
to write decisions and more discretion over their work environment.
    The first change examined is the introduction of intermediate appellate courts (IAC’s).
This has the effect of reducing the case load of sitting supreme court judges. We measure
the impact of the rule change by comparing the performance of individual judges before
and after the introduction of an IAC. These judges could respond in various ways to the
reduced workload, including working less (choosing more leisure) or working more intensely
on the cases still on the docket. The results show that judges respond to the introduction of
an IAC by focusing on the more interesting cases that are cited more often by later judges.

    See Choi et al. (2008) for a discussion of how to measure judicial performance.

    Recent work by economists in a legal-realist tradition includes Glaeser et al. (2001), Gennaioli and
Shleifer (2007), and Baker and Mezzetti (2012).


                                                   3
With more time from the reduced caseload, the judges write longer and more well-researched
opinions, suggesting an intrinsic motivation for their work. Moreover, this effect is strongest
when judges have more discretion over what cases to select for review.
    Next is the question of term length – the number of years a judge serves in between
elections. An increase in term length reduces time and incentive pressures arising from the
retention process. If judicial elections incentivize good performance, then increasing term
lengths should reduce performance on average because elections play a weaker role in the
judge’s decision-making. If elections take time, for example due to electoral campaigning,
then increasing term lengths (reducing electoral incentives) may improve performance due to
the operation of intrinsic motivation. The results support the latter idea: judges respond to
a term length increase with higher-quality judgments and no decline in output as measured
by the number of cases or total number of words written.
    Another implication of the time allocation model is that if judges are engaged in outside
activities that provide income, then increasing income from judging should reduce time
pressure and thus be associated with more and/or higher-quality output. In the data, wage
increases have a positive effect on performance, but only in the states where judges have
full discretion over selecting cases for review. In states with less discretion over their case
portfolio, there is no effect of wages on performance. This suggests the importance of control
over the work environment in the operation of intrinsic incentives.
    Finally we measure the effect of the election process by comparing the performance of a
judge in the year they are up for re-election to other years of their tenure. There are two
types of judicial elections. In contested systems, judges face challengers and therefore face a
real chance of being removed from office. Under uncontested elections, only the worst judges
are removed by vote and electoral demands are much weaker. In contested systems, there is
a decrease in both the number of decisions and the quality of those decisions during election
years, while in uncontested elections there is no effect.
    In summary, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that judges have an intrinsic
motivation to write high quality opinions that interacts with extrinsic incentives to determine
the allocation of time across judging and other activities. The results are also consistent with
the contention that judicial elections interfere with good judging, rather than reward it.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses the relevant
literature. Section 3 introduces a model of judicial behavior, while the institutional context
is discussed in Section 4. Section 5 discusses the data. The empirical strategy is outlined
in Section 6 and the results are reported in Section 7. Section 8 provides a concluding

discussion.


2       Literature Background
This paper contributes to two distinct literatures. The first is the literature on public sector
employment, where the concern is that use of low-powered incentives may result in less
efficient provision of government services (see Francois and Vlassopoulos, 2008). The second
is the large literature on judicial behavior, much of it in political science, that is concerned
with understanding how judges make decisions.4 These are discussed in turn.


2.1     Public Sector Incentives
A generic feature of compensation contracts for individuals who are being asked to provide
expert opinion is that compensation is insensitive to the opinion provided. The cost for these
individuals of changing their recommendation is low, so even small rewards for a particular
position can lead to a large distortion in decision-making.5 In 1991 the National Academies
commissioned a report on how to improve compensation policy in government (Milkovich
and Wigdor, 1991), concluding that the distortion costs of performance pay outweighed any
benefits from increased performance. This report contributed to a large literature, beginning
with Kerr (1975), on the dysfunctional behavior that incentive pay can create.
   The challenge for economics is to understand performance in professions where incentive
pay is weak. Wilensky (1964) explains this as a consequence of “professionalism” where
norms of behavior evolve that create intrinsic incentives – individuals work hard to provide
performance that is evaluated by their peers as high quality. Kreps (1997) introduced this
idea into economics, leading to a number of interesting theoretical developments, including
Dewatripont et al. (1999a,b), Besley and Ghatak (2005), and Benabou and Tirole (2002,
2003, 2006). In Dewatripont et al. (1999a,b), the effort incentive stems from career concerns
– being rewarded with a better job in future periods. In Benabou and Tirole (2003), extrinsic
incentives crowd out intrinsic motivations because they signal that the principal does not
trust the agent.

of the literature.

      This result is so well known in incentive theory that it is not typically presented as a result. Variants of
the result can be traced to D’Aspremont and Gerard-Varet (1979).



                                                        5
and Dur (2008) apply these ideas to incentives for public officials. These papers are concerned
with how to design public employment contracts under a number of assumptions about the
self-motivation of agents. The corresponding empirical inquiry is to measure the extent to
which intrinsic incentives lead public servants to modify their behavior as a function of the
environment.
    Beginning with Deci (1971), a substantial body of work has used experiments with college
students to tease out the effect of intrinsic incentives. Economists have extended this work
both in the lab (Gneezy and Rustichini, 2000) and in surveys (Lacetera and Macis, 2010).
These papers show that explicit performance pay can crowd out intrinsic motivation. Gneezy
et al. (2011) provide a review of this growing literature.
    Dal Bo et al. (2013) conduct a field experiment in which they randomize salaries for
public sector job offers in Mexico. Higher compensation is associated with increased quality
of the applicant pool and better self-motivation among the hired workers. Besley and Coate
(2003) find that appointed regulators are more sensitive to the issues that policy makers care
about, while elected regulators are more pro consumer. These papers illustrate the effect of
selection on intrinsic incentives, a central issue in the political science literature on judging
(Knight and Epstein, 1996).
    This paper is concerned with the effects of changes in the environment on acting officials,
rather than on the effects of selection. Examples of this approach in looking at public
sector employees include Mas (2006); he studies the effect of arbitration decisions on police
performance and finds that favorable outcomes lead to better police performance. Dal Bó
and Rossi (2011) find that longer term limits lead to higher effort by Argentine legislators,
while Banerjee et al. (2014) find that reforms that reduced managerial autonomy in India
police stations reduced police effectiveness.


2.2    Judicial Behavior
One strand of the large literature on judges asks how compensation affects the ability of
judges selected. Klerman and Mahoney (2005) find that in eighteenth-century England,
the passage of statutes giving judges higher salaries was associated with abnormally high
returns on stock equity. Baker (2008) instruments for differences in federal judge salaries
by comparing them to law-partner salaries in the judge’s home state. He finds that these
salary differences are not associated with judicial effort, as measured by tendency to dissent
in controversial cases and time between case filing and case disposition. Choi et al. (2009)
use a cross-section of state supreme court judges to measure the effect of salaries on the

                                               6
quality of judges selected, and they find only mixed evidence on whether judges with higher
salaries perform better, as measured by the number of opinions written and number of case
citations.
    A second literature explores the effect of election politics on judge decision-making.
Tabarrok and Helland (1999) find that electoral incentives increase tort awards, while Gor-
don and Huber (2007) find that they lead to harsher criminal sentences. Shepherd (2009a,b)
uses a cross-section of state supreme court decisions to show that judicial voting reflects
the political preferences of the authority responsible for reappointment (the governor or the
state legislature), and that judges favor litigants affiliated with that authority. In a separate
cross-section of state supreme court decisions, Choi et al. (2010) find that elected judges
write more opinions while appointed judges write more heavily cited opinions.
    Lim (2013) compares the behavior of elected versus appointed state court trial judges
and finds that as a group appointed judges are more homogeneous and tend to make less
harsh sentencing decisions. Iaryczower et al. (2013) extend this work to allow for common
values and dispersed information among judges, coming to similar conclusions.
    Section 3’s model of judicial behavior follows the legal-realist approach pioneered by
Landes and Posner (1980) and supposes that judges allocate time and effort consistent with
well-defined preferences. Recent work by economists in a legal-realist tradition includes
Glaeser et al. (2001), Gennaioli and Shleifer (2007), and Baker and Mezzetti (2012). Epstein
et al. (2013) introduce a rational-choice model of judging that explicitly allows for judges
to enjoy allocating time to their work. The empirical difficulty is that this intrinsic work
satisfaction cannot directly be observed. Our contribution is to formalize how intrinsic
motivation would influence the behavioral responses to observed variation in employment
conditions.
    Epstein et al. (2013) use their model to motivate an empirical study of federal appellate
courts. The focus here is on state appellate courts, where there is greater variety of treat-
ments across states and across time. Subject to the caveats in Bertrand et al. (2004), one
can view the U.S. states as a collection of “natural experiments,” where a quasi-experimental
approach can be taken to estimate the causal effects of changes in employment conditions
on the behavior of individual judges (see Angrist and Pischke, 2009).




                                               7
3       Judicial Preferences
This section extends the model of Epstein et al. (2013, pp. 25-50) to allow for an interac-
tion between shocks to the environment and how judges allocate their time over cases and
outside activities. This model provides a framework for interpreting the behavioral effects
of exogenous shocks to the judicial employment contract.
    Epstein et al.’s (2013) model begins with the observation that the judge’s problem, like
most incentive problems, is to allocate time across activities. In this case, those activities
are leisure, judging, and “outside activities.” Non-judging activities refers to outside work
that increases (pecuniary and/or non-pecuniary) income. Moonlighting as a private-sector
arbitrator or providing legal representation is rare for appellate judges, and generally forbid-
den by rules of judicial conduct. The key example of an outside activity for our purposes is
campaigning for re-election. But as discussed in Epstein et al. (2013), outside activities may
also include other political activities such as fund-raising for party affiliates, writing books
and journal articles, or guest lecturing at law schools.
    A judge must allocate time between leisure TL , judging TJ , and outside activities TA ,
subject to the constraint:
                                       TL + TJ + TA ≤ T̄ .                                  (3.1)

where T̄ is the time available for the period in question (week, month, or year, for example).
Let T~ = {TL , TJ , TA } denote the vector of time allocations. Suppose that the utility function
takes a standard Cobb-Douglas form:
                                  
                            ~ , β~ = UL (TL , αL )βL UJ (TJ , αJ )βJ UA (TA , αA )βA
                     U T~ , α

where the vector of judge preferences β~ = {βL , βJ , βA } ∈ (0, 1)3 , includes the elasticity of
leisure βL , the elasticity from the intrinsic value of work on cases βJ , and the elasticity for
outside activities βA .6 The parameters α  ~ = {αL , αJ , αA } are used to parametrize environ-
mental features that change the rewards or time demands of judges. The parameters β~ can
vary across judges but are assumed to be fixed within-judge over time. In contrast, the
parameters α  ~ can vary across courts and across time.
    Suppose that preferences have the standard properties:

Assumption Judicial utility, Ui (Ti , αi ) ≥ 0, for activity i ∈ {L, J, A} is continuous in Ti
    6                            Ui ∂U
    The elasticity is given by   U ∂Ui   = βi . Given that βi ∈ (0, 1), this implies that preferences are strictly
concave in the time choice.



                                                         8
       and αi . Holding αi fixed, Ui is strictly increasing and concave for Ti ≥ 0.

Further, suppose that the parameter values are such that at the optimum Ti > 0, to focus on
the interesting cases. The fact that Ui are concave in Ti and the log function is strictly concave
implies that the monotonic transformation of utility, u = log (U ) gives us an equivalent
representation of preferences in a linear form that is strictly concave in T~ :
                                
                            ~ , β~ = βL uL (TL , αL ) + βJ uJ (TJ , αJ ) + βA uA (TA , αA ).
                     u T~ , α

The judge’s time allocation is the solution to:
                                                               
                                                           ~ , β~ ,
                                                max u T~ , α                                   (3.2)
                                               T~ ∈<3+


subject to the time constraint (3.1).
    A key measure of judicial preference is the extent to which utility varies with time allo-
cated to an activity. Accordingly, when utility is time-differentiable, define the time elasticity
of activity i by:
                                              βi Ti ∂Ui (Ti , αi )
                           i (Ti , αi ) =                         > 0.                      (3.3)
                                           Ui (Ti , αi ) ∂Ti
The assumptions made regarding utility imply that a unique solution to the time allocation
problem exists. In the appendix we provide a proof to the following proposition:

Proposition 1. For βi > 0 (∀i), there exists a unique solution to the judge optimization
                                                                                             ∂T ∗
                    
problem, T~ ∗ α~ , β~ > 0. Moreover, if the solution is twice differentiable in αi ,∀i, then ∂αii > 0
      ∂Tj∗                       ∂i                                            ∂i
and   ∂αi
             < 0 for j 6= i if   ∂αi
                                       > 0. The inequalities are reversed if    ∂αi
                                                                                      < 0.

   One can gain a bit more insight into these conditions by defining the price of time, given
by the Lagrange multiplier, µ, for the time constraint (3.1). The first order conditions for
time allocation imply:

                           value of timei = µTi∗ = i (Ti∗ , αi ) , ∀i ∈ {L, J, A} .           (3.4)

Without loss of generality, normalize the value of leisure so that

                                                 UL (TL ) = TL ,




                                                         9
and set βL = 1, which implies L = 1. From (3.4), we have that µ = 1/TL∗ , and hence:

                              Ti∗ = TL∗ × i (Ti∗ , αi ) , i ∈ {J, A} .                    (3.5)

Thus, the time allocated to judging and outside activities depends on the elasticity of pref-
erences with respect to time. An immediate implication is:

Corollary 2. An increase in the judge’s elasticity for activity i, βi , increases time allocated
to that activity.

   This result highlights the fact that without some way to measure β,~ one cannot measure
the importance of intrinsic incentives across judges because observed variation in choices
may be due to variation in preferences, and not due to variations in employment conditions.
Therefore, we hold β~ fixed and ask how changes in employment conditions α   ~ might affect
judge behavior.


3.1    Preference for Outside Activities
Consider first the allocation of time to outside activities that add to the pecuniary returns
from judging. Outside activities are interpreted in general terms; they include any activity
that has a cost or benefit that is not affected by decision-making in the court. The main
examples are electoral campaigning, writing books, and other activities that have future
returns. We cannot directly measure these activities, but we may consider their implications
when they are monetized and enter via the current period’s pecuniary returns.
   Let the preference for outside activities be given by:

                             UA (TA , αA ) = I0 + IA (TA , αA ) ≥ 0.

The term I0 is the base income from employment as an appellate judge, while IA (TA , αA )
represents all other forms of non-leisure rewards, including career concerns from keeping
one’s job. Suppose that the parameter αA represents changes in the electoral system. When
αA is larger, then the judge faces greater competition for re-election. If one does not increase
effort, then increased electoral competition leads to a fall in future compensation:

                                      ∂IA      ∂IA
                                          > 0,     < 0.
                                      ∂TA      ∂αA

Next suppose that an increase in electoral competition leads to an increase in the marginal

                                                 10
return from outside activities:
                                              ∂ 2 IA
                                                     > 0.
                                             ∂TA ∂αA
The effect on the elasticity of time is thus:
                                                                                  !
              ∂A (TA , αA )     βA TA         ∂ 2 IA     1       ∂IA ∂IA
                             =                        −                               > 0,
                  ∂αA          I0 + IA (·)    ∂TA ∂αA I0 + IA (·) ∂TA ∂αA

which gives, from Proposition 1:

Proposition 3. An increase in electoral competition results in more time on outside activ-
ities and less time allocated to judging.

   The model also makes a clear prediction regarding the effect of pecuniary rewards on
judging. Viewing the income from judging, I0 , as a parameter we have:
                                                                       !
                      ∂A (TA , I0 )     βA TA ∂IA           1
                                     =                 −                   < 0.
                          ∂I0          I0 + IA (·) ∂TA   I0 + IA (·)

Proposition 4. An increase in judicial income reduces time allocated to outside activities,
and increased time allocated to judging.

   This result requires judges to have some ability to allocate time to outside activities. If
TA = 0, then changing judicial income will have no effect on time allocated to judging.


3.2    Preference for Judging
This section considers the sub-problem of allocating time TJ to different cases. This in turn
allows us to derive the indirect utility from judging, denoted by U (TJ , NJ , dJ ), where NJ > 0
is the total caseload, and dJ ∈ [0, 1] is the amount of discretion. The discretion parameter is
important because in some states supreme courts are required to review cases with certain
characteristics, such as death penalty cases. The parameter dJ denotes the fraction of the
case load over which the judge has discretion to hear the case or not. With a larger dJ , she
will have more control over her case load, which in turn will have implications for the quality
of her decisions.
    Specifically, there is a continuum of cases indexed by their complexity/legal significance
γ ∈ [0, ∞), with probability distribution given by f (γ). The index γ allows one to explore
how variations in the cost of time affect the cases a judge chooses to hear and how much
time is allocated to each case. The number of cases is given by NJ .

                                                 11
    Time spent on case γ is given by t (γ). If the judge had no interest in doing her job, then
she would set TJ = 0, and allocate the rest of her time to leisure or outside activities. In
practice, judges likely have some intrinsic desire to do a good job. White (1959) calls this
professionalism, and supposes that it arises from the development of skills that the judge
enjoys using. Our goal is to measure the empirical significance of such preferences. The
rest of this section details a model that has a rich set of predictions regarding how time
constraints affect the choices of a professional. The main results are outlined here with the
details provided in the appendix.
    Professionalism can consist of two elements. First, it is assumed that the judge receives
utility V0 ≥ 0 simply from being a judge – we call this the prestige from judging. Second,
for each case she hears, she obtains utility V (t (γ) , γ) , representing the intrinsic reward a
judge obtains from hearing a case of importance γ ≥ 0.
    Normalize this function so that V (0, γ) = −c < 0 for all γ. This is the minimum time
cost from hearing a case. Also suppose Vt (0, 0) = 0, and for γ, t > 0,

                                               ∂V
                                                  > 0
                                               ∂γ
                                             ∂ 2V
                                                  > 0
                                             ∂γ∂t
                                             ∂ 2V
                                                  < 0.
                                             ∂t∂t

This captures the idea that the judge gets more intrinsic utility from cases with higher γ.7
Finally, we suppose the judge always gets positive utility from cases with sufficiently high
value. This is made more precise below. For the cases over which the judge has discretion,
let h (γ) ∈ [0, 1] be the fraction of these cases that she hears. Given these assumptions, the
value from the discretionary allocation of time to judging is given by:

                                                             Z∞
               VJ (h (· ) , t (·) , dJ , NJ ) = V0 + dJ NJ        V (t (γ) , γ) f (γ) h (γ) dγ
                                                             0
                                                                  Z∞
                                               +(1 − dJ )NJ            V (t (γ) , γ) f (γ) dγ.
                                                                  0

   7
     An example of such a function is V (t, γ) = tr γ − c, r ∈ (0, 1). Notice that these assumptions imply
V (t, 0) = −c for all t.




                                                   12
   Given this, the judge solves the following time allocation problem:

                            UJ (TJ , dJ , NJ ) = max VJ (h (·) , t (·) , dJ , NJ )           (3.6)
                                                 h(·),t(·)


subject to:

                      Z∞                                        Z∞
              dJ NJ        t (γ) h (γ) f (γ) dγ + (1 − dJ )NJ        t (γ) f (γ) dγ ≤ TJ .   (3.7)
                      0                                         0


Consider first the case of the unmotivated judge for which βJ = 0. In that case TJ = 0,
and the judge only allocates time between leisure and outside activities. For such a judge
variation in working conditions that do not affect their time allocation will have no affect on
judicial performance.
   The more interesting case is when they do care and βJ ∈ (0, 1). Let µJ be the Lagrange
multiplier for (3.7). Using (3.4) we have:

                                                   ∂UJ     UJ
                                           µ∗J =       = µ∗ .                                (3.8)
                                                   ∂TJ     βJ

The marginal value of time for the judging sub-problem is equal to the judge’s marginal
value of time, times the utility from judging, divided by the elasticity for judging.

The Effect of Discretion

The solution to the judging sub-problem can be conveniently expressed in terms of the cost
of time. The amount of time allocated to a case of quality γ depends only on the value of
time in the judging sub-problem:

                                         Vt (t∗ (µJ , γ) , γ) = µJ .

This expression implies that time, and thereby opinion quality, is increasing with the diffi-
culty of the case: t∗γ (µJ , γ) > 0.
    An increase in discretion reduces the time constraint, and hence µJ . Thus there is an
increase in time per case holding TJ fixed. The choice of cases to hear is given by the net
value of case γ:
                         ∆ (µJ , γ) = V (t∗ (µJ , γ) , γ) − µJ (t∗ (µJ , dJ )) .

This value is increasing in γ and decreasing in µJ . For γ = 0 it is −c, and therefore negative.

                                                       13
We assume that for for γ sufficiently large this is positive. Thus there is a unique γ ∗ (µJ )
such that ∆ (µJ , γ ∗ (µJ )) = 0. For cases γ > γ ∗ (µJ ), the judge gets positive utility from
hearing these cases, and so sets h (γ) = 1. For γ < γ ∗ (µJ ) , the judge prefers not to hear
these cases, and thus only hears the fraction required, (1 − dJ ). By the envelope theorem,
the net value is decreasing in µJ . Therefore an increase in the value of time µJ leads to fewer
cases being heard and less time allocated to the cases that are heard. These observations
are summarized as follows:

Proposition 5. An increase in discretion reduces the elasticity of the utility from judging
 ∂J (T ,dJ )
( ∂dJJ        < 0), and hence less total time is allocated to judging, with fewer cases being
heard.

    This result illustrates the countervailing properties of discretion – it tilts the balance in
favor of more important cases. Since these cases provide more utility, they have an effect
similar to V0 , and thus lead to a reduction in total time in judging.
    The effect upon time per case is ambiguous. The reason is that from expression 3.8, we
see that that the cost of time in judging solves depends both on the overall cost of time µ∗
and on utility U . An increase in discretion lowers the cost of time but raises utility, so the
net effect is ambiguous. This will be an effect that we will measure in the data.
    The model also helps explain the role of discretion as a matter of public policy. If there
are cases that are deemed to be in the public interest, then a mandatory review might
be warranted. Otherwise, they may not be heard if considered to be of marginal legal
significance. On the other hand, allowing discretion may result in more time allocated to
cases with greater legal significance if the time constraint is relaxed sufficiently.

The Effect of Case Load

Finally, consider the effect of changes in the case load. Rewrite the variable utility component
for judging as:

                           V (TJ , dJ , NJ ) = U (TJ , dJ , NJ ) − V0 ,
                                                       TJ
                                                                   
                                             = NJ V         , dJ , 1 .
                                                       NJ

This implies that the optimal marginal value of time in the judging sub-problem can be
                       
written as µ∗J NTJJ , dJ , which is decreasing in both the time and discretion arguments.



                                               14
    The appendix shows that the effect of case load on the preference for judging is given by:

                         ∂UJ              TJ                   TJ      TJ
                                                                 
                             =V              , dJ − VTJ           , dJ    > 0.             (3.9)
                         ∂NJ              NJ                   NJ      NJ

This expression is positive because an increase in case load results in more high-value cases;
the judge can always reallocate effort from the low-value to the high-value cases to increase
total utility. The effect on the elasticity with respect to case load is given by:
                                                                                 !
                    ∂ 2 J (TJ , dJ , NJ )   β J TJ     ∂ 2 UJ    1 ∂UJ ∂UJ
                                           =                   −                     .
                          ∂TJ ∂NJ             UJ       ∂TJ ∂NJ   UJ ∂TJ ∂NJ

The first term in parentheses is positive – increasing the case load always increases the
marginal value of time – while (3.9) implies that the second term is negative in sign. The
relative importance of the two terms is determined by prestige, V0 . Thus we have:

Proposition 6. An increase in the case load (NJ ) increases the time allocated to judging TJ
if the prestige from judging is sufficiently high, otherwise it lowers total time on judging.

    In summary, judges have to decide which cases to hear, and how to allocate time across
these cases. Given that pecuniary returns do not vary with these decisions, the allocation
of time depends on their personal preferences for their work, or their professionalism. As
professionals, judges may spend more time on the more important cases. When judges have
discretion, then the theory predicts that they adjust their workload on two margins – which
cases to hear, and how much time to allocate to the cases that they do hear. The theory
provides little guidance regarding the size of these effects – that requires empirical evidence.


4     Institutional Background
State supreme courts operate as the state judiciary’s analogue to the U.S. Supreme Court,
where judges rule on questions of state law rather than federal law. These questions arise
in cases appealed from lower state courts. The state supreme court consists of a panel of
between five and nine judges, who decide together how to rule on appeals.
    A case begins when a plaintiff files a lawsuit or a prosecutor indicts a criminal. At trial,
facts are litigated and a judge/jury gives a verdict, which the losing party can appeal. If
the state has an intermediate appeals court, they will then take the case and may affirm,
reverse, or modify the trial verdict. After this intermediate court’s decision (or after the


                                                      15
trial decision when the state does not have an intermediate appellate court), the ruling can
be appealed to the state supreme court.
    If the supreme court accepts a case for review, the panel of judges will rehear the case at
oral argument and review the submitted briefs for legal error. Each judge votes whether to
affirm or reverse the lower decision. One of the majority judges writes an opinion explaining
the decision. In rare cases, the state supreme court ruling is appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
    This is the institutional context for the present study of judicial incentives. Importantly,
the job of a supreme court judge does not change much over the course of a career. A judge
in his first year of work has essentially the same task as a judge in his last. While the state
supreme court judge’s job of reviewing cases and establishing precedent is similar to that
of a U.S. Supreme Court justice, there are important institutional differences between state
supreme courts and the U.S. Supreme Court that provide attractive opportunities for the
empirical study of how employment conditions affect judicial behavior.

                                     [TABLE 1.1 HERE]

    This paper identifies the causal relationship between employment conditions and judge
performance using institutional changes at state supreme courts. The list of treatments
is described in Table 1.1. These include the addition of an intermediate appellate court,
changes in term length between elections, changes in judge salaries, and the staggered judicial
electoral cycle. Some of the reforms to intermediate appellate courts and term lengths were
not included due to co-occurrence of other major reforms. The following reforms are not
the focus of the analysis but are included as control variables: establishment of a court
administrative office, change in the judge retention system, increase in the number of judges,
and establishment of a mandatory retirement age.
    One of the most common reforms is the establishment of an intermediate appellate court
(IAC). Intermediate appellate courts significantly filter the set of cases that supreme court
judges have to review. When an IAC is operating, supreme court judges have a lot of help in
reviewing cases and have more discretion in whether to accept cases for review. We expect
that the introduction of an IAC will increase the time and discretion available to judges,
so they can devote more time to what they care about. If judges care about their work
product, they will spend more time on the opinions that remain on the docket. In terms of
the model notation, this reform can be seen as reducing NJ , the number of cases they must
hear, and/or increasing dJ , the level of discretion in case selection. As discussed in more


                                              16
detail below, some states gave full discretion to the supreme court after establishing an IAC,
while other states gave only limited discretion. This will turn out to matter empirically.

                                       [FIGURE 1.1 HERE]

    Because compensation is not contingent on performance, the retention process is probably
the strongest incentive system facing state appellate judges. In most states, judges have to
be reappointed by the governor or by voters every few years. There is substantial variation
in the lengths of terms of office for state appellate judges, as shown in Figure 1.1. Moreover,
there are discrete changes in the judge term length. Section 7.2 reports estimates of the effect
on performance of these changes. In the sample of years, while ten states in total changed
judge term lengths, there were only five states without significant coterminous reforms to
judge employment conditions.8 Increasing term lengths reduces the frequency with which a
judge faces re-election, so the effects of election on a judge’s time allocation will be reduced.
Decreasing term lengths should have the opposite effect. In the model, decreasing electoral
incentives corresponds to a decrease in the return to outside (campaigning) activities α0 ,
which by Proposition 1 should increase time spent on cases and be reflected in higher quantity
and/or quality of output.

                                       [FIGURE 1.2 HERE]

    We measure the effects of IAC establishments and term length changes in a panel frame-
work using judge fixed effects. Because there is such a long time period, we measure effects
in a window around the reforms. While the results are not particularly sensitive to the
time window chosen (as illustrated in the figures below), we settled on a ten-year window as
reasonably balanced given our purposes. This ten-year-window specification accommodates
the average career length of state supreme court judges – having a longer effect window
would give too much weight to the handful of judges who work on the court for many years
before and after the reform. The regressions include an indicator equaling one for the base-
line time window of ten years before and ten years after an IAC establishment or a term
length change. The treatment variable is a dummy for the ten years after the change. Thus,
with the inclusion of the judge fixed effects, the estimates can be interpreted as the average
difference in within-judge performance for the ten years after the policy change relative to
the ten years before the policy change. This setup is illustrated in Figure 1.2. In a handful
  8
    The changes are as follows: Hawaii, seven to ten years; Montana, six to eight; South Dakota, six to
eight; Louisiana, fourteen to ten; Vermont, two to six.


                                                  17
of states, we shrank the time window if the reform occurred close to the end of the sample
(ND and NE) or if there was a conflict with another reform (HI). Where reforms occurred
within 5 years of each other, they were not included in the analysis.

                                    [FIGURE 1.3 HERE]

                                    [FIGURE 1.4 HERE]

                                    [FIGURE 1.5 HERE]

    Next we have monthly data on individual judge salaries between 1974 and 1994. This
analysis add to existing findings, such as Choi et al. (2009) and Baker (2008), by measuring
the within-judge effect in a panel data framework. Proposition 4 suggests that increasing
base income I0 would reduce incentives to engage in outside activities and therefore may
increase time spent on judging work. To get an idea of the scope of variation in salaries,
Figure 1.3 shows the average real judge salary over time for the sample of judges. The
negative trend early in the period is due to pay increases not keeping up with inflation.
Figure 1.4 provides a histogram of the number of discrete salary increases by year in the
data. Figure 1.5 shows the average size, in proportional terms, of the judicial salary increases
that occurred in that year (if one did occur). As in Mas (2006), these discrete compensation
changes may result in measurable performance changes.

                                     [TABLE 1.2 HERE]

    To look more closely at judicial election incentives, we exploit the staggered electoral
cycle. Like U.S. Senators, nontenured state supreme court judges face election on a staggered
basis, where a subset of judges are up for election in any particular election year. One can
compare the performance of judges who are up for election to their colleagues who are not up
for election. If judges choose high performance to impress voters or the party organization,
then being up for election should improve judge performance. If instead judges have an
intrinsic motivation to choose high performance and elections take up their time, then being
up for election should reduce judge performance. Or elections may have no effect. Helpfully,
there are both contested election systems (where elections are competitive and incumbents
face challengers) and uncontested election systems (where incumbent judges face an up-or-
down retention vote and only the worst judges are removed from office). Whatever their



                                              18
effect, elections should have a weaker or non-existent effect in uncontested systems.9 Table
1.2 lists the states by their retention system.
    The judge retention system also matters for the analysis of salary increases. An alter-
native model by Besley (2004) suggests that increasing salaries may affect performance by
increasing the value of retention, which would cause judges to change their performance to
influence their election. If Besley’s model is correct, one would observe an incentive effect of
salaries only in the competitive retention systems, and not under uncontested elections or
tenure.

                                           [TABLE 1.3 HERE]

    As emphasized in the theory, the judge’s discretion to select cases for review is crucial
to the operation of extrinsic incentives and intrinsic motivation. The central idea is that
with discretionary case selection, intrinsic motivation should play a more important role in
performance because judges have more control over their work environment. One can divide
state supreme courts into three categories, depending on whether they have full discretion
in case selection, partial discretion (that is, some cases are mandatory), or fully mandatory
review (that is, all cases must be reviewed to some degree).10 These states are listed in Table
1.3. A line of papers in the political science literature have shown that while judges have
some level of discretion under mandatory review, it nonetheless has substantial compositional
effects on the state supreme court caseload (e.g. Eisenberg and Miller, 2009).11
   9
      There are two types of contested system. In partisan contested elections, incumbent judges face a
challenger, with party affiliations on the ballot. In non-partisan contested elections, incumbent judges face a
challenger, but party affiliations are not on the ballot. We examine the differences between these two systems
in separate work. Three other judge retention systems have a relatively small number of states. In governor
retention, the governor decides whether a judge should be re-appointed at the end of his/her term. With
legislative retention, the state legislature decides by majority vote whether a judge should be re-appointed.
With life tenure, judges cannot be removed except by impeachment.
   10
      The U.S. Supreme Court has fully discretionary review.
   11
      In practice, the appellate review standards are relatively complex. Splitting the states into three cate-
gories required simplification and some subjective coding decisions. That is why we report aggregate results
without regard to the discretion level. A second procedural rule that did not turn out to matter was the pro-
cedure for assigning cases to judges. At state supreme courts, discretionary assignment by the chief justice
(the rule at the U.S. Supreme Court) is the minority rule followed in just 15 states. In 13 states, cases are
randomly assigned to authoring judges. In the remaining 22 states, cases are assigned on a rotating system,
with cases arbitrarily assigned to judges based on their order on the docket. Christensen et al. (2012) show
some differences in case assignment characteristics across systems. In their sample, for random assignment
and rotating assignment, case characteristics and judge characteristics are only negligibly correlated. In
the electoral cycle results, however, we find that the number of opinions still goes down for judges up for
election relative to their colleagues, meaning that true rotation/randomness is not occurring. It turns out
that looking only at the states with rotating/random assignment does not affect our results.


                                                      19
    We do not have variation over time within state in the rules for case selection. Our
analysis seeks to study their importance by examining the relative magnitude and significance
of the other treatments depending on the case selection rule. In particular, the establishment
of an IAC should have a larger treatment effect under discretionary case selection, as this
gives the supreme court more scope to reduce their caseload. In terms of the model, this can
be thought of as a greater increase in the parameter dJ due to establishing an IAC under full
discretion relative to limited discretion. Similarly, for courts with higher review discretion,
treatments that reduce the return to outside activities (αA ) or increase base income (I0 )
might have a larger positive effect on judging effort (relative to courts with lower review
discretion) since the return to judging time (relative to leisure time) is greater in those
courts.


5     Data
One contribution of this project is the assembly of a new integrated data set on state appellate
courts. At present, there is extensive data on federal court judges (e.g., Epstein et al., 2013),
but no existing comprehensive panel data on state courts. Existing studies, such as Landes
and Posner (1980), Shepherd (2009b), Tabarrok and Helland (1999), Hall and Bonneau
(2006), Gordon and Huber (2007), Kritzer (2011, 2015), Lim (2013), and Iaryczower et al.
(2013), ask different questions and/or use different, shorter time periods. Our data set has
a much longer time period and is more comprehensive. The State Court Data Project had
four years of data (1995-1998), and did not have data on how often cases were cited by later
judges. Choi et al’s (2009, 2010) data included three years of cases (1998-2000). These short
time frames only allow cross-sectional studies of judge behavior. Since the data set spans 48
years of data (1947-1994) it allows us to use a within-judge identification strategy.
    Three data sets have been constructed with three types of data: 1) judge characteristics,
2) institutional variables, and 3) judicial output measures. These data are discussed in the
next three subsections.


5.1    Judge Characteristics
The data on the characteristics of individual judges is collected from a range of sources. The
key sources include state court web sites, judge obituaries, and Marquis Who’s Who. Items
that were unavailable from these sources were obtained through interviews of state court
administration staff.

                                               20
                                          [TABLE 2.1 HERE]

    Table 2.1 presents summary means and standard deviations for a collection of judge
variables in the sample. State supreme court judges are hired in middle age: 53.6 years old on
average. They work as judges for an average of 12 years, are overwhelmingly male, and most
of them resign or retire (rather than earn a promotion, die in office, or lose election). Because
promotion (defined in this table as moving to a federal appeals court or to a governorship)
is so rare, career concerns are likely a limited source of incentive pressure for these judges.


5.2     Institutional Variables
The key changes in institutional treatment variables, as described in Section 4 above, are
listed in Tables 1.1 and 1.2. Summary statistics for these variables by state and year are
listed in Table 2.2. The discrete rule changes are represented in the data as dummy variables
that equal one for the years after the law change and zero for the years before. In almost all
cases, reforms are enacted by voters through ballot referendums administered in November
and officially going into effect the subsequent January. In these cases the dummy variable
would turn on in the year following the vote. In cases where the policy is effective in the
first half of the year, it is coded as turning on in that year. For annual salaries, we use the
weighted average across months. The term length changes are combined in a single variable,
where a term length decrease is represented as a negative one.12

                                          [TABLE 2.2 HERE]

    The institutional variables were collected from a range of sources. Most of the judge
salary data were obtained from the National Center for State Courts (NCSC), which admin-
isters an annual survey of state judge salaries. These data were error-checked by research
assistants. Inflation adjustments are made with BLS data on prices for regions or MSA’s,
when applicable. The appellate review standards were also collected from the NCSC. The
data on discrete rule changes were collected from previous papers on judge election rules,
from the web site judicialselection.us, and from inspection of legislation and constitutional
amendments. The records on election events were collected from a range of sources, with
most of the records obtained from Kritzer (2015).
  12
    Treating these changes symmetrically is a strong assumption, but most of the estimates are similar if we
treat them as separate reforms. Statistical significance is lower due to the smaller number of experiments.




                                                    21
5.3     Judicial Performance
The data set contains judicial performance measures constructed for judicial opinions. Here
we use performance measures suggested by Landes and Posner (1980), Choi et al. (2010),
and Epstein et al. (2013). These include the number of opinions written, the length of
opinions, the amount of research put into opinions, and the number of subsequent citations
to a judge’s opinions. A detailed description of how the data were collected and constructed
is included in Appendix B.
    The judicial performance data are constructed from the universe of opinions published
by state supreme courts between 1947 and 1994. The full sample includes 1,025,461 cases.
Many of these cases are summary orders – certiorari denials, habeas corpus denials, and
other brief orders that do not require a full written opinion. These orders are just a few
sentences long and are rarely if ever cited by future judges. Many states in the sample
do not publish these types of orders. Our interest is in the professionally authored legal
precedents that explain the ruling for future judges, so summary orders are excluded from
the empirical analysis. Specifically, we focus on published majority opinions that are seven or
more sentences in length – orders with six or fewer sentences are removed. This step shrinks
the sample to 496,099 majority opinions. Next, since the goal is to study the behavior of
individual judges across time, unauthored (per curiam) opinions are removed, as well as
the small number of opinions written by non-supreme-court judges, such as magistrates,
commissioners, and other special sitting judges.13 This step shrinks the sample to 387,905
majority opinions (plus attached discretionary opinions) written by judges with biographical
information. This results in 184.7 cases per state per year and 25 cases per judge per year
on average.
    The list of performance variables, along with summary statistics, are presented in Tables
2.3 through 2.6. At the state supreme court level, whether to accept a case for review is
often discretionary, so if judges accept more cases for review they are taking on more work.
Whether to write a discretionary opinion – a concurrence or a dissent – is always up to the
judge’s discretion and involves willingly taking on more work.
    Second, effort statistics are constructed from the raw text of a judge’s opinions. An
appellate judge’s output is his writing; a rough measure of increased effort would be increased
  13
    The treatment variables are uncorrelated with the number and proportion of per curiam opinions, with
the exception of the establishment of the intermediate appellate court. The proportion of per curiam opinions
goes down after an IAC is established. This likely reflects that per curiam opinions are on average less
important than authored opinions, and that after an IAC is established the court reviews fewer less important
cases.


                                                     22
language output that is measured by the total number of words written during a time period,
as well as a basic opinion length measure – the average number of words per majority opinion
written. In addition, the amount of research a judge engages in is measured by the average
length of the Table of Cases, which is the number of previous authorities cited in her opinions.
    When using opinion length and case-law research as effort measures, it’s important to
note that much of the raw labor inputs into opinion writing and research are provided by
supreme court clerks. If one observes changes in output in response to rule changes, that
effect may be due in part to changes in how the judge manages her clerks. We interviewed
state supreme court court staff, and learned that the number of clerks per judge remained
relatively constant over the time period of the study. Moreover, the processes of clerk
selection and retention were relatively stable and do not seem to be correlated with changes
in other judicial institutions.
    The third measure is the number of citations to a judge’s opinions by other judges.
Bloomberg Law staff attorneys have categorized citations as positive, distinguishing, or neg-
ative. A positive cite is a clear signal that a decision is found useful by a future judge. A
distinguishing cite means that part of the ruling is useful, but needs to be clarified – so this
is perhaps a weaker signal of opinion quality. The significance of a negative citation is more
problematic; the most intuitive interpretation is that a negative cite means a judge made
the wrong decision. On the other hand, negative cites could mean that a judge is being
more creative in his judging and allowing for more experimentation in lawmaking. A final
possibility is that negative cites are just another signal of an opinion’s influence relative to
other opinions, and therefore could serve as an additional quality measure.
    The Bloomberg citation analysis features allow the construction of more fine-tuned data
on judicial citations, and includes information about whether a case is discussed by the
future court (rather than cited without comment), or whether it is directly quoted by the
citing court. These measures can be understood as more direct signals that the citing court
finds the opinion useful. The Out-of-State Cites measure includes positive cites from out-of-
state courts; as noted by Choi et al. (2010) among others, this is perhaps the best quality
measure because the cited case serves as persuasive rather than binding precedent. For all of
these citation measures, however, an important caveat is that the number of cites is a joint
measure of both the importance of a case and the effort of the judge.14
    Citations are an interesting outcome variable because they reflect case quality, which
  14
    For the citations measures, versions using only citations within ten years of the publication of the opinion
(rather than all citations through 2012) did not qualitatively affect the results.



                                                      23
judges may be intrinsically motivated to produce when other time constraints are reduced.
Citation counts would not be useful on this point if they could easily be manipulated by
judges independently of case quality. Another problem would be if judges monitored their
citations and derived utility from citation counts (rather than case quality itself).

                                    [FIGURE 2.1 HERE]

    There are a number of reasons why this may not be a serious concern. First, the vast
majority of citations to state supreme court opinions are from other courts (mostly lower
courts in the same state, but also courts in other states), meaning that the judge cannot
meaningfully influence citation counts either from citing his own cases or from influencing
his colleagues to do so. Second, during this time period it was difficult to monitor one’s
citations, since they would have to be looked up manually in citation digests – large tomes
that span multiple shelves in law libraries. Moreover, many citations occur long after an
opinion is written (and presumably forgotten). Figure 2.1 shows the distribution of the
delay between a case and its citations – the median delay is ten years. Recalling that the
average career length in the sample is 12 years, this shows that a majority of citations occur
after a judge leaves the bench. Citations are therefore unlikely to be a source of expected
rewards for the authoring judge.

                                     [TABLE 2.3 HERE]

                                     [TABLE 2.4 HERE]

    Table 2.3 provides summary statistics for case-level variables. Besides the performance-
related variables just described, this table includes a handful of opinion-level variables that
are not used in the empirical analysis but provide context for the type of work performed
by state supreme court judges. They include the case outcome – affirm, reverse, remand,
or modify – and the main areas of law for each case – civil, criminal, administrative, or
constitutional. The first pair of columns gives statistics for the full sample of cases, while
the second pair of columns gives statistics for the pruned sample of authored legal opinions,
which is the sample of opinions used in the empirical analysis. As expected, the average
opinion in the pruned sample is longer, more well-researched, more well-cited, and has more
discretionary opinions attached. This reflects that the less important summary orders have
been excluded. Table 2.4 gives summary correlations within case for the set of performance
measures used in the empirical analysis. Notably, all of the measures are positively correlated

                                              24
within opinion, some strongly so. In particular, the fact that negative cites are strongly
correlated with positive cites would support the use of negative cites as an additional signal
of opinion quality.
    It’s tempting to draw causal inferences from these correlations; after all, a well-researched
opinion is likely to be more well-cited due to its higher-quality research. But there are other
unobserved qualities of opinions that also influence the number of citations, such as the
clarity of the legal reasoning or the novelty of the legal issues presented, which are likely also
correlated with the length of the table of cases. While it is an interesting open empirical
question what case features determine the number of citations, we do not have independent
exogenous variation in particular features of opinions and therefore cannot procure credible
estimates of those effects. Therefore, the empirical analysis uses each performance variable
separately and only as a dependent variable.

                                      [TABLE 2.5 HERE]

    Table 2.5 aggregates the data by judge-year. This level of aggregation is used in the
results reported below because it allows the use of a judge fixed effect and treats a year
of work by an individual judge as the unit of observation. If case-level data were used in
the regressions, then the number of opinions written would skew a judge’s weighting in the
estimates. Also, it makes sense for judges who work many years to count more than judges
who work just a few years. Finally, using years rather than months or quarters is helpful
for avoiding problems associated with seasonal variation in performance, for example due to
vacation time.
    The statistical levels observed in the data are not especially relevant to the empirical
analysis. The coefficient estimates are derived from log specifications and can therefore be
interpreted as proportional changes due to the treatments. That said, one might note that
each of these judges is responsible for a large corpus of output in any given year. The
average annual output is 63,831 words, the length of a short novel. On average, a judge’s
opinions for a year are used 43 times by judges in other jurisdictions (Total Out-of-State
Cites), illustrating that state supreme court judges are influential figures that can play an
important role in the broader legal system.

                                      [TABLE 2.6 HERE]

   Finally, Table 2.6 reports summary correlations for the performance variables using the
judge-year data set. As with the case-level correlations reported in Table 2.4, the judge-year

                                               25
correlations indicate that the performance measures are mostly correlated within judge over
time. The multiple measures of output and quality provide multiple signals of the amount
of time a judge spends on his opinions. The important exception in this table is the number
of majority opinions, which is negatively correlated with most of the quality measures. This
suggests that judges face a tradeoff between quantity and quality. These correlations may
reflect that judges with larger caseloads have to sacrifice on quality, or it may just be a case
composition effect where judges with larger caseloads also tend to work on less important
cases. The goal of our empirical work is to discriminate between these types of explanations
using panel data.


6    Empirical Strategy
The core of our empirical approach is to exploit within-judge variation in performance. More
precisely, consider the following setup with three types of data. First, judge characteristics
,Xi , include observables such as age, experience, and education, as well as unobservables such
as ability and preferences (These would include β~ from the model). Second, employment
conditions Zit generally vary within state over time but can also vary by judge within state
(due to a staggered electoral cycle, for example). These variables include compensation,
rules for appointment and retention, term length, etc. Third, judge performance outcomes
Yit are constructed from the sample of judicial opinions as described in Section 5.3.
    The goal is to compare judge performance under conditions Z A and Z B . The causal
effect of potential outcome A compared to B is given by:
                                                                   
                          YitA − YitB = F Z A , Xi , t − F Z B , Xi , t

where F (·) describes the outcome as a function of the treatment (Z), judge characteristics
(Xi ), and time (t). As Holland (1986) observes, measuring the causal effect is impossible
because it requires comparing different treatments to the same judges administered at the
same time.
    Previous papers on judicial employment conditions have taken two different approaches to
solving this identification problem. The structural approach, best-known from the industrial
organization literature (e.g., Angrist and Pischke, 2010), assumes that the model of judge
behavior is known and that only parameter values are unknown. Two leading applications
of this approach to state supreme court judges are Lim (2013) and Iaryczower et al. (2013).
These papers illuminate the relative importance of different mechanisms assuming that those

                                               26
mechanisms exist. However, a causal interpretation relies on the correctness of a model that
cannot in general be proven to be correct.
   A second approach is to estimate cross-sectional effects conditional on observables. The
two leading applications of this approach to state supreme court judges are Choi et al.
(2009) and Choi et al. (2010). This approach assumes that Xi captures all the relevant
characteristics of a judge. Then whenever Xi = Xj ,

                                  F (Z, Xi , t) = F (Z, Xj , t) , ∀Z.

If the treatment Z is assigned to different judges, then the causal effect is given by:
                                                                          
                         YitA − YjtB = F Z A , Xi , t − F Z B , Xj , t

and no time variation is needed. The problem with this approach is that judges and courts
may have unobserved characteristics that vary systematically by state (Xi 6= Xj ). If so,
correlation between performance and employment conditions are not likely to be causal
links, but the result of differences between the judges selected.
    Our solution to the identification problem is to use the panel structure in the data.
Changes in state laws determining judicial employment conditions over time are viewed as
“natural experiments,” measuring the changes in judicial performance in response to changes
in employment conditions. Formally, we measure:
                                                                                 
                                                  F Z A , Xi , t − F Z B , Xi , t − 1
                 YitA − Yit−1
                          B
                                      X
                              =                                                         ,
                                  (i,t)∈T (A,B)
                                                                 #T (A, B)

where T (A, B) is the set of all the judges i and periods t where employment rule Z A prevailed
in period t and employment rule Z B prevailed in period t − 1. By construction, we measure
within-judge effects of the treatment. The benefit of this approach is that many of the
features of the court and judge that are likely to be important, such as the number of judges
or judge ability, are held fixed.
    There is still the problem of secular changes from one period to the next. We follow
Bertrand et al. (2004) and address this issue with the inclusion of state time trends and
time dummies. Under relatively weak conditions one can correctly identify the effect of a
change at the state level on individuals in that state. A number of studies have used this
approach in a law-and-economics context, including Miles (2000), Autor et al. (2004), Autor


                                                        27
et al. (2006), MacLeod and Nakavachara (2007), Currie and MacLeod (2008), Carvell et al.
(2012) and Avraham et al. (2013).
    The econometric specification is a linear model estimated by ordinary least squares.
Records are indexed by ist, representing judge i, state s, and year t.15 The set of judge
characteristics, described in Section 5.1, is represented by Xi . The vector of treatment
variables, described in Section 5.2, is represented by Zist ; what is included varies by regression
and is described in more detail in the results section. The performance measure is denoted
by Yist , as described in Section 5.3. It is constructed from the sample of opinions written
by judge i working in state s during year t. The outcome variables in the regressions are
yist = log(1 + Yist ); coefficients can therefore be interpreted as proportional changes due to
reforms.16
    The estimated equation is given by:

                                                             0
                       yist = TIMEt + JUDGEi + STATEs × t + Zist ρ + ist

where TIMEt is a fixed effect for year t, JUDGEi is a judge fixed effect, and STATEs × t is
a state-level linear time trend for state s. The year fixed effect allows for arbitrary national
trends in the performance variable. The judge fixed effect controls for time-invariant state-
level and judge-level characteristics. The state time trends control for preexisting trends
in the performance variable that may be confounded with changes in state laws.17 Again
following Bertrand et al. (2004), standard errors are clustered at the state level, allowing
for heteroskedasticity and for arbitrary correlation of the error term within state across
judges and across time. This is sensible because unobserved shocks to performance are likely
correlated within the same court.18
  15
     More precisely, it is court s, since Oklahoma and Texas each have two courts of last resort.
  16
     The variable 1 + Yist is used to account for zeros in the data; the means of the variables are mostly
far from zero. The results are robust to using levels or the inverse hyperbolic sine rather than logs of the
dependent variable. The adjusted R2 is usually higher in the logs specification than in levels.

     Our results are robust to the inclusion of a full set of dummies for years of judge experience, meaning
that the effects are not generated by mechanical changes in judge human capital. The results are robust
to removing the first and last years of each judge’s career, meaning that they are not generated by outliers
related to different case compositions for younger/older judges, or for judges transitioning between positions.
We have done the regressions with all the opinions (not just those with more than seven sentences), which
strengthens our results. Finally we have done regressions using state-year data (rather than judge-year data)
that includes unauthored (per curiam) opinions and those authored by special judges, with substantially
similar results.
  18
     The statistical tests are robust to using two-way clustering by state and year. See Cameron et al. (2011).

7      Results
This section presents four sets of empirical results. First, Section 7.1 reports results on
establishing an intermediate appellate court. The results on extending judge term lengths
are in Section 7.2. Results on increasing judge salaries are presented in Section 7.3. Section
7.4 reports the effect of being up for election.


7.1     Effect of an Intermediate Appellate Court
First consider the effect of introducing an intermediate appellate court (IAC). IAC judges
take over much of the caseload and and give the supreme court judges more discretion in
whether to accept cases for review. Reducing the caseload should mechanically reduce time
demands for the supreme court judges, and hence these regressions provide a robustness
check.
    A concern is that the introduction of the IAC may be correlated with judge performance.
These courts were established because the supreme court was overworked, and anecdotal
evidence suggests that the supreme court judges actively lobbied for the lower court.19 We
can measure the effect of the treatment on the judges in these states but cannot make strong
external validity claims about the effects of an IAC in states that did not choose to establish
one. What we have done is checked carefully whether there were other significant reforms to
the court system at the same time as an IAC being established. We have not considered any
of those reforms in our treatments (although including them does not substantially change
the results).20 A detailed history of these reforms is available from the authors upon request.
    As discussed in Section 6, our basic regression model is given by

                                                          0        0

where TIMEt is a fixed effect for year t, JUDGEi is a judge fixed effect, and STATEs × t

     For example, the Massachusetts judiciary web site states: “The Supreme Judicial Court’s appellate
caseload had greatly expanded through the late 1950s and 1960s. Expansion was fueled in part by a huge in-
crease in criminal appeals. . . Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Joseph Tauro, with considerable support
and assistance from SJC Clerk John E. Powers, leaders of the Legislative and Executive Branches, and the
state’s bar associations, succeeded in getting an intermediate appellate court established in 1972.” Besides
Massachusetts, we found historical evidence of this justification for Florida, Arizona, New Mexico, Mary-
land, North Carolina, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Hawaii, Alaska, Idaho, Connecticut,
Minnesota, and North Dakota.
  20
     We have not excluded reforms that occurred coterminously with salary increases (Florida, New Mexico,
Washington, Colorado, Kansas) or establishment of a mandatory retirement age (Florida, Massachusetts).

is a state-level linear time trend for state s. The term Z̄st is a vector of indicators equaling
one for the baseline time windows of ten years before and ten years after each of the policy
changes discussed in Section 4. Zst is a vector of treatment indicators for the ten years after
each rule change.21 Thus, with the inclusion of the judge fixed effects, the estimates for the
elements of ρ can be interpreted as the average difference in within-judge performance for
the ten years after the policy change relative to the ten years before the policy change. Let
ρIAC be the component of ρ corresponding to the IAC treatment, with estimate ρ̂IAC .
    The level of discretion given to state supreme court judges in selecting cases for review
should affect how they reallocate their time in response to changes in employment conditions.
Therefore, the effects of the treatments are interacted with the level of discretion given in
each state. The second regression model is


                                              0        0            0 LD
       yist = TIMEt + JUDGEi + STATEs × t + Z̄st ρ̄ + Zst ρ + γ LD Zst ρ + ist                   (7.2)

where γ LD is a dummy equaling one in the states with limited discretion – whether partial
discretion or mandatory review, as described in Section 4 and listed in Table 1.3. In this
specification, the coefficients of ρ̂ measure the baseline effect of establishing an IAC in the
full-discretion system, while the coefficients of ρ̂LD give the additional interacted effect under
limited discretion.

                                        [TABLE 3.1 HERE]

    The estimated effects of establishing an IAC are reported in Table 3.1. Each row corre-
sponds to a different outcome variable, listed in the leftmost column. The items in Columns
1 through 3 give the estimated ρ̂IAC from Equation (7.1), where subsequent columns add
additional fixed effects and/or trends. Column 1 estimates the IAC effect by comparing
across states within years, basically giving the average difference in supreme court judge
performance between states that have an intermediate appellate court and those that don’t.
Column 2 gives the within-state effect, which compares how the supreme court as a whole
did after establishing the IAC, with both sitting judges and newly arrived judges. Column 3
gives the within-judge effect, looking only at the average treatment effect on sitting judges
at the time of the rule change. The estimates in Columns 4a and 4b are derived from Equa-
tion (7.2), where Column 4a includes the baseline effect ρ̂IAC and Column 4b includes the
  21
    As discussed in Section 4 and illustrated in Figure 1, the time window is smaller for several of the
reforms.

                                                  30
interacted effect ρ̂LD
                    IAC . For this table, we focus on Columns 3, 4a, and 4b, which give the
within-judge effect of establishing an IAC.
    Overall the number of opinions decreases after the reform, reflecting a decreased workload
(Column 3, first row). Columns 4a and Column 4b show that the effect is focused in the
full-discretion states, with a statistically negative interaction effect under limited discretion
which fully cancels out the effect. This is consistent with the idea that lower discretion
constrains the ability of judges to reduce their caseload in response to the reform.
    In Columns 3 and 4a, the estimated coefficient on total words written is much smaller in
magnitude than that on number of opinions, and in the aggregate it is statistically insignifi-
cant. The reason can be seen in the row on majority opinion length – after the establishment
of an IAC, state supreme court judges are using their extra time to write longer, more de-
tailed majority opinions. This effect is almost totally focused in the full-discretion states,
with limited-discretion states (Column 4b) having a significantly smaller effect on majority
opinion length. Correspondingly, the cases are more well-researched (Length of Table of
Cases), an effect which is also strongest (though not significantly so) under full discretion.
    The longer, more well-researched opinions are also of higher quality – but only under
full discretion. The coefficients on positive cites, discussion cites, quote cites, and out-of-
state cites are all significantly positive in the aggregate (Column 3), and they are even
larger under full discretion. The relative effect in limited-discretion states is weaker (that
is, negative) for all of the citation measures, with statistical significance on most measures.
Finally, the increase in distinguishing and negative cites may reflect a greater level of judicial
independence and experimentation, which is consistent with their having more time and
energy in opinion-writing.
    Next we analyze the dynamics of the judge response to establishing an IAC by estimating

                                             −1                6

                                                                      ρτ Zst
                                                                          τ

                         yist = JUDGEi +                   +                 + ist

                                                                   τ
where JUDGEi is a judge fixed effect and the indicator variables Zst , τ ∈ {−6, ..., −1, 1, ..., 6}
are the leads and lags from the IAC reform year. In particular, given IAC reform year Ts in
           τ
state s, Zst equals one for judges working in state s at year T + τ . The sample is restricted
to treated judges, and to the six years before and after the IAC reform. This means the
coefficients can be interpreted as the average within-judge log deviations in the performance
variable relative to the year the reform was enacted.

                                     [FIGURE 3.1 HERE]

                                                  31
    This regression is run separately in states with full discretion and limited discretion over
case selection after the IAC reform. As illustrated in Figure 3.1, the IAC had a large effect in
the states with full discretion (left column of graphs) and a more muted effect in the states
with limited discretion (right column of graphs). Under full discretion, we see clear and
immediate effects on the number of opinions, caselaw research, and citations. Under limited
discretion, we only see a performance improvement on the caselaw research margin. This is
consistent with the importance of discretion in the effectiveness of an IAC in reducing the
caseload.
    The effects on per-opinion performance measures in Table 3.1 are potentially from two
sources. First, an IAC increases judge discretion over case selection, so they may be selecting
a set of cases that are more interesting on average. Second, judges may be putting more
effort into the cases left over. The average length, research, and cites might increase without
increases in judge effort just because the set of cases is different. To study this, we look at
how the performance measures change on a fixed number of the most important cases in
a judge’s portfolio, with the idea that higher performance on these cases is due to higher
effort in response to having more time. Specifically, a set of judge-year performance data
are constructed using averages from the five lowest-quality opinions and five highest-quality
opinions published for each judge, ranked by the number of positive citations. This neces-
sitates the exclusion of a handful of judge-years with fewer than ten opinions. If there is
a change only in the bottom-quality cases, that suggests the IAC effect consists solely of a
change in the composition of cases. If there is a change in the top-quality cases as well, that
suggests the judges are using their extra time to put more work into important cases.

                                     [TABLE 3.2 HERE]

    The effect of establishing an intermediate appellate court on the bottom five and top five
cases by quality are reported in Table 3.2. As with Table 3.2, we report the interacted effect
with limited discretion. As expected, the bottom 5 cases (Column 1a) show large increases in
most quality measures, reflecting that the least important cases are no longer being accepted
for review and the tail of the distribution is being cut off. In terms of the model, this is
consistent with the model’s prediction that judges rule only on the more important cases
first. As seen in Column 1b, these effects on the least-important cases are significantly weaker
under limited discretion. These judges have less control over their caseload, and hence they
cannot filter out the least-important cases.
    The effects on the top 5 cases (Column 2a) are weaker, with mostly zeros but a statistically
positive effect on average majority opinion length and the average length of the table of

                                              32
cases. This suggests that with the extra time from a reduced caseload, judges are spending
more time on their most important cases, writing longer and more well-researched majority
opinions. That extra work does not translate into more citations, however. Again, discretion
seems to matter, with limited discretion killing the effect on opinion length.
   Overall, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that judges have an intrinsic
incentive to do good work, particularly on the cases they find more interesting. When given
more discretion to select cases, judges choose the more interesting cases that have a stronger
impact on the law. When their workload is reduced due to a smaller caseload, they spend
more time working on the cases remaining on the docket.


7.2     Effects of Term Length Changes
This section discusses the estimated effects of changes in term lengths. With a longer term
of office, judges face weaker electoral incentives because they have to face election less often.
Therefore increasing the term of office should result in judges spending more time on what
they care about.
    There were changes in supreme court term length in ten states in the sample, but the
treatment is independently identified in only five states due to the co-occurrence of other
reforms in five of the states. The changes are as follows: Hawaii, seven to ten years; Montana,
six to eight years; South Dakota, six to eight years; Louisiana, fourteen to ten years; and
Vermont, two to six years. Of these states, at the time of the reform Hawaii had governor
retention, Vermont had legislative retention, and Montana, South Dakota, and Louisiana
had contested elections.22 The effects have similar magnitude but are more precise if the five
other states are included while controlling for the co-occurring reforms.

                                           [TABLE 4 HERE]

    The results reported in Table 4 come from estimating Equations (7.1) and (7.2), as done
with IAC’s in the previous section. The table includes estimates for ρT L , where T L stands
for a term length change. Column 1 gives the across-state effect, Column 2 the within-state
effect, and Column 3 the within-judge effect. Columns 4a and 4b present the interacted
treatment by discretion over case selection.
  22
    If one interacts the effect with the retention system, There were similar positive effects on case-law
research and quality in governor retention and contested election systems. The term length effect is actually
negative overall in the legislative retention system (Vermont).




                                                     33
    Unlike the IAC results, including judge or state fixed effects has a significant impact on
the term lengths effects. In Column 1, we see that the states that increased term lengths
have much lower scores on opinion quality measures than other states on average. Once one
controls for a state fixed effect (Column 2), that disparity disappears. This is consistent
with significant variation in measured judge quality across states that is controlled with the
addition of judge or state fixed effects.
    As can be seen in Column 3, when judges get more time due to changes in term length,
they respond with increases in opinion quality. While there are no significant effects on
the number of opinions and opinion length, there is an increase in several of the opinion
quality measures. In particular, increased term length results in significant improvements in
distinguishing cites, discussed cites, and quoted cites.
    Looking to the analysis of discretion over case selection, similar patterns to that in the
IAC are observed. The positive effects of increasing term lengths are strongest under full
discretion, and weaker under limited discretion. The positive effect on caselaw research
becomes statistically significant for full-discretion states. The relative effects on opinion
quality under limited discretion are statistically negative for caselaw research, discuss cites,
and quote cites. These estimates are consistent with the hypotheses that longer terms make
intrinsic incentives more powerful, and that judges invest more in the task of opinion writing
when work discretion allows.


7.3    Effects of Judge Salary Changes
This section discusses the effect of judge salary on judge performance. This analysis is
motivated by Proposition 4, which states that increasing base income I0 should reduce time
spent on outside activities and thereby increase time spent on judging. The outcome yist for
judge i in state s at year t is modeled as

                                                             0
                yist = TIMEt + JUDGEi + STATEs × t + ρWst + Xst β + ist                    (7.3)

where TIMEt is a fixed effect for year t, JUDGEi is a judge fixed effect, STATEs × t is a
state-level linear time trend for state s, Wst is the log real annual salary paid to judges in
state s at year t, and ist is an error term. The set of control variables Xst includes treatment
dummies for all of the institutional reforms described in Section 4. This regression effectively
compares deviations from the detrended mean log salary to deviations from the detrended
outcome variable. Outcome variables are in logs, so coefficients can be interpreted as the


                                               34
predicted percent change in the outcome variable for a one percent increase in real salary.
   As done with intermediate appellate courts and term lengths, we estimate a separate
specification where salary changes are interacted with a dummy for limited discretion. This
specification is given by

                                                                  0
      yist = TIMEt + JUDGEi + STATEs × t + ρWst + ρLD γ LD Wst + Xst β + ist               (7.4)

where everything is the same as (7.3) except for the interacted salary term. As before, γ LD is a
dummy equaling one in the states with limited discretion, meaning that ρ̂LD gives the relative
salary effect in limited-discretion states. The estimated wage elasticity of performance for
full-discretion states is given by ρ̂; for limited discretion states, ρ̂ + ρ̂LD .

                                      [TABLE 5.1 HERE]

    Table 5.1 reports the salary results. Column 1, with only year fixed effects, is the closest
specification to that used in Choi et al. (2009). Column 2 gives the within-state effect which
would include the effect of salary increases on sitting judges and the quality of new judges.
For analyzing only the incentive effect, we look at Column 3.
    Column 1 shows that there are large and significant relationships between wages and
the outcome variables when comparing judges across states. In states with higher salaries,
judge tend to write fewer opinions, but they are longer and have more citations. However,
these effects are zero when controlling for state fixed effects (Column 2) or judge fixed effects
(Column 3). This is consistent with selection bias in the cross-sectional regression (Column
1). Due to other judge-level and court-level factors, those judges paid higher salaries are
also the ones who write fewer, better opinions. Recall that this regression includes the other
treatment variables, highlighting that there are other unobserved variables driving the effect.
    However, we can see in Columns 4a and 4b that when accounting for discretionary review,
there are positive effects of salary changes. In particular, both within-state and within-judge,
increases in log salary in full-discretion states are associated with increases in positive cites,
discuss cites, and quoted cites per opinion. The interacted effects on these measures for
limited discretion are negative – and as large or possibly larger in magnitude than the
positive effects for the full-discretion states.
    The effects on time use of relieving time pressure from outside activities is stronger when
a judge has discretion over using his time. One way to interpret this result is that time spent
on judging is less valuable under limited discretion. They have less intrinsic motivation


                                               35
for their job due to having less control over their work environment, so the leisure effect is
stronger than the intrinsic-motivation effect.
    Besley (2004) provides another potential explanation of these results. A positive effect
of salary on performance could arise from an incentive effect where a larger salary increases
the value of being retained for future judge terms. Because retention is more valuable, the
judge works harder to be retained, and performance increases on average. If this is the key
explanation, wages would increase performance in states where judges undergo a contested
retention process,but should have a weaker or no effect in states where judges have tenure.
To consider this hypothesis, we look at salary effects separately by the contestedness of the
retention process. As listed in Table 1.2, “contested retention” includes contested elections,
governor retention, and legislative retention. “Uncontested retention” includes uncontested
elections and life tenure.
    Formally, we define the dummy variable δ C to equal one in those states with contested
elections, governor retention, or legislative retention. The dummy variable δ U equals one
under uncontested elections and life tenure. The estimated equation is:

                yist = TIMEt + JUDGEi + STATEs × t + Wst0 ρ + Xst
                                                               0
                                                                  β + ist                   (7.5)

where:
             Wst0 ρ = ρC δ C Wst + ρCLD δ C γ LD Wst + ρU δ U Wst + ρU LD δ U γ U LD Wst .

The coefficients ρ̂C and ρ̂U give the baseline salary-performance elasticities under contested
and uncontested retention systems, respectively. The coefficients ρ̂CLD and ρ̂U LD give the
respective interacted effects with limited discretion.

                                       [TABLE 5.2 HERE]

     In Table 5.2, Columns 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b respectively report the estimates for ρ̂C , ρ̂CLD ,
ρ̂U , and ρ̂U LD . It is apparent that there is a striking similarity between contested and
uncontested retention systems. Especially for the effects on positive cites, discuss cites, and
quoted cites, the estimates are very similar. If anything, the effects are slightly stronger under
weak retention incentives. Moreover, the interacted salary effects with limited discretion are
strikingly similar across the retention systems.
     These results contradict the hypothesis that higher performance in response to higher
pay is due to an increased value of being retained for future terms of office, but consistent
with the simple time allocation model. A third alternative explanation would be a behav-
ioral reciprocity effect (e.g. Akerlof, 1982). While the evidence cannot convincingly reject a

                                                  36
reciprocity model, it’s worth noting that most of the empirical studies on reciprocity shows
that the effect is ephemeral, dying out within days or even hours (e.g. Gneezy and List, 2006;
Bellemare and Shearer, 2009).


7.4    Electoral Cycle Effects
To further study the effects of retention incentives on judge behavior, consider how judges
change their behavior over time in response to the election cycle. In particular, the stag-
gered election cycle allows one to compare judges sitting on the same court who are not
up for election with those who face election in the current period. The election schedule is
arbitrarily assigned by history, so one can reasonably assume that it is uncorrelated with
other institutional or socioeconomic factors that would affect individual judge performance.
If judges who are up for election have less free time than judges who are not up for election,
then this will crowd out effort in judging. This effect should be weakest in the uncontested
electoral system where judges have de facto tenure.
    This effect is estimated with:

                yist = JUDGEi + STATEs × TIMEt + ρC Zist
                                                     C
                                                         + ρU Zist
                                                               U
                                                                   + ist                 (7.6)

where JUDGEi is a judge fixed effect,and STATEs × TIMEt is a state-year fixed effect for
                                      C         U
each state s and year t. The terms Zist and Zist  are indicators that equal one when judge i is
up for election at year t, where C stands for contested elections and U stands for uncontested
elections. Note that the dummy variable is coded as a one regardless of whether the judge
actually ran for election – this is needed to avoid endogeneity problems from the judge’s
choice whether to actually run.

                                      [TABLE 6 HERE]

     Table 6 reports the results on the performance effect of being up for election. There are
three “a-b” column pairs, with the “a” columns reporting ρ̂C and the “b” columns reporting
ρ̂U . Columns 1a and 1b include state fixed effects and state trends; Columns 2a and 2b
include judge fixed effects and state trends; Columns 3a and 3b (the specification from
Equation 7.6), include judge fixed effects and state-year fixed effects. While Columns 3a and
3b are preferred for measuring the causal effect on judges of being up for election, Columns 1a
and 1b are useful because they summarize the average effect on the whole court when more



                                              37
judges are up for election in a particular year, relative to trend (although these coefficients
may be biased by other election-year factors unrelated to judicial elections).
    Columns 1a and 1b include only state-year fixed effects. In contested elections, when
more judges are up for election, that is associated with fewer opinions that are of lower
quality. In uncontested elections, there is an opposite effect – when more judges are up for
election, there are more opinions and they may be higher-quality on average. This is strong
initial evidence of the differences in the incentive effects between these electoral systems.
Contested elections seem to take time away from the judges, with an aggregate negative
effect on output. Importantly, this means that any within-judge effects of elections are not
compensated for by other judges. We don’t have an explanation for why there would be more
opinions in election years for uncontested systems; this is likely due to other non-election
factors.
    Next consider the effects in Column 3a, which give the effect of being up for election in
a contested system relative to other judges on the court. With less time for judging, how do
they reorganize their time? First, output is significantly reduced – they write fewer majority
opinions and fewer discretionary opinions, and the opinions are shorter in length They are
directly reducing the amount of work done. On the other hand, the coefficients on caselaw
research and on out-of-state cites are zero. The negative coefficients on the other opinion
quality measures are smaller in magnitude than the effects on opinion output. This suggests
that that the judges reduce the number of opinions in order to maintain the quality of those
opinions.
    Finally, Column 3b reports results on uncontested elections. In contrast to Column 3a,
there are no negative effects of being up for election. If anything, there are positive effects on
performance of being up for an uncontested election. These results are consistent with the
notion that these judges have de facto tenure and do not need to reduce their time allocation
to judging based on the electoral cycle.
    Finally we look at the dynamic within-judge effect of elections by estimating

                                                    2
                                                         ρτ Zist
                                                             τ
                                                    X
                              yist = JUDGEi +                    + ist
                                                 τ =−2

                                                                      τ
where JUDGEi is a judge fixed effect and the indicator variables Zist   , τ ∈ {−2, −1, 0, 1, 2}
are the leads and lags from a judge election year. Given nearby election year Tist for judge
                       τ
i working at year t, Zist equals one for year T + τ . The sample is restricted to states with
elections, and only includes the last four years and first two years of a judge’s term (when


                                               38
the term length is longer than six). This means the coefficients can be interpreted as the
average within-judge log deviations in the performance variable relative to the fourth-to-last
year (t = T − 4) of a judge’s term.

                                    [FIGURE 3.2 HERE]

    This regression is run separately in states with contested and uncontested elections, and
performance trends are plotted separately in Figure 3.2. Consistent with the regression re-
sults, contested elections have a large effect on the number of majority and discretionary
opinions, and only a small effect on the table of cases length and on citations. In the uncon-
tested elections, meanwhile, there is no consistent trend in performance due to elections.
    These trend estimates further support the hypothesis that strong electoral incentives im-
pose time constraints, and that in response to those constraints judges reduce their time
spent on judging. This behavioral response mostly consists of reducing the number of opin-
ions written, rather than reducing opinion quality. These results are consistent with the
hypothesis that judges care more about the quality rather than the quantity of their opin-
ions.


8    Discussion
The goal of this paper has been to measure the causal effect of changes in employment
conditions on judicial behavior. Given that judges have low-powered incentives that do not
explicitly link pay to performance, a standard agency model would predict that reducing
incentive pressure would have no effect on behavior. The evidence is inconsistent with
that hypothesis; the reduction of time pressure is associated with longer, better-researched
opinions that are cited more often by later judges.
    When time pressure increases, judges prefer to reduce the number of opinions written
rather than compromise on quality. These findings are consistent with the view that judges
are professionals who care about the quality of their work, and that at the margin they prefer
to maintain high quality at the cost of lower quantity. This is consistent with a model in
which judges have an intrinsic desire to write high quality appellate opinions, tempered by
the cost of their time. Moreover, discretion over case selection – that is, the level of control
a judge has over his work material – appears to contribute to intrinsic motivation, consistent
with the early work of Deci (1971), and more recent theory on intrinsic motivation (Benabou
and Tirole, 2003; Prendergast, 2008; Rebitzer and Taylor, 2011).

                                              39
    State supreme court judges are a highly selected group of individuals, concluding a signif-
icant career in the law by serving in one of the most prestigious legal positions in their state.
The evidence supports the (perhaps unsurprising) claim that state supreme court judges
are motivated by professionalism (White, 1959; Wilensky, 1964). Because there are limited
prospects for promotion for state supreme court judges, the results are likely due to an in-
trinsic motivation to good work, or a concern for their professional legacy, rather than career
concerns (Dewatripont et al., 1999b; Francois, 2000; Prendergast, 2007). Extrinsic incentives
that impose time pressure reduce judge performance by crowding out intrinsic motivation
to do a good job, consistent with previous empirical work in other settings (Gneezy et al.,
2011).
    By demonstrating that judges care about their opinion output, this paper’s findings
strengthen previous empirical studies using features of judicial opinions to measure judicial
performance (e.g., Choi et al., 2010; Epstein et al., 2013). The results support the view that
both institutional rules and judge preferences are important inputs into a well-functioning
legal system, which might partly explain the significant cross-country variation in the quality
of legal systems (Djankov et al., 2003).
    The recent work in behavioral economics has demonstrated a great deal of variation in
individual preferences. In particular, this work has shown that the standard agency model’s
assumption that agents are motivated only by pecuniary returns is a (useful) simplification.23
It remains an open question the extent to which one could design institutions that select
individuals with particular social preferences, and in particular a preference to act in the
public interest.24 The evidence here suggests that state appellate court judges are one group
of officials where institutions do matter for selection of preferences.

A      Theory Appendix: Solution to Judge Optimization
       Problem
A.1     General Case
We consider first a general time allocation problem and then apply the solution to the
judge’s problem. There are n activities, indexed by i ∈ {1, .., n}. The time allocated to
each activity is given by Ti , with vector representation T~ = {T1 , ..., Tn }. Let T̄ > 0 be the
total time available. The gain from each activity is represented by Ui (Ti , αi )βi , with the
corresponding payoff function given by:

                                              n
                             u T~ , α
                                                X
                                    ~       =         βi log (Ui (Ti , αi )) ,             (A.1)
                                                i=1
                                                Xn
                                            =         βi ui (Ti , αi ) .                   (A.2)
                                                i=1


Note that since Ui is (weakly) concave in Ti , then ui is strictly concave in Ti (a strictly
concave function of a concave function is strictly concave). The sum of concave functions is


                                                  45
concave, so u(·) is concave in T~ . The agent faces the following time constraints:
                                         n
                                         X
                                               Ti ≤ T̄                                   (A.3)
                                         i=1
                                               Ti ≥ 0, ∀i.                               (A.4)

The objective is to allocate time across activities to maximize the payoff function subject to
these constraints. Since Ui (0, αi ) = 0, the non-negativity constraints are not binding and
we do not need to consider them.
    Existence and uniqueness follow from the standard concave optimization assumptions
over a compact, convex set. We can characterize the optimum using the first order conditions
for the Lagrangian:
                                                            n
                                                            !
                                              
                               L = u T~ , α
                                                            X
                                          ~ + µ T̄ −               Ti .
                                                             i=1

Let T~ ∗ (~
          α) denote the optimum, and let µ∗ (~
                                             α) be the associated Lagrange multiplier. The
first-order condition for Ti is given by

                                           ∂ui (Ti∗ , αi )
                              0 = LTi = βi                 − µ∗ .                        (A.5)

   Using the expression for the elasticity we have:

   Next we work out the comparative static conditions. Let J = ∇u be the Jacobian for u

order conditions can be written in matrix form:

                                    < 0. From (A.5) and the strict concavity of uj in Tj , we have                                    ∂αi

This implies that     < 0 for all j 6= i (as uj is strictly concave in Tj for all j). A similar

argument occurs if the sign is negative. This completes the proof of Proposition 1.

A.2.1      First Order Conditions

Let µJ be the multiplier for the time constraint. We can solve the problem by working out
the first order conditions given the multiplier, and then choosing the multiplier to ensure
the time constraint is satisfied. In this way µJ represents the price of time in the judging
sub-problem.
   The Lagrangian can be written as:

                       L = V0 +

      Next, the first order condition for the allocation of time to a case of difficulty γ is given
by:
                                                 Vt (t∗ (γ, µJ ) , γ) = µJ .                                         (A.12)

Notice that the time allocated per case does not vary directly with discretion dJ nor with
the case load NJ , only with the value of time (which in turn is affected by dJ ).
   We can see how time varies with the quality of a case since:

                                                              ∂ 2 V (t∗ (γ,µJ ),γ)
                                               ∂t∗
                                                   = − ∂ 2 V (t∂t∂γ
                                                               ∗ (γ,µ ),γ) > 0.
                                               ∂γ                    J
                                                                     ∂t∂t


Hence the time spent on cases increases with the importance of a case. Moreover, we also
have :
                                     ∂t∗ (γ, µJ )
                                                  < 0.
                                        ∂µJ

                                                                   48
As the price of time rises, the time spent per case falls.
   The next issue is the choice of cases to hear. The amount of time spent on a case depends
only on the quality of the case and the value of time. Hence we can write the net value of a
case with quality γ given optimal time t as:

                        ∆ (γ, µJ ) = V (t∗ (γ, µJ ) , γ) − µJ (t∗ (γ, µJ )) .

Now the Lagrangian can be written as:
                                   Z    ∞
                    L = dJ NJ               ∆ (γ, t∗ (γ, µJ ) , µJ ) h (γ) f (γ) dγ
                                    0
                                                 Z    ∞
                            + (1 − dJ ) NJ                ∆ (γ, t∗ (γ, µJ ) , µJ ) f (γ) dγ
                                                  0
                            +µJ TJ .

Notice that the Lagrangian is linear in h (γ) ∈ [0, 1], implying that:

  1. h∗ (γ, µJ ) = 0 if ∆ (γ, µJ ) < 0.

  2. h∗ (γ, µJ ) = 1 if ∆ (γ, µJ ) > 0.

Let us consider the case where the judge chooses to hear a subset of the cases over which
she has discretion. Since t∗ (γ, µJ ) is increasing in γ and ∆ (0, µJ ) = −c there is a unique
γ ∗ (µJ ) such that:
                                      ∆ (γ ∗ (µJ ) , µJ ) = 0,

in which case the judge chooses to hear the harder cases with γ ≥ γ ∗ (µJ ). What is interesting
is that the cases she chooses are only a function of the value of time µJ . Applying the envelope
theorem to A.12 and the implicit function theorem to the equation above we get:

                                 ∂γ ∗        t∗ (γ ∗ , µJ )
                                      =                            > 0.
                                 ∂µJ    Vγ (t∗ (γ ∗ , µJ ) , γ ∗ )

   As time becomes more scarce/expensive, the judge hears fewer cases (chooses a higher
threshold γ ∗ ).
   The total time spent on judging given the time cost µJ is given by:
                                                      Z   ∞

    Finally, notice that the monotonic transformation of the preferences VJ to (VJ − V0 ) /Nj
yields an objective function that is independent of NJ . Dividing the constraint by NJ we
see that:

A.2.2    Comparative Static Results

An increase in V0 increases UJ without affecting the marginal value of time in judging. Since
V0 does not affect the marginal utility of time, we have that

                                     ∂J (TJ , dJ , NJ )
                                                         < 0.
                                           ∂V0

which along with Proposition 1 implies the following:

Proposition 7. An increase in the prestige from being a judge (V0 ) reduces time allocated
to judging.

   The reason for this result is that an increase in prestige for judging increases the marginal
value of other activities, while having no effect on the marginal return from judging.

   At the optimum the utility is equal to the Lagrangian:

                                                                                   

   Namely, the multiplier gives us the marginal utility of time allocated to judging, which
multiplied by elasticity of judging βJ is equal to the overall price of time. As time be-
comes more expensive, then this multiplier is larger, which will have some clear predictions
regarding the allocation of time to cases.

which with proposition 1 implies that TJ falls. In particular, this implies that the cost of
time µ∗ falls, however the effect upon the time allocated to hard cases is ambiguous since:

                                                      dµ∗J   dµ∗         dUJ

The first term on the left is negative, while the second term is positive. This implies propo-
sition (5).
    Next observe that if we let

we can write the indirect utility from judging as:

                                                                     TJ

                                                                                 !

Given that the marginal returns do not vary with V0 , then for large V0 this term is positive,
but negative for small V0 . From this we have that

                                        ∂J (TJ , dJ , NJ )
                                                            > 0,
                                              ∂NJ

if and only if V0 is sufficiently large. This implies proposition (6).


B      Empirical Appendix: Construction of the Data Set
The judge performance data were collected from Bloomberg Law (bloomberglaw.com), which
has the data presented in a standard HTML format that is amenable to automated parsing.
Because scraping the data were disallowed by the Terms of Use, we had to hire undergrad
research help to manually download the cases and related metadata. We downloaded all
cases published at state courts of last resort between January 1, 1947 and December 31,
  25
     Let f (x) = V (x) − xVx (x), then fx = Vx − Vx − xVxx ≥ 0, while f (0) ≥ 0 and hence f (x) ≥ 0 for
x ≥ 0.

1994. Collection of the case data began in December 2011 and concluded in November 2013.
    The case data were matched to states and employment conditions from the name of the
court and from the date the case was published. The cases were matched to judges by the
name of the judge, using the list of judges that were working on the court at the time. When
all judges have different last names, this was done by last name. When two or more judges
had the same last name, we matched by first and last name. In the one case where there
were two judges with the same first and last name (Thomas M. Kavanagh and Thomas G.
Kavanagh of the Wisconsin Supreme Court), we matched on middle initial. To allow for
misspellings, we implemented a fuzzy string matching algorithm that would match to the
correct judge if one or two characters were misspelled.
    The case text files had fields for the opinion text as well as metadata attached by
Bloomberg staff attorneys. The opinion text was already divided between majority opinions
and supplemental opinions, which could be matched to judges the same way as majority
opinions. The opinion length measures included the number of words in the opinions after
having removed all HTML markup. Citations to previous case were already annotated, so
we could count those citations to construct the Table of Cases length measure.
    The citation counts were constructed from Bloomberg Law’s citation analysis feature,
which gives the full record of subsequent cases that have cited each decision. This includes
all state and federal court cases in the United States, up through December 2011 (when data
collection began). To generate out-of-state cites, we used the state where the citing court
was located (either state or federal).
    We loaded the case text and institutional variables into a PostgreSQL relational database.
A series of Python scripts interface with the Postgres database to parse the text, compute
performance measures, and merge with the institutional variables. We exported to CSV files
for statistical analysis in Stata.

Notes. Observation is a state-year. Intermediate Appellate Court is a dummy for state-years where the
court had an IAC operating. Real Salary is deflated by 1984 dollars. Number of Judges is the number
of judge positions on the court (rather than the number actually sitting due to vacancies). Term Length
is the number of years in between elections or reappointment. Nonpartisan Election, Partisan Elec-
tion, Uncontested Election, Governor Retention, Life Tenure, and Legislative Retention are dummies
for the methods of judge retention described in Section 4. Min Age Requirement is a dummy equaling
one in state-years that judges have to be above a certain age to join the court. Max Age Requirement is
a dummy for state-years that judges have a mandatory retirement age. Partial Discretion is a dummy
for having partial discretion in selecting cases for review. Mandatory Review is a dummy for having to
review all cases. This leaves 44.4% of the state-years left over for discretionary review.

Notes. Kernel density estimate of case citations by the number of years between the original case and
the citing case, using the Epanechnikov kernel with bandwidth=1. Includes all cases. Vertical line
indicates median delay of 10 years. The kink in the distribution at 18-19 years reflects that our case
data ends in 1994 and citations go through 2012.

from a separate regression that includes a year fixed effect. The treatment variable is a dummy for the ten years after a policy change, and the effect is relative to
a baseline that includes the ten years before and after the policy change. Columns 1 through 3 report aggregate effects. Columns 4a and 4b report the baseline
treatment effect (4a) interacted with a dummy for limited discretion over case selection (4b).

restricted to judge-years with at least 10 published cases. Columns 1a and 1b include the bottom 5 cases, and
Columns 2a and 2b include the top 5 cases, for each judge-year as ranked by the number of positive citations. Each
regression includes a year fixed effect, judge fixed effect, and state trend. The baseline effect is a dummy for the
ten years after a policy change, and the effect is relative to a baseline including the ten years before and after the
policy change. Columns 1a and 2a report the baseline treatment effect, which is interacted with a dummy for
limited discretion over case selection (1b and 2b).

Notes. Plotted coefficients obtained from regression of the performance variable on indicators for two
years before and after a re-election event, relative to three years before the re-election event.
Regressions include judge fixed effects. Error bands indicate 90% confidence intervals using standard
errors clustered by judge. Table 1.2 lists states by retention system.
