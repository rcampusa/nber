              The Impact of the Market and the Family
               on Youth Enrollment and Labor Supply


                           ABSTRACT

     This paper analyzes the school enrollment and labor
supply   decisions of teenagers and young adults as jointly deter-

mined outcomes. The empirical results are based on an application
of discrete multivariate analysis to a sample taken from the

Survey of Income and Education. Higher relative wage offers
are found to reduce the probability of a youth enrolling in school

and to increase labor supply. However, the estimated impacts are
very sensitive to adjustments made for the possibility that wage
rate offers by         are higher for full-time than for part-time

work. Job availability, as measured by the local youth unemploy-
ment rate, has its strongest effect on the probability of enroll-

ment and full—time labor force participation for nonwhite males,

accounting, in the extreme, for a difference in this probability

of almost 50 percent. Since a wage measure is included as an
independent variable, we can be sure that the job availability

measure is not acting as a surrogate for an absent wage variable,

but instead has an impact of its own. Specific findings on the
influence of various family and market characteristics are compared

to those from earlier studies.

      This paper analyzes the separate influences of the labor market and the

family on the school enrollment and labor supply decisions of teenagers and

young adults. For a sample drawn from the 1976 Survey of Income and Education,

the analysis considers explicitly two market signals pertaining to the rela-

tive reward for participation by the youth in the labor market. These are:

(i) the wage, and (ii) the youth unemployment rate in the relevant local labor

market, which is used as a measure of job availability. Data reflecting each

family's socio—economic circumstances are also used in the analysis. As a re-

sult1 it is possible to examine directly the impact of the family on the

youth's decisions and to separate this from the impact of the labor market

characteristics. This permits us to discern, among other things the added

worker and discouraged worker effects.

      Decisions as to whether to participate in school and/or the labor force

are qualitative in nature and are jointly determined. The empirical portion

of the study uses discrete multivariate analysis, a relatively new statistical

technique suitable for analyzing jointly—determined qualitative decisions, to

estimate youth enrollment and labor supply functions. In a separate paper

(Steinmeier, 1979), it is demonstrated formally that multinoimial logit analy-

sis applied to analyze an identically specified model would generate identical

results. However, in the context of our problem, multinomial logit analysis

would be more expensive to use and more difficult to apply than discrete multi—

variate analysis.

      While other studies have been concerned with various aspects of the

school enrollment—labor supply decision, there is no single set of estimates

which: (a) incorporates information on the youth, the youth's family, and the

market; (b) considers the roles of both job availability and the wage; and
                                       —2—



Cc) uses econometric tools that would be viewed today as being appropriate for

analyzing these enrollment and labor supply decisions. As a result, the find-

ings of these past studies—-many of which were conducted before appropriate

analytical tools were developed—-are likely to be biased, either because they

used inappropriate techniques (e.g., OLS to analyze qualitative outcomes) or

because the enrollment or labor supply relations were not fully specified, sub-

jecting parameter estimates to specification bias.1 To provide an indication

of how serious these biases may be, our findings are compared in detail with

those from the most complete and important of the earlier studies, Bowen and

Finegan's pathbreaking work (1969) and the aithitious effort by Cohen, Rea, and

Lerman (1970) .   Comparisons with results from other studies are also presented.

while there are differences between our study and     earlier   ones in the periods

covered, variable definitions, and   other   factors, all of which lead us to ex-

pect some differences in results, a major purpose of this study is to highlight

those areas where quantitative estimates differ very significantly from those

reported elsewhere. Equally important, it is of interest to discover which

findings from earlier studies persist.

      For   those who work, we also attempt to discover how family background
and market conditions influence the propensity for part-time vs. full—time

      1
        To the extent that downwardly rigid wages prevent the youth labor mar-
ket from clearing, one would expect both wages and job availability to influ-
ence labor supply. If one of these measures is not included in explaining
labor supply, the coefficient estimated for the other measure may, for well
known reasons, be biased. In addition, in the alternative circumstance in
which the youth labor market does clear,     if
                                            the wage is not included as an in-
dependent variable and standardized for statistically, one might find that a
measure of job availability-—such as the proportion of industries in a com-
munity that normally employ teenagers—-is significantly related to the quan-
tity of labor supplied. Unless the wage is held constant, findings with re-
spect to demand related factors which normally influence the quantity of labor
supplied by operating through the wage rate may erroneously suggest that job
availability plays an independent role in influencing labor supply.

participation, and how this is related to the enrollment decision. Consider,

for example, the potentially conflicting effects of job availability on school

enrollment and the interrelation with part—time employment. On the one hand,

if jobs are readily available to young people, youth from poor families may be

able to enroll in school, supporting themselves through part—time work. With

no jobs available, some may be unable to afford school expenditures and may

drop out (Bowen and Finegan, 1969, p. 404). On the other hand, readilyavaila—

ble employment opportunities for youth may simply raise the probability of

dropping out of school and working full—time. Our findings will help to deter-

mine how young people react to this influence and to other influences of the

market.

        Much of the public concern about the operation of the youth labor market

has focused on the very high unemployment rates for nonwhites and the impact

of these high rates on minority youth. In view of this concern, and also in

view of the likelihood that the labor supply and enrollment functions may be

different for young men from those for young women, we fit   separate   functions

for   those in each race—sex category and highlight the differences among the
groups. While much work remains to be done, it is our hope that this paper
will take policy—makers   a step closer to having the kind of estimates of en-

rollment and   youth labor supply functions that can be used to isolate the ef-
fects of   the market and the family on the youth's enrollment and labor supply

decisions. such estimates are required if policy—makers are to distinguish

the impacts of current youth-oriented labor market programs from those of mar-

ket forces, and if they are to be able to predict the impact of proposed poli-

cies.

        We begin by sketching a theoretical framework which builds on the time

in the household approach. A second section discusses the empirical specifi—
                                        —4—



cation and the estimation techniques used. The empirical results in Section

III analyze the influence of the market and the family on the enrollment and

labor supply of the over 18,000 young people in the sample and compare the re-

sults to those from other major studies of youth enrollment and labor supply.

A concluding section discusses the relation of these results to current policy.



                             1. Theoretical Framework

        The analytical framework builds directly on Gronaus (1977) recent model

of the allocation of time. The youth is assumed to be the decision-maker, but

the family influences the youth's decisions through a number of channels.

Utility is determined according to the following function:


                V v(Z[(X +
                              XP[HH])1HL]IZFIEOJHJIE[EZHJ,Fam)                    (1)



To preserve space, a number of structural relations discussed in more detail

in Gustman and Steinmeier (.1979) have been collapsed into V. The function Z

represents   current commodities produced by purchased goods (X) , by goods (xv)
produced    from time spent in the household (H). and by leisure time (FIL)   .




is   a function representing the current value of commodities to be produced in

future periods. It is assumed that commodities will be produced in future pe-

riods so as to generate optimal investment, production in the household, and

consumption patterns in all periods after the one under observation. The

amount of future goods available is a function of total education accumulated

up to the beginning of the period of observation (E0) and time devoted in this

period to educational activities (HE) which together determine the amount of

human capital inputs to the earnings function in futur periodsJ Education


        1
        Educational inputs purchased might also be included in H. But to do
so requires us to consider the price of educational goods. There is no con-
venient measure of the price of educational goods available for use in the em-
pirical analysis.

    (E) is also assumed to influence independently the level of utility. Finally,

    Pam represents the influence of family characteristics. Family characteris-

    tics influence each of the commodity production functions listed, the youth's

    preferences and knowledge of the available choice set. They may also play a

    role because the youth cares about the family and may alter behavior in accor-

    dance with the family's circumstances.' For convenience of presentation, Pam

    has been included only once in Equation (1)

          Equation (2) represents the time constraint facing the youth. It is as-

    sumed that T, total discretionary time availabler is constant.



                               T=HN+HH+HE+HL.                                  (2)



    The other budget constraint pertains to goods:


•                               P'X =               + I.                       (3)
                                        W•F(HNfU)

    P is the price of all goods (X) purchased in the market; W is the wage rate;2

       is the hours in the labor force; U is the unemployment rate; and I is other



          1
            One possibility suggested by Ehrenberg and Marcus (1979) is that there
    is a minimun contribution to the family required of young people from poor
    households. Such a requirement may modify either the utility function, the
    budget constraint, or both. If this effect is important, they note that,
    where jobs are scarce, a young person who might otherwise work part—time and
    attend school might be forced to drop out and look for work full-time. Gold-
    farb and yeazer's analysis, which utilizes a Stone-Geary specification for the
    utility function, is consistent with this view. Our empirical analysis in-
    cludes a test for the presence of the interaction effects between family in-
    come and the local area unemployment rate which are implied by two hypotheses,
    but the interaction is fcund not to be significant.
          2
            Rosen (1976) has shown how to incorporate into the analysis a wage
    that varies with hours supplied. He includes a measure of the total earnings
    associated with different amounts of time spent at work rather than just using
    the wage rate to explain time supplied to market work. Such an adjustment
    would complicate but not change the thrust of the theoretical model. Accord-
    ingly, at this point we assume the wage is invariant with hours. To examine
    the importance of this assumption, the empirical analysis utilizes as an al-
    ternative to the observed wage an adjusted wage which is calculated at a par-
    ticular amount of hours worked.

income. For a young person, much of I is expected to take the form of trans-

fer income from and to ether members of the family.1

         Time that is actually spent in market work, generating income at the

wage rate of w is measured by F(ENIU) ,       which is less than      The difference

between time supplied to the labor market and time spent at work is accounted

for by time spent unemployed, either in job search or idle time. Since some

labor force time is spent in activities that do not generate income, the like-

lihood of spending some fraction of labor force time in unemployment reduces

the expected returns from labor force time.2 Accordingly, when optimal decisions

are calculated, the attractiveness of labor force participation may be èx-

pected to vary       inversely   with the unemployment rate. While many approaches

may be taken to modeling the role of unemployment as it affects job choice,

the simple specification in Equations (1), (2), and        (3) captures the spirit of
the discouraged worker effect as visualized in the labor force participation

literature.3 However, in view of the siinplifications involved, no assumption

         1
        A more elaborate analysis would allow transfers to vary with educa-
tional choice. This would reflect both a family's willingness to finance edu-
cational but not other types of expenditures, and the availability of govern-
mental and other loans only to those who are enrolled in school. Another
extension would incorporate the linkage between future earnings and desired
current period consumption (see Gustman [19731 and Custman and Stafford [1972]).
         2
        The probability of a new entrant obtaining a job will depend on the
unemployment rate and on turnover of those who are already employed. If, for
any given unemployment rate, turnover is high enough so that unemployment is
shared by all those who are in the market, the unemployment rate may provide a
direct indication of the fraction of labor force time that a typical individual
will spend unemployed (Grainlich [1976]). For an analysis which considers the
interrelations between the minimum wage, job turnover, unemployment, and the
likelihood of securing a job, see Mincer (1976)

             The model could be further modified to consider own unemployment as a
state    that involves (dis)utility that is differcnL from abc disutility of work-
ing. The differential productivity of search from unemployment rather than
search       from employment might also be considered.
                                     —7—



is made about the specific functional form of F and therefore about how unem-

ployment time varies with total time committed to the labor force.1

       Maximization of (1) with respect to the uses of time (HN UHr 'E' and

HL)f the quantity of goods purchased (X) , and Langrangian multipliers repre-

senting the marginal utility of time and money, subject to Equations (2) and

(3), yields a system of reduced form equations for each of the various uses of

tine and goods purchased.2 The equations we focus on are those for time spent

on educational activities (HE). and time supplied to the market (HN)   These

are:



                           UN = HN(Famfw;PfUfI;EO)                             (4)




                           HE = HE(FamW,PfUtI$EO)                              (5)



       Consider now the role of stochastic elements in the model. Clearly,

utility functions are not the same, even for youths with the same set of ob-

servable characteristics. Differences in tastes for work and education arise

from factors we cannot measure, and the sane is true for the kind and amount

of parental advice. These factors serve to introduce stochastic elements into

       1
        In an analysis of the effect of unemployment on labor supply, Rea
(1974) assumes that unemployment time is not a function of time spent in the
labor force.   -




       2
        This procedure assumes rational decision—making on the part of the
youth. A number of objections may be raised to this assumption. One is that,
despite the intuitively appealing nature of the marginal conditions for maxi-
mization, the calculations required are too difficult for it to be assumed
that the "as if" hypothesis can legitimately be adopted. Another objection is
that in some cases the youth's activities may conflict so obviously with his
or her own self-interest that defending the rationality assumption involves
the tautological argument that if the youth acted in a particular way, there
is some goal that he or she had in mind which was being maximized. On the
other hand, it is our judgment that by using the analytical framework sug-
gested by the theory in combination with the (relatively flexible) statistical
technique we employ, which does not require narrow assumptions as to func-
tional form, there is a smaller probability that the results will be contami-
nated by serious specification error than if any available alternative ap-
proach is taken.

any parameterization of the utility function. Furthermore, there may be some

unmeasured constraints that vary from family to family, such as difference in

the conditions upon which income is transferred from the parents to the youth.

         As a result of these unseen random factors, HN and HE are not completely

determined by the observed explanatory variables in Equations (4) and (5) (al-

though they may be completely determined by some larger set of observed and

unobserved explanatory variables). Rather, HN and HE have a probability dis-

tribution for any particular set of values of the observed explanatory varia-

bles. The relation that we estimate is


                            Prob(HNJHE) = F(Fam,W,P,tJ),                      (6)



where the dependent variable is the joint probability that a youth works HN

hours and goes to school HE hours. The estimation procedure (to be discussed

below) does not require us to specify the functional form of F in Equation

(6). For consistent parameter estimates, however, the usual assumption that

the stochastic errors are uncorrelated with the explanatory variables is neces—

5 ary.


         In addition to the introduction of stochastic elements, the transition

from Equations (4) and (5) to Equation (6) involves two other changes. First

since there is no information on the nature of intrafamily transfers which

make up the bulk of the youth's income (I), it is assumed that I is a function

of family income and background. Therefore, the variable I does not appear

directly in Equation (6). The second difference is that E0 does not appear in

Equation (6)'. It is assumed that past family and market circumstances persist

sufficiently over time so that it is possible to substitute iteratively for

enrollment in each of the past years. The role of past enrollment outcomes is

then approximated by writing them as functions of current measured family and
                                          —9—



local market characteristics. The reason we adopt this procedure is that at

least some youths may make a single lifetime educational decision. If this is

so, E and the dependent enrollment variable will be simultaneously determined.

Substituting iteratively for F0 permits us to avoid the problems that arise if

F0 is endogenous to the decision—making process.1



              II. Empirical Specification and the Estimation Procedure

         The Survey of Income and Education (Sn) is a large cross—section survey

built around questions from the Current Population Survey. The sample was

taken    from April through July of 1976. We work with      observations for over

18,000   young people who live in one of the 98 largest SMSA's and who do not
have   a health problem. For this group, the survey identifies the name of the

SMSA, which allows us to calculate relevant labor market measures and to in-

corporate them into the analysis, and hence to estimate the separate influences

of the market and the family.

        Activities of young people that are of interest to us can, for conveni-

ence, be divided into six mutually exclusive categories. The first major divi-

sion indicates whether or not the youth was enrolled in school after February 1,

1976. Those enrolled in school fall into one of three categories; those who

were not in the labor force in 1975, those      who were in the labor force for 20
weeks or     less (many summer—only workers will fall in this category) , and those

who   were in the labor force for more than 20 weeks. For those not enrolled in
school after February 1, 1976, the three categories are: in the labor force

             Evidence that the distribution of unemployment rates among areas per-
sists over time so that current area unemployment rates provide an indication
of relative unemployment in a market in past periods is presented by Bowen and
Finegan. For a further discussion, see Hall (1970) and also Holt (1978)

last   year for less than 100   hours,   in the labor force last year for 100   to
                                                                            1
1200 hours, and in the labor force last year for more than 1200 hours.

        The independent variables are categorical. Limits for each category

are chosen to correspond to conunorily used classification terms (e.g., less

than high school education, high school graduate, etc.) and/or to generate a

relatively even number of observations in each category. Independent varia-

bles pertaining to the family are as follows:

                The level of family income exclusive of the youth's own earnings:
                      i:l         <$10,000
                                  $l0.000—l7,500
                      Y:3         $17,S00—25,000
                                  >$ 25 , 000


                The education of the head of the youth's family:
                     PE:1         less than a H.S. graduate
                     PE:2         11.5. graduate

                                  one
                                  two



       1
        Note that since the sample was taken in the months from April through
July, including time when students may be looking for or engaged in summer
work, current status during the month of the survey may be a particularly mis-
leading indicator of the activities pursued by the youth over the course of
the year. Therefore, we have focused on time spent in the labor force last
year (1975) .It should be noted that we decided to base the part—time labor
force measure for students on weeks worked last year rather than on hours
worked because of the problem in interpreting the answer to the usual hours
pet week question for students who work, both during the summer and part—time
while in school.

      The enrollment question does not refer to exactly the same time period
as the time in the labor force question. Since there is no information on en-
rollment status during the past year, some people may be classified as having
part—time labor force commitment when in fact their commitment was full—time.
For example, those who went to work on a full—time basis after leaving school
in June 1975, but who did not work while in school, will not have worked more
than 26 weeks last year and most likely will not be enrolled after February 1,
1976. Therefore, they are likely to fall into the not in school, 100 to 1200
hours in the labor force category.

                     A:2         19—20
                     A:3         21—22

        We use two measures pertaining to conditions in the labor market, the

wage of the youth relative to the average wage for high school graduates over

25 in the SNSA and the probability of finding a job as reflected in a youth

specific     unemployment rate. The four categories for the wage measure are:
                     w:l         <0.296
                     W:2         0.296—0.438
                     W:3         0.4380.627
                     W:4         >0.627
The numerator of the youth wage variable is calculated as the ratio of the
youth's earnings to the product of the usual hours worked per week and the
number of weeks worked in 1975. These calculated wage rates for youth are

then divided by a fixed weight measure of the average adult wage rate in the

city    where the young person lives.2
        Youth unemployment in the   area   is measured by a fixed weight index using

national weights calculated according to age, race, and sex, and is estimated

as the ratio of time spent undmployed to time spent in the labor force in



         1
        Those who were 16 at the time of the survey are excluded because they
were 15 during some part of 1975. Legal limitations on the kind of jobs they
can hold and school attendance requirements restrict the freedom of fifteen—
year—olds to choose between work and schooling options.
         2
        The deflated wage variable measures the relative reward to working
while still a youth. The adult wage rate reflects, at least in part, inter-
area differences in the cost of living. Accordingly, we do not, as called for
by Equation (6), also deflate by an index of cost of living (F)

1975. There are three categories for the unemployment variable:'

                      nil        <16.4%
                      U:2        12.2—16.4%
                      U:3        >12.2%

        Econometric estimates used in this study are based on the discrete mul-

tivariate algorithm developed by Goodman (1968, 1971) and others for dealing

with a model consisting of categorical dependent and independent variables.

Bishop, Feinberg, and Holland (1975) discussed the approach in detail. Using

this technigue we are able to estimate the effects of variation in the inde-

pendent variables specified above on the probability that a youth falls in a

given school enrollment—labor supply category. It may be shown that the dis-

crete multivariate algorithm maximizes exactly the same likelihood function as

does the standard multinomial logit algorithm, and hence the two sets of esti-

mates must be equivalent.2 We chose to use discrete multivariate analysis be-

cause it is flexible-—i.e., it requires no rigid assumption about functional

form—-and is a relatively inexpensive technique to use for analyzing very large

data sets in a situation where there are only a few explanatory variables)

        1
        Similar results are obtained when an alternative measure of area unem-
ployment——one based on the rate of unemployment at the time of the SIB survey——
is used.
       2
        The equivalence requires that the full set of interactions among the
explanatory variables (but not involving the dependent variable) be included in
the discrete multivariate model; see Steinmeier (1979) . The algorithm actually
used in the study assumes that family characteristics are only weakly corre-
lated with area labor market characteristics so that some third—order and
higher interactions between these two groups of independent variables are ig-
nored. All second—order interactions are considered, however.

        In a report upon which this paper is based (Gustean and Steinmeier,
1979), for purposes of example, we solved the model specified in Equations (1)
through (3) , assuming simple Cobb—Douglas-type production and utility functions.
It   is clear   from this exercise that the underlying relations are nonlinear. An
estimating technique which uses categorical explanatory variables, as discrete
multivariate analysis does, facilitates an analysis of nonlinear relations.
l4oreover, discrete multivariate analysis facilitates the study of interactions
among independent variables, which we expect to occur.

        In discrete multivariate analysis, the central statistic is U2, which is

—2 times the log-likelihood function:



                                    =   -2         •
                                             i=l


where      is the probability predicted by the model for a combination of values

from the actual data, and i runs over all possible combinations of variables.

Estimating an additional effect (or interaction) will tend to reduce U2, and

the significance of the effect is inferred from the size of the reduction. Un-

der the hypothesis of no true effect, an additional estimated effect will yield

a AG2 which has a        distribution with the degrees of freedom equal to the

number of additional independent parameters introduced by the effect- If the

AG2 is above the appropriate critical point on the              distribution, the effect

(or interaction) is deemed to have a significant impact on the dependent varia-

ble. Thus, the A@2      statistic   tests the joint significance of a group of dummy

variables defining the categories of an explanatory variable. A value of the

AG2 statistic pertaining to the relation between the indicated independent

variable and the set of enrollment-labor force outcomes is reported, where ap-

propriate, in the last column of the tables in Section III.

        There are two missing data problems which the econometric procedure must

accommodate.      The first pertains to       the wage rate for those who did not work

last   year.    For those youths, the distribution of potential wage rates is taken

from an earnings function based on age, sex, race, and labor market (i.e.,

SMSA), and     estimated from those who did work.        A major concern in following

this procedure is that those who did not work are different from those who did

in a   systematic fashion that will lead to the results being contaminated by se-
lectivity bias.      However, tests for selectivity bias indicate that it is not a
                                       —14—




significant problem.'

      The second data problem arises because if a young person has either dis-

continued schooling and left home or has married and left home, characteris-

tics pertaining to the youth's parents' household are not reported. This prob-

lem is not very serious for the younger members of the group we are concerned

with, especially because the SIE reports family characteristics for young peo-

ple who are not married but are in schools away from home. However, for the

older cohorts, a larger fraction of observations in the sample have no data re-

ported on parental family characteristics. Since a youth is unlikely to leave

home and school without a means of support, those with missing information are

more likely than average to be working, at least in the case of male youth.2

      Given that information on fanily characteristics is missing, one of two

courses can be taken. The analysis can be limited to those for whom a full set

of data is available. The problem with following this course is that since the

young people who leave their parents' home are likely to be those able to sup-

port themselves, while some who remain home cannot, the effect of independent

variables on school—work choice is conditional on remaining at home. Hence,

quest. For a discussion of selectivity bias, see Heckman (19-74, 1976) and

        The percentage of the entire population with missing data is reported
in the following table.

the   findings would be difficult to interpret and not representative for a typi-
cal   youth in the population. Alternatively, it is possible to estimate the

distribution of family background variables for those for whom no data are re-

ported. Estimates can be obtained by assuming that parental family income,

education, and structure are the same for the younger cohorts, for whom family

data are available for almost everyone, as they are for the older cohorts, for

whom we have family data on only a sthsetj The distribution of family charac-

teristics for the subset of the older cohort with no data reported can then be
estimated as the difference between (a) the characteristics for the      entire

older cohort, as projected from the younger cohort, and (b) the family charac-

teristics for the subset of the older cohort for whom we do have data. In

practice, we use discrete multivariate analysis to estimate separate distribu-

tions   for the younger cohorts and for those in the older cohorts who remain
home.       After adjusting for size differences among the cohorts, the probability

distribution for those with missing data is calculated as the difference. This

method of projection, which is roughly analogous to using averages for missing

observations in OLS, is not without its problems,2 but projecting the missing

data and including all observations appears to be a better choice than simply

eliminating from the sample all those who left, home.



        1
        This assumption cannot, in practice, be fully justified. For example,
the number of families with two parents may be lower for 20—year—olds than for
17—year--olds because the parents of 20—year-olds are older and more of them
are likely to have died. Nevertheless, in our calculations we assume as an
approximation that the distribution of family characteristics is the same for
younger and older cohorts.
        2
        As a result of this procedure, the effects of family background charac-
teristics may be biased downward, especially for older youth who have left home
in greater numbers. Experimentation indicates that the estimated effect of
market factors on labor supply and enrollment is not very sensitive to the as-
sumptions made about the relation between family income, labor supply, and en-
rollment within the group that has left home.

                                III. Empirical Results

         The empirical results are organized in the following way. First, Table

1 summarizes the effects of personal characteristics——age, race, and sex——on

the probability of falling into one of the schooling-labor force groups speci-

fied. The probabilities presented in Table 1 are calculated for what we will

call a reference youth-—that is, a youth from a family with chosen characteris-

tics facing reference level labor market conditions.1 Specifically, the refer-

ence youth is assumed to be from a family with an income that is in the second

category ($lO,000—$l7,500) ,     to   have a family head with an education level that

is in the second category (high school graduate) /       to   be from a two—parent f am—

ily, and to be from a family with a head who is employed. This reference youth

faces a wage offer that falls in the second category (30          to 44 percent   of the

average      adult wage) and lives in an SNSA with a youth unemployment rate that
falls in the middle category (l3.6l7.6 percent). It is important to remember
that these data are not simple cross-tabs, but compare probabilities for dif-
ferent age, race, and sex groups holding family background and labor market
characteristics constant,. Tables 2A through 2F, which are presented later in

this section, examine the effects of variation of each of the independent

variables      on the probability of a youth falling into one of the work—schooling
categories.
      The first six columns of each table refer to the joint probabilities of
a youth falling into one of the six school enrollment—labor force categories
defined above. The remaining six columns of probabilities are derived from
the joint probabilities presented in the first six columns. Columns 7 and 8
refer to the marginal (i.e., unconditional) probabilities of school enrollment

         1
             The actual parameters estimated, which underlie the probabilities pre-
sented in each of the tables in the text, are available from the authors on re-
quest.
                                         —17—




and labor force participation, respectively. Columns 9 through 12 deal with

the conditional probabilities of being in the labor force or in school. Col—

umn   10, for example, considers the probability of labor force participation,
given that the individual is not enrolled in school.
         The conditional probabilities are computed primarily for purposes of
comparison with earlier studies. Many who dealt with this issue previously
did   not have the techniques of multinoimial logit or discrete multivariate ana-

lysis available to them, and instead took the approach of analyzing conditional

distributions.       As the discussion of Bowen and Finegan indicates, however, the

parameters of conditional distributions are by themselves tricky to interpret.2

To illustrate, consider the effect of higher family income on labor force par-

ticipation conditional on being in school. This effect is composed of two

parts;       (i) For each person who was in school at the lower income level, the

higher income level changes the probability that he or she will be in the labor

force.       (ii) The higher family income may cause some people who were not en-

rolled originally to become enrolled. They may have had a much different pro-

pensity to be in the labor force, and the fact that they are now in the

         1
        Three recent papers apply the multinomial logit technique to data from
the National Longitudinal Survey. One analyzes the joint determination of
school enrollment and labor force participation (Pates and Mellow, 1978); an-
other, changes in enrollment and employment status (Stephenson, 1978) . Neither
study includes a direct measure of the wage in examining market impact. The
third study (Ehrenberg and Marcus, 1979) investigates the effect of minimum
wage laws on employment and enrollment status. Notice that employment status
is an outcome of supply and demand interactions. Our ooncern is with the sup-
ply side relationship where the quantity measure pertaining to the labor market
is time supplied to the market.
         2
        Bowen and Finegan essentially combine a labor supply function condi-
tional on enrollment status with a marginal equation describing the determi-
nants of enrollment to derive a joint probability of labor force participation
and enrollment status. Lerman (1972) takes an analogous approach to explain-
ing enrollment behavior. However1 while he discusses the determinants of en-
rollment status for youth conditional on labor market status, he combines that
with an analysis of labor market status conditional on enrollment status.
                                       —18--




enrolled group will affect the conditional probability under consideration.

These two effects, which Bowen and Finegan call a "pure" effect and a "shift"

effect, are muddled in a conditional distribution, with the result that the

parameters of an estimated conditional distribution cannot be interpreted as

the marginal effect of an explanatory variable on the probability of a typical

individual being in the labor force.'


A. The Probabilities for the Reference Youths

        Consider now the basic probabilities for the reference youth in the dif-

ferent age, race, and sex categories as reported in Table 1. It can be seen

from the data in Column 7 that the probability of enrolling in school declides

with age. The probability of enrolling in school is roughly the same for non-

white and white males, and, other things the same, it is lower for white fe—

males than for nonwhite females.2 With regard to labor force participation,



        Among those who analyze a conditional distribution, it is not uncommon
to do so simply by including enrollment status as an independent variable.
This approach assumes that explanatory factors have the same impact on work ac-
tivities by students and nonstudents. See, for example, Katz (1970).
        2
       We should note that the same market-wide measure of job availability—-
a weighted average unemployment rate for all age, race, and sex groups-—implies
different levels of job availability for each group, especially for whites and
nonwhites. The level of job availability for nonwhites associated with a given
category of the unemployment measure we use is much lower than it is for whites.
This can be seen in the following table.

the rates shown in Column 8 are always higher for whites than for nonwhites

and for males than females. Labor force participation increases with age ex-

cept for a slight downturn for 21—22—year—old white females. From Columns 9

and 10 it can be seen that for males, labor force participation rates for
those   enrolled in school are always below participation rates for the not en-

rolled, while this is not always so for females.

        One category of our dependent variable bears a special relation to a

masure stressed by 8owen and Finegan. They were interested in what they called

the activity rate-—the ratio of those either in school or in the labor force to

the total population. The activity rate is equal to one minus the probability

of being observed in the not enrolled-not in labor force category. We report

this latter probability in Column   4.
        The probability of falling in the not enrolled, full—time in the labor

force category increases with age for the four sex-race groups (Column 6)

Nonwhite youth with reference level characteristics have a much lower proba-

bility of falling in the not enrolled, full-time in the labor force category

than   do comparable white youth. White males are, in comparison with all but
younger nonwhite females, less likely than those in the other groups to be not

enrolled, part—time in the labor force (Column 5). With the exception of older

white males, the probability of falling in this category increases with age for

all groups.


13. Effects of Variation in the Independent Variables

        The following six tables report on the effects of variation in the basic

family and labor market characteristics on the probability that a youth will

fall within each of the work—schooling categories, Specifically, the numbers

reported in each column are the differences in the respective probabilities if

    the   characteristic under consideration alternately takes on the highest arid

    lowest possible values. All other relevant independent variables are held at

    the level designated for the reference group. Note that the AG2 statistic re-

    ported in Column 13 refers to all main and higher order effects, and tests for

    any relationship between the independent variable and the complete set of six

    outcomes for the dependent variable.


             (1) Family Income. The first thing to notice is the effect of family in-

    come on the joint probability of enrolling and participating in the labor force

    (Columns 2 and 3) and of not enrolling but participating (Columns 5 and 6)

    Those with highest family income have a much higher joint probability of en-

    rollment arid participating and a much lower joint probability of being in the

    labor force and not in school than do those with lowest family income. As a

    result, it can be seen that, for all but younger white females, differences in

    family income have a bigger impact on the (marginal) probability of enrolling
•
    (Column 7) than on the (marginal) probability of participating in the labor

    force (Column 8). Indeed, while for other groups the probability of partici-

    pating in the labor force is positively related to family income, it has vir-
-

    tually    no relation for white males. The effect of family income on the proba-

    bility of participating is smaller than the effect on enrollment because stu-

    dents who work part—time are counted in the labor force with equal weight with

    nonstudents who work full-time year—around. The strongest effect of family in-

    come is for youths who are 19 or older, whose schooling decisions pertain to

    levels    of oclucation beyond tho cusbomary minimum expected of ll young people,
    and thus whose choices are not as constrained by social pressures as are the
    choices of 17— and l8—year—olds. Higher family income is also associated with
    a lower probability of being both not enrolled and not in the labor force (Col-
    umn 4).

      A positive relation between family income and   time   spent in the labor

force might be the result of a number of factors——e.g., a relation between

family income and the work ethic, the youth's preferences, and/or between fam-

ily income and family connections, which make it easier to locate a jobJ

Note also the indication in Table 2A that the effect of family income on en-

rollment is much more pronounced for minority than for majority youth.2 What

happens to those young people who would be enrolled had they been from high

income families, but who are not enrolled because their family incomes are

low? An examination of Columns 4-6 indicates that for whites, these youths

tend to be mostly in the labor force full—time; very few seem to fall into the

part—time participation or nonparticipation categories. For nonwhites, how-

ever, the story is somewhat different. For them, almost equal numbers of

youths from low income families end up in the part-time participation category

as in the full—time participation category, and a substantial fraction go into

the nonparticipation category.

      In comparing the results of Table 2A to those from other studies, it

should be remembered that the family income variable and the covered sample in

our study are different from those of earlier ones. Specifically, our family

income variable always refers to the income of the parents' family. Most ear-

lier studies either used a combined measure of family income which referred to

the parents' family if the youth lived at home or to the youth's, and perhaps

the spouse's earnings if the youth lived away from home, or they confined the

sample so that only those still living with their parents were included (as in

      1
        flowen and Finegan, in examining the role played by family connections,
found that young people whose parents are employed in sales occupations are
more likely to be employed themselves. See, however, Bees and Gray (1979)
      2
        In contrast, Lerman's (1972, p. 376) results suggest that family income
had the same effect on enrollment for minority and for majority youth.

Bowen and Finogan's analysis of 14- to 17—year-old enrolled youth)

       The conditional probabilities f rpm our study indicate, first, that con-

ditional on being enrolled in school, labor force participation is higher for

those from families with highest incomes, but is only barely so for white

males. Cohen, Rea, and Lerman applied ordinary least squares analysis to a

sample consisting of 16— to 2l—year-olds living in the 96 largest S1SPi'S.

Their results and ours agree (see their Table G-ll, which is most comparable)

       Bowen and Finegan analyzed labor force participation for 18— to 24-year—

olds enrolled in school. But they were not satisfied with the income variable

and were suspicious of the results. For l4—17—year—olds enrolled, they find

nonmonotonic effects of income. Labor force participation over part of the

range increased with income. Eventually, however, participation for highest

income youth fell below that for those in the lowest income classes. While

our full results pertaining to the variation of participation with each of the

four income categories are not reported here, only for enrolled white males do

we find a nonmonotonic pattern similar to the one reported in Bowen and Fine—

gan.

       Our calculations of labor force participation rates conditional on non-

enrollment status are presented in Column 10. Bowen and Finegan find no im-

portant impact of family income for this group (p. 4l5), which is the way we

would characterize the results for white males. However, Cohen, Rea, and Icr—

man find a negative impact on participation (Table G—ll)

       Our findings in Columns 11 and 12 point to strong positive effects of

family income on school enrollment for those in the labor force and for those

out of it. Lerman finds similar strong positive effects. However, Lerman's

findings also indicate that differences in family income have a somewhat

larger impact on enrollment for those out of the labor force than for those in
                                      —25--




it. If anything, our findings point slightly in the other directionS

      (ii) Family Head's Education. Table 2B presents the estimates of the

effects of differences in the education of the family head on the various la-

bor force participation and enrollment categories. Increases in the family

head's education have a strong positive impact on the probability of enroll-

ment for all age, race, and sex groups. There is for 17—lB—year—olds a posi-

tive impact on labor force participation as well. But for the older groups

the effects of higher levels of parental education on participation is mixed.

For nonwhite females, Table 2B indicates that the probability of being not en-

rolled/part—time in the labor force and the probability of being enrolled and

in the labor force more than 20 weeks are particularly sensitive to variations

in the head's education.

      For those in the labor force, enrollment probabilities increase with the

head's education. Given the mixed results for those not in the labor force,

our findings concur with Lerman's observation that the head's education is

more likely to be associated with school enrollment for those in the labor

force than for those outside it.

      (iii)   Number of Parents Home. As can be seen from Table 2C, the varia—

ble measuring whether there are one or two parents home is significant at bet-

ter than the 95 percent level only for males. In general, the effects on the

probabilities of enrollment and of labor force participation vary in sign

among groups. The same is true of the measures referring to the probability

of different amounts of hours worked.

      (iv) Head Employed. Family head's employment status is included to con-

trol for the added worker effect. It does not have a significant impact for

males. The impact for white females is significant at better than the 95 per-

cent level, while for nonwhite females it is significant only at somewhat more

    In calculating these differences in probabilities, the probability for a youth whose family heads edocation is less than a high school gradoate is
    subtracted from the probability for a yooth wlioae family head's education is at least a college graduate. All other variables except age arc held
    at their reference level.

b See footnote to Table 2A for explanation. The interaction with family income is              sigrLficant   at the 95% level for white males and nonwhite females,
  and the interaction with age is significant for white males and white females.

than the 90 percent level. Both groups of females are less likely to be en-

rolled if the family head is unemployed. And while the effect on overall la-

bor force participation differs between the two groups, it can be seen from

Column 6 that the probability of not enrolling and participating full-time in•

the labor force is consistently higher for those young women whose family head

is unemployed. This is clearly what the added worker hypothesis would lead us

to expect, but again, it is not of importance for young men.'

      Bowen and Finegan's (pp. 399-401), findings indicate some statistically

insignificant added worker effects for 14-17—year—old girls enrolled in school,

and for 18—24—year—old young men who are not enrolled but still live at home.

For 14-17—year—old boys still enrolled, if the father is unemployed, they find

a significant negative effect on labor force participation. Our results with

respect to this variable are weak, and age categories do not correspond fully

to theirs. Nothing in our findings strongly contradicts their results.

      Mincer (1966, p. 95) argues that, given a lower relative asset position

of poorer families, he expects that added workers are more likely to come from

lower income families. There is no significant interaction between family in-

come and head's unemployment to indicate that the impact of head's unemployment

varies with family income. It is important to note, however, that the inclu-

sion of those who have left home in the sample may have weakened the effect of

the head of parents1 household employed measure. To be sure, those who have

left home may increase their work effort if the head of their parents' house-

hold is unemployed-—e.g., they may wish to help out even though they aren't

living at home, or they may be forced to support theire1ves if they had been

receiving transfers from their parents. But it seems reasonable to expect

      1
        A portion of the added worker effect may be captured by the family in-
come variable, thus weakening the measured impact of parental unemployment.

that a youth living away from home is probably less likely to adjust his or

her own employment status in light of the parents' circumstances than isa

youth who still lives at home. Despite this expectation, we find the effect

of a difference in parental employment status is significant for young women,

who are more likely to have left home, while it is not for young men. This

may reflect a stronger family cotmuitment to the education of the young men.

           (v)    Wages. Table 2E reports the effects on the probabilities of falling
in each of the school-work categories of a difference in the observed wage
from   less than 27 percent of the average adult wage to greater than 63 percent

of the adult wage. In other words, this table represents the response of the

youth to a more than doubling of his or her wage rate. This effect is statis-

tically significant for all but nonwhite females.

       The probability of enrollment is lower for those in the highest compared

to   the   lowest wage category. The negative impact is greater in absolute terms

for l9—22—year—olds than for those 17-18 and         is   greater for males than it is

for   females. •The probability of labor force participation increases with the
wage for all but younger white females.
       The relatively weak effects on the overall participation rate are accom-

panied by major differences in the probability of putting longer time in the

labor force.          These do not result in large changes in the labor force partici-
pation     rate because the higher probability of working longer hours if a high

wage is offered is accompanied by a lower probability of falling in the part—
time in the labor force categories.

       These findings may be questioned on a number         of grounds.   Most impor-

tantly, a question         can be raised as to whether the finding that hours supplied

increase         with the wage inadvertently reflects a relationship running from
hours to wages—-i.e., firms offer higher wages for full—time than for part—

a In calculating these differences in probabilities, the independent verieble takes on the lowest value if the youth'a wage is less than 27% of the
  average adult wage and the highest value if the youth's wage is greater than 63% of the adult wage. All other variables except age are held at
  the3r reference level.

b See footnote to Table 2A fur explanation. The interaction with age is significant at the 95% level for white females.

time    workj While theoretically, the market relation between wage rates and

tine spent at work (which Rosen 11976] calls the wage-hours locus) may be

positively or negatively sloped, the available empirical literature suggests a

positive relationship (see Lazear, 1977; Owen, 1978; Parsons, 1974; and Rosen,
        2
1976)

        A number of approaches may be taken to correct far the potential bias

arising from the influence of the wage-hours locus. Essentially, we can try to

calculate the wage that would be offered to each individual at a constant

amount of work, thus eliminating the correlation between wages and hours that

would result from movement along the wage—hours locus. One approach is to sub-

stitute     for the actual wage for full—time workers the wage distribution for
part—time workers    of the same age and sex who work in the same city where the

full—time workers live and to estimate the results for the four race-sex groups

using the calculated part-time wage distribution for those with full—time earn-

ings. When such estimates are made, we find that the level of significance for

the wage variable falls to just below 95 percent for white males and just below

90 percent for nonwhite males. The wage variable becomes insignificant for

white females and had previously been found to be insignificant for nonwhite

        1
        We should take note of other potential sources of bias which may lead
to an underestimate of the effect of wages on hours supplied. First, earnings
may be measured with error. Second, the aricunt of time employed may be mea-
sured with error, causing the denominator of the wage variable to be related to
the value of the dependent variable. A standard approach for dealingwith er-
rors in measurement is to use instrumental variables. However, many of the in-
struments normally used——age, race, sex, residence in a city-—already form the
basis for dividing our sample into subgroups. Those pertaining to education
are inappropriate because they may be endogenously related to the dependent
variable. Third, there is also evidence that part—time work may be easier to
do than full—time work (Lazear, 1977) , with the result that unmeasured nonpe—
cuniary benefits may be negatively related to the wage rate.
        2
           may be argued, however, that some of the evidence suggesting a posi-
tively sloped wage-hours relationship merely reflects the existence of a posi—
tively sloped labor supply curve.

the above table with the analogous figures in Table 28, we find that while the
impact of substantial wage differences on the             probability           of labor force par-
ticipation is     very small whichever procedure is used, the magnitude of the ef-

fect of wages on enrollment probability and on the probability of being not en-

rolled in the labor force more than 1200 hours are both reduced dramatically

when estimated part—time wages are used instead of actual full—time wages.

These findings are consistent with a view that the estimates reported in Table

28    may have been influenced, at least in part, by a positively sloping wage-
hours locus. On the other hand, based on these results alone, we cannot be
sure that the impact of wages on the allocation of time is as small as the re-
sults using the part-time wage instrument indicate. The available instrument

for this procedure was the identity of the SNSA in which the person worked, but

this instrument accounts for only 8 to 14 percent of the variance of the re—

           The measured impacts of the other         independent variables are not changed

corded part—time wages.

         Therefore, to provide a further check on our findings, we modify the es-

timating procedure to take into account Rosen's findings as to the estimated

slope of the wage—hours locus for women. According to his findings, the wage

increases by 2 percent for each additional 100 hours supplied. We proceed by

recalculating wage rates for all observations assuming 1000 hours worked.

Thus, if an individual worked 2000 hours, we used a calculated wage that was

20 percent below the wage rate actually observed. A problem with this proced-

ure is that we do not know what the wage—hour locus really looks like. It

may, for example,    be discontinuous with part—time work during the summer paid
at a different rate from part—time work during the yearJ Thus, estimates       for

youth    based on Rosen's findings for women should be viewed with great caution.2
If one had full knowledge of the wage—hours locus it would be appropriate to
calculate and use the marginal return to work in the    labor   supply curve. We
use   only the calculated wage. Results for white males are reported in Columns

6(b), 7(b), and 8(b) of the preceding table. The wage variable is significant

at above the 99 percent level for white males, but is not significantly dif-

ferent from zero at any standard level for nonwhite males. The only wage ef-

fect that persists for estimates in Table 2E and those reported above is that

higher wages reduce the probability of enrollment.3 These results imply that


        Over some range, it is conceivable that the wage rate varies inversely
with hours worked. E.g., the wage rate paid for summer work may exceed that
paid for an after—school job.
         2
        We should also note that Rosen's estimates themselves may be subject
to wide error, even when applied to women. One reason is the choice of which
instruments appear in the wage—hours locus and which appear in the labor sup-
ply curve are subject to question. E.g., education appears in the wage-hours
locus,    but not the labor supply curve.
        Even this finding does not hold up if it is assumed that the     true slope
of the wage—hours locus reflects a 3 percent wage increase for every     additional
100 hours worked.
                                     —35—



estimated wage elasticities of enrollment and of labor supply are very sensi-

tive to assumptions about the wage-hours locus. Since we do not have very

good information on what it looks like, extreme caution should be exercised be-

fore assuming coefficients estimated for the wage variable represent the true

parameter values of the labor supply curve.

      (vi) Area Unemployment Rate for Youth. The area unemployment rate for

youth is included to test for the effects of interarea differences in job

availability on enrollment and labor supply. Since the wage is also included

as an independent variable, a finding that the relation between job availa-

bility and time supplied to various activities is significant will mean that

job availability has a truly independent impact. This was not clear from pre-

vious studies, which did not include the wage as an independent determinant of

the quantity of labor supplied. The reason is that in these earlier studies,

the measures of job availability, reflecting as they do the demand for labor,

may have acted as a surrogate for the wage. It can be seen from our findings

in Table ZF, however, that even when wages are included as a separate explana-

tory variable, youth unemployment has an impact that is significant at better

than the 95 percent level for three of the four groups consideredJ The ex-

ception is white females.

      In areas with low youth unemployment rates vis—a—vis those with high

rates, the probability of enrolling in school is lower for white males, non-

white males, and white females. Bowen and Finegan (p. 45O) found, in general

agreement with our results, that higher area unemployment raises the proba-

bility of enrollment for males. With the exception of a slight negative ci-



      1
        The estimated impact of unemployment is changed only slightly when in-

fect   for   older white males, the probability of Labor force participation is

higher in areas where jobs are more readily available.

       Rowen and Finegan have set forth an argument that jobs are likely to be

particularly important for minority youth so that they could help finance

their way through school. The response of nonwhite women to greater job

availability is consistent with this view. Enrollment and labor force par-

ticipation rates are higher in areas with lower unemployment. Nonwhite men,

however, appear to take advantage of readily available jobs by leaving school

to begin working on a full—time basis. For these men, the increase in the not

enrolled/full—time participation is very substantial, amounting to 40 to 48

percent of the reference probabilities of falling in this category (see Table

1) -


       Bowen and Finegan found, before correcting their results for the effects

of those who shift employment status, that labor force participation for those

not enrolled responded more to differences in job availability than did labor

force participation for those enrolled (p. 424) .    Similarly,   Cohen, flea, and

Lerman found lower unemployment associated with greater labor force participa-

tion for those not enrolled, with the same relationship holding weakly between

areas with the highest and lowest unemployment rates for those enrolled. With

regard to the probability of enrollment conditional on participation, Lerman

found for those in the labor force, higher unemployment is associated with

greater school participation, while for those not in the labor force, he found

no significant effect of unemployment on enrollment. In general, our results

for the various conditional probabilities, as presented in Columns 9 throu9h

12 of Table 2F, are mixed. They tend to support the findings of the other

studies cited for some sex—race categories, but not for others.

                           IV. Summary and Implications

      This study has used a relatively new statistical technique, discrete

multivariate analysis, to estimate in a simultaneous framework the effects of

family background and labor market conditions on the enrollment choices by

youth and on the time they supply to the labor market. Where possible, find-

ings have been compared to those from earlier studies, with similarities and

differences pointed out.

      Parental income and the education of the head of the family have much

stronger effects than either the number of parents living at home or the head's

employment status. Added    worker   effects are found for young women but not for

young men.

      No matter what wage measure is used, higher relative wage offers seem to

reduce the probability of the youth enrolling in school, but the size of the

estimated impact of wage on enrollment, and the impact on labor supply are very

sensitive to whether or not adjustments are made for the possibility that wage

rate offers by firms are higher for full-time than for part—tine work. If es-

timates of labor supply curves obtained by others, especially for secondary

workers, are as sensitive to the treatment of the wage variable as our results

indicate they are, great caution and a clear awareness of the potential vari-

ance in estimated results is called for before applying them to the design of

public policy programs.

      Job availability, as measured by youth unemployment, does seem to influ-

ence youth labor supply, with the strongest effect on the labor supply for

nonwhite males. The results suggest that nonwhite males in low unemployment

areas will be in the labor force full-time 40 to almost 50 percent more often

than will similar males in high unemployment areas. Moreover, since a wage

measure is included as an independent variable, we can be sure that the job
                                          —39—



    availability measure is not acting as a surrogate for an absent wage   variable,
    but instead has an impact of its own.

            Youth-oriented labor market experiments have been proposed and conducted

    in the past, and some are in progress (e.g., the Youth Entitlement Incentive

    Pilot Project) .   Income and substitution effects of the changes brought about

    by these programs may be calculated and used to make projections of program

    impact. Our findings suggest that job availability may play a direct role in

    influencing the budget constraint facing the youth. Accordingly, explicit con-

    sideration should be given to the role of job availability when calculating in-

    come and substitution effects, and in making national projections based on re-

    sults pertaining to a particular site.

            Further developments along the lines pursued here may make it easier to

    estimate the impact of interarea or intertemporal differences in market condi—
-
    tions   on school enrollment and youth labor supply. This may be especially

    helpful in evaluating experiments which implement different school or job pro-

    grams in different cities. Results such as those developed in this paper can

    aid in separating out that part of the outcomes of these programs (e.g., drop-

    out rates or school continuation rates) due to the impact of the program from

    that part which arises merely because market conditions vary among the various

    cities in which the experiment is being conducted. Moreover, in the case of

    experiments like the Youth Entitlement Project, which saturate the labor mar-

    ket with jobs for young people, there is a special need to estimate, based on

    information from outside of the experiment, what enrollment and labor supply

    would have been in the absence of the program.

            The supply curve we have estimated constitutes one of the structural

    equations in a model of the effects of the minimum wage on youth labor market
                                        —40—



activities and enrollment behavior. 1    In concluding, it is appropriate to note

that while our findings are consistent with a View that minimum wages discour-

age labor market activity and increase school enrollment, they are not them-

selves sufficient to generate such a result.

        The likely importance of job rationing in a model of the impact of
minimum wages has been recognized by Welch (1974)',. Mincer (1976), Gramlich
 (1976), and others. Interactions between school and work and their implica-
tions for the measured impact of the minimum wage have been examined by
Ehrenberg and Marcus (1979), Leighton and Mincer (1979), and Mattila (1978).
