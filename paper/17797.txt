We use the Business Roundtable’s challenge to the SEC’s 2010 proxy access rule as a natural experiment
to measure the value of shareholder proxy access. We find that firms that would have been most vulnerable
to proxy access, as measured by institutional ownership and activist institutional ownership in particular,
lost value on October 4, 2010, when the SEC unexpectedly announced that it would delay implementation
of the Rule in response to the Business Roundtable challenge. We also examine intra-day returns and
find that the value loss occurred just after the SEC’s announcement on October 4. We find similar
results on July 22, 2011, when the D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of the Business Roundtable. These findings
are consistent with the view that financial markets placed a positive value on shareholder access, as
implemented in the SEC’s 2010 Rule.

    Does Shareholder Proxy Access Improve Firm Value? Evidence from
                    the Business Roundtable Challenge

        Shareholder access to the company’s proxy statement has been one of the most heated –

if not the most heated – topics in corporate governance over the past decade.1 Opponents of

proxy access argue that it would shift a dangerous amount of power to certain kinds of

shareholders (for example, union pension funds) who could pursue objectives counter to

shareholder value maximization (e.g., Bainbridge 2003). They also argue that high-quality

directors may be less willing to serve on boards if they must face competition from shareholder-

sponsored candidates (e.g., Lipton and Rosenblum 2003). Proponents of shareholder access

argue that competition in the director election process is desirable, and that giving institutional

investors more influence in the director election process will likely benefit all shareholders

(Bebchuk 2003, Bebchuk and Hirst 2010).

        We use the Business Roundtable’s challenge to the proxy access rule as a natural

experiment to measure the value of shareholder proxy access. On August 25, 2010, under

authority provided by Section 971 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer

Protection Act, the SEC enacted a shareholder proxy access rule (the “Rule”). This Rule was

intended to go into effect on November 15, 2010. On September 29, however, the Business

Roundtable filed a petition in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals challenging the new Rule,

alleging that it was arbitrary and capricious, exceeded the SEC’s authority, and would reduce

overall shareholder wealth. In a move that surprised most observers, on October 4 the SEC

announced that it would delay implementation of the new Rule until the Business Roundtable

  See, e.g., Business Roundtable and U.S. Chamber of Commerce v. U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission,
Complaint filed Sept. 29, 2010 at 2 (“Few issues in corporate governance have generated more disagreement or
stronger passions.”).

                                                                                                               2
challenge was resolved. On July 22, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit struck

down the Rule under the Administrative Procedure Act, accepting the Business Roundtable’s

argument that the SEC was insufficiently deliberate and rational in adopting the Rule. In

September 2011, the SEC announced that it would not appeal the D.C. Circuit’s ruling, but rather

would permit shareholders to pursue access on a company-by-company basis.

        The Business Roundtable’s challenge to the SEC’s proxy access rule provides the basis

for an event study. If shareholder access increases shareholder value, then companies that would

have been most exposed to the new Rule should decline in value, relative to companies that

would have been more insulated from the Rule, in response to the SEC’s unexpected stay on

proxy access (October 4, 2010) and the (arguably) unexpected decision by the D.C. Circuit to

invalidate proxy access (July 22, 2011). If instead shareholder access decreases shareholder

value, then companies that would have been most exposed to the Rule should increase in value,

relative to those what would have been more insulated, on these dates. This natural experiment

allows a rough quantification of the value of shareholder proxy access. In addition, the

experiment allows testing of hypotheses about board influence. If there is heterogeneity across

firms in the value of shareholder influence through the board of directors, or across different

types of shareholders in their ability to improve the value of firms, our natural experiment

provides an opportunity to quantify those differences.

        We use measures of institutional ownership, and activist institutional ownership2 in

particular, as a proxy for vulnerability to the Rule. Using a 1-day event window around October

 By activist hedge fund, we refer to hedge funds with a history of corporate activism and intervention (see
Greenwood and Schor 2009 and Brav, Jiang, Partnoy, and Thomas 2008). We discuss the motivation for this in
more detail below.

                                                                                                              3
4, 2010,3 we find that share prices of companies that would have been most vulnerable to the

Rule declined significantly compared to share prices of companies that would have been most

insulated from the Rule. Specifically, we find a 44 basis point spread between firms with high

institutional ownership and firms with low institutional ownership for that day’s returns. The

pattern of lower returns for firms with higher institutional ownership holds true for equal-

weighted excess return portfolios (37 basis point differential), as well as portfolios based on

activist ownership (43 basis point differential). All three of these estimates are statistically

significant. In a regression setting, we confirm that institutional ownership, and especially

activist institutional ownership, was correlated with negative returns on October 4. For July 22,

2011, we find results that are directionally similar to the October 4, 2010 results, slightly smaller

in magnitude and statistically significant. Taken as a whole, these findings are consistent with

the view that financial markets placed a positive value on shareholder access, as implemented in

the SEC’s August 2010 Rule. Presumably, the stock market perceived the stay as a reduced

likelihood of proxy access in the short run as well as in the long run, perhaps seeing the stay as

indication of the SEC’s own perception of their ability to defend the rule in court.

        We also use intra-day data on October 4 to determine whether our overall results can be

attributed to shareholder proxy access. We find that virtually all of the observed activist effect

comes after the 12:21 pm announcement of the SEC stay – a period during which the overall

market hardly moved. The value loss in activist-held firms appears to have accelerated

substantially after a Bloomberg news story about the SEC stay appeared at 3:20 pm. These intra-

day results suggest that the relative drop in the market value of equity for firms with large



3
  Using a one-day event window to study proxy access is tantamount to focusing on the market’s short term view of
the announcement’s value effect. Unfortunately, the event study methodology is much less suitable for identifying
the market’s long-term views (since long term stock returns are more variable than short term stock returns).

                                                                                                                4
activist ownership can be attributed to the SEC’s announcement delaying shareholder proxy

access.4

         The paper proceeds in six sections. Section 1 summarizes the evolution of shareholder

access in the U.S. Section 2 reviews the existing related literature on proxy access and corporate

governance more generally. Section 3 explains our empirical strategy. Section 4 describes our

data and methodology. Section 5 presents our results, and Section 6 discusses potential

interpretations. Section 7 concludes.



1. Background: Proxy access and boards of directors in the United States

         The corporate law of every U.S. jurisdiction requires that corporations hold an annual

meeting to elect directors. In this election, the company will invariably nominate exactly the

number of candidates to fill the available seats – for example, seven candidates for seven seats.

Shareholders of the corporation have the right to nominate their own candidates to the board.

Any shareholder can propose a nominee to the board’s nominating committee, but if the board

refuses to put the shareholder’s candidate on the company’s slate (which is by far the more

common outcome), the shareholder would have to engage in a time-consuming and expensive

process in order to get their candidate seated. Specifically, a shareholder who wants to nominate

one or more candidates would have to file Schedule 14A with the SEC, hire a proxy solicitor,

and often engage in an expensive public campaign to support their nominee or nominees. These

  The intra-day findings respond to critics of an earlier version of our paper, who expressed skepticism about the
validity of event study methodology in general and the causal inferences that can be drawn from such a
methodology. See, e.g., David Marcus, The Proxy Access Problem, THE DEAL (Nov. 24, 2010) (“[R]eaders with
little understanding of and less confidence in the black art of regression analysis may well be skeptical of a paper
that claims to be able to assign a value measured in basis points to a single amorphous factor on a single trading day
among the dozens that affect the value of stocks.”).

                                                                                                                     5
expenses are only reimbursed if the shareholder gains control of the board.5 Moreover, the

shareholder must share the benefits of any improvement in corporate performance pro rata with

the other shareholders. As a result of these obstacles, contested director elections outside the

context of a hostile takeover bid have been exceedingly rare in corporate America (Bebchuk

2003).6

          Against this backdrop, many commentators have viewed shareholder access to the

company’s proxy statement as an essential step to make director elections more meaningful, and,

by extension, to improve overall corporate governance. After decades of discussion,7 and not

coincidentally in the wake of corporate scandals at Enron, Worldcom, and other large U.S. public

companies, the SEC proposed a shareholder access rule in October 2003. Under the 2003 rule,

shareholders would gain the right to place one or more nominees on the company’s proxy

statement after one of two trigger events had occurred: (1) “withhold” votes of more than 35% of

votes had been cast for one or more directors; or (2) a majority vote for a 14a-8 shareholder

access proposal, proposed by a shareholder or shareholder group that had held at least 1% of the

company’s shares for at least one year. The Business Roundtable and other groups representing

director and management interests engaged in a lobbying effort against the proposed Rule. By

early 2005, the SEC issued a series of no-action letters permitting companies to omit shareholder

proposals based on the proposed rule, effectively withdrawing its proposal.

  For the classic statement of this rule, see Rosenfeld v. Fairchild Engine & Airplane Corp., 128 N.E. 2d 291 (N.Y.
1955)

  In July 2007, the SEC promulgated its long-awaited “eProxy Rules,” which allow insurgents to post their proxy
materials on-line and simply mail shareholders a “Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials.” In theory,
eProxy rules should reduce the costs of proxy solicitation and increase the number of contested director elections.
However, the early empirical evidence suggests that the number of contested director elections did not increase
substantially in the 2009 or 2010 proxy seasons.

        In 2006, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees

(AFSCME) submitted a shareholder proposal to American International Group (AIG) to amend

AIG’s bylaws so that a 3% shareholder could place one nominee in AIG’s proxy materials – in

effect, trying to do at AIG what the SEC’s proposed Rule 14a-11 had tried to do more generally.

Surprising many commentators, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that this proposal was

not excludable under the Rule 14a-8(i)(8) exclusion, which at the time permitted companies to

exclude proposals “relat[ing] to an election for membership on the company’s board of

directors.” The court found that the proposal related to board elections broadly, and not to “an

election” of directors.8 The holding seemed to open up the possibility of proxy access on a

company-by-company basis. But in December 2007, the SEC amended the Rule 14a-8(i)(8)

exclusion to permit corporations to exclude proposals “relating to an election for membership on

the company’s board” or relating to “a procedure for such nomination or election.” This

amendment was intended to reverse the Second Circuit’s holding in AFSCME v. AIG.

        Shareholder proxy access remained dormant until May 2009, when the SEC returned to

the issue with a new shareholder access proposal. The SEC explained: “The nation and the

markets have recently experienced, and remain in the midst of, one of the most serious crises of

the past century. This crisis has led many to raise serious concerns about the accountability and

responsiveness of some companies and boards of directors to the interests of shareholders, and

has resulted in a loss of investor confidence.”9 Under the proposed Rule 14a-11, a shareholder or

shareholder group that owned more than 1% of a large U.S. public company (defined as market

capitalization greater than $700 million), more than 3% of a midsize public company (market

capitalization $75-$700 million), or more than 5% of a small public company (market

capitalization less than $75 million) would have the ability to place nominees on the company’s

proxy statement for up to one-quarter of the total board seats.

           In an effort to preempt or at least shape the SEC’s consideration of shareholder access,

Delaware amended its corporate code to confirm that shareholders could amend the company’s

bylaws to permit proxy access. Section 112 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, enacted

in May 2009, provides that: “The bylaws may provide that if the corporation solicits proxies with

respect to an election of directors, it may be required . . . to include in its proxy solicitation

materials . . . 1 or more individuals nominated by a stockholder.” Section 112 reflects one

application of the Delaware Supreme Court’s holding in CA v. AFSCME,10 handed down in July

2008, which permits shareholders to regulate procedural aspects of corporate governance (e.g.,

how decisions are made) but not substantive aspects, which are left to the board. Thus Section

112 confirmed the shareholders’ right to opt-in to proxy access (a so-called “voluntary proxy

access regime”).

           In July 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and

Consumer Protection Act. Notwithstanding Delaware’s efforts to preempt federal action,

Section 971 of the Act amended Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act to provide the SEC

explicit authority to adopt proxy access rules. By confirming that the SEC had the authority to

issue shareholder access rules and signaling Congress’s support for such rules, Section 971 made

shareholder proxy access inevitable, according to most observers.

           On August 25, 2010, by a 3-2 vote, the SEC announced the adoption of a final Rule 14a-

11, mandating proxy access at all U.S. public companies. Any shareholder or shareholder group

that held more than 3% of a U.S. public company’s shares for more than three years would be

eligible to nominate candidates for up to 25% of the company’s board seats. The new Rule 14a-

11 was planned to go in to effect on November 15, 2010, well in time for the April/May 2011

proxy season.11

         On September 29, the Business Roundtable, along with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,

filed a complaint in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, alleging that the SEC’s proxy access rules

were unlawful under U.S. securities laws and “arbitrary and capricious.”12 The Business

Roundtable complaint also asserted – but did not explain – that the SEC’s proxy rules “do not

promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation.”13 The complaint was widely-

anticipated by the marketplace based on public statements, including in the comment letters

submitted by these two groups to the SEC on the proxy access proposal. Nevertheless,

Congress’s authorization to the SEC under Section 971 of the Dodd-Frank was intended to

largely shut down this kind of challenge; perhaps as a result, the filing of the Business

Roundtable complaint did not attract significant media attention.

         However, on October 4, the SEC unexpectedly announced that it would stay

implementation of Rule 14a-11, pending resolution of the Business Roundtable litigation in the

D.C. Circuit. The SEC explained: “Among other things, a stay avoids potentially unnecessary

costs, regulatory uncertainty, and disruption that could occur if the rules were to become

effective during the pendency of a challenge to their validity.”14 News accounts noted that the




11
   The three year rule excluded many investors with shorter holding periods. However, the rule would have allowed
investors with two year holdings, for example, to qualify relatively soon. Cella (2011) shows that activist investors
have longer holding periods than other investors in the US.

Roundtable challenge” hereinafter.

SEC’s announcement was a surprise.15 Commentators also noted that the SEC’s stay meant that

proxy access rules would not go into effect for the 2011 proxy season.16

        On July 22, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit struck down Rule 14a-

11 under the Administrative Procedure Act. The D.C. Circuit accepted the Business

Roundtable’s argument that the SEC’s process in considering and adopting the new Rule was

insufficiently deliberate and rational.17

        In September 2011, the SEC announced that it would not appeal the D.C. Circuit’s ruling,

but instead would re-instate its amendments to Rule 14a-8, which would allow shareholders to

vote on a resolution recommending or requiring the inclusion of shareholder-sponsored board

candidaets in the next year’s corporate proxy statement. The SEC thus moved away from

comprehensive proxy access to a two-step, company-by-company approach. Shareholders at

several major companies, including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Hewlett-Packard, Sprint

Nextel, and Wells Fargo, have proposed proxy access resolutions for the 2012 proxy season.18



2. Literature

        The delegation of control over firms to professional managers is a defining feature of

modern capitalism (see Berle and Means 1932), and one that raises the possibility of agency

problems. Estimating the economic impact of boards and board structure on shareholder wealth

has been difficult because of econometric identification challenges. Hermalin and Weisbach

(1998) point out that one reason that much of the corporate governance literature finds weak

correlations between board characteristics and firm performance may be that board

characteristics are endogenous, i.e. across firms, board characteristics are likely not assigned at

random. This makes the effect of any board characteristic (e.g., the presence of outsiders, the

number of directors) impossible to identify based only on the observed correlation between that

characteristic and firm performance.

        Shareholder access to the company’s proxy statement is one specific dimension of

corporate governance that has been heavily debated over the years. As an illustration, more than

700 different comment letters were submitted to the SEC when proxy access was proposed in

2003; more than 200 different comment letters were submitted during the 2007 rulemaking

process; and more than 500 different comment letters were submitted when proxy access was

proposed again in 2009. Proponents of shareholder access (e.g., Bebchuk 2003, Bebchuk and

Hirst 2010) point out that proxy contests under the existing regime are exceedingly rare, and

argue that a meaningful director election process would improve corporate governance.

Opponents of shareholder access argue that shareholders already have sufficient voice in the

election of directors (e.g., Bainbridge 2010), that shareholder access rules would likely shift too

much power to shareholders or shareholders with specific agendas, and that high-quality

directors may be less willing to serve on boards if they must face competition from shareholder-

sponsored candidates (e.g., Lipton and Rosenblum 2003).19 A third set of commentators object

to the “one-size-fits-all” approach of mandatory shareholder access (e.g., Grundfest 2009).

These commentators propose that shareholders should be able to opt-in, or at least opt-out, of the

SEC’s proxy access rules.



19
  This argument is related to the idea proposed by Burkart, Gromb and Panunzi (1997) that closer oversight may
weaken managerial incentives. Adams and Ferreira (2007) argue that management-friendly boards are sometimes
optimal because they pose a weaker monitoring threat, which enables them to solicit more information from CEOs.

                                                                                                             11
       A recent theory paper by Harris and Raviv (2010) addresses the optimal extent of control

to place in the hands of shareholders versus managers. Their model includes strategic

communication between self-interested and potentially privately informed managers and

shareholders as well as delegation. Harris and Raviv find that when shareholders seek to

maximize firm value and are not misinformed, it is optimal to place the delegation decision in

the hands of shareholders, allowing them to decide ex ante which decisions to leave to

management and which to make directly. Owners will then delegate decisions where

management’s information advantage outweighs its agency costs to managers. The authors view

this result as being consistent with Bebchuk’s (2005) recommendation to allow shareholders to

set the “rules of the game” regarding decision power and corporate governance.

       A recent paper by Kahan and Rock (2011) argues that proxy access would be unlikely to

yield a significant number of shareholder-nominated candidates, and would be unlikely to have a

meaningful effect on corporate governance more generally. Drawing inferences from past

behavior, the authors argue that neither mutual funds nor private pension funds would make

significant use of shareholder access. Large public pension funds “may make some

nominations,” but hedge funds and union-affiliated funds, which historically have been more

activist, would generally not satisfy the ownership and holding period requirements under the

Rule. In addition, Kahan and Rock argue that the proxy access rule would not substantially

lower the costs of running a short slate contest, and that, in some respects, the costs of running a

candidate using the company’s proxy statement would be greater than running a candidate in the

traditional manner.

       While we agree with Kahan and Rock that the number of actual candidates under a

shareholder access regime may very well be small, we believe that Kahan and Rock give too



                                                                                                  12
little weight to the potential for more meaningful “constructive engagement” between large

shareholders and the company under a proxy access regime, when the “stick” of a proxy access

candidate is lurking in the background. Moreover, Kahan and Rock’s predictions about

shareholders’ willingness to use proxy access are based on past behavior, and do not account for

the possibility that shareholder behavior would change in response to a new regime.20 Leaving

aside the hypothetical future role of proxy access, our study focuses on a set of investors with a

track record of activism (i.e., we study the value changes for firms held by such investors). In

any event, we agree with Kahan and Rock that proxy access would have both costs and benefits;

the question then becomes how best to predict whether the benefits outweigh the costs, and the

magnitude of the net benefits if any.

         The idea of empirically evaluating regulatory changes with stock market data was

introduced by Schwert (1981).21 Two prior studies and one contemporaneous study use this

methodology to examine the wealth effects of shareholder proxy access. Akyol, Lim and

Verwijmeren (2010) examines 14 events between September 2006 and December 2009 that, in

their interpretation, increased22 or decreased23 the likelihood of shareholder proxy access. For

   In a recent presentation of this paper at NYU alongside Kahan and Rock, one of us observed that Kahan & Rock’s
approach to proxy access could similarly be used to predict that texting is unlikely to be a significant mode of
communication: texting is just slightly less costly than e-mail (e.g., no need for a header, as is the convention with e-
mail), and in some ways texting is more costly than e-mail (e.g., you need to know the phone number rather than just
the e-mail address). Of course, this prediction would be highly inaccurate because behavior has in fact changed in
response to the new technology, at least in part because text messages go to a space (the phone number) that is far
more sacrosanct than the e-mail in box. The analogy to proxy access should be apparent: a simple cost/benefit
analysis ignores the possibility for behavior change due to the fact that a proxy access candidate goes to a “sacred
space,” namely, the company’s own proxy statement.
21
   See Hochberg, Sapienza and Vissing-Jorgensen (2009) for a recent example.
22
   The nine events that, according to the authors, increased the likelihood of shareholder proxy access were: the
Second Circuit’s holding in AFSCME v. CA (Sept. 5, 2006), the SEC announcement of a roundtable discussion on
proxy access (April 24, 2007), the SEC’s disclosure of a proposed rule on proxy access (July 27, 2007), a speech by
SEC Commissioner Elisse Walter on proxy access (Feb. 18, 2009), a speech by SEC Chairwoman Mary Schapiro on
proxy access (April 6, 2009), the SEC’s announcement that it would vote on a proposed rule (May 12, 2009), the
SEC’s announcement of the content of the proposed rule (May 14, 2009), the introduction of the Schumer Bill in the
U.S. Senate (May 19, 2009), and the SEC’s vote in favor of the proposed rule on proxy access (May 20, 2009).
23
   The five events that, according to the authors, decreased the likelihood of shareholder proxy access were: the
SEC’s publication of a final Rule 14a-8 with no substantial changes (Nov. 28, 2007), the SEC’s publication of a

                                                                                                                     13
each event date, they compare the return of a portfolio of U.S. firms to the return of a global

market portfolio (excluding U.S. firms) and to a Canadian market portfolio. They also isolate

U.S. financial firms from other U.S. firms, on the theory that financial firms might be more

likely to be targeted by shareholders for proxy access. Six of the events taken individually

produce statistically significant abnormal returns around the event dates (at 95% confidence),

and when the events are aggregated the returns are highly significant and inversely correlated

with shareholder proxy access. Specifically, the authors find that an increased likelihood of

shareholder access reduced returns to the U.S. portfolio relative to the non-U.S. portfolios, and

for U.S. financial firms relative to non-financial U.S. firms. The authors conclude that

“increasing shareholder rights . . . may actually be detrimental to shareholder wealth,” and that

the results “highlight the need for the SEC to further deliberate on the proposed rule, and to

consider not implementing the proposed changes.”

         Larcker, Ormazabal, and Taylor (2010) similarly use an event study approach to examine

thirteen events between March 2007 and June 2009 that arguably increased24 or decreased25 the

likelihood of shareholder proxy access. The authors use the number of institutions with 1% or

more ownership (NLargeBlock) and the number of possible coalitions that would control 1% or


final Rule 14a-8(i)(8) with no substantial changes (Dec. 12, 2007), the introduction of an opt-in shareholder proxy
access bill in the Delaware House of Representatives (Mar. 10, 2009), the passage of this bill in the Delaware House
(March 18, 2009), the passage of the bill in the Delaware Senate (April 8, 2009), and the reopening of the comment
period on the SEC proposed Rule on shareholder access (Dec. 14, 2009).
24
   The eight events that, according to the authors, increased the likelihood of shareholder proxy access are: first
mention of the Schumer Bill in the press (April 25, 2009), introduction of the Schumer Bill in the U.S. Senate (May
19, 2009), first mention of the Shareholder Empowerment Act in the press (June 12, 2009), the SEC announcement
of a roundtable discussion on proxy access (April 24, 2007), the SEC announcement of amendments to Rule 14a-8
14a-8(i)(8) (July 27, 2007), first mention of potential amendments to Rule 14a-11 (April 6, 2009), the SEC’s vote in
favor of the proposed rule on proxy access (May 20, 2009), and the publication of the SEC’s draft proposal for Rule
14a-11 (June 10, 2009).
25
   The five events that, according to the authors, decreased the likelihood of shareholder proxy access are: the SEC’s
publication of a final Rule 14a-8 with no substantial changes (Nov. 28, 2007), the SEC’s publication of a final Rule
14a-8(i)(8) with no substantial changes (Dec. 6, 2007), the introduction of an opt-in shareholder proxy access bill in
the Delaware House of Representatives (Mar. 10, 2009), the passage of this bill in the Delaware House (Mar. 18,
2009), the passage of the bill in the Delaware Senate (April 8, 2009), and the reopening of the comment period on
the SEC proposed Rule on shareholder access (Dec. 14, 2009).

                                                                                                                   14
more of the shares outstanding (NSmallCoalitions) as proxies for a company’s exposure to a

shareholder access rule. For five out of the thirteen events, the authors find a statistically

significant (at 95% confidence) negative correlation between NLargeBlock and events that

increased the likelihood of shareholder proxy access. For a (somewhat different) five out of

thirteen events, the authors find a statistically significant negative correlation between

NSmallCoalitions and events that increased the likelihood of proxy access. As with the Akyol

study, the coefficients for both NLargeBlock and NSmallCoalitions become highly significant

and inversely correlated with increased likelihood of shareholder access when all thirteen events

are pooled. The authors conclude that their findings are consistent with the view that >1%

shareholders “will use the privileges afforded to them by proxy access regulation to manipulate

the governance process to make themselves better off at the expense of other shareholders.”

Larcker and Tayan (2010) summarize this literature as suggesting that “regulation of corporate

governance is viewed negatively by shareholders.”

       One problem inherent in these prior event studies is that at least some of the events being

studied are of questionable importance. For example, both the Akyol study and the Larcker

study identify the announcement of a SEC roundtable discussion series on April 24, 2007 as an

event that increased the likelihood of proxy access. With the SEC having considered proxy

access off-and-on for most of the prior decade (and having already promised to take up proxy

access after the AFSCME decision the prior year), it is not clear why the announcement of a

roundtable discussion – with, of course, no prediction on what conclusions the discussants would

reach – should convey meaningful information to the marketplace, much less increase the

likelihood of proxy access.




                                                                                                 15
           In fact, the impact of the April 24 announcement on the likelihood of proxy access is not

even directionally clear. At the time of the announcement, the AFSCME decision permitted

proxy access on a company-by-company basis. In the press release announcing the Roundtable

series, SEC Chairman Christopher Cox noted generally: “This roundtable will explore the

relationship between the federal proxy rules and state corporation law, and pose questions to the

participants about whether this relationship can be improved.”26 After the Roundtable, the first

move from the SEC, proposed in October 2007 and finalized in December 2007, was

amendments to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) that overruled the AFSCME decision and eliminated proxy

access. To the extent that investors interpreted Cox’s general statement to mean that the

AFSCME decision was vulnerable (which, in retrospect, would have been an accurate

interpretation) the April 24 announcement should have decreased the likelihood of shareholder

access, rather than increased it as the Akyrol and Larcker studies predict.

           A second potential problem with the Akyrol and Larcker studies is that many of the

events were predicted in advance, at least in part, by the marketplace. For example, it is well-

known that the Corporate Law Section of the Delaware Bar Association, not the Delaware

legislature, creates Delaware corporate law. Once the Corporate Law Section voted in favor of a

shareholder access amendment on February 26, 2009, its implementation in Delaware became

virtually a foregone conclusion. Both the Akyol study and the Larcker study examine the

introduction of the shareholder access bill in the Delaware House of Representatives (March 10,

2009), the passage of the bill in the House (March 18), and the passage of the bill in the

Delaware Senate (April 8), but fail to examine the recommendation from the Corporate Law

Council that occurred on February 26. Similarly, the promulgation of the final Rule on August

25, 2010 was very accurately predicted in press reports ahead of its actual announcement. If the

marketplace fully anticipates an event, then wealth effects around the event date can be

meaningless.

         Despite these deficiencies, the Akyol and Larcker studies have led some commentators to

conclude that shareholder proxy access reduces shareholder wealth. For example, Grundfest

(2010) summarizes the “consistent conclusion” from the two studies as follows:

          [P]roxy access, as currently proposed by the Commission, reduces shareholder
         wealth, and, even if preferred by vocal institutional investors, is inimical to the
         best interests of the shareholder community as a whole. . . . The best currently
         available empirical data indicate that, given a choice between the current regime
         and the Commission’s proxy access rules, shareholders seeking to maximize
         returns would prefer the status quo because the proposed rules appear to destroy
         shareholder wealth.


         It should also be noted that both the Akyol and Larcker studies were submitted to the

SEC as comment letters during the rulemaking process, and were referenced by the SEC in the

final Rule. We find the reliance on these prior event studies to be troubling because many of the

events were widely-anticipated, confounded, directionally unclear, and/or not meaningful, for

reasons described above. 27 In contrast, we study a main event that in our view was

unanticipated, unconfounded, directionally clear, and highly meaningful with respect to proxy

access. Our second event, the Supreme Court ruling in 2011, was predictable but of unknown

direction and also directionally clear.

         Cohn, Gillan, and Hartzell (2010) also study proxy access using an event study

methodology, focusing on firms with activist investors (but using a classification scheme for

investors that differs from ours). They use three event dates, all more recent than the Larcker and

  See also Steven Davidoff, The Heated Debate Over Shareholder Access, NEW YORK TIMES (Nov. 3, 2010)
(“What is remarkable about these arguments is the lack of empirical evidence about the actual effect that proxy
access would have on the value of public corporations. That is, there is no scientific evidence either way on the
impact that shareholder proxy access will have on the stock prices of public corporations. Will it make these
companies more or less valuable? Behind this question is whether proxy access has positive or negative worth.
Until this month, there have only been two empirical studies even purporting to look at these issues.”).

Akyol studies: a refinement of the proxy access rule that clarified the position size requirements

for proxy access (June 16-17, 2010); an additional refinement that led to the dropping of the five

percent threshold from the Dodd-Frank bill (June 24-25, 2010); and the ultimate passage of the

proxy access rule (August 25, 2010). Cohn et al. argue that the 5% size requirement introduced

on June 16/17 was a higher threshold than expected in the marketplace, and therefore should be

interpreted as a negative event for proxy access. When this 5% requirement was dropped on

June 24/25 this was, in turn, a positive event for proxy access. On August 25, when the final

Rule was announced, Cohn et al. argue that the surprise event was the three-year holding period

rather than two years expected by the marketplace; therefore this was a negative event for proxy

access. The authors find a positive correlation between proxy access and shareholder wealth,

i.e., the two negative events reduced value for companies most vulnerable to proxy access, and

the one positive event increased value for companies most vulnerable to proxy access. These

findings stand in contrast to the findings from the Akyol and Larcker studies.The Cohn et al

paper is similar to this study in that it examines the differential return between firms with and

without activist owners. We use different event dates, and sources of the set of activists. Like us,

Cohn et al conclude that proxy access appears to have been ascribed positive value by the stock

market.



3. Empirical Strategy

       The unexpected delay that occurred on October 4, 2010 provides the basis for an

empirical test of the wealth effects of shareholder access. We apply the idea of Schwert (1981)

that stock price changes following the announcement can be informative about the market’s




                                                                                                    18
evaluation of the impact of regulation on value. While our focus is on October 4, 2010, we also

examine July 22, 2011, when the D.C. Circuit invalidated proxy access.

       For an event to be useful as a natural experiment, there are several requirements. First, it

has to be unexpected. By all accounts, the SEC’s delay was unexpected, and therefore not

predicted in advance by the marketplace. Second, the value impact has to affect stock prices –

that is, it must be a relatively significant event. The degree of debate and press coverage around

shareholder proxy access suggests that implementation of the Rule was a significant event, and,

by extension, the delay of the rule was also significant. The fact that the SEC had already

implemented shareholder access means that a specific Rule was on the table, and all companies

reacted to the same Rule. Finally, evading the proposed regulatory reform must be difficult or

impossible. Rule 14a-11 is a mandatory rule, with no prospect for opt-out. For this reason,

market prices before October 4 likely did not reflect any possibility that companies might evade

the Rule.

       If the marketplace perceived that shareholder access would increase shareholder value,

then companies that would have been most exposed to the new Rule should decline in value,

relative to companies that would have been more insulated from the Rule. If the marketplace

perceived that shareholder access would decrease shareholder value, then companies that would

have been most exposed to the Rule should increase in value, relative to those that would have

been more insulated. Furthermore, we can use the event to test if the perceived value effect of

shareholder access depends on the features of a firm or its shareholders. For example, the

possibility of board representation may be more valuable when shareholders are sophisticated, or

if they are more willing to get involved with the governance of a firm. Board representation may

be less valuable if the board already represents the views of outside investors well.



                                                                                                  19
       We use several proxies for determining which companies were more and less likely to be

affected by the SEC’s proxy access Rule. First, and most importantly, we examine the

institutional ownership of the companies in our sample, on the assumption that institutions,

particularly institutions that held 3% or more of the company’s stock, would be most likely to

make use of proxy access. We also distinguish between activist institutions such as hedge funds,

and traditionally passive institutions such as index funds, on the view that activist institutions

would be more likely to make use of proxy access. Many institutions are reluctant to exercise

control rights and participate in activism (Pozen 2003, Kahan and Rock 2011). Examples

include index funds and some pension funds (see e.g. Del Guercio and Hawkins 1999). Other

institutions are much more prone to activism and direct influence on corporate governance. For

example, Kahan and Rock (2006) argue that hedge funds have stronger financial incentives and

fewer regulatory constraints than mutual funds, and may therefore be better able to monitor firms

in their portfolios. Greenwood and Schor (2009) also suggest that hedge funds may be better able

to identify underperforming companies.

        Finally, because the SEC’s Rule would have given proxy access to investors who had

held their positions for at least 3 years, we explore empirical specifications that capture the

length of time that the firms’ existing investors, activist or otherwise, have held their stakes.

       We also use three other governance-related measures for determining which companies

were more impacted by the SEC’s proxy access rule. First, we distinguish between companies

incorporated in Delaware and those that are not. At least since May 2009 and likely before,

shareholders in Delaware companies have had the ability to opt-in to shareholder access, while

shareholders of companies incorporated in other states do not clearly have this right. It seems




                                                                                                     20
possible, therefore, that Delaware companies would have benefitted less from SEC-mandated

shareholder access than companies incorporated in other states.

       Finally, we differentiate companies according to whether they have a staggered board,

perhaps the most important antitakeover defense (Bebchuk, Coates & Subramanian 2002), and

according to their Governance Index (Gompers, Ishii and Metrick 2003). Both of these

measures test the theory that companies with greater entrenchment might be more vulnerable to

the SEC’s Rule.

       The impact of shareholder proxy access may also depend on the scope for improvement

in firm performance. A firm with strong current performance and a high stock price may offer

fewer opportunities for intervention. We therefore sort firms based on lagged stock returns and

valuation ratios, to test whether the impact of institutional and activist institutional ownership is

strongest among the firms with the worst recent performance.

       Because our empirical results are based on a single event and stock returns have patterns

of cross-sectional correlation, our approach and our measures of statistical significance must be

adjusted accordingly. Our baseline regressions use risk-adjusted returns, which control for

market performance and the two additional risk factors identified in Fama and French (1993)

(see the data section for details). Using risk-adjusted returns means that we control for the

overall pattern of market movements on October 4. We also report results from using raw

returns as the dependent variable for the sake of completeness.

       We also need to address cross-sectional correlation among stock returns. Incorrectly

assuming independence in stock movements can yield standard error estimates that are biased

downward (Fama and French 2000). Therefore, we do not rely on standard regression standard

error estimates to assess the significance of our coefficient estimates. Instead, we assess the



                                                                                                    21
significance of our results in two ways: GLS standard errors and non-parametric assessment

using the empirical distribution of coefficient estimates. To calculate GLS standard errors, we

follow Greenwood (2005) and use pre-event return data for our sample stocks to estimate the

covariance matrix for individual stock returns. We then use the estimated covariance matrix to

calculate standard error estimates that adjust for the observed correlations between different

stocks.28 Applied to this setting, we find GLS standard error estimates are approximately twice

as large as OLS standard errors. In all tables reporting regressions, we report the GLS standard

errors as well as p-values from the empirical distribution of coefficient estimates.

         As a less parametric approach to assessing significance, we re-estimate each regression in

the 67 trading days after June 30, 2010. We do not use earlier dates because our key variables of

interest are based on institutional holdings as of June 30. We then use the empirical distribution

of coefficient estimates to test the significance of each of our regression coefficients. In other

words, we empirically estimate how many days other than the event day would have delivered

estimated coefficients equal in magnitude to the coefficient we estimate for October 4. Because

our significance estimates using this empirical approach are very similar to the GLS-based

estimates, our tables report only the GLS standard errors.



4. Data

         We collect stock price data from Datastream, and define each stock’s return as the log of

the closing stock price on Monday, October 4, minus the log of the closing stock price on Friday,

October 1. We use a one-day event window because the SEC’s announcement on delaying


28
  In matrix notation, we use                   Ω            to estimate standard errors, where X is a vector of return
data, and  is the pre-event covariance matrix of returns. This differs from basic OLS standard errors which use the
identity matrix in place of . An underlying assumption in this approach is that the pre-event covariance matrix is
an appropriate estimate for the true underlying covariance matrix on October 4.

                                                                                                                   22
shareholder access came out during the trading day on October 4.29 We estimate factor-adjusted

returns based on the Fama-French (1993) three-factor model, which controls for firms’ exposure

to overall stock market movements as well as a value/growth effect and a small firm effect. We

estimate firm betas on the Fama-French factors using daily stock returns for the period between

January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009. We use the daily factor returns from Ken French’s data

library.30 We winsorize all three beta estimates at the 5th and 95th percentiles.

        We take the Gompers, Ishii and Metrick (2003) governance measure for each S&P1500

firm in 2006, the last year for which the index has been calculated. From RiskMetrics, we

identify firms with staggered board provisions and collect data on the number of board members.

We collect data on each firm’s equity value from CRSP; this allows us to run both value-

weighted and equal-weighted empirical tests.

        Institutional ownership data come from ThomsonReuters, which summarizes data from

13F filings by institutional investors. We use data from the second quarter of 2010, because later

data are incomplete.31 We look exclusively at shares held by U.S. institutions. For each

investment manager, we calculate total holdings, as both dollars and number of stocks. For each

firm in the sample we construct the following measures of institutional ownership: the number of

institutional owners; the number of institutional owners above the 3% ownership threshold (the

requirement for proxy access under the Rule); a dummy variable equal to 1 if a firm has at least

one institutional owner with a 3% stake; and the total ownership by institutions.

        Activist institutional investors are more willing to intervene in corporate governance than

institutions overall. Because these investors are particularly aggressive about influencing firm

management and board composition, they are more likely to have made use of proxy access (see

e.g. Brav, Jiang, Partnoy, and Thomas 2008). We use the classification of activist investors

identified by Greenwood and Schor (2009). They construct a sample of activists based on 13D

filings and DFAN filings with the SEC. Investment managers and other investors must file a

13D filling with the SEC within 10 days of acquiring 5% or more of any class of a company's

securities. 13D filings also include a “Purpose of Transaction” section which allows Greenwood

and Schor to identify activist purposes and exclude investors whose 13D filings reflect passive

strategies. DFAN filings are filed with the SEC by investors intending to engage in a proxy fight

with firm management. These filings allow Greenwood and Schor to construct a list of activist

investors, which they identify as investors whose 13D or DFAN filings indicate activist intent.

They identify 177 investment managers as activists, of which 139 are hedge funds and 38 are

non-hedge funds. Many of the activist investors in the Greenwood and Schor sample are serial

activists. In particular, eleven hedge funds account for more than two-thirds of the activist

activity in the Greenwood and Schor sample.32 The Greenwood and Schor classification is

narrow in the sense that some activist investors will not appear because they (a) held stakes that

were too small to trigger the 13D filing requirement; or (b) the purpose statements may not be

accurate, or may become less accurate over time for a given holding (since the filing is done at

initial acquisition).

         We collect firm data from the CRSP-Compustat merged database. For each firm, we

calculate its 2009 end of year book-to-market ratio (book value of common equity divided by the

stock price times number of shares outstanding), minus the mean of its Fama-French (48)

Fama-French 48-sector industry classification.33



5. Results

           Our main sample is the S&P 1500 because these firms are large, liquid, and heavily

traded, but our results also hold for the larger universe of all publicly-traded companies. In the

S&P 1500, we have ownership data for 1,388 firms. Panel A of Table 1 shows the mean

institutional ownership as well as activist institutional ownership, both by decile. There is

substantial variation in each of these measures. Institutional ownership overall amounts to about

half of the typical company’s shares, but in the bottom decile, institutional ownership averages

about 25.3 percent. In the top decile it averages almost 70 percent. Activist institutional

ownership averages 0.05% of the shares in the bottom decile, but over 13% of shares in the top

decile.

           a. Institutional ownership

           Panel B of Table 1 presents summary statistics for four measures of institutional

ownership: the raw total institutional ownership; the number of owners with at least 3% of the

capital; the highest single activist institutional ownership stake; and the number of activist

institutional owners.

           Table 2 sorts firms by institutional ownership, and examine returns on October 4 across

the different levels of institutional ownership. Figure 1 presents the same information in graphic

form. The first column shows that the average equal-weighted return was -124 basis points, but

firms in the highest ownership decile dropped 44 basis points more than firms in the lowest

ownership decile. The difference is statistically significant at the 1 percent confidence level.
33
     Results are similar when we use 12 Fama-French industries, 2-digit NAICS codes, and S&P Industry sectors.

                                                                                                                 25
         The next column reports excess returns, which control for firms’ exposure to the market,

size, and value factors. Using this return measure, the difference between the returns of high and

low institutional ownership stocks is 37 basis points. Sorting on activist owners produces a

differential of 43 basis points. Both of these differences are statistically significant.

         Table 3 presents the baseline regression results. In column (1), we regress the excess

returns for the day of each stock in the S&P 1500 index on institutional ownership. The

coefficient estimate in this specification is -137 basis points, significantly different from zero at

the 10 percent confidence level. Here and throughout the paper, our reported standard errors

account for the observed correlation of individual stock returns, as discussed in Section 3. The

R-squared in this regression is low, reflecting the noisy nature of stock returns and the many

factors that will affect individual securities. Although our event clearly affected a subset of firms

(i.e. the t-stat is significant), it was not the major mover of stock prices that day (this also applies

to the specifications we report below). The coefficient estimate implies that a 10 percentage

point increase in institutional ownership was associated with an additional 14 basis point loss of

value on October 4. Column (2) of Table 3 presents a similar regression for activist institutions.

The estimated coefficients are larger in magnitude and statistically significant at the 1 percent

confidence level. The coefficient estimate implies that a ten percentage point increase in activist

ownership is associated with a 55 basis point drop in value on October 4.34

         In columns (3) and (4), we repeat these tests using excess returns. Our excess return

measures adjust returns based on the Fama-French three-factor model. Betas for the three-factor

model are estimated using daily data from 2009. The coefficient estimate using the

comprehensive institutional ownership measure is -113 basis points, again significant at the ten

34
  Results using the time window [0,2] or [-1,2], i.e. returns of October 2 and October 5, are similar to baseline
results in magnitude and statistical significance. Results with the [0,3] time window which incorporates returns on
October 5 and October, 6, are similar in magnitudes but insignificant.

                                                                                                                  26
percent level. The coefficient estimate for the activist institutional ownership measure is -527

basis points, significant at the 1 percent confidence level. From this point on, we only report

regressions with excess returns. This approach is more conservative, and controls for any

differences in factor exposures across stocks. Columns (5) and (6) of Table 3 examine value-

weighted excess returns. Coefficient estimates are slightly larger, but the estimated statistical

significance falls.35

         These results are consistent with a loss in value for those firms expected to benefit from

proxy access in the future. Are they also consistent with a general loss of faith in SEC

enforcement? We believe that they are. However, this does not appear to explain the lower

returns for firms that were more likely proxy access targets, since there is no reason that SEC

enforcement generally should affect exactly those firms that had high activist ownership. Put

differently, we cannot evaluate the extent that the case was perceived as bad news for the SEC’s

ability to enforce more generally, as long as that effect was market-wide (or affected a different

set of firms from those we identified using activist ownership). We cannot extract the market’s

view of the SEC’s general ability to enforce rules.

         b. Intra-day returns

         We now turn to intra-day returns to assess the extent to which our 1-day results can be

attributed to the SEC’s announcement on proxy access. We start with within-day trading data

from Bloomberg for all available firms from the S&P 1500 for October 4, 2010. We divide the

trading day into 5-minute windows and calculate for each stock the average trading price during

the 5-minute window. We then calculate a cumulative return measure for each 5-minute window

35
   If the observed price drop for firms with high activist ownership reflected temporary price pressure as activists
dumped their positions, we might expect smaller responses for large institutions since these have deeper and more
liquid trading, and can be expected to have smaller price responses to idiosyncratic trading. The fact that the point
estimates in the value weighted regress are larger, suggests that we are not necessarily measuring a temporary price
movement. We discuss this issue, and try longer time windows to address this concnern, below.

                                                                                                                   27
using the change in price from the previous day’s close to price observed within that window.

We then estimate 79 different regressions of cumulative returns on our activism measure: one for

each of the 78 within-day windows and one for the return based on market closing price.

        Figure 2 shows the results of our analysis. The aggregate market movement that we

document in Table 2 occurs mostly during the morning hours, while the divergence between the

activist-owned firms and other firms appears to have come mostly in the afternoon, after the

SEC’s announcement. The effect appears to have accelerated at the end of the day, after the

Bloomberg coverage of the SEC’s announcement. This intra-day analysis suggests that our

observed activism effect is not a spurious result arising from insufficient control for the overall

market movement; in addition, the timing also appears consistent with the hypothesis that the

SEC’s announcement caused the underperformance of activist-held firms on October 4, 2010.

        c. Alternative specifications

        Table 4 examines alternative measures of institutional ownership. In column (1), we

measure the largest institutional stake (as a share of firm equity value), including both activist

and non-activist institutions. The estimated coefficient is negative and not statistically

significant. Column (2) regresses the October 4 excess return on the largest single activist stake,

and our estimated coefficient of -642 basis points is statistically significant at the 1 percent

confidence level. The fact that this coefficient is larger than the coefficient for total activist

ownership highlights the role of large single activist investors. This is consistent with an

important role for concentrated institutional ownership, and may reflect coordination costs or

free-riding (see e.g., Grossman and Hart 1980, Shleifer and Vishny 1986).

        The third alternative measure is motivated by the details of the SEC’s Rule, which would

have required an owner to have a 3 percent stake to qualify for proxy access. Although the Rule



                                                                                                      28
would have allowed investors to combine for the purpose of proxy access, having an individual

owner above the 3 percent threshold means that proxy access was feasible without coordination.

Having more such owners might increase the likelihood further (this number ranges from zero to

four). In column (3), the coefficient on the number of institutional owners with stakes above 3

percent is negative and significant at the 1 percent level. The coefficient estimate implies that

each additional large, institutional owner in a firm is associated with a reduction of equity value

by 33 basis points on October 4.

         d. Firm heterogeneity

         Having established that activist ownership is associated with negative returns on October

4, we now test hypotheses about the relationship between firm characteristics and the value of

proxy access. Table 5 presents the results of this analysis. All of these results use excess return

measures, use the S&P 1500 sample, and control for activist institutional ownership. In general,

the evidence of any role for governance metrics is weak.

         Our first test looks at the impact of staggered boards, as a proxy for corporate governance

at each firm. The regression results in column (1) of Table 5 suggest that having a staggered is

not predictive of stock return on the event day. In column (2), we use the Gompers, Ishii and

Metrick (2003) governance index (“G”). The hypothesis is that firms with poor governance

measures (high G values) may see larger potential benefits from shareholder proxy access.

Again, the results are close to zero, and we cannot reject a zero effect at standard confidence

levels.36

         We next turn to Delaware incorporation. Because Delaware corporate law already

facilitates opt-in proxy access, the SEC rule might have had a smaller effect for Delaware


36
  We have also included the interaction of the GIM index with activist ownership. This interaction is not related to
returns, suggesting that the value of the governance index does not mediate the important of proxy access.

                                                                                                                  29
companies.37 Alternatively, if investors perceived that a proxy access proposal would not be

prohibited in other states, notwithstanding their lack of explicit recognition of the possibility of

opting in, then Delaware firms should react no differently than firms in other states. We test

these competing hypotheses by including the interaction of a dummy for Delaware incorporation

and institutional ownership, as well as a dummy variable for Delaware incorporation. The

coefficient estimate on the Delaware dummy itself is negative and significant. The interaction of

the Delaware dummy with institutional ownership is positive and significant at the 10 percent

confidence level. The different coefficients imply that non-Delaware firms saw value drop by 81

basis points for every 10 percentage points of activist ownership, while Delaware-incorporated

firms dropped by only 31 basis points per 10 percentage points of activist ownership (=0.1*(-

810+497) basis points). Thus, the estimated effect of institutional ownership is much smaller for

Delaware firms, consistent with our prediction that the marketplaces considers explicit

recognition of opt-in proxy access at Delaware firms to be meaningful.

        We also examine board structure, specifically, board size. Yermack (1996) argues that

smaller boards are more effective than large boards. If this is true, there may be less scope for

improvement for firms with small boards, and so the proxy rule announcement return might be

larger (i.e., smaller losses for firms that were already well managed). On the other hand,

shareholder nominees might have more influence on a smaller board than on a larger board (even

though the fraction of directors remains the same, at one-quarter), and so the withdrawn rule

might have had more impact on firms with small boards. We test these competing hypotheses

for board size in column (4) of Table 5. The coefficient on the board size variable is positive and


37
  The same argument would also hold for North Dakota companies, where the corporate law since 2007 has
provided mandatory proxy access for any 5% shareholder that has held their shares for at least two years. See
Publicly Traded Corporations Act ch. 102, 2007 N.D. Laws 497, codified at North Dakota Cent. Code § 10-35-08.
However, there are no North Dakota firms in the S&P 1500.

                                                                                                            30
statistically insignificant, indicating that the value loss on October 4 did not depend on board

size.38

          e. Investor heterogeneity: holding periods

          We next examine the effect of institutional holding periods. The proposed SEC Rule

would have given proxy access to investors whose stakes had been held for 3 years or more. We

thus construct two additional measures of institutional ownership: the first measure (used in

columns (2) and (5) of Table 6) is a measure of institutional ownership that includes only the

institutional stakes that have been held for more than 3 years. The second measure is based on a

weighting scheme, applying a (1/12) weight for holdings held for only 3 months, up through a

(12/12) weight to holdings held for 12 quarters. Therefore, the variable puts progressively more

weight on holdings that are closer to qualifying under the Rule. Columns (1)-(3) use the baseline

measure of institutional ownership, the measure of three year old stakes, and the weighted

measure. Columns (4)-(6) we use only activist investors, and apply the same three methods.

Coefficient estimates are higher when we use the measures of ownership that control for holding

duration, and as before borderline significant for overall institutions, and highly significant for

activists. This finding is consistent with the marker reaction on October 4 reflecting holding

periods as well as the amount of institutional ownership.

          f. Lagged firm performance

          Our final analysis examines the relationship between lagged firm performance and the

results we have described above. The scope for improvement by activist investors should vary

across firms, and be related to firms’ previous performance. We test this hypothesis by sorting

firms based on variables related to recent performance: the end of 2009 book-to-market ratio (the


38
 We have replicated this finding with alternative measures of board size, such as the number of directors per
million dollars of equity market value (unreported).

                                                                                                                31
ratio of equity book value to market value) and the stock return over 2007-2009. For each of

these variables, we demean by Fama-French industry using all firms in the same 48-industry

classification. Our assumption is that poor performance relative to a firm’s industry is a good

proxy for the available scope of potential improvements. Table 7 presents the results of this

analysis. Columns (1) and (2) are split by 2007-2009 stock return; columns (3) and (4) are split

by market-to-book ratios.39 The impact of activist institutional ownership is larger in firms with

poor recent performance. The difference between the coefficient estimates in the subsamples is

large but insignificant for both splits.

         g. The D.C. Circuit decision event date (July 22, 2011)

         We repeat our event study methodology on July 22, 2011, when the D.C. Circuit

invalidated the proxy access Rule. Results are reported in Table 8, using 2010Q2 measures of

activist holdings, for equal-weighted raw returns, equal-weighted excess returns and value-

weighted excess returns for the one day event window of the day of the ruling. The estimate for

equal-weighted excess return (the smallest estimate of the three) is -463 basis points, implying

that a 10% difference in activist holdings corresponds to a 4.6% loss in value on the July 22. The

loss in value for firms with activist owners is therefore slightly smaller on July 22 than on

October 4 of the previous year, but directionally similar. To the extent that the court’s ruling was

a further negative surprise regarding the availability of proxy access going forward, these results

are consistent with the results reported with respect to the October 4 event date (that is,

companies that were more vulnerable to shareholder proxy access suffered an abnormal decline

on that day)The smaller estimated effect might be due to the fact that the July 22 event changed

39
  Because we split by whether a firm is above or below average, not median, industry performance, and because we
define averages for all Compustat firms, not just the S&P1500 group, the subsamples are not exactly of equal size.
The logic of the test seems to suggest that the best possible split into strong and weak performers is more important
than getting equal size samples. Splitting so that samples are equal size provides qualitatively similar results. We
have also performed splits into more groups (i.e., quartiles), with similar results.

                                                                                                                  32
expectations on proxy access less than the October 4 event. On October 4, the likelihood of

proxy access went from virtually 100% to 0%, at least for 2011 and maybe for longer. On July

22, the likelihood of proxy access went from something substantially less than 100% to 0%, at
                                           40
least for 2012 and maybe for longer.



6. Discussion

        We find that the companies that would have been most vulnerable to the SEC’s

shareholder proxy access rule experienced a statistically significant drop in value after the

unexpected delay in the Rule on October 4, 2010. The magnitude of the implied positive effect

of proxy access that we find is economically significant. We estimate that firms that would have

been most affected by proxy access, as measured by overall institutional ownership, lost 12 basis

points of value for each standard deviation of ownership. For firms that had large ownership

stakes held by historically activist institutions, the value loss was almost five times as large. The

results highlight the importance of the process for nominating and electing directors.

        This value loss is particularly striking because the October 4 event only created some

probability (less than 1) of losing shareholder proxy access. We find a directionally similar,

though not statistically significant, drop in shareholder value on July 22, 2011, when the D.C.

Circuit invalidated the SEC’s proxy access rule. To the extent that the market did not anticipate

the D.C. Circuit’s decision, our October 4 results only measure the value loss from delaying

shareholder proxy access by one year. That is, the value of shareholder proxy access is likely to

be larger than what is captured in our event study.


40
   By way of comparison, Bebchuk, Cohen and Wang (2011) found a positive and significant stock market reaction
when the Delaware Chancery Court (in effect) unexpectedly weakened staggered boards, and then a negative and
statistically significant stock market reaction when the Delaware Supreme Court unexpectedly reversed the
Chancery Court decision. The two events in the Bebchuk et al. study operated in opposite directions.

                                                                                                            33
       Our findings are consistent with Cohn et al. (2011), which uses three event dates from

2010 (though not October 4). They find that the events that they argue increased the likelihood

or impact of shareholder proxy access increased firm equity value, and events that decreased the

likelihood or impact of shareholder access decreased firm equity value.

       Our findings are inconsistent with Larcker et al. (2010) and Akyol et al. (2010). These

prior papers found that events that (arguably) increased the likelihood of shareholder proxy

access reduced firm value, and vice versa. The difference between our findings and these prior

papers might be explained by time differences. For example, in 2006-09, the market might have

had a negative view of shareholder proxy access, but this view might have changed by 2010.

Alternatively, or in addition, in 2006-09, the market did not have clarity on what the final Rule

would look like, but by October 2010 the market reacted to a well-defined Rule.

       Another possibility that would explain the different findings between our paper and the

prior related work might be the different methodologies used, or the nature of the events

themselves. For reasons explained in Sections 2-3, we believe that the October 4 event provides

the cleanest test on the value of shareholder proxy access because the October 4 event. In our

view, the October 4 event, unlike all prior events, was material, directionally clear, and also not

expected by the marketplace.

       In order to examine the influence of methodological differences, we examined some of

the dates proposed in other papers using our methodology: i.e. regressing three-factor excess

returns on our measure of activist holdings. In our sample of large firms (S&P1500), coefficient

estimates (the return difference for a one hundred percentage point change in institutional

ownership) for June 16-17, 2010; June 24-25, 2010 and August 25, 2010 were 156, 17, and 279




                                                                                                    34
basis points, respectively.41 The t-statistics for these coefficients, using the Greenwood (2005)

GLS standard errors, are -0.78, 0.11 and 1.77, respectively. In other words, by our methodology,

these dates do not deliver significant returns at the 95% statistical confidence level, a result that

is consistent with our view (as discussed in Section 2) that these events were unlikely to have

surprised the market. If instead of using the Greenwood (2005) GLS standard errors, we use

standard error estimates that do not control for cross-stock correlations, our estimated t-stats

become -1.37, 0.17, and 3.25, respectively. With these less precise standard errors, one out of

three events appears to be statistically significant. When we use raw returns as the dependent

variable (i.e. returns that are not adjusted for the impact of broad market movements, as captured

by the 3-factor Fama French model), the coefficients and t-statistics (still unadjusted) are 57

(t=6.47), 26 (t=2.48) and -837 (t=2.91). Using raw rather than factor-adjusted returns amounts to

ignoring the factor and market exposures of activist-held firms, and is not, in our view, an

appropriate econometric approach. These differences highlight the importance of addressing

econometric concerns related to cross-correlation when dealing with individual stock returns.

           Regardless of the underlying explanations for the difference between our findings and the

prior work, our paper, along with Cohn et al., challenges the conventional wisdom that the

market believed that shareholder access reduced equity values. The causal mechanism for this

alternative view is straightforward: enhancing activist investors’ voice in corporate governance

increases firm value. This value effect was a consistent theme among proponents of the

shareholder access Rule during the SEC’s comment period. For example, Roy Katzovicz,

general counsel for Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital, noted in his comment letter:

           Engaged shareholders with meaningful stakes in the companies in which they
           invest have the potential to regulate corporate conduct through private and market
           behavior. The existing tools of shareholder engagement, however, have not
41
     These dates are included in Cohn et al (2011).

                                                                                                    35
         proven to be sufficient or optimally suited for that task. We believe that the
         SEC’s proposal to require public companies to include shareholder nominees in
         corporate proxy materials goes a long way toward better equipping shareholders
         to be more effective monitors of corporate behavior and, as a result, another force
         for good corporate governance.42


         An alternative interpretation is that activist investors “dumped” shares on October 4. As

a starting point in assessing this claim, we find no evidence (in unreported analyses) of abnormal

trading volumes on October 4, either overall or at companies that would have been particularly

vulnerable to the Rule. Indeed, it would be unusual for an activist investor to have held shares

for three years in anticipation of proxy access, and then to have dumped shares within hours

when there was a delay in gaining access to this right. But even taking this theory at face value,

it would be important to understand why activist investors dumped shares. If they did so because

their future voice had been unexpectedly reduced and therefore future cash flows were

diminished, then this motivation would be consistent with the conclusion that shareholder access

improves firm equity value. If instead activists dumped shares because they would be delayed

in their ability to extract private benefits at the expense of other shareholders and the company

overall, then this motivation would be consistent with the conclusion that shareholder access

reduces firm equity value. As above, our analyses thus far cannot rule out this alternative

explanation.



7. Conclusion

  http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-10-09/s71009.shtml. See also Comment Letter from Capital Research and
Management (an activist fund with $775 billion in assets under management): “As long-term investors actively
engaged in voting proxies in the interest of our funds’ shareholders, we support a process which allows for
meaningful director elections, particularly in cases where corporate boards historically have been unresponsive to
investor concerns.”

                                                                                                                     36
          This paper uses a relatively clean natural experiment to assess the shareholder wealth

implications of shareholder proxy access. Contrary to the prior event studies on proxy access,

we find significant negative abnormal returns for companies that were most vulnerable to

shareholder access on October 4, 2010, when the SEC unexpectedly delayed proxy access for

U.S. public companies. We find directionally similar, but slightly smaller, results on July 22,

2011, when the D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of the Business Roundtable. These findings are

consistent with the view that financial markets placed a positive value on shareholder access, as

implemented in the SEC’s 2010 Rule. The difference between our result and earlier work may

reflect different methodologies, and in particular the different events used. Our view is that the

October 4 announcement makes a particularly useful event for empirical work because it was

both material and unexpected.

          Our results might be useful to shareholders in determining how to vote on proxy access

proposals under the current regime. In addition, because the D.C. Circuit did not reach the

Business Roundtable’s constitutional challenges, it remains possible that the SEC might propose

a new proxy access rule in the future. Prior to the announcement of the D.C. Circuit’s decision,

the New York Times observed that “the lack of empirical evidence at the time the S.E.C. made its

decision will be an issue in the District of Columbia court case.” Our results might contribute to

addressing this perceived deficiency if the SEC were to return to the issue of proxy access in the

future.

This table reports stock returns for S&P1500 firms by institutional ownership or activist institutional ownership
decile for Monday, October 4, 2010. Returns outside of [-0.3, 0.3] are excluded. Return data is from Datastream,
