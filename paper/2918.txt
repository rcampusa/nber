        In this paper we generalize the target zone exchange rate as model
   formalized by Krugman (1988b) to include finite-sized interventions in
   defense of the zone. The main contributions of these pages consist of
   linking the recent developments in the theory of target zones to the
   mirror-image theory of speculative attacks on asset price fixing regimes
   and in using aspects of that linkage to give an intuitive interpretation
   to the smooth pasting" condition usually invoked as a terminal condition.

      Agents in the public or private sectors often follow one systemic set

of   actions when   their environment lies within some prescribed boundaries

and   switch to another    set of actions when the boundaries are reached.

Their   recognition of the presence of the boundaries ties the two sets of
actions   together. In previous work, we have studied economic behavior in

similar situations, but we found it difficult to produce closed form

solutions. Jj

      Recently, several authors have investigated this class of problems

with a set of tools that readily generates closed form solutions in a

stochastic setting. The new research, aimed at issues in exchange rate

policy, has been due to Smith (1987), Krugman (1987. 1988). Smith and

Smith (1988), Miller (1988), Klein (1988), and Froot and Obstfeld (1989).

Additional     work in a .iicroeconomic setting has been carried out by Krugman
(1987), Bertola (1987), and Dixit (1987, 1988).
        All   this recent work was partly stimulated    by   the publication of

Harrison (1985), which shows how to derive closed form solutions for a

variety of problems in controlled Erownian motion. Harrison's results

make it   easy to    implement the idea that   the   anticipation of "bumping Into"

the boundaries generates important nonlinearities that are not well

modeled by linear approximations.




  j/ In Flood and Garber (1980. 1983b), we studied the impact of an
endogenous triggering of monetary reform on the current price level in the
German hyperinflation. In Flood and Carber (1983a). we considered the
determination of the current floating exchange rate when the regime would
switch to a fixed rate system at an endogenously determined, random tirue.

     In this paper, we will arbitrage yet another result from Harrison

(1985) into the study of exchange rate target zones. We will generalize

the target zone (TZ) exchange rate as model formalized by Krugman (1988W

and extended by Froot and Obstfeld (1989). 1.!   the   Itrugi.an   it bears some
resemblance to the European Monetary System (EMS), where members agree to

maintain their exchange rates within prespecified bands. While the EMS

recognizes the possibility of occasional band shifts (devaluations), we

will study a system in which the exchange rate bands are permanent. 2/

     The main contribution of these pages consists of linking the recent

developments in the theory of target zones to the mirror-image theory of

speculative attacks on asset price fixing regimes. j/ We also use aspects

of this linkiage to provide an intuitive interpretation of the "smooth

pasting" condition, generally invoked as a terminal condition in this

literature.

     We aim to unify these two literatures by showing that the solution

concepts in both are identical. Indeed, we can show that in the TZ

context speculative attacks must generally occur as a result of a policy

to defend the zone. 4/ Thus, Krugman's recent (1987, 1988) work is

  2/ The TZ models can readily be integrated with models of speculative
attacks either of the buying or selling varieties, if a limit is placed on
the amount of reserves or bonds that the authorities are willing to buy or
sell to defend the zone.

actually &   •tep   toward coming full circle on his (1979) contribution on

balance-of-payments crises.

     We derive our results in the two remaining sections. In Section II,

we present the exchange rate TZ problem in a standard exchange rate model.

The TZ literature developed thus far has considered only the case of

infinitesimal interventions. A closed-form solution for the exchange

rate for the case of discrete-sized interventions can be read directly

from results in Harrison (1985), however. Therefore, we simply reproduce

the relevant problem from Harrison and indicate those properties of

Harrison'. solution which convey economic intuition about boundary

conditions. In Section III, we restudy the IZ problem in the ilanner of

Krugman and of Froot and Obstfeld using the boundary conditions developed

in Harrison for discrete interventions. We also extend the analysis to

situations in which the policy authority may use discrete interventions of

uncertain magnitude to keep the exchange rate within possibly stochastic

boundaries. Finally, we also examine the interest rate implications of

adopting a TZ in this model and conclude by placing the current analysts

in a broader perspective.


                         II. A Model of Tarzet Zones

     The TZ is a nonlinear compromise between fixed exchange rates and

freely flexible exchange rates. The basic idea of the exchange rate TZ is

that a country or group of countries sets explicit margins within which

exchange rates will be allowed to fluctuate. While the exchange rate is

within those boundaries, policy can be directed toward other goals. When

the boundary is reached, the policy maker focuses resources on maintaining
                                    -4-


the boundaries. The TZ does not preclude foreign exchange interventions

inside the boundaries. Indeed, the TZ studied by Xrug.an simply does not

specify govenu.ent behavior inside the TZ boundaries, Of course, this is

the point of the TZ. While the exchange rate ii      inside   the band, policy

can be directed as desired toward goal. other than fixing the exchange

rate. JJ

     Xrugman (1988) was able to characterize the behavior of the exchange

rate within a target zone when exchange rates are driven by reeulated

3rownian notion. Regulated Brownian notion is Brownian notion with

occasional intervention by a regulator, which we identify as a policy

authority. In Krugman's case, the unregulated fundamentals follow

nondrifting Brownian motion. The intervention which regulates the process

is triggered by the edges of the TZ, which are syimietric     about zero.
Froot and Obstfeld (1989) extend Krugman's results to the case of

fundamentals following Brownian   notion   with constant drift and to

nonsyimEetric zones. 2/



  / There    is no claim that such a nonlinear setting of policy would be
welfare improving compared to linear nonsterilized intervention in
response to a set of indicator variables. In fact, for fairly general
quadratic welfare functions, the optimal policy is linear. Therefore, the
case for a TZ must rely on, for example, welfare's being poorly modeled by
a quadratic function, the optimal settings of the coefficients in a linear
policy rule being difficult to achieve (with the TZ providing a better
welfare outcome than inappropriate coefficients in a linear policy), or
possibly some multilateral negotiating aspects of a TZ providing a better
chance of reaching a near Pareto optimal policy than would be true for a
linear policy.
  2/ Obstfeld and Froot (1989) have also extended these results to the
case of a different forcing process, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and
to the case of absorbing barriers, The absorbing barriers case was
studied by Flood and Carber (1983a) with closed form solutions first
derived by Smith (1987).

     W. extend this analysis to allow both a discrete intervention and the

possibility that intervention may be triggered randomly. While both

extensions are required before models of this type can be applied to data.

the ability to obtain solutions for discrete interventions is the more

interesting result. This extension provides the intuitive link between

the earlier literature on discrete attacks on foreign exchange reserves

and clarifies the latitude available to a policy authority while

maintaining the fl

     To study the behavior of the exchange rate inside the band, Krugman

and Froot and Obstfeld use a standard law of motion for a flexible price
                                          -
exchange rate model: Jf


     (1)   x(t) —   k(t)   +   aEfdx(t)I/dt.   a > 0.

x(t) is the logarithm of the exchange rate, a can be interpreted as the

Cagan interest rate semi-elasticity, and the expectation operator is

conditioned on current inforaation. Only information about the forcing

variable k(t) is relevant to the exchange market. In a standard monetary

approach model, k(t) is a linear combination of the logarithms of foreign

and domestic money supplies, real incomes, money demand disturbances and

real exchange rate movements.




  jJ The law of motion would be generated in the exchange rate models of
Bilson (1978), Frenkel (1978), and Mussa (1978). The same model was
adapted by Flood and Carber (l983a) to a continuous tine stochastic
environment with future exchange rate fixing. The underpinning of the law
of motion would be a Cagan money demand function in two countries,
purchasing power parity, and open interest parity. Other models, of
course, would produce laws of motion for the exchange rate of a similar
form with different interpretations of the forcing variables.

        k(t) can be controlled by intervention of the monetary authorities.

Specifically, the authorities can control k(t) to assure that


        (2) x>x>x1
where xa and x' are the upper and lower bounds of the exchange rate TZ,

respectively. Krugman and Eroot and Obstfeld assume that the authorities

interfere with the motion of Ic only when x reaches the boundaries of the

TZ. j/ When the exchange rate is inside the TZ boundaries, k follows a

random walk with drift that is independent of the exchange rate: 21


        (3)     dk — 7dt +   odz

where q and a are constants and z is a standard Wiener process.

implying that the variance of k over any period t         is   02t and that

1.      An exchange rate solution with discrete intervention
        We now transcribe from Harrison (1985) the closed form        exchange rate
solution when intervention is         discrete. Consider a situation in which the

Brownian       notion with drift process Ic is controlled as in Figure 1. When
it    is between the bounds k" and k' 1€      follows the Brownian   motion process

of    equation (3).      When Ic hits the upper bound k". an intervention throws Ic

discontinuously back to the interior point Q — Ic"        -
                                                               1u, where I" measures


     Jj Both x and k are       functions of time, however, we will usually
suppress       the time dependence notation in the following presentation.
  2/ Krugman assumes a zero drift parameter. Froot and Obstfeld argued
that the policy specification in Krugaan is incomplete since both discrete
Jumps in kK and infinitesimal interventions are compatible with a given
TZ. They base their discussion on a similar point nade in Obstfeld and
Stockman's (1985) discussion of an indeterminacy in Flood and Carber
(1983a). Nevertheless, they consider only the case of infinitesimal
intervention. It turns out that this case implies intervention only at
the boundaries of the TZ.

the magnitude of intervention. At Q,       the process resumes the random

action given in equation (3).        II k hits the lower bound k1 it is thrown

back to the point q—k' • l Of course, when I" 11_O, we have the

case of Froot and Obstfeld: asymmetric reflecting barriers with

infinitesimal interventions. When, in addition, ij — 0 and k" —      -id,   we

have the symmetric case of Krugman.

     These discontinuous shifts in k can be interpreted as interventions

that occur to saintain the exchange rate k within its prescribed bounds.

Krugman implicitly and Froot and Obstfeld explicitly assume that such

interventions are infinitesimal; they associate the attainment of x' with

the simultaneous attainment of lc1.      Je doubt, however, that agents

operating in a TZ would be sure that any intervention would be

infinitesimal and would take place only at the TZ boundary. In the

generalization to discrete interventions, these two events will not

coincide. J

     How will the exchange rate, x, behave under such circumstances? Note

that the exchange rate solution for the differential equation (1) can be

written as:



     (4) x —   g(k(0))   —   'E   [7 k (r)exp(—c)dr Ik(0)]


The analytical solution of this integral, as well as the layout in

Figure 1. is presented in Harrison (1985). Chapter 3, page 52, problem 13,



  j/ Apparently actual interventions by the bundesbank in defense of the
ENS margins neither take place only at the declared exchange rate margins
nor is the size of the intervention always related to the proximity of the
margins.

for the case where units are chosen so that xT —                     0.      From special cases

of this solution, it is easy to arbitrage most of the results of the

literature applying controlled rownian notion to economics. For current

purposes, however, we note that the general functional for, of the

solution is exactly that of Krugman and Froot and Obstfeld:


        (5) x — g(k) — It + aq + Aexp              [A11c) +   B.xp   (A2kJ


where

For a given U even the constant terms A and B are identical to those of

Krugman and Froot and Obstfeld, thoug)i they are apparently determined by

different boundary conditions.

        We graph Harrlion's solution for the function gOt) for the case of

discrete intervention in Figure 2. The functional form in equation (5) is

invariant to the size of the intervention; and I" and I will affect

neither A nor B for a given TZ. Also, it can be shown with some

manipulation that Harrison's solution for x as a function of It is

continuous at It —        It"   and It —       so that g(k") —        g(k"    -   I")   and

         — g(k1 +   Il).        We will present an intuitive argument for this result

and use it as a boundary condition below.

2.    A derivation of the fimetional for, of the exchanee rate solution
      Our presentation    of   Harrisons solution for g(Ic) without          any
development is a bit mysterious. Therefore, we now follow Krugman and

Froot and Obstfeld a to develop the functional form of the solution

presented by Harrison. Suppose that the exchange rate solution is

x —   g(k).   Our   problem   is to develop the g(k) function explicitly.

       If g(k) is the solution then Edx/dt can be derived from the

appropriate differential of the g(k) function. The g(k) function and thus

the exchange rate is driven by k. which follows a Weiner process.

Therefore we must apply Ito differentiation to g(k). According to

Harrison (1985) page 65 we obtain: 1/


      (6) dx —      g(k)dk     • (l/2)g (k)dk2

on current information. Inside the TZ. E(dk) — ndt since Edz —                 0.   Since

                                                            —

      — o2dt (see Harrison, page 65) so that equation (6) may be rearranged

to become:


      (7) Edx]/dt —     8(k)i7     +    (l/2)g   (k)a2


Now substitute from equation (7) into equation (1) to find:




  jJ The stochastic differential of x is slightly different from the
differential we normally encounter because though the path of the variable
Ic is continuous, it is not differentiable in the normal sense. Conse-
quently the normal rules of differentiation are not applicable and we
must use a slightly different derivative concept, the Ito dervivative as
in equation (6).

      (8) x — g(k) — k + o[g'(k)q                 • (l/2)g''(k)a21

Equation (8) is a second order linear differential equation, which we

solve by: (1) finding a particular solution; (2) combining the

particular solution with the hosogenous solution; and (3) applying

appropriate boundary conditions.

      A particular solution is obtained by ignoring           the   TZ. Without the TZ

equations (1) and (3) require x —       k   + W7,   and   this is a particular

solution to equation (8). The homogenous part of the solution is

x —               +   RexptA2kI.   The su, of the two parts of the solution is
      Aexp(4k1
the general solution given in equation (5) with 4 and A2              as   above.

Obtaining a complete solution requires application of the appropriate

boundary conditions.

3.     Miandary   conditions and the exolicit       exebante rate    solution
       Though the explicit solution is available with some manipulation of
Harrison's result, we prefer for expositional purposes to develop the

solution for the problem of discrete interventions along the intuitive

lines provided by Krugaan and Froot and Obstfeld. To solve for A and & in

equation (5), Froot and Obstfeld (following Krugman) impose the "smooth

pasting conditions," a requirement that g.(ku) — 0 and g'(kt) — 0.                  These

two conditions provide sufficient boundary information to determine A

and   3.
       to   see that these conditions are valid in the cases studied by

Krugman and Froot and Obetfeld, let us consider Figure 2. the diagra. of

Harrison's solution for discrete interventions. Define 1çmaI' and                        as

the solutions of g'(k) — 0.         Note that Ic"> klUx > Q and            <        c   q.
                                     - 11   -




Assuring that the endpoints of the segment defined by I always lie on the
solution curve at the same vertical height, let i" converge to zero.

Similarly, let il converge to zero. Q and Ic" will then converge to

and q and Ic1 will converge to kmin. Therefore, for infinitesimal

interventios, 8(k") —     g(k1),   the smooth pasting condition. The smooth

pasting condition is applicable for infinitesimal interventions, but it is

inapplicable for finite interventions. Similarly, the assumption that the

TZ boundary points are attained simultaneously with     the   Ic boundary points

is true only in the case of infinitesimal intervention.

4.   Continuity at the boundaries

     What   is   the intuition behind the continuity of the exchange rate in

the presence of discrete forseen interventions?      This is a natural

requirement familiar from the speculative attack literature. If there

were a discontinuity in response to an anticipated intervention i.e. •       if
g(k") did not equal g(k"-V3). there would be a foreseeable profit at an

infinite rate, Speculators would act to remove this opportunity.

     Recall that in the speculative attack literature of Krugman (1979) or

Flood and Garber (1984), domestic credit is usually rigged with upward

drift. An attack on a fixed exchange rate system is timed to prevent an

expected discontinuity in exchange rates. In the context of equation (1)

exchange rate continuity in the face of an expected attack on the fixed

rate regime requires the exchange rate to be the same in the instant just

before and the instant just after the attack. Yet, the expected rate of

change of the exchange rate would jump discontinuously from zero to a

positive number, driving down money demand and accomodating the sudden

loss of reserves at the moment of the attack.
                                                - 12   -




          The logic for a discrete intervention in a TZ is identical. When the

distance from Ic to k" is infinitesimally small, there will be a shift from

k'' to Q    with    probability one. Since the expected value of the integral

in equation (4) takes account of the shift, its value will not change when

the shift occurs. Now evaluate equation (1) at Ic" and Q,                   respectively.
and subtract the two results. Since the exchange rate is the same at the

two k values, the result is:


(9)         k'' -   Q   —     — -atEdx/dt   -
                                                           Edx/dt
                                            jk—k                    k—Q


The discontinuous           shift in It (e.g.. the reduction in foreign reserves or
bond holdings           of the policy authority) exactly offsets the discontinuous

shift in expectations.

          In this It problem, the shift in the expected depreciation adjusts to

the arbitrary magnitude of the intervention. In the speculative attack

literature, the magnitude of the intervention adjusts to the specified

shift in expected depreciation rates rigged into the problem. Otherwise.

the problems are identical.

          Indeed, there is even a run on reserves in the Ti               model.   When k

(domestic credit) reaches a high enough level, speculators will approach

the policy authority to convert domestic currency for reserves, thereby

forcing an intervention of the prescribed magnitude. This monetary

alignment      crisis (MAC Attack) serves to preserve the TZ, however.
    The relevant (AS) pair for a specific intervention strategy that
supports a particular It can be found by noting that x" — g(kma) and
          g(kThi), where u and x1 are the announced TZ bounds. For arbitrary
      —



values of A and B, we can find kma)t and kmit the critical values of g(k),
                                      - 13   -




as functions of A and 5. Substituting these functions into x" — g(kma))

and xt —    (kmuhI) yields two equations in the unknowns (A,B). In the
Appendix    we sketch more completely the determination of A and B        for a

particular intervention strategy.
     The continuity condition requires that gUi") — g(k" - 1u) and
g(k1 + Il). These two conditions are also sufficient to determine A and S
in equation (5)    as   functions of the policy quadruple (Ic", Q,   q,   Ic1). The
pair     (AS) associated with a specific TZ can therefore be generated by an

infinite number of combinations of values for the inner and outer bounds

on Ic.

         In this sense, simply announcing a specific Ti is not a well-

specified policy. A particular TZ can be supported by an infinity of

intervention strategies. This incompleteness is not an indictment of the

TZ policy, which was designed as a part of a broader policy. Indeed, the

incompleteness of the TZ allows policy to be directed toward other goals

         An interesting case occurs when Q < q as depicted in Figure 3.           In

this case, the exchange rate can float downward toward the floor of the Ti

even though It approaches its upper bound, Ic". When Ic teaches k' &         large
intervention to reduce It occurs although the exchange rate is near or even

at its minima level. Thus, in a situation in which an intervention to

purchase reserves appears necessary to prevent breaching the floor of the

zone,     the intervention instead consists of    a large reserve sale aimed at

preventing     the breaching of the zone's ceiling.

6.      Intervention uncertainty
        In    our analysis so far we have assumed a preannounced intervention

strategy defending a sharp TZ, i.e.        a preannounced pair   (1a1l)• In
practice,      however, it is unlikely that the intervention strategy would be

precisely preannounced and we find interesting the possibility of "soft

zones, •      which we formalize as a probability distribution concerning the
boundaries of the TZ. JJ In this situation we need to examine some

additional possibilities to find a formula for x inside the TZ. In

particular, recall that a 'solutioir for the exchange rate must be of the

form given by equation (3). To use equation (3) in the current setting

let:



       (10)       E(dxj/dt —
                               JfE([dxln.Y]/dt)f(n.Y)dnciY.
where n is an intervention strategy y is a TZ boundary pair and f(ny) is

the distribution function giving the appropriate probability density for

any n.y. For any n and for any y we can solve the model conditionally as

above to get the appropriate values of A and B. We then calculate the

unconditional expected rate of change of x from equation (10) and

substitute the result into equation (1) to find the value of the exchange

rate with stochastic intervention policy.

       Since the actual intervention can surprise private agents.

intervention can result in seemingly perverse exchange rate movements. To

see this point examine Figure 2.       The figure was predicated on the


  j,1 We assume an information structure such that there is no learning
about the nature of intervention or the boundaries of the zone. In our
version both the nature of intervention and the soft boundaries will be
random exogenous variables drawn from a time-invariant distribution.

exchange authority's intervening in aaount I" when k reaches its upper
bound. If instead the authority were to intervene by less than I" then

the currency would actually depreciate.

7.     The   volatility of   exchanze   and interest rates
       Krugman (1988) showed that the TZ will stabilize the exchange rate.
This result occurs because the function gOt)               is   almost everywhere less

responsive      to k than is   the functional       relation between x and k in a pure

floating      regime.

       Yet,    the possibility   of achieving       some   exchange rate stability
without      actually having to intervene has the disturbing appearance of a

free lunch. Where does the volatility go?

       To address this question, let us assume that the domestic interest

rate i equals the constant foreign interest rate plus the expected rate of

depreciation. Since the foreign interest rate is constant,                  the only

volatility in the domestic interest rate stems from movements                   in E(ds].


Then


       (11) V(i(k),t) —        02V(g(k)-k,t)

where V(y,t) is the variance of the variable y over an interval of length

t.

       For both fixed and floating exchange rates V(i(k),t) —0 in the
constant drift cases that we have considered. Since g(k) -                  k   is not


constant for the TZ, however, V(i(k),r                 0 in the target zone. Thus the

exchange rate becomes less volatile at the expense of raising the interest

rate volatility.

                                  IV.   Conclusion
     Public   and private sector agents often adopt one set of actions when

some indicator is within certain bounds and switch to another set of

actions wtien the bounds   are   reached.      Examples       of   such action patterns are

widespread in policy making circles and seem to describe a possibly

i.portant part of the policy making process not captured linear rules.

     The purpose of the present paper was primarily technical: to extend

the literature to the possibility of finite-sized and stochastic

interventions in defense of the U. IJ0 found the terminal conditions

required both for the finite-size interventions and for the infinitesimal

interventions to be most easily understood by relating them to the

mirror image problem of describing an anticipated speculative attack.

                                              Ante ix
     In this Appendix we sketch the developuient of the explicit forirnilas

requited to find A and I when the TZ is defended by finite interventions.

Recall equation (9) in the text. This equation shows                the   shift in the

expected   rate, of change of the exchange rate required to accomodate an
intervention of size i". An analogous formula holds, but is not
displayed, for a finite intervention from below in size I. Note that the
two expected rates of exchange rate change in equation (9) nay be
developed in terms of A and B by using equations (5) and (7), which imply:

    Edx                — qjl       +
                                       A1AexpA1k" + A2BexpA2k")
              1k—k"


                           +   (a2/2)t4AexpA1k" + 4BexpA2k"].

    Edx /dt            —    .j(l   +
                                       A1AexpA1Q + A2Bexp2Q1
              Ik-Q


                           + (o2/2)[AAexpA1Q         +
                                                         ABexpA2Q

These   two   equations may be           substituted into equation (9) to give one

equation      in   A   and B. A second equation in A and may be developed by
considering intervention at the lower bound, which may be finite as above
or infinitesimal as in Krugman and Froot and Obstfeld.
