The Effect of Job Security Regulations on Labor Market Flexibility:

                                            ABSTRACT

Job security provisions are widely believed to reduce dismissals and hiring. In addition, in
developing countries job security is believed to reduce compliance with labor regulations and to
increase informal activity. Reductions in dismissal costs are, thus, often advocated as a way to
increase labor market flexibility and to increase compliance with labor regulations. This paper
analyzes the impact of a substantial reduction in dismissal costs introduced by the Colombian Labor
Market Reform of 1990. A theoretical model illustrates the effect of dismissal costs when there is
a noncompliant sector. The model shows the direct effect of a reduction in dismissal costs on
increased turnover as well as the second order effects on wages and on the composition of the
compliant and noncompliant sectors. Using microdata from the Colombian National Household
Surveys, I exploit the temporal variability in dismissal costs together with the variability in coverage
between formal and informal workers (who are not covered and were, thus, not directly affected by
the reform). The differences-in-differences results indicate increased separations and accessions for
formal workers relative to informal workers after the reform. Moreover, the increase in worker
turnover was greatest among younger workers, more educated workers, and workers employed in
larger firms who are most likely to have been affected by the reform. The estimates, together with
the steady-state conditions of the model, suggest the reform contributed to 10% of the reduction in
unemployment during the period of study.

I. Introduction

       Job security regulations are usually considered to inhibit labor market flexibility by

reducing the ability of firms to hire and fire workers. While severance pay and other job security

provisions admittedly protect workers from unjust termination, these laws may also adversely

affect workers by reducing their ability to find new jobs. State-mandated severance pay and job

security requirements are equivalent to taxes on job destruction that reduce firms’ incentives not

only to dismiss but also to hire new workers. In fact, it has often been suggested that the

elevated severance pay and job security requirements in Europe are in part to blame for the high

unemployment levels in this continent.

       The perception that reducing firing costs would help to reduce unemployment by

enhancing labor market flexibility, through increased worker turnover into and out of

unemployment, has driven several European countries to introduce labor market reforms in this

direction. In particular, a number of countries including, England, France, Germany, and Spain,

introduced temporary contracts during the 1980’s as a way of reducing severance payments and

payments for unjust dismissals. In contrast, American labor markets became more rigid during

the 1980’s. During this decade, a number of states in the U.S. introduced indemnities for unjust

dismissals, thus, creating exceptions to the employment-at-will doctrine.

       Although the evidence on the effects of these legislative changes on employment and

unemployment in Europe and the U.S. has been ambiguous, reforms to reduce labor market

rigidities have also been advocated and implemented in a number of less developed countries. In

less developed countries the effects of these reforms are considered to be even greater, as labor

market regulations are considered not only to discourage hiring and firing, but in addition to

encourage noncompliance with labor legislation and the expansion of the informal sector.

                                                2
        In this paper, I consider the incidence of a substantial reduction of firing costs on

flexibility and unemployment in a less developed country. In particular, this paper studies the

impact of the Colombian labor market reform of 1990, which reduced severance payments

substantially, on worker flows into and out of unemployment and its implied net effect on

unemployment. I use a micro-level data set from Colombia to examine the effects of a reduction

in firing costs on worker turnover. The labor market reform introduced in Colombia in 1990

reduced severance payments for all workers hired after 1990 and covered by the legislation

(formal sector workers). Informal workers, who are not covered by the legislation, were not

directly affected by the reform and, thus, are used as a comparison group in the estimations. The

empirical analysis exploits this variability in the coverage of the legislation between formal and

informal sector workers together with the temporal change in the Colombian legislation to

identify the effects of a reduction in firing costs on the exit rates out of employment and out of

unemployment. The Colombian Household Surveys for June provide information about formal

and informal sector activity and allow estimating hazard rates for formal and informal workers,

before and after the reform. The results of the hazard models using a differences-in-differences

estimator indicate that hazard rates into and out of unemployment increased after the reform for

formal sector workers (covered by the legislation) relative to informal workers (uncovered).

Moreover, the increase in worker turnover was greater among younger more educated workers

employed in larger firms who are likely to have been affected most by the changes in the

legislation.

        The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section II, I survey the evidence on the

effect of firing costs on employment volatility, the speed of employment adjustment, and

employment levels, labor market participation, and unemployment for developed countries. In

                                                3
Section III, I describe the legislative changes, introduced by the Colombian labor market reform

of 1990 that led to a reduction in severance pay and other firing costs. In section IV, I develop a

matching model with endogenous sorting into a formal and an informal sector. The model is

useful as it predicts the direct effect of a reduction in severance pay on worker turnover as well

as the general equilibrium effects of the reform on turnover in the two sectors. Section V

discusses the identification strategy of the firing cost effects on worker turnover. In Section VI, I

describe the data and present the results on the incidence of firing costs on the exit rates into and

out of unemployment. In Section VII, I use the steady-state condition from the model together

with the results in Section VI to estimate the net impact of the reform on unemployment. Section

VIII concludes.

II. Review of the Literature

       The perception that flexible labor markets promote employment and reduce

unemployment is widely accepted. Yet, the theoretical and empirical evidence on the net effects

of firing costs on employment and unemployment are ambiguous.

       Past theoretical work on the effects of firing costs shows that while reductions (increases)

in firing costs are expected to increase (reduce) hiring and firing as well as employment

volatility, the net effects of reductions in firing costs on employment and unemployment are

ambiguous. Theoretically, the net effect of firing costs on employment is very sensitive to the

assumptions of the model. The net effect of firing costs on employment depends crucially on

whether the entry-exit margin is considered and on the stochastic process assumed to be

generating the demand shocks. Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993) simulate the effect of firing

costs in a general equilibrium framework with firm entry and exit and they find that an increase

in firing costs reduces employment. On the contrary, Bentolila and Bertola (1990) consider a

                                                 4
partial equilibrium model with a monopolistic firm and find that employment increases slightly

with firing costs, because the firing effect dominates the hiring effect. In addition, Bentolila and

Dolado (1994) argue that in an insider-outsider model a-lá Lindbeck and Snower (1988), firing

costs may strengthen the position of insiders and increase their employment while reducing the

employment of outsiders.

       Similarly, past empirical evidence indicates that lower firing costs are related to greater

employment volatility, but the evidence of the net effect of firing costs on employment and

unemployment in these studies has been mixed. Bertola (1990) constructs job security indices

for ten countries and finds that job security provisions are negatively correlated with the variance

of employment and with unemployment’s response to output changes (i.e., Okun’s coefficient).

Using a panel of retail firms in the U.S., Anderson (1993) finds that the seasonal variability in

employment is lower in firms facing higher adjustment costs. Moreover, a number of studies

have related the speed of employment adjustment to shocks to the level of firing costs. As

predicted by the theory, Anderson (1993) finds that the probability of responding to shocks is

negatively correlated to the adjustment costs faced by firms. In addition, Hamermesh (1993)

finds that the speed of employment adjustment to shocks fell in non-unionized industries over

the 1980’s in the U.S., when exceptions to the employment-at-will doctrine were being

introduced. Using British data Burgess (1993) finds a lower speed of employment in industries

subject to higher firing costs.    Bentolila and Saint-Paul (1992) also find that employment

adjustments over the business cycle increased in Spain after the introduction of temporary

contracts in 1984. Thus, these studies provide evidence of the greater employment volatility

when firing costs are lower.

       The evidence on the impact of firing costs on employment and unemployment, however,

                                                 5
appear mixed. Lazear (1990) uses cross-country data from 22 developed countries over 29 years

and finds evidence suggesting that high severance payments and advance notice requirements

reduce employment and labor force participation. Grubb and Wells (1993) construct job security

indices for OECD countries and also find a negative correlation between job security and

employment.    Di Tella and MacCulloch (2004) use a measure of flexibility provided by

employers and they find that flexibility is positively correlated with employment and

participation, and to a lesser degree with unemployment. In contrast, Bertola (1990) finds

evidence suggesting that job security provisions are unrelated to medium and long run

employment. Nickell and Layard (1999) find that employment and labor force levels are lower

when employment protection legislation (EPL) is stricter, but since they are exploiting cross-

country variation they cannot control for the fact that female labor force participation is lower

and EPL stricter in Southern European countries. In fact, they find that the results disappear

when considering a sample of adult males. The OECD’s Employment Outlook (1999) exploits

additional temporal variation in EPL and finds no effect of EPL on aggregate employment.

However, consistent with the story that EPL protects insiders, the Employment Outlook finds

that EPL increases the employment of adult men and reduces the employment of young workers

and women.

       Exploiting the temporal change in the labor legislation across states in the U.S.,

Dertouzos and Karoly (1993) find employment levels fell in states that introduced more stringent

employment protection. In contrast, Miles (2000) finds no effect of the changes in unjust

dismissal costs in the U.S. on aggregate employment. However, both Autor (2003) and Miles

(2000) find that stricter employment protection contributed to the rise in temporary employment

in the U.S. over the 1980’s. Anderson (1993), instead, exploits the experience-rating feature of

                                               6
the U.S. unemployment insurance system to quantify adjustment costs and finds higher average

employment in firms subject to higher adjustment costs. The mixed results observed in the

literature are not surprising if one considers that cross-section studies are subject to omitted

variable biases, simultaneity problems, and endogeneity of the legislation. The panel studies

while mitigating the concerns of omitted variable biases and simultaneity are subject to the

possibility of endogeneity of the legislation as well as to selection biases. Thus, while the

evidence on the effects of firing costs on the volatility of employment appears robust, the net

effect of firing costs on employment and unemployment is not as clear.1

          More recently, a handful of studies have exploited the differential variation in labor

legislation for certain groups of workers to set up natural experiments of the impact of firing

costs using microdata. While Acemoglu and Angrist (2001) find no effect of the American with

Disabilities Act on separations of disabled relative non-disabled, Oyer and Schaefer (2000) find

substitution of individual dismissals for mass layoffs after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of

1990 for groups covered by the legislation. Kugler and Saint-Paul (2003) and Autor, Donohue

and Schwab (2003) find increased hires and employment in those states that introduced certain

unjust dismissal provisions over the 1980’s. Finally, Kugler, Jimeno and Hernanz (2003) find

increased hiring of young workers and increased separations of older workers after the

introduction of the Spanish labor market reform of 1997, which reduced dismissal costs and

payroll taxes for these groups of workers.

          While micro studies solve some of the problems in studies relying on macrodata, these

studies have focused on the impact of firing costs in developed countries.                                             There is little


1
  However, a number of recent studies, including Angrist and Kugler (2003), Bertola, Blau and Kahn (2003), and Blanchard and Wolfers (2000),
find that the negative effects of labor market institutions on employment and unemployment are realized when economies are faced with bad
shocks.

                                                                     7
evidence on the impact of firing costs in less developed countries. In the next section, I describe

the legislative change introduced in Colombia in 1990, which allows to exploit the temporal

variability and the variability in coverage of labor legislation to estimate the impact of firing

costs on turnover and unemployment in a less developed country.

III. Changes in the Colombian Institutional Framework

          In 1990, Colombia introduced a labor market reform that substantially reduced the costs

of dismissing workers.                 The Colombian reform reduced severance payments, widened the

definition of ‘just’ dismissals, extended the use of temporary contracts, and speeded up the

process of mass dismissals. All of these policy changes reduced the costs of firing workers

covered by the legislation after 1990.2 The reform, thus, reduced firing costs for firms in the

formal sector but not for informal firms, which did not comply with labor legislation.

          Although the reform introduced various legislative changes simultaneously, the one

major policy change that decreased the costs of dismissals was the reduction of severance

payments.3 The reform reduced the severance paid for dismissals in three ways. First, prior to

the reform, employers were mandated to pay severance of one month per year worked based on

the salary at the time of separation. After the reform, employers were, instead, required to

deposit a monthly contribution equivalent to one month of the yearly salary at that moment in

time to an individual severance payments savings account (“Fondo de Cesantías”), which would

be accessible to workers in the event of separation. Thus, total severance payments were reduced

because the monthly payment per year worked was no longer based on the higher salary at the


2
  In addition to the Labor Market Reform of 1990, a social security reform was passed in 1994 and implemented in 1995 and 1996. However,
since the social security reform increased payroll taxes, the increase in non-wage recurrent costs of this reform implies different effects on
turnover than the reduction in dismissal costs of the Labor Market Reform of 1990. Moreover, the study by Gruber (1997) of a similar reform in
Chile finds no effects of payroll taxes on employment because recurrent costs are passed onto wages.
3
  Note that both before and after the reform, employers were exempt from the payment of severance in cases when employees were dismissed
because of undue care, sabotage, or release of employers’ proprietary information.

                                                                      8
time of separation, but rather on the salary during each month. Second, prior to the reform,

workers could obtain advance payments from their severance to use for investments in education

and housing, that would only be credited to the employer in nominal terms in the event of

separation. After the reform, although the withdrawal of funds was still permitted, these ‘loans’

were now credited to the employer in real terms. According to Ocampo (1987), the fact that,

prior to the reform, withdrawals were credited to the employer in nominal terms implied, on

average, a cost of 35% of the total severance payments in the manufacturing sector prior to 1990.

Finally, the change in the legislation reduced severance pay, because the introduction of

guaranteed severance payments essentially turned severance payments into a deferred

compensation scheme, allowing workers lower wages in exchange for future severance.4 Not all

workers were, however, affected in the same way by the reduction in severance payments. As

indicated above, workers hired by informal firms are not covered by the legislation and, thus,

should not had been affected directly by the reform. Moreover, family workers, temporary

workers, and workers employed by firms with 5 or less employees are not entitled to severance

payments, and domestic workers and workers employed by firms with very little capital are

entitled only to a severance payment of 15 days per year worked.

             A second important change introduced by the reform was the change in the legislation

with regards to indemnities for ‘unjust’ dismissals. First, the definition of ‘unjust’ dismissals

changed in 1990. Prior to the reform, ‘just’ cause dismissals included dismissals of employees

because of fraud, violence, undue care, sabotage, discipline problems, deficient performance, and

release of proprietary information. After the reform, the definition of ‘just’ cause dismissals was

extended to include any dismissal for failure to comply with firm regulations and instructions

4
    Kugler (2002) studies the impact a change from a standard severance payments system into a system of severance payments savings accounts.

                                                                        9
from one’s supervisors. The exemptions for the payment of indemnities for ‘unjust’ dismissals

were thus extended after the 1990 reform, reducing firing costs for formal firms. Second, the

reform eliminated the ability of workers with more than ten years of tenure to sue for backpay

and reinstatement. At the same time, however, the reform increased the cost of ‘unjustly’

dismissing workers with more than ten years of tenure (see Table 1) and this may have increased

the incentives for firms to dismiss workers just before reaching 10 years of seniority.5 Thus,

these changes in ‘unjust’ dismissal legislation can be expected to have the greatest impact on

formal workers with intermediate levels of seniority.

           Another important change brought about by the reform was the extension of the use of

fixed-term contracts.6 Prior to 1990, fixed term-contracts were allowed for a minimum duration

of a year.7 After the reform, these fixed-term contracts were extended to contracts of less than a

year (renewable up to three times). This change in the legislation, thus, lowered firing costs for

firms hiring workers for less than a year and would be expected to have increased turnover

among formal workers with less than a year of tenure after the reform.

           An additional change introduced by the reform was a reduction in the advance notice for

mass dismissals. While advance notice requirements for mass layoffs existed prior to the reform

(see Table 2), the reform introduced penalties to bureaucrats who did not process requests for

mass layoffs quickly. If such threats to bureaucrats were effective, this change in the legislation

should have speeded up the dismissal process for formal firms and lowered their costs of firing.

           Finally, the reform also introduced a new type of contract that eliminated severance

5
  Note, however, that employees with more than ten years of experience hired before 1990 could also choose to be covered by the new regime
with Severance Payments Savings Accounts.
6
  While temporary contracts are subject to payroll taxes and social security contributions, these contracts are not subject to severance pay and
‘unjust’ dismissal legislation as long as contracts end by the agreed date.
7
  Despite legislation on fixed-term contracts, however, firms could circumvent this restriction by subcontracting workers from temp agencies even
prior to the reform.

                                                                      10
payments altogether. This type of contract (“Salario Integral”) allowed formal workers who

earned more than ten times the minimum wage to opt out of severance payments, indemnities for

unjust dismissals, benefits (except paid vacations), social security contributions, and payroll

taxes in exchange for a higher salary. The introduction of this type of contract effectively

allowed firms to eliminate the cost of dismissing highly paid workers who opted for the “Salario

Integral”. Thus, one would expect to find a greater effect of the reform on formal sector workers

with salaries above ten minimum wages.8

          The changes in severance pay legislation, ‘unjust’ dismissal legislation, temporary

contracts, and mandatory advance notice introduced by the Colombian Labor Market Reform

should have directly reduced the costs of dismissals for formal firms and increased turnover in

the formal sector. Moreover, it is often argued that job security regulations simply encourage the

expansion of the informal sector and one would, thus, expect for this type of reform to have

encouraged greater compliance with the legislation. The next section introduces a matching

model with firing costs, which shows the direct effect on formal turnover of a reduction in firing

costs as well as the indirect effects on formal and informal turnover through the compositional

changes of firms in each sector. The model shows that a reform that reduces dismissal costs may

not only increase turnover, but it may also increase compliance with state-mandated firing costs.

IV. A Sorting Model of Compliance with Job Security Provisions

          This section presents a matching model with a formal sector and an informal sector in

which firms sort themselves between the two sectors. Firms producing in the formal sector must

comply with labor legislation and have to pay state-mandated severance in the event of a


8
  By 1994 only 1.5% of all workers in manufacturing and 0.6% of workers in commerce had opted for this type of contract (Lora and Henao,
1995). Since the surveys used in the analysis do not indicate whether a worker indeed opted for an Integral Salary, we examine whether the
impact of the reform was greater on older and highly educated workers who are more likely to earn above ten minimum wages.

                                                                   11
dismissal, while firms in the informal sector do not comply with job security legislation and

avoid the severance payment. Productivity in the informal sector is, however, lower overall than

in the formal sector because informal firms must produce at a smaller scale to remain

inconspicuous to the authorities.      Moreover, the presence of a firm-specific component to

productivity in the model implies that, in equilibrium, firms with higher idiosyncratic

productivity self-sort into the formal sector while firms with lower idiosyncratic productivity

self-sort into the informal sector.

        The model predicts that the probability of being dismissed by a formal firm is lower

because of the legislated severance payments, but also because formal firms are more productive.

Also, a reduction in severance payments increases the probability of dismissals in the formal

sector through a direct effect on the firing costs. In addition, however, the reduction in firing

costs has effects on the idiosyncratic composition of firms in each sector as well as on the wages

paid in each sector. This model, thus, highlights the potential biases that may arise in empirical

studies that attempt to quantify the effects of firing costs.

A. Assumptions

        In this model, heterogeneous firms may choose to produce in a formal sector in which

they must comply with job security provisions or to produce in the informal sector without

complying but at the cost of lower productivity. Workers are identical ex−ante, but they may

have different productivity ex-post depending on how well they match. After a match, the firm

and worker set the wage according to a Nash-bargaining solution. Then, the firm decides

whether to keep or dismiss the worker.

Production in Each Sector

        Formal and informal production is a function of a sector-specific component, as, of a

                                                  12
firm-idiosyncratic component, A, and of the match-quality component, γ, and produce with a

technology, Ys = asγA, for s = F, I. Sector-specific productivity is fixed and it is assumed,

without loss of generality, that aF = 1 > aI = a. The firm-idiosyncratic component comes from a

distribution F(A), and the match-quality component comes from a distribution G(γ).

Timing

       Firms, first, observe their firm-specific productivity. Firms then choose a sector given

the productivity in the sector and their known firm-specific productivity. Formal and informal

firms hire in the same market and, immediately after hiring, they observe the match-specific

productivity. Then, firms and workers bargain over wages. At the end of the process firms

decide whether to keep or dismiss the worker, and formal firms that do dismiss must provide a

severance payment, C. However, workers may still be separated afterwards at arrival rates, λF

and λI, due to exogenous reasons, in which case firms do not pay severance.

Matching

       All firms and workers search in the same market. The arrival rate of applicants to formal

and informal firms is the same, q(θ) = m(1/θ,1), where θ = v/u. The arrival rate of job

opportunities is θq(θ), and workers receive offers from formal or informal firms with a given

probability that depends on the share of firms in each sector.

Wage-setting

       Each firm and worker pair sets the wage based on Nash bargaining. Wages are set after

firm-specific and match-specific productivities are observed.    In this model, all wages are

affected by job security legislation, because the severance pay raises the utility of the




                                                13
unemployed and thus raises the reservation wage of all workers.9

B. Solution to the Model

     The model is solved by backward induction. First, the solution for the dismissal choices in

each sector is found. Second, the Nash-bargaining solution of the wage is determined. Finally,

the marginal firm between the two sectors is determined to solve for the split of firms between

the formal and informal sectors.

Dismissal Decisions

           The present discounted profits for a firm with a filled job is Js and the present discounted

value of a vacant job is Vs, for s = F,I (formal and informal, respectively). Thus, the asset

equation of a filled and a vacant job are given by the following equations, respectively:

                                                   r Js = Ys – ws + λs ( Vs – Js ),

                                                        r Vs = q(θ) ( Js – Vs ),

As there is free-entry, and all profit-opportunities are exploited, Vs = 0. Thus,

                                               Js = [asγA - ws ] / ( r + λs + q(θ) ).

Once matched, a firm must choose whether to keep or dismiss a worker. A formal firm has to

pay a cost, C, if it decides to dismiss, while an informal firm does not have to pay the firing cost.

Thus, the minimum match-productivity that triggers a dismissal by a formal firm is given by,

                                             γF = [ wF - C ( r + λF + q(θ) ) ] / A .

For informal firms, the trigger productivity is given by,

                                                           γI = [ wI ] / aA .


9
  As pointed out by Lazear (1990), in a perfectly competitive market, the state-mandated severance pay could be undone given the proper
contract. In particular, the worker would have to post a bond for the cost of the severance pay to the firm upon the signing of the contract.
However, as in Lazear (1990), it is assumed that the state-mandated severance pay is not completely offset by a private transfer, because workers
may be liquidity constrained and because of moral hazard problems on the part of firms.


                                                                      14
Given firm-specific productivity and wages, the probability that a formal firm dismisses a

worker is less than the probability that an informal firm dismisses, i.e.,γF < γI ⇔ G(γF ) <

G(γI ). This is both because formal firms must pay severance payments and because sector

productivity is higher if producing formally.

Determination of Wages

       Wages are set by each firm-worker pair before the match-quality is realized. Wages are

set according to Nash-bargaining, where each side has the same bargaining power. Thus, formal

and informal firms split their surplus equally with workers, as follows:

                                   JFe – VF – G(γF )C = EFe – U,

                                         JIe – VI = EIe – U,

where JFe, JIe, EFe, and EFe are the expected discounted profits of a formal and informal job and

the expected lifetime utilities of a formal and an informal worker, respectively, and U is the

expected lifetime utility of an unemployed worker.          The asset equations of employed and

unemployed workers are given by,

                                      r Ese = ws + λ ( U – Ese ),

                                       r U = θq(θ) ( Ee - U ).

Where Ee is the expected lifetime utility of employment for an unemployed job-seeker. Since an

unemployed worker is uncertain about whether he will be hired in a formal or an informal job,

his expected utility of employment is:

  Ee = Pr(formal offer) [ ( 1 - G(γF ) ) EFe + G(γF ) C ] + Pr(informal offer) ( 1 - G(γI ) ) EIe.




                                                  15
Solving for ( Ese – U ) in each sector and substituting into the equal split equation above

determines the wages in each sector:

         wF ={ ( r + λF )( r + θq(θ) ) [ ÇγAg(γ)dγ – G(γF )C ] + r( r + λF + q(θ) )θq(θ)Ee } /
                                  { ( 2( r + λF )+q(θ) ) )( r + θq(θ) ) },

                wI = {( r + λI )( r + θq(θ) )[ÇγAg(γ)dγ + r( r + λI + q(θ) )θq(θ) Ee } /
                                   { ( 2( r+λI )+ q(θ) ) )( r + θq(θ) ) }.

Wages are expected to be higher in the formal sector because of the higher sector-productivity in

formal jobs. However, as shown above, in equilibrium the average match-quality is lower in

formal sector firms, as firms in this sector are more likely to keep less productive matches than

informal firms. Hence, the lower quality of the matches in the formal sector lowers the expected

wage in the formal sector. In addition, wages are affected not only by average productivity but

also by the level of the firing cost. Both formal and informal wages are raised by the presence of

state-mandated severance pay, because the severance payment raises workers’ reservation

wages.

Sorting into Sectors

         Given dismissal choices and wages, firms choose whether to sort into the formal or the

informal sector. The benefit of producing formally is that the productivity of this sector is

higher, but the cost of producing in this sector relative to the informal sector is the payment of

state-mandated severance in the event of a dismissal. As firms are heterogeneous, firms may

split between the two sectors. Firms produce formally if the difference between the expected

stream of profits of formal and informal firms is positive, i.e., if [ JFe – JIe ] > 0, and they produce

informally if it is negative, i.e., if [ JFe – JIe ] < 0. As the firm-specific productivity increases, the

output gains in the formal sector relative to the informal sector increase. Thus, the gains from


                                                   16
going into the formal sector are greater for more productive firms than for less productive ones:

d[ JFe–JIe ] / dA = Çγ∈[γF,γ] [ γ / (r + λF + q(θ)) ]g(γ)dγ + Çγ∈[γI,γ] [ aγ / (r + λI + q(θ)) ]g(γ)dγ > 0.


Firms with A∈[ A, Acrit ] produce in the informal sector, while firms with A∈[ Acrit,A ] produce

in the formal sector, where Acrit is the firm-specific productivity of the firm that is marginal

between producing formally and producing informally. Consequently, since formal firms are

more productive in equilibrium, they dismiss less often and they pay higher wages than informal

firms.10

C. Severance Pay and Turnover

           The presence of state-mandated costs and higher productivity in the formal sector imply

different hazards into and out of unemployment in the two sectors. On the one hand, the

probability of endogenous dismissal in the formal sector is likely to be lower than the probability

of dismissal in the informal sector, i.e., θq(θ)(1 - F(Am))G(γF)) < θq(θ)F(Am)G(γI)). On the

other hand, the hiring probability will be higher or lower in the formal sector relative to the

informal sector depending on the share of firms producing in each sector, i.e., depending on

whether θq(θ) (1 - F(Am)) > θq(θ) F(Am) or θq(θ) (1 - F(Am)) < θq(θ) F(Am). As the proportion

of firms producing formally increases, then the hiring probability in the formal sector increases

relative to the informal sector.

           Moreover, the hazards into and out of unemployment are affected directly and indirectly

by changes in severance pay legislation. First, a reduction in state-mandated severance pay has a

direct effect on formal firms by increasing the threshold match-productivity that triggers

dismissals. Second, a reduction of severance payments pushes down wages in both sectors due

10
   The self-sorting of more productive firms into the formal sector, thus, makes evident the problems of identifying the effect of legislation on
turnover, simply by estimating the effect of firing cost on the hazard rates.

                                                                      17
to the fall in the reservation wage. Wages increase, however, due to the greater probability of

dismissal in the formal sector, and the net effect on wages in both sectors is positive as well as

the effect of wages on turnover.                             Finally, a reduction of severance payments changes the

composition of firms in each sector. In particular, decreasing severance payments increases the

incentives to produce in the formal sector and shifts lower productivity firms, that before were

unwilling to produce formally, away from the informal sector.                                                   The compositional change

increases the dismissal and hiring rates in the formal sector due to the greater share of firms

producing formally.

              The direct and indirect effects of a reduction in firing costs on turnover that emerge in

the model illustrate the problems that may arise when trying to estimate the impact of a change

in firing costs on turnover. First, the effects of firing costs on wages imply that the effect of

firing costs on turnover captures not only the direct effect mentioned above, but also the indirect

effect of firing costs on turnover going through wages. This is not problematic in so far as one is

interested in measuring the total effect, both direct and indirect, of firing costs on turnover.

However, the self-sorting of firms into formal and informal sectors according to their firm-

specific productivity and the effect of the reduction of firing costs on this self-sorting are likely

to introduce selection biases. Finally, if a policy change occurred simultaneously with a change

in the distribution of the shocks, then one may attribute to the reform an effect that may indeed

be due to a worsening in the distribution of the matches.11 The next section discusses an

identification strategy to deal with the problem of contemporaneous changes in the distribution

of the shocks and discusses inference given the presence of a selection problem.



11
     In addition, a change in firing costs is also likely to affect turnover in both sectors through its indirect effect on wages.

                                                                             18
V. Identification Strategy

A. Differences-in-differences

       The theory laid out above suggests that firing costs should only have direct effects on the

exit rates of workers in the formal sector (covered by the legislation), but not on the exit rates of

workers in the informal sector (uncovered by the legislation). Hence, the firing costs should

only have direct effects on the tenures of formal sector workers, but not on the tenures of

workers employed in the informal sector.             Similarly, the unemployment duration of workers

whose spells end as a result of being hired in the formal sector should be directly affected by

firing costs, but not those of workers whose spells end as a result of being hired in the informal

sector. Comparing the hazards into and out of unemployment (or tenures and unemployment

spells) between formal and informal workers (covered and uncovered by the legislation) could

then provide an estimate of the effect of firing costs on turnover. The sample counterpart of the

firing cost effect on tenure (unemployment spells) using differences would be:

                                        ∆s = [s formal -s informal ],
           formal             formal           informal             informal
where,h            = 1 /s            andh              = 1 /s              and thes’s are mean tenures

(unemployment spells) and theh’s are mean hazard rates.12 Considering the simplest possible

model of tenure (unemployment duration) with no regressors, tenure (unemployment) depends

only on a formal dummy,

                          sit = β + δ Formalit + uit,          E(uitFormalit)=0.

Given this model, it is easy to see that the difference of the mean tenures in the formal and

informal sectors provides an estimate of the firing cost effect, δ. This way of estimating the

firing cost effect is, however, likely to be biased for three reasons. First, the two groups may


                                                          19
have different characteristics and, thus, different turnover behavior and different mean tenures

and unemployment spells.                      Including regressors in the model above allows controlling for

observable characteristics and helps to solve this problem.                                   Second, the error term could be

correlated with the Formal dummy if there is self-selection into the groups, i.e., E(uitFormali=1)

≠ E(uitFormali=0). Finally, the two groups may be subject to different shocks and part of the

differences in turnover patterns and, thus, tenures and unemployment spells, between the groups

may be simply capturing these differences, i.e., βF ≠ βI.

             Exploiting the temporal change in the legislation introduced by the labor market reform

of 1990, in addition to the variability in coverage between covered and uncovered workers,

allows controlling for self-selection and for the difference in shocks across groups. In the model

of tenure (unemployment spells) with no regressors, tenure (unemployment) depends only on a

formal dummy, on a post-reform dummy, and on an interaction term between the two,

                              sit = β + δ0 Formalit + δ1 Post90it + δ2 Formalit × Post90it + uit

             First,      if     self-selection         is     constant        over    time,     i.e.,   E(uipre90Formali=1)   =

E(uipost90Formali=1) and E(uipre90Formali=0) = E(uipost90Formali=0), the firing cost effect can

be estimated by simply taking differences-in-differences:

                              ∆s gt = ∆[s post90 -s pre90 ] formal - ∆[s post90 -s pre90 ] informal,

where,hgt = 1 /sgt. Taking differences of average tenures (unemployment duration) for formal

workers between the pre-1990 and the post-1990 periods provides an estimate of the firing cost

effect and allows to difference out the biases introduced by self-selection when self-selection is

constant over time. Taking differences of these differences with respect to informal workers


12
     This sample counterpart holds as long as the hazards follow a Poisson process.

                                                                         20
(uncovered by the legislation) allows controlling for common trends that affect both groups,

whether it is a constant trend, β, or a changing trend common to both groups, δ1.

          As indicated above, however, it is possible that the two groups are subject to different

shocks, i.e., βF ≠ βI. In this case, differences-in-differences would work provided that the post-

reform shocks can be adjusted using pre-reform trends. Thus, differences-in-differences would

work even if the trends were different in the two groups under two circumstances. First,

differences-in-differences would work if the trends are constant over time for each group, i.e.,

βFpre90 = βFpost90, βIpre90 = βIpost90, and δ1 = 0. Second, differences-in-differences would also work

if the trends change over time for each group, but the trends change by a common factor in both

groups, i.e., βFpre90 ≠ βFpost90 = βFpre90 + δ1 and βIpre90 ≠ βIpost90 = βIpre90 + δ1.13

          To estimate the effect of the reform on the hazard rates into and out of unemployment,

the analogue of differences-in-differences is estimated using a formal hazard model. I estimate

an exponential model that controls for observables and includes, the formal dummy, the post-

1990 dummy and the interaction term between the formal and the post-1990 dummy:

               h( sit | Xit, ) = exp{ βXit + δ0 Formalit + δ1 Post90it + δ2 Formalit × Post90it },

where Xit is a 1 × k vector of regressors, and β is a k × 1 vector of parameters. The vector of

covariates Xit , includes: age, education, sex, marital status, number of dependants, the city

where the person lives, and industry of employment. The Formal variable is included to control

for constant differences between the groups. Thus, δ0 is expected to be negative since the

dismissal of formal workers is more costly than that of informal workers, both before and after


13
   Moreover, even if trends do not change by a common factor in both groups, an unconventional differences-in-differences estimator could be
obtained using a method proposed by Heckman and Robb (1985). This method assumes that a pre-reform model, that is stable over time, could
be fit for each group and then used to quantify post-reform shocks that can be inserted into equations fit to post-reform data.


                                                                    21
the reform. The Post90 dummy controls for common shocks affecting the turnover behavior of

all workers after 1990. Finally, the interaction term of the Formal and Post90 dummies is

included to estimate the effect of the reduction in firing costs introduced by the reform on the

hazard rates. A test of the impact of the reform is equivalent to a test that the coefficient on the

interaction term, δ2, is different from zero. In particular, the test considers whether workers

covered by the legislation changed their turnover behavior relative to uncovered workers after

1990.

B. Potential Sources of Contamination

        The identification strategy above exploits both the temporal variability and the cross-

section variability available in the Colombian context.         Nonetheless, these differences-in-

differences estimators rely on a number of assumptions that may yield inconsistent estimates of

the effects of firing costs on turnover. First, the differences-in-differences estimators ignore the

general equilibrium effects of a reduction in firing costs on composition suggested by the model

in the previous section. Second, the estimators rely on the assumption that trends did not change

differentially across groups over time. In turn, I consider the implications for the identification

of the firing cost effect of having these two potential sources of biases.

        As highlighted by the model in the previous section, the reduction of firing costs

introduced by the reform is likely to have generated general equilibrium effects. In particular,

the model above showed that a reduction in firing costs not only has direct effects on turnover by

reducing the costs of dismissals, but it also has indirect effects on turnover through its impact on

sector selection. As described above, the differences-in-differences estimator above is consistent

as long as self-selection is constant over time. The model in the previous section showed,

however, that a reduction in firing costs changes the incentives to sort into the formal and

                                                 22
informal sectors and generates compositional changes that also affect turnover.          Thus, a

reduction in firing costs may itself generate compositional changes that invalidate the

assumption of a constant self-selection rule, before and after the reform. Yet, the model above

does suggest that the bias introduced by differences-in-differences should be negative. In the

model, the reduction in firing costs induces firms with low firm-specific productivities to start

producing formally and the reallocation between sectors thus lowers the average firm-specific

productivity and increases turnover in both sectors. However, the effect of this change in

composition on turnover was shown to be greater in the informal sector. Thus, while the firing

cost effect obtained with differences-in-differences is inconsistent, the estimate should be a

lower bound of the effect of the reduction in firing costs on turnover. Moreover, the next section

shows that the change in the size of the two sectors was small and this may indicate that the

selection bias is unlikely to be large.

        The second reason why the differences-in-differences estimators may yield inconsistent

estimates of the firing cost effects is if the trends change differently over time for formal and

informal workers. As discussed above, an important assumption that has to be fulfilled for

differences-in-differences to yield consistent estimates of the reform is that it eliminates the

effect of aggregate shocks or trends on turnover. The effect of aggregate shocks is eliminated if

aggregate shocks are common to both groups, or if aggregate shocks are specific to each group

but either, the shocks are constant over time or the shocks change similarly across groups.

However, if trends are different across groups and they change differently over time, the firing

cost effects obtained from differences-in-differences are likely to be biased. Aside from macro

shocks, which are common to both groups, there were two additional shocks occurring during

this period that could have affected by turnover. First, trade was liberalized during this period

                                               23
and, second, a social security reform was introduced in the early 1990’s.

       Colombia’s trade liberalization during the early 1990’s should be expected to have

increased instability for workers employed in tradable sectors after 1990. Nonetheless, trade

shocks should have affected formal and informal firms alike and, hence, differences-in-

differences should control for the effect of these shocks on turnover. If, however, formal firms

were more likely to produce in tradable sectors and informal firms in non-tradable sectors, then

differences-in-differences would yield upwardly biased estimates of the firing cost effect.

Below, I estimate differences-in-differences across sectors to identify whether the changes in

turnover were greatest in tradable sectors. There are two reasons to believe, however, that the

trade shocks did not generate the differences in turnover over time presented below. First, the

next section shows no consistent pattern across sectors in the differences-in-differences

estimates. In addition, differences-in-differences for different firm sizes and age groups show

that the change in turnover was greatest for large firms and middle age workers who should have

been affected most by the changes in job security legislation, but not by trade shocks.

       The social security reform introduced during the early 1990’s affected formal firms but

not informal firms. Thus, the social security reform introduced a shock affecting formal and

informal firms differentially over time. As described above, the social security reform increased

employers’ health and pension contributions and, thus, increased non-wage labor costs for firms

complying with the legislation. The increased variable costs should have reduced hiring and

should have had no effect on dismissals in the formal sector relative to the informal sector. This

means that the social security reform should had generated very different effects on turnover




                                                24
from those predicted by a reduction in firing costs and from those reported in the next section.14

Moreover, if firms adjusted to the increased non-wage labor costs by reducing wages, then the

social security reform should not have had any turnover effects.                       There is evidence that

employers tend to pass on their non-wage costs to workers as lower wages. For example, Gruber

(1997) shows the sharp reduction payroll taxes that followed the privatization of Chile’s social

security system had no employment effects because wages adjusted fully to the change in non-

wage costs. Moreover, differences-in-differences across different firm sizes and age groups

show that turnover changed most among larger firms and middle age workers who should had

been affected most by the changes in job security legislation, but not by the social security

reform.

VI. Empirical Analysis

          This section examines the impact of the Colombian labor market reform of 1990, which

included a substantial reduction in severance payments, on the hazard rates out of employment

and out of unemployment of formal sector workers relative to informal sector workers.

A. The Data

A.1 Description

          The data to analyze the effects of the reform on the exit rates out of employment and out

of unemployment are drawn from the Colombian National Household Surveys (NHS) for June of

1988, 1992, and 1996.           The June NHS’s were administered in seven metropolitan areas,

including: Barranquilla, Bogota, Bucaramanga, Cali, Manizales, Medellin, and Pasto.                             The

benefit of using the June surveys is that these include information on informality that allows to


14
  See Kugler, Jimeno and Hernanz (2003) for an analysis of the differential effects of firing costs and payroll taxes
on turnover and employment.

                                                         25
separate workers between formal sector workers (covered) and informal sector workers

(uncovered). The June surveys allow defining workers as covered and uncovered in two ways.

First, formal (covered) workers are defined as those workers whose employers make social

security contributions and informal (uncovered) workers are defined as those whose employers

do not contribute to the social security system. This definition is a useful one, because whether

the employer contributes or not to social security is a good proxy of whether the employer

generally complies or not with labor legislation. Second, formal (covered) workers are defined

as wage-earners employed in firms with more than ten employees, and informal (uncovered)

workers as wage-earners employed in firms with less than ten employees, family workers,

domestic workers and the self-employed workers (excluding professionals and technicians). As

discussed above, employers with five or less employees, family workers, and the self-employed

are all exempt from severance pay legislation and domestic workers and workers in firms with

low levels of capital are entitled only to half the amount of severance pay received by other

employees. These surveys also include information on gender, age, marital status, educational

attainment, number of dependents, city and sector of employment, that allows controlling for

differences in turnover due to differences in characteristics across individuals. In addition, the

surveys include information about whether the worker is permanent or temporary, which allows

distinguishing the effect that the legislative change on temporary contracts had on turnover.

       Table 3 presents summary statistics for the covered and uncovered groups (using the two

definitions), before and after the reform. Columns 1 and 2 present the characteristics of formal

(covered) workers and Columns 3 and 4 present the characteristics of informal (uncovered)

workers, before and after the reform, respectively. Under both definitions, covered workers have

more education, are slightly younger, have larger families, and are more likely to be married and

                                                26
female and to have a permanent contract than uncovered workers. However, aside from the

differences in educational attainment, the differences in characteristics between the two groups

are small. In addition, the changes in characteristics of the two groups between the pre-1990 and

the post-1990 periods have moved in the same direction and are similar in magnitude.

Educational attainment, average age, and the share of married workers increased in both groups

after 1990, while the share of men, the size of households, and the share of workers with

permanent contracts decreased in both groups after 1990.

       These summary statistics suggest that differences in composition between the groups are

not substantial. Nonetheless, the differences in characteristics may account for part of the

changing turnover patterns and, thus, raw differences in turnover between covered and

uncovered groups should be interpreted carefully. For this reason, in the analysis below I

estimate formal hazard models that allow controlling for individual characteristics. The use of

these models is, thus, crucial for identifying the firing cost effect of the labor market reform.

Another source of compositional bias may arise if, as highlighted by the model, the composition

of firms changes over time. Table 3 shows an increase in the size of the formal (covered) sector

after 1990, according to both definitions. The percentage of workers in the formal sector

increased from 44.84% to 51.05%, according to definition 1, and from 41.47% to 45.22%

according to definition 2, between the pre- and post-reform periods. The increase in the size of

the formal sector, thus, indicates the importance of controlling also for firm characteristics, as

the composition of formal firms may have also changed. Although the NHS’s have little

information on firm characteristics, the hazard models below do control for industry affiliation.

Moreover, the fact that the increase in the size of the formal sector was small and that it cannot



                                               27
be directly attributed to the reform suggests that the selection biases described above may not be

of great concern.

A.2. Sampling Plan

        The June NHS’s include information on tenure on the current job (in years) and on the

duration of unemployment (in months) right before entering the current job that allow estimating

hazard rates. In particular, the survey asks currently employed workers: How long have you

been working on your current job?, and How long were you unemployed between your current

job and your previous job? The data, thus, provides information on incomplete employment

spells of currently employed workers, and on complete unemployment spells of workers who are

currently employed and had a previous job (see graph below).

                     June Waves:

Employment Spell
                                                                    _________________
Unemployment Spell
                     ___________________________

                     ↑                                             ↑
                     end of previous job    end of unemployment spell-beginning of new job



        The stock sampling for the employment spells generates two types of biases. First, the

sampled employment spells are too short because of the sampling of incomplete employment

spells. In particular, Heckman and Singer (1985) show that under the assumptions of a time

homogenous environment, no heterogeneity, and independence between employment and

unemployment spells, the completed spells would be on average twice as long. Second, as a

consequence of sampling currently employed workers, the incomplete employment spells are


                                               28
longer than the completed spells from a sample that follows workers flows from job-to-job over

time. Thus, the sampling of currently employed workers introduces length bias. Heckman and

Singer (1985) show, however, that under the assumptions stated above and, in addition, under

the assumption of no duration-dependence the two biases exactly cancel out. Below, I estimate

exponential hazard models that impose these assumptions.

       Similarly, the stock sampling of the unemployment spells may also introduce a number of

biases. Although the data provides complete unemployment spells, the fact that the spells are

drawn from a sample of workers who are currently employed and had a previous job may

generate biased estimates. First, sampling currently employed workers introduces length bias.

This is because one oversamples workers with short spells relative to long spells. Thus, the

mean of the sampled spells would be shorter than the mean of the spells from a flow sample.

Second, sampling workers who had a previous job excludes all new entrants into the labor force

and this introduces another type of length bias. By excluding new entrants from the sample, one

oversamples workers with long spells relative to short spells, implying that the mean of the

sampled spells would be shorter than the mean of the spells from a flow sample. Although, the

distribution of unemployment spells obtained from this sampling plan is likely to be distorted,

the bias due to stock sampling may be small in practice because the two biases have opposite

signs and they may thus cancel out.

B. Tenure and Unemployment Spells, Before and After the Reform

Average Tenure

       The model presented above indicates that the direct and indirect effects of the reduction

in firing costs introduced by the reform should have increased the exit rates out of employment

for formal workers relative to informal workers. The reform should have, thus, reduced the

                                              29
average tenure of workers covered by the reform (formal workers) relative to the tenure of

uncovered workers (informal workers).15

           Table 4 presents the average tenure for the covered and uncovered groups (using the first

definition), before and after the Colombian Labor Market Reform of 1990.16 The first row

corresponds to the average tenure after the reform, the second row corresponds to the average

tenure prior to the reform, and the third row to the differences. The last row provides the

differences-in-differences estimate of the effect of the reform on tenure. The average tenure of

covered workers decreased after the reform from 5.6002 to 5.3130 years. The decrease in

average tenure for covered workers was of 3.4452 months and significantly different from zero.

In contrast, the decrease in average tenure for uncovered workers was of 0.2112 months and not

significantly different from zero. The differences-in-differences estimate of the effect of the

reform was a reduction in average tenure of 3.6612 months. The effect is large, significantly

different from zero, and, as predicted by the theory, most of the change comes from the reduction

in average tenure of covered workers rather than from the increase average tenures of uncovered

workers. Table 5 presents the difference-in-differences estimates of the reform on average

tenure by gender. This table shows that most of the change in the aggregate figures is driven by

the effect of the reform on men’s tenures. The differences-in-differences estimate of the effect of

the reform was a reduction of 4.1208 months for men and of 2.1012 months for women, although

the effect is not significantly different from zero for women.

           Tables 6 and 7 present differences-in-differences estimates of the reform for different age

and education groups. Table 6 shows that the effect of the reform was greatest for middle age

15
    In particular, the average tenure of formal workers should decrease because the fraction of workers with short tenures (those just hired)
increases and/or the fraction of workers with long tenures (those just fired) decreases.
16
   This section and the rest of the analysis relies on the first definition of formal/informal since the two measures are highly correlated and the


                                                                       30
workers. The differences-in-differences estimate of the effect was a reduction of 4.0176 months

for middle age workers, while the estimates for young and older workers were not significantly

different from zero. These results are consistent with the change in severance pay legislation and

with the change in ‘unjust’ dismissal legislation that raised the cost of ‘unjustly’ dismissing

workers with more than ten years of tenure. In particular, the change in the legislation should

have induced firms to dismiss workers just prior to completing ten years of tenure. This result is

confirmed in the next section with the formal hazard analysis. In contrast, Table 7 shows that

the difference-in-differences estimates of the effects of the reform were greatest for employees

with primary education and with a university degree or more. This result, however, inverts in

the formal hazard analysis that controls for changes in turnover for these groups after the reform.

           Table 8 shows the differences-in-differences estimates of the effect of the reform by

sector, to identify whether the reduction in tenures could had been the result of trade

liberalization.           This table shows that the difference-in-differences estimates for agriculture,

mining, manufacturing, construction, and commerce are not significantly different from zero at

conventional levels. Moreover, the differences-in-differences estimate of the reform was a

reduction of 6.4836 months in transportation, but only significant at the 10% level, a reduction of

10.7028 months in financial services, only significant at the 5% level, and a reduction of 10.236

months in services, significant at the 1% level. Thus, the estimates by sector do not show a

consistent pattern of changes across tradable and non-tradable sectors.               These results are

confirmed by the formal hazard analysis presented below.                 Moreover, consistent with the

changes predicted by the labor market reform, the changes that are significant are driven by




results are robust to the definition used.

                                                        31
reductions in the tenures of covered workers and not by the increase in tenures of uncovered

workers.

           Table 9 shows the differences-in-differences estimates by firm size. The results show

that the effects of the reform were greatest for larger firms, as predicted by the changes in the

legislation.        The differences-in-differences estimates for the self-employed and for workers

employed in firms with 2-5 employees and in firms with 5-10 employees are not significantly

different from zero. In contrast, the estimate of the effect of the reform for workers employed in

firms with more than ten employees was a reduction of 6.3372 months. The effect of the reform

on workers employed by large firms is big, significantly different from zero, and driven mainly

by a reduction of tenures of covered workers rather than by an increase of the tenures of

uncovered workers. This evidence is strongly consistent with the expected effects of a reduction

in firing costs, since the self-employed and workers employed in firms with less than 5

employees are completely exempt from severance and workers employed in firms with little

capital are only entitled to partial severance payments.

Unemployment Duration

           The model predicts that a reduction in dismissal costs should increase the exit rate out of

unemployment and into formal jobs relative to the exit rate out of unemployment and into

informal jobs.            Thus, the reduction in severance payments would be expected to shorten

unemployment spells of workers hired into formal jobs relative to those of workers hired into

informal jobs.17




17
   In particular, the average unemployment spell of those going into formal jobs should decline because of the increased probability of being hired
into a formal firm should reduce the fraction of workers with long spells. Moreover, the fraction of workers with short spells (those just fired
from formal jobs) increases.

                                                                       32
           Table 10 presents the differences-in-differences estimates of unemployment spells.18 The

average unemployment spell for workers whose spell ended with a formal sector job increased.

However, the average unemployment spell of workers whose spell ended in an informal sector

job lengthened by even more than that of formal workers. Thus, the differences-in-differences

estimate was a reduction in the average unemployment spell of 3.1108 weeks and significantly

different from zero.19 Table 11 presents the results for men and women, separately. The

differences-in-differences estimate for men was not significantly different from zero, but the

effect on women was a shortening of the average unemployment spell of 7.9672 weeks and

significant at the 1% level.                     Table 12 presents the differences-in-differences estimates for

different age groups and Table 13 presents the differences-in-differences estimates for different

education groups. The results show that unemployment spells decreased most for young and

middle aged workers. This result is consistent with the expectation that a decrease in firing costs

should increase hiring, especially for outsiders, and is also confirmed in the formal hazard

analysis below. Moreover, Table 13 shows that the differences-in-differences estimates are

greatest for workers with incomplete secondary and incomplete university education. Thus, the

firing cost effect on hiring appears to be greater on workers that are risky hires. This is also

confirmed below by the formal hazard analysis.

           Table 14 presents the differences-in-differences estimates of the effect of the reform on

unemployment spells by industry. The differences-in-differences estimates are not significantly

different from zero in agriculture, mining, manufacturing, utilities, construction, transportation,


18
   Unemployed workers are defined as formal if the job subsequent to their spell was in the formal sector and as informal if their job subsequent
to the spell was in the informal sector.
19
   Contrary to the results for tenure, the differences-in-differences results for unemployment spells are driven mainly by the lengthening of the
spells of those exiting into the informal sector. This is however, consistent with the model presented above. On the one hand, the model predicts
that the probability of being hired in the formal sector should rise after the reform because of the increase in the number of firms producing in this
sector. On the other hand, the probability of being hired into the informal sector falls unambiguously.

                                                                         33
and financial services. Only the effect on commerce and services are significantly different from

zero. The differences-in-differences estimate of the effect of the reform was a reduction of

1.2746 weeks of the unemployment spell in commerce, but only significant at the 5% level and a

reduction of 1.3126 weeks of the unemployment spell in services, significant at the 1% level.

Thus, as for tenure, the results do not show a consistent pattern of a differential impact on

tradable and non-tradable sectors. In contrast, the differences-in-differences estimates by firm

size in Table 15 provide some evidence that the firing cost effect was greatest among larger

firms. In particular, the differences-in-differences estimates of the reform on firms with 5 –10

employees and on firms with more than ten employees indicate reductions of the average

unemployment spell of 0.8038 weeks and of 0.2913 weeks, respectively. Although neither effect

is significant at conventional levels, the p-values for the differences-in-differences estimates of

larger firms are greater than the p-values for the estimates of the self-employed and of firms with

2-5 employees.

C. Employment and Unemployment Survivor Functions, Before and After the Reform

       While the previous section presented the implied effects of the reform on tenure and

unemployment spells, this section presents evidence on the effects of the reform on the survival

probabilities in employment and unemployment. If the reduction of dismissal costs introduced

by the reform, indeed, was important, then the probability of survival in a formal job should had

fallen after the reform relative to the probability of survival in an informal job. In addition, if the

reduction in dismissal costs generated more hiring, then the probability of survival in

unemployment should had fallen after the reform for workers exiting into formal jobs relative to

those exiting into informal jobs.



                                                  34
       Figure 1 presents the Kaplan Meier survival estimates for employment. This figure

includes the probabilities of survival for formal and informal workers before and after the

reform. The figure shows that the probability that a formal job lasts more than two years

decreased after the reform. For tenures of more than two years, the survivor function of formal

workers after the reform (Formal/Post-1990) shifts down with respect to the survivor function of

formal workers before the reform (Formal/Pre-1990). However, for tenures of less than two

years, the survivor function of formal workers after the reform shifted up with respect to the

survivor function of formal workers before the reform. That survivor function is greater for

formal workers with less than two years of tenure after the reform is surprising, given the

extension by the reform of the use of temporary contracts for less than a year. However, this

shift in the survivor function for those with less than two years of tenure may simply reflect the

greater hiring of new permanent workers after the reform, as is shown below in the estimation of

formal hazard models. The downward shift of the survivor function of formal workers after the

reform is consistent with the reduction in dismissal costs for formal firms after the reform. In

contrast, however, Figure 1 shows, that the probability of survival increased slightly for informal

workers after the reform relative to informal workers prior to the reform. The survivor function

of uncovered workers after the reform (Informal/Post-1990) shifted up slightly with respect to

the survivor function of uncovered workers before the reform (Informal/Pre-1990). If common

shocks to both groups were responsible for the decreased probability of survival of formal jobs,

then the figure should also show a downward shift of the survivor function for informal workers.

Moreover, consistent with the fact that formal workers are covered by job security regulations

while informal workers are not, the survivor functions for formal workers are higher than the

survivor functions of informal workers both before and after the reform. The survivor functions

                                                35
for the covered and uncovered groups, as well as the shifts of the survivor functions for each

group after the reform, are, thus, consistent with the predicted effects of firing costs and with the

predicted effects of the reform on formal turnover.

        Standard Kaplan-Meier survival functions of unemployment show a similar change after

the reform. Figure 2 shows that the unemployment survival functions of formal hires shifted

down between the pre-reform (Formal/Pre-1990) and post-reform (Formal/Post-1990) periods.

Thus, for every unemployment spell of duration t, the probability of remaining unemployed

decreased after the reform for those who exited into formal employment. On the contrary,

Figure 2 shows that the unemployment survival functions increased slightly for informal

workers, after the reform. These shifts are consistent with the expected effects of the reform.

The reduction of firing costs would have predicted that the probability of remaining unemployed

at every time t should have decreased for workers covered by the reform but not for uncovered

workers. Moreover, the next section shows, that the escape rates into and out of unemployment

increased for formal workers relative to informal workers, even after controlling for observable

characteristics.

D. Formal Hazard Models

        It is possible that the employment and unemployment spells and the survivor functions

presented above changed after the reform due to changes in the characteristics of workers and

jobs after 1990. Thus, below I estimate formal duration models that allow controlling for the

effects of changes in worker and job characteristics on exit hazard rates.

        As described in Section IV, I estimate exponential hazard models that control for age,

education, marital status, city, industry of employment, and the number of dependents. More

importantly, these formal hazard models can capture the effects of the reform. The models

                                                 36
include a Formal dummy that controls for differential turnover patterns across groups, a Post90

dummy that captures the differential turnover pattern in turnover after 1990 for all groups, and

an interaction term of the Formal and Post90 dummies that captures the effect of the reform. In

particular, the coefficient of the interaction term can be interpreted as the differential hazard

rates of covered workers after the reform was introduced. Moreover, to further probe the

importance of the reform, other specifications of the model are included to test whether the

effects of the reform showed the expected patterns for different groups. In addition, to test the

importance of trade shocks, a specification of the model that includes interaction terms of the

Formal × Post90 dummy with sector dummies is also estimated.

       Table 16 shows the results of the estimation of exponential exit hazard rates out of

employment. Column (1) presents the estimates obtained from the basic specification of the

model that includes the covariates mentioned above, the Formal dummy, the Post90 dummy, and

the interaction term of the two. The results show the expected signs. The hazards are higher for

younger, more educated, female, and single workers and for workers with smaller number of

dependents. The results also show that the hazards out of employment decreased during the

post-1990 period for informal workers. Moreover, as expected, formal workers, who are covered

by the legislation, have lower hazards out of employment than do informal workers. Most

importantly, the coefficient on the interaction term is positive and significant at the 1% level. In

particular, the coefficient indicates that, after the reform, covered workers are 6.17% more likely

to exit employment than are uncovered workers. This result, thus, suggests that the reduction in

firing costs introduced by the reform increased the exit rates out of employment substantially.

Exit hazards out of employment are likely to have increased after the reform both because of the



                                                37
increase in dismissals and because of the increase in quits resulting from greater hiring after the

reform.

          Another essential feature of the reform was the greater flexibility in the use of temporary

(fixed-term) contracts and, thus, one may suspect that a great deal of the increases in turnover

after the reform may simply be the result of increased hiring of temporary workers in the formal

sector. The specification in Column (2) allows to distinguish whether the increase in the exit

rates out of employment was purely the result of the increase in the use of temporary contracts or

if the reduction in the cost of firing permanent workers also played a role. Column (2) in Table

16 presents the estimates of a model including, a permanent dummy, an interaction term of the

Post90 dummy and the permanent dummy, an interaction term of the Formal dummy and the

Permanent dummy, and an interaction of the Formal × Post90 dummy with the Permanent

dummy.20       All the coefficients have the same signs as before and the coefficient on the

Permanent dummy is negative and significant at the 1% level, as expected. The results show that

the coefficient on the Formal × Post90 interaction is positive, but the interaction term of the

Formal × Post90 dummy with the Permanent dummy is negative and significant at the 1% level.

The results indicate that, after the reform, the probability of exiting employment was 6.7%

higher for temporary workers in the formal sector than for temporary workers in the uncovered

sector. At the same time, the probability of exiting employment was 6.1% higher for permanent

worker in the formal sector than for permanent workers in the uncovered sector after the reform.

Thus, while the introduction of temporary contracts does appear to explain part of the increased

turnover of formal workers, the results also suggest that the reduction of dismissal costs for

permanent workers also contributed to increasing turnover.



                                                  38
             Column (3) in Table 16 presents the results of specifications including interaction terms

of the reform effect with the age and education variables. This specification of the model allows

seeing whether the impact of the reform was greater on the groups that would be expected to be

affected most by the changes in the legislation. First, since the reform increased the costs of

dismissing workers with more than ten years of tenure, then the impact of the reform would be

expected to be greater for groups with less than ten years of tenure (i.e., younger workers).

Second, the special contracts introduced by the reform, which exempted workers with more than

ten times the minimum wage from severance payments, would be expected to affect mostly the

turnover of highly educated workers who are likely to earn more than ten times the minimum

wage. Column (3) shows that, indeed, the hazard rates of younger and middle-aged workers

increased by more than the hazards of older workers. Young workers with secondary education

hired in the formal sector were 4.1% more likely to exit employment than did younger informal

workers with secondary education after the reform. Similarly, middle-aged formal workers with

secondary education were 7.9% more likely to exit employment than did middle-aged informal

workers with secondary education after the reform. The smallest impact of the reform was on

older formal workers, who were only 1.8% more likely to exit employment than did older

informal workers after the reform.                          These results are thus consistent with lower expected

dismissals of workers with more than ten years of tenure. Moreover, the results also indicate that

the impact of the reform was greater on more educated workers who are more likely to have

benefited from the use of “Integral Salary” contracts. The exit rate of middle-aged formal

workers with a primary education increased by 6.6% after the reform relative to middle-aged

informal workers with the same level of education. The exit rate of middle-aged formal workers

20
     The permanent dummy takes the value of 1 if the worker is a permanent worker and zero if the worker is temporary.

                                                                        39
with secondary, a high school degree and university education increased by 7.9%, 12.5%, and

13.1% after the reform relative to middle-aged informal workers with the same levels of

education. In contrast, the hazard out of employment increased only by 3.8% for middle-aged

formal workers with more than a university degree after the reform relative to middle-aged

informal workers with the highest educational attainment. The impact was, thus, smallest among

the least and the most educated. The small impact on these groups may be due to the fact that

these workers have longer tenures and, thus, are more likely to have been affected by the

increase in the costs of ‘unjust’ dismissals for tenures of more than ten years.

       While the above patterns are consistent with the effects of the labor market reform on

different groups, it may be that part of the increased turnover is the result of trade shocks

affecting various groups differently. Column (4) in Table 16 presents the results from an

exponential hazard model that includes interaction terms of the Formal × Post90 dummy with

sector dummies. The idea is that if trade liberalization were responsible for the increased

turnover after the labor market reform, then the observed impact would be greater on workers

employed in tradable sectors than on those employed in non-tradable sectors. The results from

Column (4) in Table 16 show that the increase in turnover of covered workers after the reform

was greater in utilities, transportation, construction and services. The probability of exiting

formal employment in these sectors after the reform was 640%, 15.7%, 12.3%, and 17.6%

greater than the probability of exiting informal employment in these sectors. However, if the

trade shocks were a main source of the increased turnover, it would be expected that the exit rate

out of employment would had increased more for workers hired in trade-intensive sectors such

as commerce and manufacturing. In fact, after the reform formal workers in commerce were

only 2.5% more likely to exit employment than informal workers in this sector were. Moreover,

                                                 40
the probability of exiting employment was 1% lower after the reform for formal workers relative

to informal workers hired in manufacturing. The results from the exponential hazard model,

thus, do not provide any reason to believe that trade liberalization increased turnover for covered

workers after 1990.

          Table 17 includes the results of exponential hazards out of unemployment. Given the

reduction of mandated firing costs, one would expect greater hiring in the covered sector and,

thus, an increase in the escape rate out of unemployment for workers hired into formal sector

jobs. Column (1) shows that, indeed, the exit hazard out of unemployment increased by 5.75%

for covered workers after the reform relative to uncovered workers.21 Moreover, while the

extension of temporary contracts appears to explain part of the increased hiring, most of the

increase in the exit hazards out of unemployment is due to the increased hazards into permanent

jobs in the formal sector. The results from Column (2) in Table 17 show that the escape rate out

of unemployment increased by 4% for formal temporary workers after the reform relative to

temporary informal workers. However, the exit rate out of unemployment increased by even

more for formal permanent workers after the reform, thus indicating that the reduction in

dismissal costs of permanent workers did increase the incentives to hire this type of workers.

The results show that the probability of exiting unemployment and entering a formal permanent

job increased by 6.1% after the reform relative to the probability of entering an informal

permanent job.22

          Column (3) in Table 17 presents the results of the exponential hazard model including

interaction terms of the reform effect with the age and education variables. The estimates from

21
  The sign on the formal dummy is positive and significant at the 1% level. This could be explained if unsuccessful discouraged workers who
get tired of searching for formal work turned to the informal sector as a last resource.



                                                                    41
this model show that, as for the hazards out of employment, the impact of the reform was greater

on younger and more educated workers. The reform should have had greater effects on the exit

rates out of unemployment for younger workers if the reduction in dismissal costs decreased the

power of insiders and induced more hiring of young outsiders. In fact, the exit rate out of

unemployment and into formal jobs for young workers increased by 25.8% after the reform

relative to the exit rate into informal jobs. The exit rate into formal jobs for middle-aged

workers also increased after the reform but not by as much. In particular, the hazard rate out of

unemployment and into formal jobs increased by 3.9% for middle-aged workers relative to

informal workers. In contrast, the hazard rates out of unemployment and into formal jobs

decreased by 11.1% for older workers after the reform, relative to those entering informal jobs.

In addition, these results show that the impact of the reform on exit hazard rates out

unemployment was greatest on the more educated. This is to be expected, given that these

workers are the ones more likely to opt for the “Integral Salary” contract that exempts workers

from severance and other dismissal costs. In fact, the hazards out of unemployment and into

formal jobs decreased after the reform by 10% relative to the hazard out of unemployment and

into informal jobs for workers with primary education and by 3.9% and 1.2% for workers with

secondary schooling and a high school degree, respectively. In contrast, after the reform, the

exit rates out of unemployment and into formal jobs increased by 37% for university graduates

and by 12% for workers with more than a university degree relative to the exit rates into

informal jobs.

             Finally, Column (4) in Table 17 shows the results of the hazard model with sector

dummy and reform interactions. The results show that the increase in the exit rates out of

22
     The sign on the permanent dummy is positive and significant at the 1% level. Similarly to the description in footnote 17, this is probably due

                                                                         42
unemployment after the reform was greater for workers exiting into formal sector jobs in mining,

utilities, and services. The probability of exiting unemployment into formal employment in

these sectors after the reform was 45.7%, 27.6%, and 10.9% greater than the probability of

exiting unemployment into informal employment in these sectors. However, the probability of

exiting unemployment into formal employment in trade-intensive sectors such as commerce and

manufacturing was only 2.8% and 6.7% higher than the probability of exiting unemployment

into informal employment in these sectors. As the results from the employment hazard models,

these results from the unemployment hazard model, thus, do not provide evidence indicating the

importance of trade liberalization in increasing worker turnover after 1990.                                          Instead, the

increased hazards in utilities and services, which are more likely to be public sector jobs covered

by the legislation, indicates to the importance of the labor market reform in generating these

patterns in turnover.

VII. Worker Turnover and Unemployment

           The previous section showed that the functioning of labor markets changed substantially

in Colombia after the introduction of the labor market reform of 1990. In particular, the

estimates from the formal hazards show that, after controlling for observable characteristics, the

post-reform period was characterized by higher exit rates into and out of unemployment in the

formal sector relative to the informal sector.

           While the results in the previous section indicate that the reform increased labor market

flexibility by increasing the flows into and out of unemployment, the net effects of the reform on

employment and unemployment are ambiguous. In this section, I use the steady state condition

of the model in Section IV, together with the hazard rate results obtained in Section VI, to obtain

discouraged workers who are unsuccessful finding a permanent position turning to temporary jobs as a last resource.

                                                                      43
a rough estimate of the net effect of the reform on unemployment.

          In the model above, a steady state condition has to be satisfied such that the flow into

unemployment from both sectors must equal the flow out of unemployment and into both

sectors:

 λFeF + θq(θ)(1-F(Am))G(γF))u + λIeI + θq(θ)F(Am)G(γI)u = θq(θ)(1-F(Am))u + θq(θ)F(Am)u.

Substituting for employment in each sector, eF = (1-F(Am))e and eI = F(Am)e, and for the

identity, e + u =1, and solving for u yields the following formula for the unemployment rate,

                                   u = [(1-F(Am))λF + F(Am)λI] /
            [(1-F(Am))λF + F(Am)λI + (1-F(Am))θq(θ)(1-G(γF)) + F(Am)θq(θ)(1-G(γI))].

The unemployment rate can be estimated from this equation by substituting for the average

hazard rates into and out of unemployment during the pre-reform period and the shares in each

sector.     The average hazard rates are estimated with the average tenure and unemployment

spells in Tables 4 and 10, which indicate an average tenure of 67.2 and 54.2 months in the formal

and informal sectors and average unemployment spells of 1.8 and 2.2 months in the formal and

informal sectors during the pre-reform period. The shares of formal and informal employment

are reported in Table 1. Before the reform, the shares of formal and informal employment were

0.45 and 0.55, respectively. After the reform, the shares of formal and informal employment

changed to 0.51 and 0.49, respectively. Finally, Tables 16 and 17 show an increase in the

hazards into an out of unemployment of 6.17% and 5.75%.

          As the model abstracts from many factors affecting labor markets, the estimated

unemployment obtained from the formula above should not be interpreted as precise estimates of

the unemployment rate, but rather as an indication of the magnitude of the changes in

unemployment rates between the two periods. For example, taking into account other flows such


                                                 44
as retirements, new entries into the labor market, and deaths, the unemployment rate is:

                          u = [ ξ + ψ + σ + (1-F(Am))λF + F(Am)λI] /
   [ ξ + ψ + σ + (1-F(Am))λF + F(Am)λI + (1-F(Am))θq(θ)(1-G(γF)) + F(Am)θq(θ)(1-G(γI))],

where ξ, ψ, and σ are the flows due to retirements, new entries, and deaths, which are estimated

assuming a working life of 35 years, entry at 18 years of age, and a life expectancy of 60 years

for those that die before retiring.

        The unemployment rate for the pre-reform period obtained with this formula is 4.84%,

which is lower than the true unemployment rate of 11.8% in Colombia in 1988. The post-reform

unemployment rate estimated with the post-reform shares is 4.69%, which is also a lower than

the true unemployment in 1992 and 1996, 10.2% and 10%, respectively. These results suggest a

reduction in unemployment of 0.15% points between the pre- and post-reform periods, compared

to the actual reduction in unemployment of 1.6% between 1988 and 1992 and of 1.8% between

1988 and 1996. These results suggest the reform contributed to about 10% of the reduction in

the unemployment rate between the pre- and post-reform periods.

VIII. Conclusion

        The Colombian labor market reform of 1990 provides an interesting quasi-experiment to

analyze the effects of a reduction in firing costs. This study exploited the temporal change in the

legislation together with the difference in coverage between formal and informal workers to

analyze the impact of the reform on worker turnover. The differences-in-differences estimates

indicate that the reform increased the dynamism of the Colombian labor market, by increasing

the exit rates into and out of unemployment. Moreover, aside from contributing to increase

mobility in the labor market, the reform is also likely to have contributed to increase compliance

with labor legislation by lowering the costs of formal production. The increased churning in the


                                                45
labor market and the greater compliance with the legislation are estimated to have contributed to

about 10% of the reduction in the unemployment rate from the late 1980’s to the early 1990’s.

At the same time, the reform is likely to explain in part the recent surge in the unemployment

rate during the late 1990’s. This is because the greater flexibility in hiring and firing after the

reform is likely to translate in increased hiring relative to firing during expansions but in

increased firings relative to hiring during recessions.

Notes: the table reports proportions and means of the variables in the formal and informal sectors before and after the reform using two alternative
definitions of informality. The proportions and means using the first definition are presented in the top panel, while those using the second definition
are presented in the bottom panel. Under definition 1, workers are defined as those whose employers pay social security taxes and informal workers
are those whose employer does not pay social security contributions. Under definition 2, formal workers are defined as wage-earners employed by
firms with more than 10 employees and informal workers are wage-earners employed by firms with less than 10 employees, family workers, domestic
workers, and self-employed workers. In Colombia, family workers, self-employed, and workers employed by firms with less than 5 employees are
completely exempt from severance pay legislation, while domestic workers and workers employed by firms with little capital are subject to half the
severance payments of workers completely covered by the legislation.
