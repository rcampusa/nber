Hepatitis B Does Not Explain Male-Biased Sex Ratios in China
Emily Oster and Gang Chen
NBER Working Paper No. 13971
April 2008
JEL No. J1,J16

                                              ABSTRACT

Earlier work (Oster, 2005) has argued, based on existing medical literature and analysis of cross country
data and vaccination programs, that parents who are carriers of hepatitis B have a higher offspring
sex ratio (more boys) than non-carrier parents. Further, since a number of Asian countries, China in
particular, have high hepatitis B carrier rates, Oster (2005) suggested that hepatitis B could explain
a large share { approximately 50% { of Asia's \missing women". Subsequent work has questioned
this conclusion. Most notably, Lin and Luoh (2008) use data from a large cohort of births in Taiwan
and find only a very tiny effect of maternal hepatitis carrier status on offspring sex ratio. Although
this work is quite conclusive for the case of mothers, it leaves open the possibility that paternal carrier
status is driving higher sex offspring sex ratios. To test this, we collected data on the offspring gender
for a cohort of 67,000 people in China who are being observed in a prospective cohort study of liver
cancer; approximately 15% of these individuals are hepatitis B carriers. In this sample, we find no
effect of either maternal or paternal hepatitis B carrier status on offspring sex. Carrier parents are no
more likely to have male children than non-carrier parents. This finding leads us to conclude that hepatitis
B cannot explain skewed sex ratios in China.

           Earlier work (Oster, 2005) has argued, based on existing medical literature and analysis of
        cross country data and vaccination programs, that parents who are carriers of hepatitis B have a
        higher offspring sex ratio (more boys) than non-carrier parents. Further, since a number of Asian
        countries, China in particular, have high hepatitis B carrier rates, Oster(2005) suggested that
        hepatitis B could explain a large share – approximately 50% – of Asia’s “missing women”.
        Subsequent work has questioned this conclusion. Most notably, Lin and Luoh (2008) use data
        from a large cohort of births in Taiwan and find only a very tiny effect of maternal hepatitis
        carrier status on offspring sex ratio. Although this work is quite conclusive for the case of
        mothers, it leaves open the possibility that paternal carrier status is driving higher sex offspring
        sex ratios. To test this, we collected data on the offspring gender for a cohort of 67,000 people in
        China who are being observed in a prospective cohort study of liver cancer; approximately 15% of
        these individuals are hepatitis B carriers. In this sample, we find no effect of either maternal or
        paternal hepatitis B carrier status on offspring sex. Carrier parents are no more likely to have
        male children than non-carrier parents. This finding leads us to conclude that hepatitis B cannot
        explain skewed sex ratios in China.



1       Introduction

Earlier work (Oster, 2005) has argued that a high rate of hepatitis B carrier status in China explains
a large share of the male-biased gender ratio – the “missing women” phenomenon – in that country
and, more generally, that high rates of hepatitis in a number of Asian countries explained some of
the skewed gender ratios there. This conclusion was based first on evidence from an existing medical
literature suggesting that families where at least one parent is a carrier of the hepatitis B virus had a
larger share of male children (Hesser, Economidou and Blumberg, 1975; Drew, London, Blumberg
and Serjeanston, 1982; Drew, Blumberg and Robert-Lamblin, 1986; Chahnazarian, Blumberg and
London, 1988; Cazal, Lemiare and Robinet-Levy, 1976; Livadas et al, 1979). Oster (2005)

                                                         1
supplemented this existing evidence with evidence on vaccination campaigns, notably in Alaska, and
cross country evidence suggesting that countries with higher hepatitis B carrier rates have higher
male-to-female ratios. In summary, the evidence suggested that families with a hepatitis B carrier
parent had children that were 60% male, versus 51% in the overall population.
         Subsequent to that research, a number of papers have emerged questioning the conclusions
in Oster (2005). Several papers have questioned the evidence on skewed sex ratios in China, arguing
that these skewed ratios, at least in recent years, appear only at higher order births, which may be
inconsistent with the hepatitis B hypothesis (Das Gupta, 2005; Ebenstein, 2007). Most notably, Lin
and Luoh (2008) have used a new, individual-level, dataset to test the underlying premise that
hepatitis B carrier status is related to sex ratio. In a sample of approximately 3 million births in
Taiwan, they find that women who are carriers of hepatitis B are only very slightly more likely to
have male children than non-carriers. The effect is approximately 0.25 percentage points.
         The dataset used by Lin and Luoh (2008) is much larger than the original individual-level
studies reported in the medical literature (most of these had only a few hundred or thousand
children) and is consequently quite convincing on the relationship between maternal hepatitis status
and offspring gender. However, Lin and Luoh (2008) only observe maternal status, whereas the
original data, and the analysis in Oster (2005) focuses on infection at the family or population level.
These data therefore leave open the possibility that paternal hepatitis B infection could be
responsible for skewed gender ratios. Indeed, in a re-analysis of the original data from Greece and
the Philippines (reported in detail in Chen, Oster, Yu and Lin (2008)) we see that paternal carrier
status, not maternal, is associated with higher offspring sex ratios.
         To test the effect of both maternal and paternal carrier status we have collected data on
approximately 67,000 individuals in China, taking advantage of a cohort of individuals already
taking part in a study of liver cancer and the effect of hepatitis B on health (this cohort is reported
on in more detail in London et al, 1995 and Evans et al, 2002). From earlier surveys of this cohort,
data was available on hepatitis B carrier status (approximately 15% of individuals are carriers). Our
survey, described in more detail in Section 2, collected data on the gender of offspring. Since the
sample includes both men and women, and in some cases links spouses together, it is possible to
estimate the effect of both maternal and paternal hepatitis B carrier status.
         Using this data, we find no effect of either paternal or maternal hepatitis B carrier status on
offspring sex ratio. Estimates of the effects on child gender are extremely close to zero, inconsistently
signed and have small standard errors. This is true with and without controls for age, township and


                                                   2
child birth order. This demonstrates that hepatitis B carrier status cannot explain male-biased sex
ratios in China. The rest of this brief note reports in more detail on these findings. Section 2
describes the survey run in China, Section 3 presents our results on sex ratios and Section 4
concludes.


2    Survey Description

This study takes advantage of an existing cohort study of individuals in China who are being
followed in order to evaluate the impact of chronic hepatitis B status on health, focusing on liver
cancer. Detailed data on the enrollment and study of this cohort can be found elsewhere (Evans et
al, 2002; London et al, 1995). This is a large, prospective cohort study of adult residents in rural
areas around Haimen City in the Jiangsu Province. Subjects were originally recruited in 1992, and
have been followed since then. At enrollment, individuals completed a one-page questionnaire with
details on age, behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption) and family history (particularly, history of
liver cancer). Individuals also gave blood, which was tested for hepatitis B carrier status (and in
some cases other hepatitis B markers). The original cohort contained 90,836 adult residents of this
area. Although follow-up has been done periodically with these subjects, they have never been asked
details about their offspring.
         Data on child gender was collected by the Haimen CDC in the period between December,
2007 and February, 2008, for 67,511 of the original subjects. Re-surveying all of the individuals
would have been prohibitively expensive (and difficult since approximately 10% of them had died).
As an alternative, we asked officials in each village to report information on the children of cohort
members who lived in their village. In each village, we invited the village head, party secretary of
the village, the village doctor, the village accountant and any other village administrative staff to
come together and provide data on cohort members’ children. They were given a list of cohort
participants in their village and asked to report the gender and status (alive, dead) for any children
born to these individuals, by birth order. Observation of these meetings suggests that the
administrators made use of official records of births and families, as well as personal recollection. In
addition, an extremely large share of the (living) individuals in the cohort had telephones, and in
cases where they were unsure, the administrators phoned the cohort member themselves.
         In addition to this, we collected quality control data on 2,590 participants. This quality
control focused on cohort members with 4 or more children, since pilot surveys suggested that this



                                                   3
was the group for which administrators were most likely to make errors. In addition to the basic
data on gender and status, the quality control data also asked details about abortions or
miscarriages that the respondent was aware of. Comparing the quality control to the larger dataset,
the surveyors found a 2.82% error rate in the first round of data provided by the administrators.1 In
situations where there were mis-matches (i.e. the quality control did not mach with the officially
provided data) the data was sent back to the village administrators and they were asked to re-check
everything. If necessary, this process was repeated more than once to ensure maximum overall data
quality. In the results section below, we will report results both for the overall sample and for the
quality control data alone. We will also report results for various sub-samples (younger people, those
with fewer children, etc) for whom we think errors are even less likely.
          Table 1 reports summary statistics for the overall sample, and the quality control.
Sixty-four percent of the overall sample is male (representing a purposeful over sampling of the
original survey, since men are more likely to be hepatitis B carriers) and 15.4% of them are carriers
of hepatitis B. The average individual has 1.0 male children, and 0.95 female children, reflecting an
overall slightly skewed sex ratio in the population. Individuals in the sample range in age from 34 to
84, with an average of 58. Among the sample, approximately 10% of respondents had died by the
most recent survey2 and 1.8% of the children of sample participants had died. Finally, for 13% of the
sample we also have their spouse included in the cohort. This will allow us to estimate the effect of
maternal and paternal carrier status at the same time, for some share of the sample.
          The quality control sample is slightly more skewed towards men (73%) and has a slightly
smaller share of hepatitis carriers (13%). The sample has more children, on average, due to the
method of selection, and is older. The older age reflects the sample selection: because of the
one-child rule, younger people typically do not have 4 or more children. Death rates among cohort
members in this sample are zero, since only living people could be contacted, but the death rate
among their offspring is higher, at 5.7%. This also reflects the selection of larger families and older
parents: among families of a similar size in the overall sample, death rates are similar.
   1
     It is worth noting the error rate would likely be lower if we had not specifically focused on quality control for the
group where they thought there was most likely to be mistakes.
   2
     Because of the data collection technique, it was possible to get information on offspring even of people who had died.
Of course, quality control was not possible with this sub-sample.

3       Results: Effect of Hepatitis B on Offspring Sex Ratio

Figure 1 shows the primary results in the paper, focusing on the overall sample. The first set of
columns focuses on paternal carrier status: among men who are carriers, 51.06% of their offspring
are boys. Among non-carriers, this is 51.56%. For mothers, the numbers are 51.58% and 51.43%.
The final set of columns compares children for whom both parents are carriers to children for whom
neither parent is a carrier; the share of males among offspring are 49.45% and 50.68%, respectively.
This graph suggests there is no substantial difference in child gender by parental hepatitis B carrier
status.
          Table 2 reports regression results focusing on the overall sample. Panel A shows the
relationship between gender and parental hepatitis carrier status with no controls (corresponding
exactly to Figure 1). As expected based on Figure 1, neither paternal nor maternal carrier status
significantly impacts child gender, and including them jointly shows a similar result. Panel B of
Table 2 includes a simple set of controls: child birth order, number of children in the family, a
quadratic in parent age and fixed effects for township (to capture location or income effects)3 .
Again, we see no effect of carrier status on gender. We do see some effects of birth order – consistent
with other work on parity, later birth order children are more likely to be boys. We also see a
negative effect of number of children – larger families have fewer boys. This is consistent with a
gender-biased stopping rule, which may well be in play here.
          One concern with these data, as discussed, is the possibility of errors based on the data
collection process; in particular, the possibility that village leaders are unable to recall details related
to residents’ children. Although there is no reason to think this would be bias the results in any
particular direction, we re-run the analysis with two sub-samples for whom we think this
misreporting is less likely. First, in Panel A of Table 3 we limit the sample to individuals who are
under 60 and who are alive, for whom we think recall by others is likely to be easier. We see no effect
of hepatitis status on gender for this group. Second, in Panel B of Table 3 we limit to families with
only one child, where the gender of the child is likely to be salient and there is no issue with
mis-reporting gender by birth order. Again, we see no positive effect in this sub-sample; there
appears to be some negative effect of maternal hepatitis carrier status on gender in the sample for
which we observe both parents, but this is a very small sample, and this result does not seem to be
generally robust.
    3
   We have also experimented with controlling for other behavioral and health measures – alcohol or smoking abuse,
exposure to pesticides, family history of liver cancer – and these do not change the result.



                                                        5
         Table 4 replicates the regressions above using the quality control sample. In this case, we
focus on using all of the quality control data, since the sample size is limited to begin with. In
addition, because of the limited sample size it is not possible to look at the effect of maternal and
paternal infection at the same time. However, in the samples separated by gender, we see
confirmation of the results in Tables 2 and 3: no effect of parent carrier status on child gender.


4    Discussion and Conclusion

Tables 2 through 4 and Figure 1 all point to a similar conclusion: in this sample we see no effect of
parental hepatitis B carrier status on offspring gender. Given this result, we conclude that hepatitis
B carrier rates cannot explain male-biased sex ratios or the “missing women” in China. The evidence
is consistent with the finding in Lin and Luoh (2008), but also allows us to estimate the effect of
paternal hepatitis carrier status.
         An important remaining issue is whether it is possible to reconcile the biological results in
the original paper (Oster, 2005) with these results and, in particular, how the individual-level data
from outside of China and the evidence from vaccination campaigns in Alaska can coexist with the
new results from China. In Chen, Oster, Yu and Lin (2008) we address this issue in more detail. We
re-visit the original individual-level data from Greece and the Philippines and continue to find
support for the connection between paternal hepatitis B carrier status and offspring sex ratio.
Moreover, in the data from China discussed here, we also find some interaction between hepatitis B,
gender and fertility: women with the hepatitis B e antigen (carriers who are also replicating an
additional viral antigen) seem to have fewer male children. Further, women who are carriers of the
virus have fewer children overall, even with extensive controls. Together, this evidence suggests that
there may still be some interaction between hepatitis B and fertility outcomes (in general) but that
clearly the pathways are much more complicated than the simple carrier-male offspring connection.
One possibility is that the interaction differs with different genotypes of the hepatitis B virus, but
that is not something we can prove definitively with the existing data. Further research would be
required to settle this question.

Notes: This table reports effects of parental hepatitis B status on child gender in the
Chinese sample. Column 1 includes all children for whom we observe paternal hepatitis;
Column 2 includes all children for whom we observe maternal hepatitis. Column 3 includes
only those children (a smaller sample) for whom both parents are in the cohort, so we see
both of their hepatitis carrier status.

Notes: This table reports effects of parental hepatitis B status on child gender in sub-
samples of the overall surveyed population: Panel A focuses on children of parents who are
under 60 and still alive and Panel B focuses on only one-child families. Column 1 includes
all children for whom we observe paternal hepatitis; Column 2 includes all children for
whom we observe maternal hepatitis. Column 3 includes only those children (a smaller
sample) for whom both parents are in the cohort, so we see both of their hepatitis carrier
status.
