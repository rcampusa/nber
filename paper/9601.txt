This paper argues that campaign finance policy, in the form of contribution limits and matching
public financing, can be Pareto improving even under the most optimistic assumptions concerning
the role of campaign advertising and the rationality of voters. The argument assumes that candidates

use campaign contributions to convey truthful information to voters about their qualifications for
office and that voters update their beliefs rationally on the basis of the information they have seen.

It also assumes that campaign contributions are provided by interest groups and that candidates can
offer to provide policy favors for their interest groups to attract higher contributions. The argument
is developed in the context of a simple model of political competition with campaign contributions
and informative advertising.

1        Introduction

This paper argues that campaign finance policy, in the form of contribution limits and matching

public financing, can be Pareto improving even under the most optimistic assumptions concern-

ing the role of campaign advertising and the rationality of voters. The argument assumes that

candidates use campaign contributions to convey truthful information to voters about their qual-

ifications for oﬃce and voters update their beliefs rationally on the basis of the information they

have seen. It also assumes that campaign contributions are provided by interest groups and that

candidates can oﬀer to provide policy favors for their interest groups to attract higher contribu-

tions.

    The argument is developed in a simple model of electoral competition. There are two political

parties representing opposing ideologies. Parties put forward candidates who represent their ide-

ologies, but may have diﬃculty finding qualified candidates. Thus each party’s candidate may be

qualified or unqualified. Voters know a candidate’s party aﬃliation but not whether he is qualified.

Advertising allows a candidate to provide voters with this information. Such advertising can be

advantageous for a qualified candidate because it may attract swing voters. Resources for cam-

paign advertising are obtained by candidates from interest groups consisting of citizens of opposing

ideologies. If elected, candidates are able to implement policy favors for their interest groups and,

before the election, they can oﬀer to implement such favors to extract larger contributions.

    The starting point for the argument is the observation that the potential social benefit of

contributions lies in giving qualified candidates an electoral advantage over unqualified opponents.

With no contributions, there would be no mechanism for qualified candidates to get out the word

to voters. Giving qualified candidates an electoral advantage potentially benefits all citizens, as it

results in better leaders.

    In order for campaign contributions to have this benefit, campaign advertising must be eﬀective



                                                  1
in that learning that a candidate is qualified will induce some fraction of swing voters to switch

their votes from unadvertised candidates. The larger the fraction of voters who switch, the greater

the eﬀectiveness of campaign advertising and the greater the advantage such advertising brings to

qualified candidates. However, when campaign contributions are unrestricted and candidates are

power-hungry, campaign advertising will not be that eﬀective. Voters will rationally be cynical

about qualified candidates, anticipating that they will implement favors for their contributors if

elected. This cynicism will reduce the likelihood of voters switching their votes and, despite the

fact that resources are spent on advertising, qualified candidates will not have much of an electoral

advantage over unqualified opponents.

   When campaign contributions are limited, candidates’ incentive to oﬀer favors to extract more

contributions is dampened. Voters now anticipate that advertised candidates will implement

fewer favors than in the unrestricted case and this may increase the likelihood they will vote for

them. This increase in the eﬀectiveness of advertising means that limits, despite reducing the

level of campaign advertising, need not reduce the likelihood that qualified candidates get elected.

Moreover, if elected such candidates will implement lower levels of favors than in the unrestricted

case. Thus, all regular citizens can be better oﬀ when contributions are limited. The only possible

losers are contributors who receive lower levels of favors. But their expected gains from favors will

be dissipated by the contributions they make, meaning they may also be better oﬀ. In this way,

limiting contributions may create a Pareto improvement.

   Even when this is not the case, a campaign finance policy which both imposes limits and

provides publicly financed matching grants can always create a Pareto improvement. Limits reduce

favors and raise the eﬀectiveness of campaign spending, while public financing oﬀsets the reduction

in private contributions caused by limits. Since public funds are tax financed, as opposed to favor

financed, this infusion of money has no negative consequences for the eﬀectiveness of campaign

spending. Eﬀectively, public financing substitutes clean money for tainted money received in


                                                 2
exchange for policy favors.

    The organization of the remainder of the paper is as follows. The next section presents the

model. Section 3 analyzes equilibrium with unrestricted contributions. Campaign finance policy

is studied in Section 4. Section 5 discusses the relationship of the paper to the growing literature

on campaign finance regulation. Section 6 concludes with a summary of the argument and some

suggestions for further research.




2     The Model

2.1     Overview

The population consists of three groups of citizens - leftists, rightists, and swing voters. These

groups diﬀer in their ideology which is measured on a 0 to 1 scale. Leftists and rightists have

ideologies 0 and 1 respectively. Swing voters have ideologies that are uniformly distributed on

the interval [µ − τ, µ + τ ]. Leftists and rightists constitute an equal fraction of the community,

so that swing voters are the decisive group. Reflecting the fluid nature of these voters’ attitudes,

the ideology of the median swing voter is ex ante uncertain. Specifically, µ is the realization of a

random variable uniformly distributed on [ 12 − ε, 12 + ε], where ε is less than            1
                                                                                            2   − τ .1   The latter

assumption guarantees that the ideologies of the swing voters are always between those of leftists

and rightists.

    The community must elect a representative. Candidates are put forward by two political

parties: Party L - the leftist party, and Party R - the rightist party. Following the citizen-

candidate approach, candidates are citizens and are characterized by their ideologies. Each party

must select from the ranks of its membership, so that Party L always selects a leftist and Party
   1 The assumptions that swing voters are uniformly distributed over [µ − τ, µ + τ ] and that the ideology of the

median swing voter is uniformly distributed over [ 12 − ε, 12 + ε] are not key to the argument. They are simply made
to ensure that the probability of winning function derived below has a simple and tractable form.



                                                         3
R a rightist. However, candidates diﬀer in their qualifications for oﬃce, denoted by q. They are

either “qualified” (q = 1) or “unqualified” (q = 0). A qualified candidate, for example, may be

one who has previously held elective oﬃce.2              All citizens, including party members, prefer a

qualified candidate. Thus parties will always select qualified candidates if they are available. The

probability that each party can find a qualified candidate is σ.

    Assuming that he does not implement favors, a citizen with ideology i enjoys a monetary payoﬀ

from having a leader of ideology i0 and qualifications q given by δq − β |i − i0 | where |i − i0 | is the

distance from i to i0 . The parameter δ measures the benefit of having a qualified candidate in

oﬃce, while β measures the cost of having a leader with a diﬀerent ideology. It is assumed that

leftists and rightists always prefer a candidate of their own ideology even if he is unqualified which

implies that δ is less than β. Candidates have the same payoﬀs as citizens except that the winning

candidate enjoys an ego-rent r. This measures how power-hungry candidates are.

    Swing voters do not have perfect information about candidates, in the sense of not knowing

whether each party’s candidate is qualified. Such information could be acquired, but swing voters

are not politically engaged and choose to remain “rationally ignorant”. However, candidates can

convey information concerning their qualifications via advertising. For example, they can inform

voters about the prior elected oﬃces they have held.3 Swing voters cannot ignore such advertising

because it is bundled with radio or television programming.

    Campaign advertising is governed by the following rules. First, candidates can only advertise

their own characteristics; i.e., whether they are qualified. This rules out negative advertising.
   2 Broader interpretations of q are possible. It could measure any valence characteristic such as managerial

competence, policy creativity, charisma, image, or looks. The significance of valence characteristics for candidate
elections has been stressed by numerous authors. See Aragones and Palfrey (2000) and Groseclose (2001) for two
interesting recent contributions.
   3 There is widespread evidence that higher campaign spending leads to greater candidate familiarity (see, for

example, Jacobson (1997)) and some evidence that it leads to greater familiarity with candidates’ policy positions
(see, for example, Coleman and Manna (2000) and Jamieson (2000)). I am not aware of any studies directly
investigating the relationship between campaign spending and voter knowledge of candidates’ records (i.e., elected
oﬃces previously held, past accomplishments, etc).




                                                        4
Second, candidates can only advertise the truth. The idea is that candidates have records which

reveal their qualifications and that candidates cannot lie about their records. These two as-

sumptions imply that only qualified candidates can benefit from campaign advertising.4                         The

advertising technology is such that if a candidate spends an amount C, his message reaches a

fraction λ(C) = C/(C + α) of the population, where α > 0.5

    Candidates’ advertising is financed by campaign contributions from interest groups. There

are two such groups - a group of leftists that contributes to Party L’s candidates and a group

of rightists that contributes to Party R’s. Each group constitutes a fraction γ of the population.

Contributions are shared equally by group members and the interest groups behave so as to

maximize the expected payoﬀ of their representative members.

    After he has been selected, each party’s candidate, if qualified, requests a contribution from

his interest group to get the word out to voters. The interest group agrees to a candidate’s request

if and only if it benefits it to do so. To obtain a larger contribution, a candidate may oﬀer to

implement policy favors. When a candidate provides a level of favors f each interest group member

enjoys a monetary benefit b(f ) at the expense of a uniform monetary cost of f to each citizen.

The function b is increasing, strictly concave, and satisfies b(0) = 0. In addition, it satisfies the

conditions that b0 (0) ≤ 1/γ and b0 (δ) > 1. The first condition implies that the aggregate benefits

of the favors γb(f ) are less than their aggregate cost f , while the second implies that interest

group members’ net benefit from favors b(f ) − f is increasing when f equals δ.

    In terms of timing, it is assumed that candidates make their requests before they or their
   4 This conclusion arises because there is only one possible diﬀerence between candidates and negative advertising

is not permitted. However, the general conclusion that candidates with characteristics swing voters value should
benefit more from advertising seems a natural implication of the informational perspective. Consistent with this,
Jacobson (1989) shows that qualified candidates - defined as those who had previously held elective oﬃce - had
higher levels of campaign spending and were more likely to win in U.S. House elections.
   5 Again, this specific functional form for the advertising technology is not key to the results and just helps

produce a tractable probability of winning function.




                                                         5
interest group knows the type of their opponent.6              Needless to say, swing voters do not observe

the interaction between candidates and interest groups and hence do not observe the favors a

candidate has promised.

    Parties choose the best candidate they can find. Qualified candidates approach their interest

group and decide what contribution to request and how many favors to oﬀer. Interest groups

decide whether or not to accept candidates’ oﬀers. Partisans (i.e., leftists and rightists) always

vote for the candidate put forward by the party representing their ideology. Swing voters, having

possibly observed one or both candidates’ advertisements update their beliefs about candidates’

qualifications and vote for the candidate who yields them the highest expected payoﬀ.7 All these

behaviors are described in greater detail in the sequel.

    Throughout the analysis, we maintain the following additional assumptions on the parameter

values.

                                    δ               δ
Assumption 1: (i) τ ≥ ε +          2β   and (ii)   2β   ≤ ε.

The role of these will become apparent below.
   6 This assumption is made to simplify the argument. If interest groups know the type of the opposing party’s

candidate, they will be willing to contribute more to a candidate running against an unqualified than a qualified
one. This is because the benefit to them of electing their own party’s candidate is higher in the former case. This
diﬀerence in contribution levels means that seeing an advertisement for a candidate provides information to voters
about the likely type of his opponent. After all, a voter is more likely to see an advertisement for a candidate when
he is running against an unqualified opponent. While it is perfectly to develop the argument taking this eﬀect into
account, it is an additional wrinkle that significantly complicates an already intricate analysis. Accordingly, the
eﬀect is assumed away here.
    7 We are therefore assuming “sincere” or “naive” voting. It is by now well known that in an election with a

finite number of voters with private information, such behavior may not be fully rational. In particular, rational
voters may choose to ignore their own private information on account of the “swing voter’s curse” (Fedderson
and Pesendorfer (1996)). In our model, there are a continuum of voters and hence such considerations do not
arise. However, it would, of course, be possible to assume a finite number of swing voters and carefully model the
equilibrium of the voting game. I have not taken this approach for two main reasons. First, a key assumption
of the model is that there is aggregate uncertainty concerning the distribution of voter preferences. Specifically,
the location of the median swing voter is unknown. In environments with aggregate uncertainty, the forces that
lead voters to rationally ignore their private information are muted (Fedderson and Pesendorfer (1997)). Thus,
given significant aggregate uncertainty, sincere voting may be a reasonable approximation of equilibrium behavior.
Second, taking this approach would substantially complicate the development of the argument. In particular, the
relationship between election outcomes and campaign spending is likely to be too complex to permit clean analysis
of the contribution game.

2.2    Details

Behavior of swing voters: Working backwards, we begin with the behavior of swing voters.

Consider the position of a swing voter with ideology i at the time of voting. He may have seen

advertisements from both, one, or neither candidate. Let (IL , IR ) denote his information where

IK = 1 if he has seen an advertisement from Party K’s candidate and IK = ∅ if not. Let

ρK (IL , IR ) denote his belief that Party K’s candidate is qualified conditional on informational

state (IL , IR ). Since only qualified candidates advertise, both ρL (1, IR ) and ρR (IL , 1) must equal

1. The beliefs ρL (∅, IR ) and ρR (IL , ∅) will be derived as part of the equilibrium.

   The swing voter will also have beliefs about the amount of favors that each party’s candidate, if

qualified, will provide to the interest group. In equilibrium, the amount of favors that voters think

that candidates will implement must equal the amount that they actually will. Accordingly, we

will not employ a separate notation to distinguish voters’ beliefs from the actual levels promised.

We let fK denote the amount of favors that Party K’s candidate, if qualified, will provide to the

interest group.

   Using this notation, the voter’s expected payoﬀ from Party L’s candidate being elected when

he has information (IL , IR ) is ρL (IL , IR )(δ − fL ) − βi, while that from Party R’s candidate is

ρR (IL , IR )(δ − fR ) − β(1 − i). Letting i∗ (IL , IR ) be the ideology of the voter with information

(IL , IR ) who is just indiﬀerent between the two parties’ candidates, we have that

                                    1 ρL (IL , IR )(δ − fL ) − ρR (IL , IR )(δ − fR )
                  i∗ (IL , IR ) =     +                                               .   (1)
                                    2                       2β

If i is less than i∗ (IL , IR ), the swing voter will vote for Party L’s candidate, while if i exceeds

i∗ (IL , IR ) he will vote for Party R’s. Thus, using standard terminology, i∗ (IL , IR ) is the cut-point

for swing voters with information (IL , IR ).

   The assumption that swing voters’ ideologies are uniformly distributed on [µ − τ, µ + τ ] implies

that when the median swing voter has ideology µ and i∗ (IL , IR ) lies between µ − τ and µ + τ ,


                                                          7
the fraction of swing voters in informational state (IL , IR ) voting for Party L’s candidate is
1       i∗ (IL ,IR )−µ
2   +         2τ       .   Assumption 1(i) implies that i∗ (IL , IR ) lies between µ − τ and µ + τ for all

µ when the two parties’ candidates are expected to implement the same level of favors.

Election probabilities: With this understanding of voting behavior, the probability that each

party’s candidate will win can be computed. Suppose first that the two candidates are qualified

and that they receive contributions CL and CR . Then, when the median swing voter has ideology

µ, the fraction of swing voters voting for Party L’s candidate is

            1 i∗ (1, 1) − µ                  1 i∗ (1, ∅) − µ
           ( +              )λ(CL )λ(CR ) + ( +              )λ(CL )(1 − λ(CR ))
            2       2τ                       2         2τ
              1 i∗ (∅, 1) − µ                        1 i∗ (∅, ∅) − µ
           +( +               )(1 − λ(CL ))λ(CR ) + ( +              )(1 − λ(CL ))(1 − λ(CR )). (2)
              2       2τ                             2        2τ

The first term is those who have seen both candidates’ advertisements; the second those who have

seen only the advertisement of Party L’s candidate; etc.

    Party L’s candidate will win if he gets at least half the swing voters vote. From (2), this

requires that µ is less than µ∗ (CL , CR ) where


          µ∗ (CL , CR ) = i∗ (1, 1)λ(CL )λ(CR ) + i∗ (1, ∅)λ(CL )(1 − λ(CR ))

                                 +i∗ (∅, 1)(1 − λ(CL ))λ(CR ) + i∗ (∅, ∅)(1 − λ(CL ))(1 − λ(CR )). (3)


Since µ is uniformly distributed on [ 12 − ε, 12 + ε], the probability that Party L’s candidate wins is

                                                                         1
                                                  0 if µ∗ (CL , CR ) <   2   −ε

                               π(CL , CR ) = {   µ∗ (CL ,CR )+ε−1/2
                                                          2ε          otherwise .   (4)

                                                                         1
                                                  1 if µ∗ (CL , CR ) >   2   +ε

    If only Party L’s candidate is qualified, he wins with probability π(CL , 0). Similarly, if only

Party R’s candidate is qualified, the probability that Party L’s candidate wins is π(0, CR ). If both

candidates are unqualified, then no contributions are given and Party L’s candidate wins with

probability π(0, 0).

                                                           8
Campaign contributions: We can now turn to the contributions received by qualified candi-

dates. Each qualified candidate, not knowing his opponent’s type, must decide the level of favors

to oﬀer its interest group and how much to ask it for. Each interest group, must decide whether

to accept the request. If it does so, it hands over the contribution and the candidate, if elected,

will implement the agreed level of favors. If it does not, then it makes no contribution. Neither

candidates nor interest groups observe the type of the opposing party’s candidate at the time of

contributing.

   Recalling that CK denotes the contribution a qualified candidate of Party K receives from his

interest group and fK the amount of favors he promises, interest group L’s expected payoﬀ from

accepting Party L’s candidate’s request is

                                                                                                   CL
σ[π(CL , CR )(β + b(fL ) − fL + fR ) + δ − fR ] + (1 − σ)[π(CL , 0)(β + δ + b(fL ) − fL )] − β −      .   (5)
                                                                                                    γ

If the interest group does not accept the request, it would make no contributions and obtain a

payoﬀ:

                 σ[π(0, CR )(β + fR ) + δ − fR ] + (1 − σ)[π(0, 0)(β + δ)] − β.       (6)

Thus, in order for the interest group to accept the request, (5) must exceed (6). Similar remarks

apply to interest group R.

   When Party L’s candidate’s request is accepted, his expected payoﬀ is:


      σ[π(CL , CR )(r + β + fR − fL ) + δ − fR ] + (1 − σ)π(CL , 0)(r + β + δ − fL ) − β. (7)


Party L’s candidate’s request (CL , fL ) maximizes his expected payoﬀ subject to the constraint

that the interest group will agree to it. Thus, (CL , fL ) maximizes (7) subject to the constraint

that (5) exceeds (6). Similarly, for Party R’s candidate.




                                                     9
2.3        Political equilibrium

A political equilibrium consists of (i) candidate requests ((CL , fL ), (CR , fR )); (ii) voter belief func-

tions (ρL (IL , IR ), ρR (IL , IR )) describing swing voters’ beliefs concerning the likelihood that can-

didates are qualified; and (iii) cut-points for the swing voters (i∗ (IL , IR )) describing their voting

behavior as a function of the information they have received in the campaign. Candidate strategies

must be mutual best responses given voter behavior and the constraint of interest group accep-

tance. Voter beliefs must be consistent with candidates’ strategies and voter behavior must be

consistent with their beliefs.

    The analysis will focus on political equilibria that are symmetric in the sense that candidates

make the same request to their interest groups (i.e., (CL , fL ) = (CR , fR ) = (C, f )). In such an

equilibrium, if C > 0, Bayes Rule implies that voters beliefs about unadvertised candidates must

satisfy:
                                                                        σ[1 − λ(C)]
                ρL (∅, ∅) = ρR (∅, ∅) = ρL (∅, 1) = ρR (1, ∅) =                          . (8)
                                                                   σ[1 − λ(C)] + (1 − σ)

Thus, the probability that voters assign to an unadvertised candidate being qualified is indepen-

dent of both his party aﬃliation and the information they have recieved about his opponent. If

C = 0 then Bayes Rule implies that ρL (∅, ∅) and ρR (∅, ∅) must equal σ but has no implications for

ρL (∅, 1) and ρR (1, ∅). This is because the event of observing any candidate’s advertisement does

not arise along the equilibrium path when C = 0. Since it seems unreasonable to suppose anything

else, we focus only on symmetric equilibria that have the property that ρL (∅, 1) and ρR (1, ∅) are

σ when C = 0.8        This assumption implies that (8) holds even when C = 0. Voters’ beliefs may

therefore be summarized by a single variable ρ interpreted simply as the probability that voters

assign to an unadvertised candidate being qualified. This must satisfy (8) in equilibrium.

    Turning to voter behavior, (1) and (8) imply that in a symmetric equilibrium, the cut-point
   8 Henceforth, when we refer to a symmetric political equilibrium we will mean one where the beliefs satisfy this

property. Note also that equilibria in which C = 0 and ρL (∅, 1) and ρR (1, ∅) are not equal to σ are not sequential
equilibria (Kreps and Wilson (1982)).

for symmetrically informed swing voters is just    2   (i.e., i∗ (1, 1) = i∗ (∅, ∅) = 12 ). For asymmetrically

informed voters, the cut points are given by:

                                                       1 (1 − ρ)(δ − f )
                         i∗ (1, ∅) = 1 − i∗ (∅, 1) =     +               . (9)
                                                       2       2β

Voting behavior may therefore be described by the single variable ξ = i∗ (1, 0) − 12 . This variable

measures the size of the interval of swing voters who are induced to vote for a candidate by seeing

him advertise and nothing from his opponent. It therefore measures the eﬀectiveness of campaign

advertising in inducing swing voters to switch from their natural allegiances. In particular, when

ξ is zero, campaign advertising is completely ineﬀective.

   Using this notation, equation (3) may be written

                                              1
                            µ∗ (CL , CR ) =     + ξ(λ(CL ) − λ(CR )). (10)
                                              2

                                                                                     1             1
Since Assumption 1(ii) implies that µ∗ (CL , CR ) must always lie between            2   − ε and   2   + ε, the

probability of winning function is given by:

                                           1  ξ
                           π(CL , CR ) =     + (λ(CL ) − λ(CR )). (11)
                                           2 2ε

This simple and tractable form of the probability of winning function is a consequence of our

assumptions concerning the distribution of swing voters’ ideal points. The expression nicely illus-

trates how ξ determines the productivity of campaign spending. In the sequel, we recognize the

critical role of ξ by writing the probability of winning function as π(CL , CR ; ξ).

   It follows from the above discussion that a symmetric political equilibrium may be completely

described by four variables (C, f, ξ, ρ); C is the contribution given by interest groups to qualified

candidates; f is the level of favors these candidates promise to interest groups to get their contri-

butions; ξ is the eﬀectiveness of advertising; and ρ is the probability voters assign to unadvertised

candidates being qualified.

3      Equilibrium with Unrestricted Contributions

This section discusses the equilibrium that would arise with no restrictions on the amount interest

groups can contribute to candidates. It first provides a general characterization of equilibrium. It

then shows what happens in the limit as candidates become increasingly power-hungry.

    As the first step towards characterizing equilibrium, we study the oﬀers that candidates will

make to their interest groups, taking as given the eﬀectiveness of campaign advertising ξ. Let

U (CL , fL , C, f ; ξ) be the expected utility of Party L’s candidate if he is qualified and oﬀers his

interest group (CL , fL ) when his qualified opponent oﬀers his group (C, f ); that is,


    U = σ[π(CL , C; ξ)(r + β + f − fL ) + δ − f ] + (1 − σ)π(CL , 0; ξ)(r + β + δ − fL ) − β.          (12)


Note that this is decreasing in fL and increasing in CL when advertising is eﬀective.

    Now let G(CL , fL , C, f ; ξ) denote the gain (gross of the contribution) to the leftist interest

group from accepting the oﬀer of Party L’s candidate; that is,

                                                                             1
            G = σ(π(CL , C; ξ) − π(0, C; ξ))(β + f ) + (1 − σ)(π(CL , 0; ξ) − )(β + δ)
                                                                             2

                     +(b(fL ) − fL )(σπ(CL , C; ξ) + (1 − σ)π(CL , 0; ξ)).               (13)


Provided that advertising is eﬀective, this gain is positive even when the interest group is promised

no favors. This reflects the interest group’s pure policy preference for a qualified candidate who

shares its ideology. The gain is increasing in favors as long as b0 exceeds 1 and increasing in the

size of the contribution when advertising is eﬀective.

    Party L’s candidate will optimally demand a contribution from his interest group suﬃcient to

exhaust its gain from contributing. The level of favors will balance the gains of the interest group

to the candidate’s personal policy cost. In equilibrium, (C, f ) must solve the problem:

                                                                                       CL
                     max         U (CL , fL , C, f ; ξ) s.t. G(CL , fL , C, f ; ξ) ≥      .     (14)
                 (CL ,fL )∈<2+                                                          γ


                                                          12
Figure 1 presents a diagrammatic analysis of problem (14). The family of convex curves rep-

resents the candidate’s indiﬀerence map. The candidate dislikes favors and likes contributions,

so that moving in a north-westerly direction increases the candidate’s utility. The convexity

of the indiﬀerence curves follows from the fact that the function U (., ., C, f ; ξ) is quasi-concave.

The concave curve is the set of (CL , fL ) pairs with the property that the interest group’s gain
                                                                          CL
G(CL , fL , C, f ; ξ) exactly equals the per-capita contribution           γ .   The constraint set for problem

(14) is the set of pairs on or below this curve. As drawn, this is a convex set. This will necessarily

be the case when ξ is small and will typically be true more generally.9 In equilibrium, the optimal

choice for the candidate will be (CL , fL ) = (C, f ) as illustrated in Figure 1.

    Turning to the eﬀectiveness of campaign advertising, we know from (9) that, in equilibrium, ξ

is given by:
                                                (1 − ρ)(δ − f )
                                          ξ=                    .     (15)
                                                      2β

Eﬀectiveness depends negatively on the level of favors and voters’ beliefs concerning the likelihood

that an unadvertised candidate is qualified. Using (8) and the functional form for λ, these beliefs

are given by:
                                                     σα
                                           ρ=                 . (16)
                                                 α + C(1 − σ)

Note that ρ is decreasing in C, reflecting the logic that when contributions are plentiful, not having

observed a candidate advertise increases the likelihood that he is unqualified.

    We may conclude that (C, f, ξ, ρ) is an equilibrium if and only if (i) (C, f ) solves problem (14)

given ξ and (ii) ξ and ρ satisfy equations (15) and (16). We can substitute the expression for ρ
   9 The constraint set will be convex if the extra contributions that can be extracted from a given increase in

favors decreases with the level of favors. There are two forces working in this direction. First, the marginal benefit
of favors is decreasing. Second, the marginal impact of contributions on the probability of winning is decreasing
in the level of contributions. Against this, we have that the marginal benefit of contributing is higher at a higher
level of favors. In the earlier version of this paper “Power-hungry Candidates, Policy Favors, and Pareto Improving
Campaign Contribution Limits” (available at http://people.cornell.edu/pages/sc163/cfrs11.pdf) I solve explicitly
for the curve describing the boundary of the constraint set and find the conditions under which it is concave.




                                                         13
from (16) into the expression for ξ in (15) to obtain

                                         (1 − σ)(α + C)(δ − f )
                                    ξ=                          . (17)
                                           2β(α + C(1 − σ))

An equilibrium can then be defined more compactly as a triple (C, f, ξ) such that (i) (C, f )

solves problem (14) given ξ and (ii) ξ satisfies equation (17). The associated equilibrium beliefs

may then be recovered from (16). Intuitively, equilibrium requires first that the oﬀers qualified

candidates make to interest groups must be optimal for them given the eﬀectiveness of campaign

advertising, and second that the eﬀectiveness of advertising must be consistent with the amount

of contributions qualified candidates receive and the favors they promise.

   We impose an assumption that guarantees that equilibrium does involve candidates providing

favors. This is:

Assumption 2: ( γ(β+(1−σ)δ)
                     2      + α)2 <         (1−σ)δαγ
                                               4βε   {(b0 (0)   − 1)r + βb0 (0) + (1 − σ)δb0 (0)}.

Assumption 2 rules out the possibility illustrated in Figure 2, in which contributions are purely

position-induced. Eﬀectively, it guarantees that the candidate’s indiﬀerence curve is flatter than

the contribution curve at zero favors. It will necessarily be satisfied for suﬃciently high r and, for

given r, is more likely to be satisfied the larger the size of the interest groups and the greater is

the marginal value of favors to interest group members.

   We now have:

Proposition 1: Suppose that Assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied. Then, in any equilibrium

(C, f, ξ), candidates oﬀer to implement favors for their interest groups to extract larger contribu-

tions. The contributions they receive allow them to defeat unqualified opponents with a probability
          1
between   2   and 1 (i.e., π(C, 0; ξ) ∈ (1/2, 1)). The level of favors promised is less than the gain from

having a qualified candidate (i.e., f < δ).

Thus, with unrestricted contributions, qualified candidates will oﬀer favors to extract more contri-

butions from their supporters. The campaign advertising these contributions finance gives them

                                                     14
an electoral advantage over their unqualified opponents. Campaign contributions therefore play

the social role of raising the likelihood of qualified leaders. However, the favors qualified candi-

dates implement reduce the benefits to non-interest group members from electing them. Moreover,

any benefit of favors to interest group members is at least partially dissipated through their con-

tributions. Indeed, it may well be the case that interest group members have a lower payoﬀ in

equilibrium than partisans who do not belong to interest groups.10

    The problem with the unrestricted equilibrium is not so much that policy favors are made. This

is just a transfer, allbeit one which may involve some deadweight loss. Rather, the fundamental

problem is that favors make campaign advertising less eﬀective. This reduces the social benefit

of any given level of campaign spending, in the sense that qualified candidates are less likely to

defeat their unqualified opponents. Or, to put it another way, the cost of generating any given

electoral advantage for qualified candidates is raised by the presence of favors.

    This diﬃculty with laissez-faire emerges most clearly when candidates are very power-hungry.

They are then desperate to obtain contributions and willing to promise large amounts of favors.

But the level of favors must be less than the benefits of being qualified if campaign advertising is to

be eﬀective. Equilibrium must therefore involve a low level of advertising eﬀectiveness to dampen

candidates’ propensity to oﬀer favors. Thus, as candidates become more and more power-hungry,

the eﬀectiveness of campaign advertising becomes smaller and smaller. More precisely, we have

that:

Proposition 2: Suppose that Assumption 1 is satisfied and, for all r, let (C(r), f (r), ξ(r)) be the

equilibrium (or an equilibrium) that would arise with unrestricted contributions when ego-rents are

r. Then,
                                                               γ(b(δ) − δ)
                                 lim (C(r), f (r), ξ(r)) = (               , δ, 0).
                                r→∞                                 2
  10 In the proof of Proposition 4, it is shown that interest group members have a lower payoﬀ than partisans who

do not belong to interest groups if f (σ + π(1 − 2σ)) is less than (π − 1/2)(β + (1 − σ)δ) where π is the probability
that a qualified candidate defeats an unqualified one.


                                                         15
    Proposition 2 implies that the equilibrium probability that a qualified candidate defeats an un-

qualified one tends to 1/2 as candidates become more power-hungry (i.e., limr→∞ π(C(r), 0; ξ(r)) =

1/2). However, the level of contributions remain positive, converging to the expected value to in-

terest groups of the favors to be provided. Accordingly, while resources are expended on campaign

advertising, these resources do not make qualified candidates more likely to be elected. This dra-

matically illustrates how the social benefit of campaign spending is undercut by favors.


4     Campaign Finance Policy

We now consider the potential of campaign finance policy to improve citizens’ welfare. We study

policies that impose a limit l on the amount of money an interest group can contribute but provide

matching public financing at rate s. Thus, if a candidate raises an amount C from private sources,

he receives a matching grant of sC from public sources. Public funding is financed by a head tax

T levied on all citizens.

    By analagous reasoning to that in Section 3, an equilibrium under policy (l, s) is a triple

(C, f, ξ) such that (C, f ) solves the problem

                                                                                                        CL
       max            U ((1 + s)CL , fL , (1 + s)C, f ; ξ) s.t. G((1 + s)CL , fL , (1 + s)C, f ; ξ) ≥      , (18)
 (CL ,fL )∈[0,l]×<+                                                                                      γ

and
                                        (1 − σ)(α + C(1 + s))(δ − f )
                                   ξ=                                 . (19)
                                          2β(α + C(1 + s)(1 − σ))

If the equilibrium is (C, f, ξ), the head tax must satisfy T = 2σsC to meet the expected costs of

public financing. A policy (l, s) is a pure contribution limit policy if s = 0 and involves public

financing when s > 0. We first study the potential of pure contribution limits and then consider

the additional benefits that public financing can provide.

4.1     Contribution limits

We begin with the following preliminary observation.

                                                         16
Lemma 1: Suppose that Assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied and let (C ∗ , f ∗ , ξ ∗ ) be an equilibrium

with unrestricted contributions. Then, if (C, f, ξ) is an equilibrium under the policy (l, 0) which

satisfies (i) π(C ∗ , 0; ξ ∗ ) ≈ π(C, 0; ξ) and (ii) f < f ∗ , (C, f, ξ) Pareto dominates (C ∗ , f ∗ , ξ ∗ ).

Thus if introducing a limit does not appreciably change the probability a qualified candidate

defeats an unqualified one and reduces the level of favors, it will create a Pareto improvement.

That these conditions imply that regular citizens are better oﬀ seems natural. That they imply

that interest group members are better oﬀ is less obvious. The key is to note that the equilibrium

payoﬀ of interest group members is decreasing in f . Intuitively, this is because interest group

members pay for their own favors up front with their contributions and must also share the

burden of favors granted to the other interest group.

    Combining Lemma 1 with Proposition 2 enables us to establish:

Proposition 3: Suppose that Assumption 1 is satisfied and, for all r, let (C(r), f (r), ξ(r)) be the

equilibrium (or an equilibrium) that would arise with unrestricted contributions when ego-rents are

r. Then, if candidates are suﬃciently power-hungry (i.e., r is suﬃciently large), (C(r), f (r), ξ(r))

is Pareto dominated by the equilibrium that would emerge if contributions were simply banned (i.e.,

l were set equal to 0).

To understand this result, note that if contributions were banned then no favors would be promised

and the probability that a qualified candidate defeats an unqualified one is just 1/2. The result

now follows from the fact that, with unrestricted contributions, as candidates become more power-

hungry, the probability that a qualified candidate defeats an unqualified one approaches 1/2 while

the level of favors remains strictly positive.

    When candidates are only moderately power-hungry, banning contributions could lead to a sig-

nificant reduction in the probability that qualified candidates win and hence the above argument

does not apply. However, limiting contributions need not necessarily reduce the probability that


                                                        17
qualified candidates win, in which case a similar logic would imply that limits could be Pareto

improving. The idea is that limiting contributions reduces favors and thereby raises the eﬀective-

ness of advertising, so that even though there is less campaign spending, the probability that a

qualified candidate defeats an unqualified one is maintained.

   Unfortunately, it is diﬃcult to find simple suﬃcient conditions under which there exists a Pareto

improving contribution limit (other than that r be large enough).11               The diﬃculty reflects the

fact that not only must limiting contributions increase the eﬀectiveness of campaign advertising

but, in addition, the increase in the eﬀectiveness of advertising must be suﬃcient to oﬀset the

reduction in the total amount of advertising following the limit. Even the former requirement

is a little tricky because (as is clear from (17)) the eﬀectiveness of advertising is determined not

only by the level of favors but also the level of spending. Intuitively, lower levels of spending

reduce advertising eﬀectiveness, because not seeing an advertisement is less likely to mean that a

candidate is unqualified.

   The bottom line is that, while contribution limits can create Pareto improvements, they do

have some drawbacks. By reducing spending, they reduce the fraction of the population who

are exposed to advertising. In addition, they reduce the negative signal from being unadvertised

which works against the increase in advertising eﬀectiveness stemming from reduced favors. The

existence of these drawbacks means that an unambiguous case for limits can only be made when

candidates are very power-hungry.

4.2     Contribution limits and public financing

The drawback of contribution limits as a remedial policy, suggests the desirability of supple-

menting limits with public financing. Public funds could substitute for the reduction in private
  11 A detailed analysis can be found in the earlier version of this paper “Power-hungry Can-

didates, Policy Favors, and Pareto Improving Campaign Contribution Limits” which is available at
http://people.cornell.edu/pages/sc163/cfrs11.pdf. This version also provides two numerical examples of the model
in which Pareto improving contribution limits exist even when candidates are only mildly power hungry (r = 2β).




                                                      18
contributions caused by limits. Since public funds are tax financed, as opposed to favor financed,

this infusion of money has no negative consequences for the eﬀectiveness of campaign spending.

Eﬀectively, clean money replaces tainted private money. This intuition is confirmed in our next

result which establishes the general possibility of Pareto improvements when public financing is

available.

Proposition 4: Suppose that Assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied and let (C ∗ , f ∗ , ξ ∗ ) be an equi-

librium with unrestricted contributions. Then, there exists a campaign finance policy (l, s) and an

equilibrium (C, f, ξ) under (l, s) such that (C, f, ξ) Pareto dominates (C ∗ , f ∗ , ξ ∗ ).

   To prove this result, we consider the class of policies (l, s) satisfying two requirements. First,

interest groups are willing to contribute l to qualified candidates in exchange for no favors. Second,

when they do so, the probability that a qualified candidate defeats an unqualified one is exactly

the same as in the unrestricted equilibrium. Under any such policy, total campaign spending

is lower than in the unrestricted case because the lack of favors makes campaign spending more

eﬀective. This implies that aggregate utility is greater than in the unrestricted equilibrium because

the social benefits of candidate selection are obtained at a lower social cost. However, this does not

necessarily imply Pareto gains, because the way in which this spending is financed has changed.

Under a policy in this class, interest group members are worse oﬀ than partisans who do not

belong to interest groups because they bear a larger share of the costs of campaign advertising.

They both contribute l and pay the head tax necessary to finance public funding. As noted earlier,

in the unrestricted equilibrium, interest group members may be better or worse oﬀ than regular

citizens depending upon the level of favors .

   When interest group members are worse oﬀ in the unrestricted equilibrium than non interest

group members, we can find a policy in our class that makes interest group members at least

as well oﬀ and makes regular citizens strictly better oﬀ. The key is to note that by successively



                                                     19
lowering l and raising s we can make the share of the spending borne by interest group members

become as close as we like to that borne by regular citizens. Thus, since interest group members

bear a greater share of more spending in the unrestricted equilibrium, it is possible to find a

subsidy level s that makes them as well oﬀ as in the status quo. At such a subsidy level, regular

citizens must be better oﬀ because aggregate utility is higher.

      When interest group members are better oﬀ in the unrestricted equilibrium than non-interest

group members, it may not be possible to find a policy in our class that compensates them.

However, it turns out that in this case the level of favors in the unrestricted equilibrium must be

suﬃciently high that all citizens would be better oﬀ if contributions were simply banned.12 The

gains from reduced favors oﬀset the losses associated with a smaller probability that the elected

leader is qualified. Thus, it remains possible to find a Pareto improving policy.

The welfare economics of campaign finance regulation is attracting increasing attention from

political economists. The topic is not only of considerable policy significance but also poses a

number of intellectual challenges.13          First, it is necessary to take a stand on how and why

campaign spending impacts voter behavior and why contributors give to candidates - issues on

which the empirical literature oﬀers no clear guidance. Then, one faces the analytical challenge of

incorporating the behavior of campaign contributors with that of political parties and voters in a

framework tractable enough to permit welfare analysis.

      The standard approach to the problem assumes that there are two types of voters: “informed”

and “uninformed”. Informed voters vote for parties/candidates based on their policy positions,

while uninformed voters can be swayed by campaign advertising. Funds for advertising are pro-
  12 As noted in footnote 10, interest group members have a higher payoﬀ than partisans who do not belong to

interest groups if f (σ + π(1 − 2σ)) exceeds (π − 1/2)(β + (1 − σ)δ) where π is the probability that a qualified
candidate defeats an unqualified one.

vided by interest groups and depend upon the positions taken by the parties or their candidates.

Parties then choose their candidates or positions taking into account their implications for con-

tributions and, ultimately, votes.14      The assumption that campaign advertising influences “un-

informed” voters may suggest that it provides information. However, this is misleading since the

approach assumes that a party’s ability to attract the votes of uninformed voters is independent

of its or its opponent’s policy position.

   The standard approach suggests that contributions lead political parties to distort their plat-

forms away from those that would maximize aggregate utility (see, for example, Grossman and

Helpman (2001)). Parties bias their policy choices to attract money from interest groups and then

use this money to attract the votes of the uninformed. Eﬀectively, parties trade oﬀ the loss of

informed votes resulting from the policy bias with the gains in uninformed votes purchased with

the contributions. Banning contributions would prevent parties distorting their policy choices and

would therefore raise aggregate welfare.

   Of course, this argument rests on the assumption that the “uninformed” voters do not have

rational expectations as has been forcefully argued by Wittman (2002). If they did, then they

would realize that a party who was advertising must have distorted its policy platform to obtain

the resources necessary to fund the advertising and a majority of them would switch their votes

to the unadvertised party. Accordingly, advertising would actually lose parties votes and hence

none would be undertaken in equilibrium! Banning contributions would be redundant.

   More recent work has sought to provide a more satisfying foundation for policy advice by

analyzing the problem under the assumption that voters update their beliefs rationally. Work

of this form falls into two categories. First, there are those analyses that assume, as does this

paper, that campaign advertising is directly informative (Ashworth (2002), Coate (2003), and
  14 See, for example, Baron (1994), Besley and Coate (2002), and Grossman and Helpman (1996), (2001). Baron

and Grossman and Helpman assume that parties just want to win and compete by choosing platforms. Besley and
Coate assume, as does this paper, that parties are policy-motivated and compete by selecting candidates.




                                                    21
Schultz (2001)). The idea is that candidates can use advertising to provide voters with hard

information about their policy positions, ideologies, or qualifications for oﬃce, thus permitting

more informed choices.15 Second, there are those who argue that campaign advertising may best

be understood as providing information indirectly (Potters, Sloof, and Van Winden (1997), Prat

(2002a) and (2002b)). The idea is that candidates have qualities that interest groups can observe

more precisely than voters and the amount of campaign money a candidate collects signals these

qualities to voters.

       The policy conclusions emerging from the analysis of models with directly informative adver-

tising depend critically on whether contributions are position or service induced.16 Coate (2003)

assumes that policy motivated parties compete by selecting candidates whose ideologies lie in a

one dimensional space. Voters know a candidate’s party aﬃliation but are not sure how extreme

or moderate he is.17           Advertising allows candidates to provide voters with information and it

is financed by interest groups who give solely to advance the electoral prospects of like-minded

candidates. The main result is that contribution limits, in addition to reducing campaign spend-

ing, raise the likelihood that parties select extremist candidates. This means that contribution

limits redistribute welfare from moderate voters to interest group members.18                       The former lose
  15 Austen-Smith (1987) introduces directly informative advertising without the assumption of rational expecta-

tions. In his model, voters are assumed to have noisy perceptions of candidates’ policy positions and campaign
advertising sharpens these perceptions. Precisely how campaign advertising works is not explained, but an in-
formational story is suggested. Bailey (2002) develops an argument in support of campaign contributions under
Austen-Smith’s assumption. In Bailey’s model, an incumbent and challenger sequentially choose positions in a
multi-dimensional policy space. Campaign advertising can be selectively targeted to groups with diﬀerent policy
preferences and regular voters are assumed to be less informed about candidates’ policies than special interest
groups. This means that, without contributions, equilibrium policy choices will be biased away from average voters
to those groups who are more informed because the latter are more responsive to policy promises. Bailey argues that
contributions can discipline such behavior. A candidate whose opponent is biasing policy towards more informed
voting blocs can use contributions to inform the uninformed of such behavior.
  16 There is considerable debate about this question in the United States. See Groseclose, Milyo, and Primo

(2000) for an interesting discussion.
  17    In contrast to this paper, this uncertainty arises endogenously from randomization in parties’ selection strate-
gies.
  18 A similar conclusion would emerge from the model of this paper under the assumption that candidates cannot

provide policy favors for their contributors. A contribution limit would reduce the probability that qualified
candidates are elected, making all regular citizens worse oﬀ. The only possible beneficiaries would be interest group
members who spend less of their resources on campaign contributions.



                                                            22
out because elected leaders are less likely to be moderate. The latter gain because they spend less

of their resources on campaign spending.

    Policy conclusions more consonant with those of this paper emerge from the independent work

of Ashworth (2002). He assumes that voters face (exogenous) uncertainty concerning candidates’

ideologies and that advertising allows candidates to provide information to voters. Advertising is

financed by interest groups who have no interest in the ideology of the winning candidate, but

do care about favors. As in this paper, candidates oﬀer favors to extract contributions from their

interest groups. In contrast to this paper, advertising expenditures are a discrete choice and (in

the language of this paper) candidates are infinitely power-hungry.19 Ashworth shows that voters

would be strictly better oﬀ under a public financing system that funds the same set of candidates

as in the laissez-faire.20    This is because, as in this paper, favors undermine the productivity of

campaign spending and so the same selection benefits can be obtained at a lower cost through

taxation.21

    When advertising is indirectly informative, banning contributions may improve aggregate voter

welfare as argued by Prat (2002a) and (2002b). Prat (2002a) considers a world in which two

oﬃce-seeking candidates, who may diﬀer in competence, compete by staking out positions in a

one dimensional policy space. A single interest group with non-median policy preferences oﬀers

contributions to candidates in exchange for them moving their platforms towards its preferred

policy position. Candidates the interest group believes to be more competent are oﬀered larger
   19 Ashworth assumes that there is a single decisive voter and that there is a fixed cost of reaching him. In

equilibrium, the level of favors provided by a candidate to his interest group equals this cost divided by the
probability the candidate wins. The fixed cost assumption means that advertising is still eﬀective in equilibrium
despite candidates being infinitely power hungry. Once a candidate has raised enough to cover the fixed cost, there
is no gain from promising additional favors.
  20 While Ashworth is not specific about the mechanism that would deliver this result, it seems likely that a

public matching grant would work. However, because interest groups have no ideological preferences, it would not
be possible to totally eliminate favors using this policy.
  21 While Ashworth’s analysis identifies the same basic ineﬃciency as does this paper, there are numerous diﬀer-

ences in the modelling approaches. More substantively, while this paper focuses on the welfare economic analysis
of alternative campaign finance policies, Ashworth focuses more on the implications of candidate asymmetries for
equilibrium advertising expenditures. In particular, he shows that when one candidate (say, the incumbent) has a
significantly better reputation than the other, neither candidate will have an incentive to advertise.


                                                        23
contributions because they are more likely to win. This is because voters observe a noisy signal of

competence and hence, ceteris paribus, are more likely to vote for the more competent candidate.

In equilibrium, therefore, the more a candidate advertises, the higher is his competence. Campaign

contributions are good for voters in the sense that they provide information about competence,

but bad in that they lead candidates to distort policy away from the median voter’s ideal. Banning

contributions can raise voters’ aggregate welfare when the losses in terms of information about

competence are smaller than the costs of policy distortion.22 This is diﬀerent from our argument

which stresses that there need be no such trade oﬀ - banning contributions need not significantly

impact the probability that competent candidates are elected.

       Prat (2002b) considers a multi-dimensional policy space and multiple interest groups, but

assumes these groups only contribute to the incumbent. Incumbent politicians again diﬀer in

competence and choose policy positions to maximize their likelihood of winning. With some

probability, voters will be perfectly informed of the incumbent’s competence and policy position;

otherwise they only observe the incumbent’s campaign spending.23                     This makes a competent

incumbent more willing to trade policy for contributions and induces a separating equilibrium

wherein only competent incumbents receive campaign contributions. From the viewpoint of this

paper, the interesting thing is that when voters only observe the incumbent’s campaign spending

they must infer the degree to which the incumbent has biased policy in order to get his contribu-

tions. The magnitude of this policy bias then determines the eﬀectiveness of campaign spending.

When the probability that voters are uninformed is large, the magnitude of the bias is almost

suﬃcient to dissipate the benefits of competence and campaign spending is close to ineﬀective.

In these circumstances, banning contributions improves median voter welfare because it has little
  22 While Prat does not consider the distributional consequences of banning contributions, it seems likely that

in his model banning is either Pareto ineﬃcient or redistributes from citizens on the side of the interest group to
those on the other side of the political spectrum.
  23   This diﬀers from Prat (2002a) who assumes that voters always observe candidates’ policy positions.




                                                        24
impact on the probability that competent candidates are elected, while removing policy bias. This

result has a very similar flavor to our Proposition 2.

    While banning contributions might be desirable under the signalling view of campaign spend-

ing, its general implications for campaign finance policy are very diﬀerent from those of this paper.

In a signalling model, oﬀering candidates public financing would be a bad idea because it would

just induce a pooling equilibrium and eliminate the sorting benefits of campaign spending. Limits

would also seem likely to induce a pooling equilibrium and hence would be undesirable. Thus, it

appears diﬃcult to rationalize common arguments for campaign finance reform with the signalling

view of campaign spending.

    The general lesson emerging from the literature (this paper included) is that the desirability

of campaign finance regulation very much depends on what one assumes about the rationality of

voters, the motives of interest groups, the objectives of candidates, the function of advertising, etc.

While this is somewhat unsatisfying, the literature will hopefully yield a clearer understanding

of exactly what the critical assumptions are as it matures. This will help sharpen the focus of

the debate by identifying the key empirical questions that must be resolved before the nature

of optimal regulation can be discerned. The literature may also suggest implications of diﬀerent

assumptions that can be taken to the data. One implication of the assumptions of service-induced

contributions and rational voters suggested by this paper is that contribution limits might raise

the eﬀectiveness of campaign advertising.24 This idea has been investigated by Stratmann (2002)

who exploits variation in campaign finance laws across the U.S. states, to test whether campaign

expenditures are more productive in states that limit contributions. Interestingly, he finds that

the answer is yes.
  24 A significant strand of the empirical campiagn finance literature is devoted to assessing the eﬀectiveness of

campaign advertising in delivering votes (see, for example, Abramowitz (1988), Green and Krasno (1988), Jacobson
(1980), (1985), Levitt (1994), and Palfrey and Erikson (2000)). The theoretical literature to which this paper
contributes provides insights into the determinants of this eﬀectiveness.

6     Conclusion

When candidates use campaign contributions to finance advertising that conveys truthful informa-

tion to voters about their qualifications for oﬃce, contributions have the potential social benefit

of helping elect more qualified leaders. But for contributions to have this benefit, voters who are

informed that a candidate is qualified through campaign advertising must be induced to switch

their votes from unadvertised candidates. The larger the fraction of informed voters who switch

their votes, the greater the productivity of any given level of campaign spending. However, when

contributions are unrestricted and candidates are power-hungry, voters will rationally be cynical

about qualified candidates, anticipating that they will implement favors for their contributors

when elected. This cynicism will reduce the likelihood of voters switching their votes, undermin-

ing the productivity of campaign spending. In the limit, when candidates are very power-hungry,

campaign spending will be completely unproductive generating no electoral advantage for qualified

candidates.

    This ineﬃciency gives campaign finance policy the potential to improve citizens’ welfare. When

candidates are very power-hungry, simply banning contributions will generate a Pareto improve-

ment. Banning will not significantly reduce the likelihood that leaders are qualified, but will

eliminate favors. This benefits even interest groups because their expected gains from favors are

dissipated by the contributions they make to get them. When candidates are less power-hungry,

banning contributions may be undesirable because campaign spending will be productive. How-

ever, limiting contributions can be Pareto improving. Limits can reduce the level of favors qualified

candidates provide, without reducing the probability that qualified candidates are elected. The

latter is possible because the reduction in favors created by limits can generate an increase in

the productivity of spending which compensates for the reduction in the level of spending. Even

when limiting contributions fails, a campaign finance policy that combines limits and publicly



                                                 26
financed matching grants can always create a Pareto improvement. Limits reduce favors and raise

the productivity of campaign spending, while public financing oﬀsets the reduction in private

contributions caused by limits.

   While the underlying logic seems quite general, the argument has been formally developed in

an undeniably simple model. It would be well worth investigating its robustness to alternative

or more general specifications. One obvious assumption to change is that the candidates present

interest groups with “take it or leave it” oﬀers that allow them to extract all their surplus. One

could alternatively follow Grossman and Helpman (1994) in assuming the opposite; i.e., that

interest groups make “take it or leave it” oﬀers. It seems likely that the conclusion that even

interest group members can benefit from campaign finance policy might need modification. That

said, even when interest group members obtain some surplus from the favors they are given, they

must still bear their share of the collective cost of granting other groups favors.

   It would also be interesting to allow for a richer set of candidate types. For example, one could

introduce multiple levels of qualifications. Presumably, equilibrium would involve only candidates

with qualifications above some critical level advertising. This critical level would depend on the

cost of advertising. For a result like Proposition 2 to hold, it would have to be the case that, in

equilibrium, more qualified candidates promised more favors. Alternatively, one could assume that

candidates diﬀered in their willingness to take favors - some were less power-hungry than others.

Under the latter assumption, the number of times a voter had seen a candidate’s advertisement

might have some significance. There might be a penalty for advertising too heavily, because voters

would take it as a signal of a candidate being more power-hungry and hence having promised

more favors. This might limit the incentive of power-hungry candidates to oﬀer favors even when

contributions are unrestricted.25       This extension becomes all the more interesting if parties can
  25 The idea is that a qualified candidate’s spending would generate a probability distribution over the number

of messages voters had received. A certain fraction would have seen no messages, some fraction just one, etc.
More spending would shift the probability distribution to the right. If less power-hungry spending candidates are

run.




expected to raise less money, voters who observed a higher number of messages would believe that a candidate
was more likely to be power-hungry. This may dampen the eﬀectiveness of large scale advertising campaigns and
thereby reduce the incentives of power-hungry candidates to raise money.

The proofs will make use of the following Fact, whose (mechanical) proof is omitted. Define the

function:
                                                 −∂U/∂fL              ∂G/∂fL
                      Ψ(CL , fL , C, f ; ξ) =            −        1            .       (A.1)

This is simply the diﬀerence between the candidate’s and interest group’s marginal rate of substi-

tution between contributions and favors. Then we have:

Fact: Suppose that f ≤ δ and that G(C, f, C, f ; ξ) ≤ Cγ . Then, Ψ(C, f, C, f ; ξ) ≥ 0 if and only if

Proof of Proposition 1: Let (C, f, ξ) be an equilibrium. By definition, we know that (C, f )

must solve the problem

                                                                                            CL

and that (C, f, ξ) satisfies (17). To prove the proposition, we need to establish that f lies in the

interval (0, δ). It will then follow that C > 0 and that π(C, 0; ξ) ∈ (1/2, 1).

    Observe first that it must be the case that ξ > 0. If not, then ξ = 0 which implies that
                                                        (1−σ)δ
(C, f ) = (0, 0) and hence, from (17), that 0 =           2β     - a contradiction. It follows that

                                       G(C, f, C, f, ξ) = C/γ.          (A.2)

If not, then the candidate could ask for a slightly larger contribution and make himself better oﬀ.

    Since ξ > 0, we know from (17) that f < δ. Thus, it remains to show that f > 0. Since

U (·, C, f ; ξ) and G(·, C, f ; ξ) are diﬀerentiable at (C, f ), there exists η ≥ 0 such that

Suppose that f were to equal 0. Then, equation (A.4) implies that η ≤                 ∂G/∂fL    and (A.3) implies

or, equivalently given (A.1), Ψ(C, 0, C, 0; ξ) ≥ 0.

   By the Fact, this means that

We know from (A.2) that

                         C
                                = G(C, 0, C, 0; ξ)

so that C < γ2 (β + (1 − σ)δ). In addition, since f = 0, it follows from (17) that ξ ≥                2β .   Thus,

it must be the case that
                                      s
             γ                            (1 − σ)δαγ 0

This is inconsistent with Assumption 2, and hence f must be greater than 0.

   Note here for future reference that (C, f, ξ) must satisfy the equation


                                           Ψ(C, f, C, f ; ξ) = 0.        (A.5)

To see this, note that since f > 0, equation (A.4) implies that η =                     ∂G/∂fL .    Moreover, it

follows from (A.2) that f > 0 implies that C > 0. This means that equation (A.3) implies that

η=   1    ∂G .   Thus

which implies (A.5).         It follows that (C, f, ξ) satisfies (A.2), (A.5) and (17). This provides

three equations in the three unknowns and enables the computation of equilibrium by numer-

ical methods.26 QED

Proof of Proposition 2: We prove the result via a sequence of three claims.

    Claim 1: Let (C, f, ξ) be an equilibrium, then C < C where

                                            γ                          σ
                                      C=      (β + δ) + γ(b(δ) − δ)(1 − )
                                            2                          2

    Proof: As shown in the proof of Proposition 1 it must be the case that ξ > 0 and that (C, f, ξ)

satisfies equation (A.2). Since ξ > 0, we know that f < δ. It follows that b(f ) − f < b(δ) − δ,

because (by assumption) b0 (δ) > 1 and b is concave. Using this and (A.2), we have that

                                 C
                                      = G(C, f, C, f ; ξ)
                                 γ
                                                      1
                                      = (π(C, 0; ξ) − )(β + σf + (1 − σ)δ)
                                                      2
                                                      σ
                                        +(b(f ) − f )( + (1 − σ)π(C, 0; ξ))
                                                      2
                                        1                         σ
                                      ≤   (β + δ) + (b(δ) − δ)(1 − ).
                                        2                         2

Multiplying through by γ yields the result.

    Claim 2: limr→∞ ξ(r) = 0.

    Proof: We need to show that for all τ > 0, there exists rτ such that if r ≥ rτ it is the case

that ξ(r) ≤ τ . Let τ be given. Let rτ be any value of r satisfying both Assumption 2 and the

inequality
   26 If (C, f, ξ) satisfies these three equations then it will be an equilibrium provided that equations (A.2) and (A.5)

are suﬃcient to imply that (C, f ) solves problem (14). Provided that the constraint set in Figure 1 is convex, they
will be suﬃcient. As noted above, the constraint set will necessarily be convex when ξ is small and will typically
be convex more generally. Thus, if (C, f, ξ) satisfies the three equations it will typically be an equilibrium. The
issue of the existence of equilibrium therefore boils down to the existence of a triple (C, f, ξ) satisfying the three
equations. Suﬃcient conditions for the existence of such a solution are developed in the earlier version of the
paper “Power-hungry Candidates, Policy Favors, and Pareto Improving Campaign Contribution Limits” which is
available at http://people.cornell.edu/pages/sc163/cfrs11.pdf.

                                 C<           {(b (δ) − 1)rτ + βb0 (δ)} − α.
                                           2ε

Clearly, such an rτ exists. Now let r ≥ rτ . As shown in the proof of Proposition 1, we know that


                                    Ψ(C(r), f (r), C(r), f (r); ξ(r)) = 0,


which, by the Fact, implies that
              r
                  ξ(r)αγ 0
     C(r) ≥             {(b (f (r)) − 1)r + βb0 (f (r)) + b(f (r)) + (1 − σ)(δ − f (r))b0 (f (r))} − α.
                    2ε

Suppose that ξ(r) > τ . Then because b00 < 0,


                r
                ξ(r)αγ 0
   C(r) ≥               {(b (f (r)) − 1)r + βb0 (f (r)) + b(f (r)) + (1 − σ)(δ − f (r))b0 (f (r))} − α
                   2ε
              r
                τ αγ 0
            >        {(b (δ) − 1)r + βb0 (δ)} − α > C.
                 2ε

By Claim 1, this is a contradiction and hence it must be the case that ξ(r) ≤ τ .

    Claim 3: There exists ξb > 0 such that for all ξ ∈ (0, ξ)
                                                           b the pair of equations (17) and (A.2)

have a unique solution (C ∗ (ξ), f ∗ (ξ)) in the domain <+ ×[0, δ]. Moreover, the functions C ∗ (·) and

                              b and
f ∗ (·) are continuous on (0, ξ)

                                                                γ(b(δ) − δ)
                                   lim (C ∗ (ξ), f ∗ (ξ)) = (               , δ)
                                   ξ&0                               2

    Proof: This claim may be established graphically by computing the loci of (C, f ) combinations

satisfying equations (17) and (A.2) for given ξ. Consider first equation (17). Let Co (f ; ξ) be

the level of contributions that qualified candidates must receive to generate an eﬀectiveness of

advertising ξ when qualified candidates provide an amount of favors f . When it is defined, Co

satisfies
                                              (1 − σ)(α + Co )(δ − f )
                                         ξ=                            .
                                                2β(α + Co (1 − σ))

                                                       34
Solving this for Co , we obtain

                                                 α[2βξ − (1 − σ)(δ − f )]
                                  Co (f ; ξ) =
                                                  (1 − σ)[δ − f − 2βξ]

                                                                                   2βξ
Thus, for given ξ, Co (f ; ξ) is well-defined for f values between max{0, δ −      1−σ },   and δ − 2βξ. On

this interval, Co (·; ξ) is increasing at an increasing rate, approaching infinity as the level of favors

approaches the upper limit of the interval.

   Now consider equation (A.2). Let Ci (f ; ξ) be the level of contributions that would make

interest groups indiﬀerent between accepting candidates’ oﬀers when the level of favors promised

is f and the eﬀectiveness of advertising is ξ. Formally, Ci is implicitly defined by the equality:

                                                                   Ci
                                         G(Ci , f, Ci , f ; ξ) =      .
                                                                   γ

Note that there may be two non-negative solutions to this equation when f = 0. One solution is

always C = 0, since the gain from giving no contributions in exchange for no favors is obviously

zero. But there will be a positive solution if ∂G(0, 0, 0, 0; ξ)/∂C > 1/γ. We will let Ci (0; ξ) be the

positive solution when it exists.

   It is possible to explicitly solve for Ci (f ; ξ). We have that
                                                         p
                                             a(f, ξ) +    a(f, ξ)2 + 16e(f, ξ)
                              Ci (f ; ξ) =                                     ,
                                                             8

where:
                            ξ                          ξ
               a(f, ξ) = 2γ{ (β + σf + (1 − σ)δ) + (1 + (1 − σ))(b(f ) − f )} − 4α,
                            ε                          ε

and

                                        e(f, ξ) = 2γα(b(f ) − f ).

Note that Ci is increasing in f and bounded above on [0, δ]. Since

                                                         γ(b(f ) − f )
                                         Ci (f ; 0) =                  ,
                                                              2

it follows that Ci (·; ξ) is strictly concave on [0, δ] for suﬃciently small ξ.

                                                         35
    Given ξ, (C, f ) ∈ <+ × [0, δ] is a solution of the pair of equations (17) and (A.2) if and only
                       2βξ
if f ∈ [max{0, δ −     1−σ }, δ   − 2βξ), C = Co (f, 0) and Ci (f, ξ) = Co (f, ξ). We know that Co (f, ξ)

must become larger than Ci (f, ξ) as f approaches δ − 2βξ. Thus, by continuity, there exists a
                                                                  2βξ
solution if Co (f, ξ) is smaller than Ci (f, ξ) at f = max{0, δ − 1−σ }. Moreover, if Ci (·, ξ) is strictly

concave, then this solution must be unique.
                                                                                         2βξ
    For ξ suﬃciently small, Co (f, ξ) is indeed smaller than Ci (f, ξ) at f = max{0, δ − 1−σ }. To see
                                                                2βξ         2βξ             2βξ
this, note that for ξ suﬃciently small, we have that max{0, δ − 1−σ } = δ − 1−σ and Ci (δ − 1−σ ; ξ)
                              2βξ
is positive, while Co (δ −    1−σ ; ξ)    = 0. Moreover, as noted above, for ξ suﬃciently small, Ci (·; ξ)

is strictly concave on [0, δ]. It follows that for suﬃciently small ξ the pair of equations (17) and

(A.2) have a unique solution (C ∗ (ξ), f ∗ (ξ)) in the domain <+ ×[0, δ]. The situation is illustrated

in Figure 3. That these solutions are continuous in ξ follows from the Implicit Function Theorem.
                                    2βξ
Further, we know that δ −           1−σ   < f ∗ (ξ) < δ − 2βξ, so that limξ&0 f ∗ (ξ) = δ. Finally, since

    As established in the proof of Proposition 1, we know that (C(r), f (r), ξ(r)) satisfies (17) and

(A.2). It follows from Claims 2 and 3 that limr→∞ C(r) = limξ&0 C ∗ (ξ) and limr→∞ f (r) =

limξ&0 f ∗ (ξ). From the proof of Claim 3 we know that

Proof of Lemma 1: We begin by calculating the payoﬀs of the various types of citizens in the

unrestricted equilibrium. Given symmetry, we can divide the population into just three types:

partisans (i.e., leftists and rightists), interest group members, and swing-voters. We deal with

each in turn.

   Consider a representative partisan. Given symmetry, the elected candidate is equally likely to

be from either party. The expected payoﬀ of the partisan is therefore δ − f ∗ − β/2 if the elected

candidate is qualified and −β/2 if not. Recall that both parties select a qualified candidate with

probability σ 2 while only one party selects a qualified candidate with probability 2σ(1 − σ). In

the latter case, the qualified candidate wins with probability π∗ = π(C ∗ , 0; ξ ∗ ) and hence the

probability that a qualified candidate is elected is σ 2 + 2σ(1 − σ)π ∗ . The expected payoﬀ of the

partisan is therefore
                                                                  β
                               [σ 2 + 2σ(1 − σ)π∗ ](δ − f ∗ ) −     .   (A.6)
                                                                  2

   Interest group members provide campaign contributions to qualified candidates and also get

policy favors enacted when their candidate wins. The expected payoﬀ of a representative interest

group member is therefore

                                                         b(f ∗ )   β  σC ∗
                        [σ 2 + 2σ(1 − σ)π∗ ](δ − f ∗ +           )− −      . (A.7)
                                                           2       2   γ

The fact that b(f ∗ ) is divided by two reflects the fact that the interest group only gets its favors

implemented if the qualified candidate it is backing is elected.

   For swing voters, matters are more complicated because of the uncertainty concerning their

ideologies. We treat swing voters as ex ante identical so that, for a given draw of µ, each is equally

likely to have any ideology on [µ − τ, µ + τ ]. Under this assumption, the payoﬀ of each swing

voter is just the payoﬀ of the average swing voter. When computing this payoﬀ, account must

be taken of the correlation between which party’s candidate wins and the location of the average

swing voter.


                                                    37
      Suppose first that both parties select unqualified candidates. Party L’s candidate will win if

the ideology of the median swing voter is less than µ∗ (0, 0) = 1/2. Thus, if µ is less than 1/2

then the average swing voter’s payoﬀ is −βµ. If µ exceeds 1/2 then Party R’s candidate wins and

the average swing voter’s payoﬀ is −β(1 − µ). Taking expectations over the realization of µ, the

average swing voter’s expected payoﬀ is

                                      Z    1                  Z       1

                                                                  2
                                                                                        2ε        2

The key point is that states in which the average swing-voter is left-leaning are states in which

Party L’s candidate will win.

      Suppose now that both parties select qualified candidates. Party L’s candidate will win if

the ideology of the median swing voter is less than µ∗ (C ∗ , C ∗ ) = 1/2. If µ is less than 1/2 then

the majority of swing voters vote for Party L’s candidate and the average swing voter’s payoﬀ is

δ − f ∗ − βµ. If µ exceeds 1/2 then Party R’s candidate wins and the average swing voter’s payoﬀ

is δ − f ∗ − β(1 − µ) The average swing voter’s expected payoﬀ is therefore

                                      Z   1                   Z       1

                       δ−f −      βµ    −                                    β(1 − µ)      = δ − f ∗ − β(     ).

                                     2ε                           1
                                                                  2

      Next consider the case in which just one party’s candidate is qualified. For concreteness,

assume that it is Party L’s candidate. Party L’s candidate will win if the ideology of the median

swing voter is less than µ∗ (C ∗ , 0) = 1/2 + ξ ∗ λ(C ∗ ). If µ is less than 1/2 + ξ ∗ λ(C ∗ ) then the

majority of swing voters vote for Party L’s candidate and the average swing voter’s payoﬀ is

δ − f ∗ − βµ. If µ exceeds 1/2 + ξ ∗ λ(C ∗ ) then Party R’s candidate wins and the average swing

voter’s payoﬀ is −β(1 − µ). Taking expectations over the realization of µ and using the fact that

ξ ∗ λ(C ∗ ) = ε(2π ∗ − 1) the average swing voter’s expected payoﬀ is

   Aggregating over these three situations, the expected payoﬀ of a swing voter is

                                         1     σ 2 + (1 − σ)2
      [σ 2 + 2σ(1 − σ)π∗ ](δ − f ∗ ) − β( − ε{                + 2σ(1 − σ)2π ∗ (1 − π∗ )}). (A.8)
                                         2            2

   By similar reasoning, the payoﬀs of partisans, interest group members, and swing voters in the

equilibrium (C, f, ξ) under policy (l, 0) are

                                                               β

                                      2            2

That partisans and swing voters will be strictly better oﬀ if π ∗ ≈ π and f ∗ > f follows directly

from comparing (A.6) and (A.9) and (A.8) and (A.11). Thus, we need only deal with interest

group members.

   We know that (A.2) holds at the unrestricted equilibrium. We can use this to express the

expected payoﬀ of an interest group member in the unrestricted equilibrium as:

                          σ(1 − σ)                             β
                δ[σ 2 +            + (1 − σ)σπ ∗ ] − f ∗ σπ ∗ − [1 − σ + 2σπ ∗ ]. (A.12)
                             2                                 2

Under the policy (l, 0), it is clear from (18) that


                                         G(C, f, C, f ; ξ) ≥ C/γ


and hence the expected payoﬀ of an interest group member is at least

                            σ(1 − σ)                      β
                  δ[σ 2 +            + (1 − σ)σπ] − f σπ − [1 − σ + 2σπ]. (A.13)
                                2                         2

Since π ' π∗ and f < f ∗ , it is clear that (A.13) exceeds (A.12) and hence interest group members

will also be better oﬀ. QED

Proof of Proposition 3: From Proposition 2 we know that limr→∞ π(C(r), 0; ξ(r)) = 1/2 and

that limr→∞ f (r) = δ > 0. If contributions were banned, the equilibrium would be (C, f, ξ) =

(0, 0, (1−σ)δ
         2β ) and the probability that a qualified candidate defeats an unqualified one is 1/2. The

result then follows from Lemma 1. QED

Proof of Proposition 4: As shown in the proof of Proposition 3, the payoﬀs of the three types

of citizens in the unrestricted equilibrium (C ∗ , f ∗ , ξ ∗ ) are given by (A.6), (A.7), and (A.8). We

need to demonstrate the existence of a policy (l, s) and an equilibrium under (l, s) which yields

all types of citizens higher payoﬀs.

    Let Ω denote the class of policies (l, s) satisfying the following two properties. First, (l, s)

is such that if interest groups contribute l to qualified candidates in exchange for no favors, the

probability that a qualified candidate defeats an unqualified one is the same as in the status quo;

i.e.,
                                              (1 − σ)(α + l(1 + s))δ
                            π(l(1 + s), 0;                           ) = π∗.
                                             2β(α + (1 − σ)l(1 + s))

This requires that
                                             αC ∗ (δ − f ∗ )
                             l(1 + s) =                          .    (A.14)
                                          (δα + (1 − σ)C ∗ f ∗ )

Second, (l, s) is such that interest groups are willing to contribute l without the promise of favors
                                                                         (1−σ)(α+l(1+s))δ
(assuming that the eﬀectiveness of advertising is given by ξ 0 =        2β(α+(1−σ)l(1+s)) ).   This requires

that

                                          G(l, 0, l, 0; ξ 0 ) ≥ l/γ

or, equivalently, that

                              l ≤ γ(π∗ − )(β + (1 − σ)δ).             (A.15)

    By construction, for any policy (l, s) ∈ Ω, (C, f, ξ) = (l, 0, 2β(α+(1−σ)l(1+s)) ) is an equilibrium

under (l, s). In this equilibrium, the probability that a qualified candidate defeats an unqualified

    Three general points should be noted. First, partisans are better oﬀ in this equilibrium than in

the unrestricted equilibrium if and only if swing voters are better oﬀ. Second, while interest group

members always bear a higher share of the costs of campaign spending than do regular citizens,

the shares become more equal as l decreases and s increases. Third, aggregate expected utility is

higher in this equilibrium than in the unrestricted case.

    To see the third point, note from (A.6), (A.7), and (A.8), that if the fraction of swing voters

in the population is η, aggregate utility in the unrestricted equilibrium is

                                                         2                             2      γ
                              σ 2 + (1 − σ)2

                                     2

From (A.16), (A.17), and (A.18) in the equilibrium under the policy (l, s), aggregate utility is

                                     β                     σ 2 + (1 − σ)2
   W = [σ 2 + 2σ(1 − σ)π ∗ ]δ −        − 2σl(1 + s) + ηβε{                + 2σ(1 − σ)2π ∗ (1 − π∗ )}.
                                     2                            2

Subtracting the former from the latter, yields


                  W − W ∗ = −2σl(1 + s) + 2σC ∗ + [σ2 + 2σ(1 − σ)π∗ ](f ∗ − γb(f ∗ )).


This is positive, since from (A.14), it is clear that l(1 + s) < C ∗ and, from the properties of b,

f ∗ > γb(f ∗ ).

                                                         41
   To progress further, we must distinguish two cases depending upon the relative shares of the

costs of campaign spending borne by interest group members and regular citizens in the unre-

stricted equilibrium. In the unrestricted equilibrium, the aggregate costs of campaign spending

2σC ∗ are borne in the following way. Citizens who are not interest group members bear a cost


                                         [σ 2 + 2σ(1 − σ)π ∗ ]f ∗ ,


which is just the expected cost of the favors provided by qualified candidates. Interest group

members bear a cost
                                                             b(f ∗ )    σC ∗
                               [σ 2 + 2σ(1 − σ)π ∗ ](f ∗ −           )+      .
                                                               2         γ

Using (A.2), the latter can be rewritten as

                                                1
             [σ 2 + 2σ(1 − σ)π ∗ ]f ∗ + σ{(π ∗ − )(β + (1 − σ)δ) − f ∗ (σ + π ∗ (1 − 2σ))}.
                                                2

Thus, whether interest group members bear a higher share of the costs of spending in the unre-

stricted equilibrium depends upon the level of favors.

   Suppose first that interest group members bear a greater share of the costs of campaign spend-

ing in the unrestricted equilibrium; i.e., that


                     f ∗ (σ + π ∗ (1 − 2σ)) < (π∗ − 1/2)(β + (1 − σ)δ).            (A.19)


It is then possible to find policies in Ω which make interest group members better oﬀ than in the

unrestricted equilibrium. From (A.12) and (A.17), this requires that:

                        l              1
                          + 2sl ≤ (π∗ − )(β + (1 − σ)δ) + f ∗ π ∗ .              (A.20)
                        γ              2

In general, when (A.19) holds, there are many policies in Ω that satisfies this requirement. The

precise choice of (l, s) necessary to generate a Pareto improvement depends upon the features of

the status quo equilibrium (C ∗ , f ∗ , ξ ∗ ). We distinguish three diﬀerent cases.

Case 1: This case arises when the status quo equilibrium (C ∗ , f ∗ , ξ ∗ ) is such that

                                                    42
                          αC ∗ (δ − f ∗ )            1
                                        ∗ ∗
                                            ≤ γ(π ∗ − )(β + (1 − σ)δ).            (A.21)
                       (δα + (1 − σ)C f )            2

Then, we simply set
                                                     αC ∗ (δ − f ∗ )
                                     (l, s) = (                          , 0).
                                                  (δα + (1 − σ)C ∗ f ∗ )

Clearly, (l, s) is an element of Ω and (A.20) is satisfied. Moreover, since s = 0 and they pay no
                                                                                    (1−σ)(α+l)δ
taxes, regular citizens must be better oﬀ under the equilibrium (C, f, ξ) = (l, 0, 2β(α+(1−σ)l) ) than

in the unrestricted equilibrium.

Case 2: This case arises when the status quo equilibrium (C ∗ , f ∗ , ξ ∗ ) is such that

          1                    αC ∗ (δ − f ∗ )             1                   f ∗π∗
   γ(π ∗ − )(β + (1 − σ)δ) <                     ≤ γ(π ∗
                                                         −   )(β + (1 − σ)δ) +               (A.22)
          2                  δα + (1 − σ)C ∗ f ∗           2                     2

Then, we set
                                                  1
                                        l = γ(π∗ − )(β + (1 − σ)δ)
                                                  2

and
                                                   αC ∗ (δ − f ∗ )
                          s=            1                                         − 1.
                               γ(π∗ −   2 )(β   + (1 − σ)δ)(δα + (1 − σ)C ∗ f ∗ )

These two values solve the pair of equations (A.14) and (A.15) with equality. That (A.20) is

satisfied follows from (A.22).
                                                                                              (1−σ)(α+l(1+s))δ
   To prove that regular citizens must be better oﬀ under the equilibrium (C, f, ξ) = (l, 0, 2β(α+(1−σ)l(1+s)) )

than in the unrestricted equilibrium, we need to show that:

                                              σ
                                          [     + (1 − σ)π ∗ ]f ∗ > sl.
                                              2

Substituting in the expression for sl, this becomes

                   σ                           1                     αC ∗ (δ − f ∗ )
               [     + (1 − σ)π ∗ ]f ∗ + γ(π∗ − )(β + (1 − σ)δ) >                        .
                   2                           2                  (δα + (1 − σ)C ∗ f ∗ )




                                                         43
From (A.2), we know that

                      1                           σ
         C ∗ = γ(π ∗ − )(β + (1 − σ)δ) + γb(f ∗ )( + (1 − σ)π∗ ) − γf ∗ (σ + (1 − 2σ)π ∗ ).
                      2                           2

Thus, by (A.19) and the fact that γb(f ∗ ) ≤ f ∗ , we have that

                                                    σ
                                        C∗ < f ∗(     + (1 − σ)π∗ ).
                                                    2

This implies the result.

Case 3: This case arises when the status quo equilibrium (C ∗ , f ∗ , ξ ∗ ) is such that

                       1                  f ∗π∗     αC ∗ (δ − f ∗ )
                 γ(π∗ − )(β + (1 − σ)δ) +       <                     .               (A.23)
                       2                    2     δα + (1 − σ)C ∗ f ∗

Then, we choose (l, s) so that interest group members are exactly as well oﬀ as they are in the

unrestricted equilibrium. Formally, (l, s) solves the pair of equations (A.14) and (A.20) with

equality. This yields
                                                                        2αC ∗ (δ−f ∗ )
                             γ{(π ∗ − 12 )(β + (1 − σ)δ) + f ∗ π∗ −    δα+(1−σ)C ∗ f ∗ }
                        l=
                                                     1 − 2γ

and
                                          (1 − 2γ)αC ∗ (δ − f ∗ )
         s=                                             2αC ∗ (δ−f ∗ )
                                                                                                   − 1.
              γ{(π∗ − 12 )(β + (1 − σ)δ) + f ∗ π∗ −    δα+(1−σ)C ∗ f ∗ }(δα   + (1 − σ)C ∗ f ∗ )

Equations (A.19) and (A.23) ensure that these values are positive and satisfy (A.15). That regular
                                                                     (1−σ)(α+l(1+s))δ
citizens must be better oﬀ under the equilibrium (C, f, ξ) = (l, 0, 2β(α+(1−σ)l(1+s)) ) than in the

unrestricted equilibrium, follows immediately from the fact that aggregate utility is higher and

interest group members are, by construction, exactly as well oﬀ.

   It only remains to deal with the case in which interest group members bear a smaller share of

the costs of campaign spending in the unrestricted equilibrium; i.e.,


                    f ∗ (σ + π ∗ (1 − 2σ)) ≥ (π∗ − 1/2)(β + (1 − σ)δ).             (A.24)



                                                     44
Then it may not be possible to find policies in Ω which make interest group members better oﬀ

than in the unrestricted equilibrium. However, under these conditions, the level of favors in the

unrestricted equilibrium is so high that banning contributions generates a Pareto improvement.

Thus, let (l, s) = (0, 0). Under this policy, there is a unique equilibrium in which (C, f, ξ) =

(0, 0, (1−σ)δ
         2β ). Partisans and interest group members get a payoﬀ


                                                                    β
                                              [σ 2 + σ(1 − σ)]δ −     .
                                                                    2

Swing voters get a payoﬀ

                        [σ2 + σ(1 − σ)]δ −         + βε{                + σ(1 − σ)}.
                                                 2              2

Given (A.6), (A.9), and (A.12), to establish that all types of citizens will be better oﬀ than in the

unrestricted equilibrium, it is suﬃcient to show that


                            [σ 2 + σ(1 − σ)]δ > [σ2 + 2σ(1 − σ)π∗ ](δ − f ∗ ).


This is equivalent to
                                    σ                                 1
                                [     + (1 − σ)π ∗ ]f ∗ > (1 − σ)(π∗ − )δ.
                                    2                                 2

Given (A.24), it is enough to show that

                      σ                (π ∗ − 1/2)(β + (1 − σ)δ)                1
                  [     + (1 − σ)π ∗ ]                           > (1 − σ)(π ∗ − )δ,
                      2                     (σ + π∗ (1 − 2σ))                   2

which follows from the fact that

                                        σ
                                    [     + (1 − σ)π∗ ] > (σ + π∗ (1 − 2σ)).
