Family Descent as a Signal of Managerial Quality: Evidence from Mutual Funds
Oleg Chuprinin and Denis Sosyura
NBER Working Paper No. 22517

JEL No. D14,G23

                                         ABSTRACT

We study the relation between mutual fund managers’ family backgrounds and their professional
performance. Using hand-collected data from individual Census records on the wealth and
income of managers’ parents, we find that managers from poor families deliver higher alphas
than managers from rich families. This result is robust to alternative measures of fund
performance, such as benchmark-adjusted return and value extracted from capital markets. We
argue that managers born poor face higher entry barriers into asset management, and only the
most skilled succeed. Consistent with this view, managers born rich are more likely to be
promoted, while those born poor are promoted only if they outperform. Overall, we establish the
first link between family descent of investment professionals and their ability to create value.

Introduction

In the majority of financial decisions, shareholders delegate decision rights to professional managers.

Thus, one of the most important tasks of shareholders is to select the most capable, high-type managers as

their agents. Inferring managerial type ex-ante is challenging. For example, the majority of CEOs at

S&P1500 firms have no prior CEO experience. Yet, given the frictions and costs of replacing managers,

this task is of first-order importance for economic outcomes in all public firms.

        This paper provides evidence that public information about a manager’s family descent and

access to resources during his formative years serves as a powerful signal of managerial ability. We

exploit the fact that individuals are endowed with different opportunities at birth and, as a result, face

dramatically different entry barriers into managerial roles. For example, some can ascend to leadership

roles with the help of their inherited status, wealth, or access to professional networks, as in the extreme

case of the heirs of family-owned firms. Others are born in poverty and face limited access to education

and professional advancement during their formative years, a crucial period for subsequent career

outcomes (e.g., Bowles and Herbert (2002); Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2005)). Because individuals

from less privileged backgrounds have much higher barriers to entry into prestigious positions, only the

most skilled types can exceed these thresholds and build a career in a management profession.

        Delegated asset management provides a convenient setting to test this selection mechanism. First,

because this is a service industry requiring professional qualifications, barriers to entry are particularly

steep. Second, in contrast to industrial firms where daily decisions are made by dozens of managers and

implemented by thousands of employees, managers of solo-managed mutual funds have the principal

authority over the fund’s portfolio. Third, fund managers perform standardized professional tasks within a

well-defined investment universe, and their outcomes are easily comparable in the time-series and cross-

section. In contrast, many corporate decisions are not standardized, and the investment opportunity set of

corporate managers is unobservable. Finally, mutual funds account for over a half of financial wealth of

the average household, and the performance of money managers has a major impact on the majority of

U.S. investors, indicating a question of broad public interest.



                                                      1
           In this paper, we study the relation between mutual fund managers’ family descent and their

performance. To identify managers’ family characteristics, we hand-collect data on the households where

managers grew up by examining photo images of individual Census records at the National Archives.1

These records provide detailed information on the income, home value, education, and occupation of a

manager’s parents during his childhood, as well as other demographic characteristics. As expected, most

fund managers come from wealthier and more educated families than those in the general population or

even the local community; e.g., the average (median) annual income of managers' fathers at the time of

Census is at the 89th (84th) percentile of the income distribution in the general U.S. male population.2 On

average, managers' fathers report 26% more years of formal education than the median male in their

census tract and own homes valued at 91% higher than the median house in their census tract. Consistent

with the notion that family economic status is an important factor for an individual’s subsequent career

progression, we observe that managers from wealthier backgrounds are more likely to attend private

universities with lower admission rates and higher tuition; e.g., the median undergraduate tuition was five

times as high in universities attended by managers from the top quintile of family wealth than those from

the bottom quintile, while the admission rate was 38 percentage points lower (78% vs 40%).

           Our main finding is that mutual fund managers from wealthier backgrounds deliver significantly

weaker performance than managers descending from less wealthy families. For example, managers from

families in the top quintile of wealth underperform managers in the bottom quintile by 2.16% per year

(significant at 1%) on the basis of the four-factor alpha. Similar results hold for alternative measures of

performance, such as benchmark-adjusted fund returns and dollar value extracted from capital markets

(Berk and Van Binsbergen (2015)). E.g., an interquartile-range increase in the manager's family wealth

translates to a monthly loss equivalent to $3.34 million in 2012.

                                                            2
        Our analysis accounts for a comprehensive set of controls which proxy for the quality and type of

the manager's own education and demographics, his parents' education and professional expertise, and

fund and management firm characteristics. While it is not feasible to control for all potentially relevant

effects, it should be noted that plausible omitted variables, such as professional connections or privileged

access to information, would favor a positive relationship between family wealth and performance and

thus are unlikely to explain our findings. Likewise, the results are unlikely to be driven by differences in

risk attitudes among manager types, since our analysis features risk-adjusted performance measures. In

addition, we control for fund return volatility and skewness in all the regressions.

        If less stringent selection criteria apply to the more privileged candidates, one should expect to

see a greater dispersion in quality among managers from wealthy backgrounds. In contrast, the candidates

who passed tighter selection should be more uniform in type. Consistent with this conjecture, we find that

the performance dispersion is higher in the sub-sample of managers from wealthier families. The F-ratio

of the alpha variance of the top wealth group to that of the low wealth group is robustly greater than 1,

with most of the results significant at the 1% level. E.g., the alpha variance is 12.7% (28.4%) higher in the

top tercile (quartile) than in the bottom tercile (quartile) of the wealth distribution.

        Overall, our main evidence is consistent with the idea that candidates endowed with fewer

opportunities face higher selection thresholds, and only the most skilled make it into fund management.3

To shed more light on this issue, we investigate fund managers’ career progressions and study how a

manager’s likelihood of promotion varies with his family background and past performance. We define a

promotion as an event when a manager obtains an additional fund or is reassigned to a fund with greater

assets under management. For managers with negative to neutral past performance, as measured by their

past five-year alpha, promotion chances are increasing in family wealth. However, managers from poorer

families can close this gap by delivering better performance, as indicated by the negative significant

coefficient on the interaction between past performance and wealth. In other words, only the best-

 Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne (2005) provide a comprehensive review of the research in sociology on the role of
parental economic status on individuals' careers and the associated survival mechanisms.



                                                        3
performing poor managers can compete with the wealthy managers for promotion, thus ensuring the

selection of the more talented managers among the less privileged candidates.

        Next, we examine the relationship between managers' family wealth and a variety of portfolio

activity measures, such as turnover, portfolio concentration, holding horizon, and herding. The results are

directionally similar across these measures and suggest that less wealthy managers tend to be more active:

they have higher turnover and concentration but shorter holding horizon and weaker herding tendencies.

However, only the turnover coefficient is statistically significant: an interquartile-range reduction in the

family wealth increases the fund's annual turnover by 5.4% of the portfolio TNA, or about 21% of the

median annual turnover in the sample. Combined with the earlier findings, this result lends support to the

argument that more frequent trading can foster value creation (Pastor, Stambaugh, and Taylor (2015)).

        In our final analysis, we test whether mutual fund investors infer managerial ability from

managers’ familial backgrounds and find little evidence that they do. Mutual fund capital flows are not

significantly related to fund managers’ family backgrounds, and this effect is similar in specifications

with and without the fund's past performance. It appears that fund investors are unlikely to incorporate

information on the fund manager's background into their investment decisions.

        The central contribution of this article is to provide the first evidence on how the family descent

of investment professionals signals their ability to create value. Our findings add novel insights to

academic research on (i) managerial characteristics that predict professional performance and (ii) the

effect of formative years on individuals’ career progression and economic outcomes.

        We contribute to a small number of papers in asset management that identify personal

characteristics of fund managers that predict their professional performance. So far, this literature has

focused mostly on the role of managers’ education. Chevalier and Ellison (1999) find that mutual fund

managers who attended colleges with higher average SAT scores deliver superior risk-adjusted returns,

and Li, Zhang, and Zhao (2011) find similar evidence in the context of hedge funds. Cohen, Frazzini and

Malloy (2008) show that fund managers’ educational networks yield valuable information that improves

managerial performance in connected stocks. Chaudhuri, Ivkovich, Pollet, and Trzcinka (2015) provide



                                                     4
evidence that investment funds managed by PhD graduates deliver superior risk-adjusted performance

and charge lower fees. In contrast to previous work, we document how endowed low economic status

serves as an important screening mechanism of managerial ability. Our paper is among the first in the

mutual fund literature to emphasize signaling of managerial quality based on selection.

        We also extend the literature on the effect of individuals’ family environment on subsequent

economic outcomes. So far, this research has focused mostly on the economic behavior of individual

households. For example, using data from a field experiment, Chetty et al. (2011) find that a child’s

access to education predicts college attendance, earnings, and retirement savings. In two studies of

Swedish twins, the socioeconomic status of an individual’s parents helps explain future savings behavior

(Cronqvist and Siegel (2015)) and preference for value vs. growth stocks (Cronqvist, Siegel, and Yu

(2015)). In contrast to studying households’ personal decisions, we provide evidence on sophisticated

financial intermediaries whose professional choices have large welfare implications for millions of

investors. Also, to identify exposure to a socioeconomic environment, prior papers have used general

time-series patterns, such as growing up during the Great Depression (Malmendier and Nagel (2011)) or

entering the labor market in a recession (Schoar and Zuo (2013)). Our approach uses a sharper

identification by focusing on the unique economic status of each household and uncovers important cross-

sectional patterns.

        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the data and presents

summary statistics. Section III establishes the relationship between managers' family wealth and

performance measures. Section IV investigates ancillary implications of selection. Section V focuses on

portfolio activity and capital flows. A brief conclusion follows.

II. Data and main variables

II.A Sample construction

We begin our sample construction with the universe of U.S.-domiciled mutual funds covered by

Morningstar in 1975-2012.4 We include both defunct and active investment products (fund share classes),

ensuring that any fund ever appearing in the Morningstar database during our time period is present in the

initial sample.

          To ensure an equitable comparison basis for investment managers, we restrict our sample to

domestic actively managed funds specializing in U.S. equity, thus excluding international funds, index

funds, and funds specializing in bonds, commodities, and alternative asset classes.5 To eliminate possible

errors in the data, we exclude funds with a missing name and funds whose total net assets (TNA) never

exceed $10 million during our sample period. Finally, to establish a clean correspondence between a fund

manager’s decisions and performance outcomes, we focus on solo-managed mutual funds. Accordingly,

we exclude funds that are always managed by a team of managers during our sample period.

          For each fund that passes the initial filters, we obtain its historical management data from

Morningstar, which details the name of the manager and his starting and ending dates (months) in a fund.

To provide a sufficient period for evaluating managerial performance, we limit our sample to managers

with at least 24 monthly return observations. For managers who pass these initial criteria, we initiate the

data collection process described below.

          First, we obtain managers’ education and employment history from their biographies in

Morningstar and FactSet and verify these data against the employment records in the Nelson Directory of

Investment Managers. We complement our data on managers’ education with records from university

alumni publications and archived university yearbooks available from ancestry.com. Where information

about a manager’s degree is missing, we contact the registrars of the university attended or the National

  Even though some funds have return series dating back to 1960, the data on net assets is generally not available before 1975.
5
  This filter excludes index funds, funds whose U.S. Broad Asset Class is not "U.S. Stock", funds for which Morningstar equity
style classification is not available, and funds that have sector restrictions or specialty focus (Global Category includes the word
"Sector" or Prospectus Objective includes the word "Specialty").



                                                                  6
Student Clearinghouse, a degree-verification service provider. We supplement this information with data

on the quality of the educational institution (average SAT score of the entering class), its competitiveness

(undergraduate acceptance rate), affordability (annual tuition), and elite status (Ivy League indicator).

This information is obtained from the College Handbook, published by the College Entrance Examination

Board, and most variables are based on the 1979 data (one of the oldest editions), except for the

standardized scores, which are recorded as of 2004 due to better data availability.6

         Second, we match fund managers to the Lexis Nexis Public Records database (LNPR). This

database aggregates information on nearly 500 million U.S. individuals (both alive and deceased) from

sources such as birth and death records, property tax assessment records, voting records, and utility

connection records. Prior research in finance has relied on this database to obtain personal data on fund

managers (Pool, Stoffman, and Yonker (2012); Pool, Stoffman, Yonker, and Zhang (2015)), corporate

executives (Cronqvist, Makhija, and Yonker (2012); Yermack (2014)), and financial journalists (Ahern

and Sosyura (2015)). All personal records in the database are linked to the individual’s social security

number (observable with the exception of the last four digits and linked to a unique ID). Using a

manager’s full name, age, and employment history, we establish reliable matches to LNPR for 92% of

managers in our sample. Appendix 1.A details our matching process and verification procedure. The 8%

of unmatched managers are typically those who live outside the U.S. (funds delegated to a foreign

subadvisor) and those who have the most common combinations of first and last names (e.g., Robert

Jones or John Miller) and no additional information to establish an unambiguous match. These managers

are excluded from the sample.

         Next, we proceed to the main stage in our data collection – extracting personal census records for

the households where fund managers grew up. Our sample construction is guided by regulatory

constraints imposed on working with individual census records. The U.S. public law prohibits the release

of individual decennial census records with personally identifiable information for 72 years after these


6
 Our results are virtually identical if we use the 2004 handbook throughout – there is a high correlation between the
1979 and the 2004 variables.



                                                          7
records are collected (92 Stat. 915; Public Law 95-416; October 5, 1978). Because of the 72-year

moratorium, the latest decennial census with personally identifiable information available at the time of

writing is the 1940 federal census (and any earlier decennial censuses), which constitutes our main source

of data. Appendix 2 shows the census form presented to households and provides an example of a

completed form.

        To ensure that the census record provides an accurate reflection of a manager’s endowed social

status during childhood, we restrict our sample to managers born in or before 1945. In other words, we

allow for a maximum delay of five years between the measurement of family characteristics and the

manager’s birth. After investigating the managers’ backgrounds, we find that some of the managers were

raised outside the U.S., and, as a result, their families were not covered in the publicly available censuses.

After eliminating these cases, we end up with 357 managers with potential census records.

        We follow a three-step algorithm to identify a manager’s household in the census by sequentially

checking three types of records – birth, marriage, and death – for the manager and his relatives. To ensure

a reliable match to the census, we require establishing a manager’s parents and, in some cases, siblings.

This criterion nearly eliminates the possibility of a spurious match, because the census record identified in

this process contains the unique combination of the manager’s parents and siblings who are further

verified based on their year of birth. Appendix 1.B describes how we identify the manager’s parents and

siblings and provides examples of birth, marriage, and obituary records used in the data collection. The

combination of these records allows us to establish the full names of both parents for 305 fund managers

or 85% of the 357 managers that satisfy our sample criteria.

        In our final step, we use the combination of the manager’s parents and siblings to identify the

family’s record in the 1940 census (for a small subset of older managers, we also obtain the 1930 census

records). We obtain the image file of the family’s census record (shown in Appendix 2) from the digital

archive maintained by the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration. To search and access

these records, we use the interface provided by ancestry.com.




                                                      8
           We are able to identify census records for 267 (88%) of the 305 managers that satisfy prior

sample filters. The unmatched observations mainly result from transcription errors in the indexing of

hand-written family names in the digital archive, which prevent us from being able to locate the record in

the archive. While we recover some of the mis-indexed records by manually going through census records

in the manager’s enumeration district, a full recovery of these observations is prohibitively costly. For a

small number of observations, we are unable to locate the 1940 census record because the managers’

parents were on an overseas trip (identified via vessel departure records) or on military duty abroad

(identified via military enlistment records). Appendix 1.B summarizes the sequence of steps in the data

collection process and provides examples of relevant records.

           Because of the data limitations in this study, our sample is naturally restricted to older managers

born before or shortly after the 1940 Census. These managers account for 482 unique funds (multiple

shareclasses of the same fund are aggregated to the fund level) spanning a long time period from 1975 to

2012. This sample size is comparable to that in other studies that focus on older fund managers, such as

Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1995) (274 funds) and Chevalier and Ellison (1997) (398 funds).

           After locating the manager's parents' household on ancestry.com, we manually record the

information from the digital image of the filled census form. The following data fields are of particular

interest: the father's and the mother's birth years, their annual incomes (as of 1939), their

occupation/profession, whether the family owned or rented an accommodation in 1940, the monthly rent

(if the accommodation was rented) or the approximate house value (if it was owned), 7 the parents'

employment type (a private or a government worker, an employer, a self-employed individual, or an

unpaid worker), the parents' education (completed years of elementary school, high school, and college),

and some auxiliary information, such as the number of children in the household and the number of

resident servants.

           In the next section, we discuss the characteristics of fund managers and compare them with those

of other U.S. households. To make these comparisons possible, we obtain tract-level census data for the

7
    Home values are recorded in increments of $500.



                                                       9
entire U.S. population and compare the characteristics of the fund manager’s household with the

characteristics of other households located in the same census tract, same county, or nationwide.8 We

obtain tract-level data for the 1940 census from the Elizabeth Mullen Bogue File, which has been used in

prior work in social economics (e.g., Sugrue (1995), Elliott and Frickel (2013)).9 Examples of tract-level

variables include total population in the tract, median home value, median monthly rent (both gross and

contract), the number of residents with school and college education, median education years, and the

number of residents without paid employment.

II.B Summary statistics

Table 1 reports summary statistics on mutual funds and fund managers in our sample. The average

(median) manager in our sample is born in 1938 (1940) – three years (same year) before we measure the

household characteristics. Even for managers born before (10th percentile is 1930) and after (90th

percentile is 1944) 1940, the Census records are close enough in time to accurately reflect the manager's

family's social situation during his childhood years. The average (median) managerial career, as measured

by the time difference between the manager's first and last appearance in the sample, is 13.4 (11.6) years,

although some managers have long careers approaching 30 years (90th percentile is 26.3 years). The peak

dollar value of assets controlled by managers in our sample has an average value of $2.96 billion and a

median value of only $647 million, highlighting the fact that a number of managers are in charge of

particularly big funds. Both figures are economically large and imply significant value effects for the

funds' investors. Most managers have strong educational backgrounds and graduate from universities with

an average (median) SAT rank of 84.4 (88.0). However, the average (median) admission rate is only

54.8% (55.9%), while the variable itself has a fairly even and wide distribution (from 10th percentile of

22.6% to 90th percentile of 86.0%), suggesting some variation in the education exclusivity.

  The matching of addresses from individual census records to the 1940 census tracts is conducted via the Unified

  This data can be found, among other sources, at www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/DSDR/studies/2930 and is

Bogue and his wife, Elizabeth Mullen Bogue, who manually entered information from printed publications released
by the Bureau of the Census.



                                                        10
         The estimated average (median) value of the manager's parents' home in 1940 is $10,097 ($7,350)

but its variation is substantial (from 10th percentile of $2,500 to 90th percentile of $20,000). Monthly rent

shows a similar pattern: an average (median) rent is $43.5 ($40.0) but the 10th and 90th percentiles are

wide apart ($14.0 and $70.0, respectively). An inspection of the parents' incomes reveals that over 75% of

mothers are either out of the labor force or report an income of $0 (as evidenced by the occupation

records, many of the wives are either housewives or attend school, while most husbands hold at least a

part-time job), whereas fathers report an average (median) annual income of $2,246 ($1,900). In Figure 1

we show how the distribution of the managers' fathers' incomes compares with the distribution of incomes

in the general male population in the U.S. in 1940 (data from Census Labor Force summary files).

Finally, for both parents, the mean and the median years of education at the time of the census is 12, with

most of the respondents having completed at least the elementary school.10

         Comparing household-level home values and rent to their tract-level counterparts does not reveal

a striking difference for the mean or the median. Household homes are generally more expensive than

those of the tract (median $7,350 vs. median $5,071) but the rent is similar. This pattern suggests that

managers whose parents already owned a house in their youth come from wealthier backgrounds while

those whose parents rented an accommodation are more representative of the tract's average. Naturally,

measures of variation, such as the standard deviation or the percentile range, are significantly lower at the

tract level than the household level due to diversification.

         Statistics from the fund sample confirm the disparity between the mean and the median size of

managed funds ($654.9 million vs. $134.4 million). A similar pattern is observed at the fund family level

and is also confirmed by the statistics on the number of equity holdings in a fund (mean of 87.4 vs.

median of 62.0). An average (median) monthly fund return is positive at 1.00% (1.26%); however one

must consider that the stock market grew at an unprecedented rate during our sample period between

1975 and 2012. An examination of fund alphas – fund returns in excess of the returns predicted by the

10
   Individual Census records report years in the elementary school, high school, and college separately, while the
tract-level Census data report the total years of education, assuming 8 (4) years for the elementary school (high
school). We follow the latter convention in constructing our measure of the duration of education.

four-factor model (Section III describes the computation methodology in greater detail) – reveals that an

average and median monthly alphas in our sample are negative at -0.04% (-0.48% annualized).

        Panel B of Table 1 reports some sample composition statistics. 68.9% of the managers earned

some graduate degree; in particular 57.0% earned an MBA degree, while 2.9% completed a PhD. 90.4%

of the managers have either an undergraduate or a graduate degree in a field which we classify as

economics-related (see Appendix 3.A for the classification methodology) and 8.2% hold a degree in

sciences, such as physics, engineering, or mathematics. The vast majority of the managers' parents' were

employed in the private sector in 1940 and 20.8% had a finance-related job, such as an accountant or an

insurance advisor (see Appendix 3.B for the classification methodology). As expected, most of the funds

in our sample (close to 65%) belong to the Large Cap styles with the Large Growth being the dominant

category (28.4%).

        In Table 2 we examine relationships among our main variables in correlation tables and by

quintiles of the managers' family income. In Panel A we focus on the parents and include household

wealth and education characteristics as well as tract wealth characteristics. Using the data from the

Census personal records, we define the following major variables: FatherIncome is the reported annual

income of the manager's father in thousands of dollars; FatherYearsEdu is the aggregate years of

education of the father by the time of the census; ParYearsEdu is the average of the father's and the

mother's education years; FinanceRelated is a dummy variable equal to 1 if at least one of the parents

held a job that we classify as finance-related, and 0 otherwise; Managerial is a dummy variable equal to 1

if at least one of the parents held a job that we classify as being in a managerial position, and 0 otherwise

(Appendix 3.B explains the classification); Rent is the monthly rent in dollars; and HomeValue is the

estimated value of the parents' home, if owned, in thousands of dollars.

        The rent is strongly positively related to the father's income (correlation of 0.686). However, the

correlation between the income and the home value is weaker (0.472). We cannot correlate home value

with rent directly since these variables are available for complementary sub-samples, namely, for owned

and rented properties. The parents' education is positively related to both income and rent, with the



                                                     12
correlation coefficients of 0.372-0.373. The income, rent, and home value are all higher if at least one of

the parents has a finance-related or a managerial job, e.g., the correlation between dummy

FinanceRelated and FatherIncome is 0.352. Larger families, as proxied by the number of siblings, tend to

earn slightly smaller incomes. Tract-level median rent and home value are weakly related to the measures

of household wealth; we should note, however, that the tract-level statistics are available for only about

28% of the municipal districts in our sample (these are main agglomerations such as New York, Boston,

or Saint Louis) and are given here for comparison only – none of our regression analysis uses tract-level

variables.

        In Panel B, we examine the relationship between the parents' wealth/education and the attributes

of the manager's education. For most of the variables featuring in this panel, the variable name directly

defines the measure, e.g., variables HasGraduate, HasMBA, and HasPhD are dummies taking the value

of 1 if the manager holds any graduate degree, an MBA degree, or a PhD, respectively, and 0 otherwise,

while IvyLeague is a dummy which takes the value of 1 if the manager's undergraduate institution belongs

to the Ivy League, and 0 otherwise. In addition, we define several classification variables to characterize

the type of the manager's scholarly specialization, creating dummies for economics-related fields, science

fields, and a psychology fields (see Appendix 3.A for details).

        The results in Panel B reveal a robust positive relationship between the parents' wealth and the

quality or exclusivity of the manager's education. E.g., the father's income has a correlation of 0.466 with

the university tuition, 0.364 with the university's private status, 0.472 with the median university ACT

score, and -0.368 with the admission rate (correlations among the university variables have the expected

signs and do not warrant special attention). In addition, graduate education in general was more often

pursued by managers from poorer backgrounds, although this effect is not strong. Finally, the manager's

own education quality is consistently positively related to his parents' education, e.g., there is a 0.213

correlation of the parents' education years with the Ivy League dummy and a 0.343 correlation of the

parents' education with the manager's university SAT rank. Also, the manager was somewhat more likely

to pursue an economics-related education if at least one of his parents was occupied in a finance



                                                    13
profession. Perhaps surprisingly, the probability of attaining an MBA degree is slightly lower for

managers whose parents held a finance-related or a managerial position.

        In Panel C of Table 2 we report mean and median values of several key variables for each quintile

of the managers' parents' household wealth. To this purpose we first construct the wealth rank variable

(henceforth, WealthRank) combining information on the income, home value, and rent. We define

WealthRank as the percentile rank of the father's income, if its value is non-missing, and the percentile

rank of HomeValue or Rent, otherwise.

        Several clarifications are in order. First, we do not incorporate the mother's income in the

measure because about 80% of mothers do not report any income even if the record indicates some

employment. Also, most of the mothers are homemakers and this is more likely to happen in wealthier

families. For these reasons, incorporating mother income would detract from the precision of the wealth

estimate. Second, for about 35% of observations the fathers do not report any salary or wage income

either. However, this generally happens when the father is a proprietor of a business or an entrepreneur. In

such cases, we use the data on home value and rent to proxy for the household wealth. To make all these

measures comparable we compute their ranked percentiles which range from 1 to 100. In our main test in

Table 3 we present the analysis for both the raw measures and the ranked wealth to demonstrate the

consistency of the results. Finally, it is worth reminding that HomeValue and Rent are defined on the non-

overlapping subsamples, meaning that it does not matter in which order they enter the ranked wealth

measure.

        The top three rows in Panel C of Table 2 show how the father's income, home value, and rent

vary by the wealth quintile. Both the means and the medians of all three measures are monotonically

increasing in wealth. The next row shows how the annualized fund four-factor alpha varies by its

manager's family wealth. This analysis is preliminary and does not feature any controls or fixed effects,

which are required in the formal analysis, since family wealth produces multiple effects some of which

are performance-related. At this stage we can only point out that managers from the top wealth quintile

deliver the worst performance while those from the bottom quintile are the best by comparison. This



                                                    14
result holds for both the mean and the median alpha; e.g., the top- and bottom- quintile median alphas are

-0.92% and -0.17%, respectively. However, the wealth-performance relationship is not monotonic across

the quintiles and is likely masked by many confounding effects, which we address in our multivariate

analysis in Section III. Some of these effects are even apparent in Panel C of Table 2. E.g., we can see

that the parents' education depth is robustly increasing in wealth, while the manager's own education

quality is also positively related to his parents' wealth (the manager's university admission rate decreases

from the median of 78.3% to the median of 39.7% as we move from the lowest to the highest wealth

quintile, while the median tuition increases from $975 to $4,825). Both these variables can have

implications for fund performance and need to be controlled for. The main takeaway at this stage is that

despite the fact that natural drivers of performance are increasing in wealth, the performance measure

itself shows the reverse pattern.




III. Family wealth and managers' performance

III.A Main results

We now investigate how fund managers' ability to create value for fund investors relates to their familial

backgrounds. Our main analysis focuses on fund alpha which we calculate as follows. For each fund j and

month t we estimate the coefficients in the four-factor model, which includes the three Fama-French

factors (Fama and French (1993)) and the Carhart momentum factor (Carhart (1997)),11 using monthly

return observations from the previous 36 months (t-36 to t-1) and compute the difference between the

actual fund return in month t and the return predicted by the model. This procedure yields rolling alphas

at monthly frequency, Alphajt, which we express in percentage points in all of our tests. We require at

least 30 non-missing observations for this estimation, otherwise we set Alphajt to missing.12

   The data is from the Kenneth French's website:
http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html. We thanks the authors for making this
data available.
12
   Our results are robust to the choice of the estimation window. However, many funds in our sample have long
return series which stretch across different market cycles. The three-year period allows reasonable statistical



                                                        15
         The fund alpha computed from net returns is a standard measure of fund performance and fits

several objectives of our study: it quantifies the percentage value created over the salient benchmark

portfolios (size and value are the major styles in Morningstar and Lipper) and is easily available to fund

investors. However, it is not without issues. First, the alpha measure can be dynamically altered. Even

though such a manipulation cannot be directly inferred from the return series, it tends to increase the

volatility and skewness of returns. For this reason, we control for the fund volatility and skewness in all

our regressions. Second, funds often operate within the boundaries of their investment mandates and are

restricted in their investment behavior. For this reason, all our regressions include fund style fixed effects.

Moreover, even though the main market trends are cleansed in the construction of alpha, we include time

fixed effects to allow for the possibility that alpha might be easier to earn in a growing market. Finally,

we investigate the robustness of our findings to several alternative measures of performance, such as the

return net of benchmark and the value extracted from capital markets, and reach similar conclusions.

         Our main right-hand side variables are designed to measure the financial standing of the

manager's family during his childhood years. For our initial tests we consider three different variables:

FatherIncome, HomeValue, and Rent defined in the previous section. We collectively call the three right-

hand side variables Wealth and run the following regression specifications:


  Alphamjt = βWealthm + Γ1×MControlsmt-1 + Γ2×FControlsjt-1 + αY + δs + εmjt ,                              (1)


where j indexes funds, t indexes months, m indexes managers, and s denotes Morningstar fund style.

Wealth is one of the three measures of the household wealth in 1940. MControls is a vector of controls

for the manager which includes ManagerAge (the difference between the observation year and the

manager's birth year) and a set of education and employment characteristics described in the previous

section, namely, ParYearsEdu, HasGraduate, HasMBA, AdmissionRate, FinanceRelated, and

Managerial. FControls is a vector of standard fund and fund family controls which includes FundSize


accuracy in the estimation without imposing the condition that the factor loadings have to remain constant over a
long period of time.



                                                         16
(log of the fund's TNA in millions of dollars), FundAge (the time in years from the month of the fund's

first appearance in the sample to month t-1), FirmSize (log of the mutual fund family TNA in millions of

dollars), LogFirmNFunds (log of the number of funds in the family), Volatility (standard deviation of

fund returns over the trailing twelve months), and Skewness (skewness of fund returns computed over the

trailing twelve months). All the controls are measured as of the end of month t-1. In these and all the

subsequent tests the standard errors are clustered at the fund level to allow for possible serial correlation

in fund returns resulting from some unobservable fund-specific institutional features.

         We report the results in Panel A of Table 3. All of the three wealth measures – FatherIncome,

HomeValue, and Rent – are robustly negatively related to Alpha, with all the coefficients significant at

least at the 10% level. The results become stronger as manager-specific controls (such as education) are

added, suggesting that any failure to control for factors likely to affect performance would generally

understate the significance of the negative relationship between performance and wealth. To evaluate

economic magnitudes, consider two managers whose fathers' incomes differ by 1.8 ($1,800), which is the

interquartile range for FatherIncome in the panel sample. The monthly alpha for the manager with the

higher FatherIncome is lower by 6.9 bp (0.83% annualized).13 To compare, the median monthly alpha in

the sample is only -4.3 bp (-0.52% annualized). Considering that our managers have long careers, the

difference in the compounded risk-adjusted returns earned by different manager types over the years can

be substantial, underscoring the importance of the quality signalling mechanism discussed in this paper.

         In Panel B of Table 3, we consider the aggregate measure of wealth – WealthRank – which does

not lose observations and which will be used in all the subsequent tests in the paper. For convenience, the

regression version of WealthRank is scaled by 0.01 and thus ranges from 0 to 1. In the right pane, we

focus on the quintiles of wealth; e.g., WealthRankQ2 is equal to 1 for a manager if his WealthRank is

between 0.2 and 0.4.




13
  All the effects in this section are computed from the coefficients in the full specification, e.g., 1.8*-0.0384 = -6.9
bp.



                                                           17
        The results from Panel B confirm and strengthen our initial conclusions. First, higher WealthRank

robustly predicts lower Alpha: an increase in WealthRank of 0.5 reduces the manager's monthly (annual)

Alpha by 7.3 bp (0.88%). Second, this effect is monotonic across the quintiles in the full specification: the

coefficient on the quintile dummy is decreasing in the quintile's ordinal number (each coefficient captures

the average difference in Alpha between that quintile and the omitted category, which is the lowest

quintile). The difference between the performance of managers from the fifth quintile of wealth and those

from the first quintile is highly significant both statistically and economically; e.g., managers from the

richest families underperform those from the poorest families by 18.0 bp monthly (2.16% annually).

        The strength of the results in this section becomes even more apparent if we acknowledge that

various unobserved effects should favor richer managers and improve their performance. Even though we

strive to control for different aspects of the manager's skill set and his family's expertise, potentially

important omitted variables always exist in this type of studies. However, a reasonable endogeneity

argument would point to a positive relationship between the parents' wealth and the manager's

performance. E.g., individuals from wealthier families have better connections and access to resources,

which should aid their portfolio management task. And yet, these same privileges make it possible to

make career advancements without showing strong performance, and only if this biased selection channel

is in full effect, would we observe a negative relationship between a manager's performance and his

endowed wealth in the sample. In the next section we explore this advancement hypothesis directly by

studying the link between managers' promotions and their parents' wealth.

III.B Alternative measures of performance

In this subsection, we consider several alternative measures of fund performance. In the original tests, we

used net fund returns to construct the alpha, since we were interested in the value effects from the

perspective of a fund investor, i.e. portfolio performance net of fees. However, if we calculate the fund's

gross return by summing the expense ratio and the return earned by investors (gross return = (1+net




                                                     18
return)*(1+expense ratio)-1), re-estimate the alpha, and rerun our tests, the results remain almost

identical, as can be seen in the first two columns of Table 4.

        Next, we consider fund performance evaluated relative to the fund's prospectus benchmark index.

We define BenchmarkAdjReturn as the difference between the fund's monthly gross return and the return

on the fund's benchmark index as reported by Morningstar. We also consider the abnormal return over the

benchmark (AbnReturnOverBenchmark) computed as the difference between the fund's return and the

return predicted by the factor model in which the factor is the index return series (as before, the model is

estimated over the trailing 36 months). The results for these two measures are reported in columns 3 to 4

of Table 4. Similar to the main test, the significance improves with the addition of controls. For the

benchmark-adjusted measures of performance, the economic effects are slightly stronger than for the

alpha. Interestingly, the ability to beat the benchmark is significantly higher for managers who graduated

from more elite universities: a decrease in the manager's university admission rate of 50% improves the

annualized benchmark-adjusted return by 1.05% (=-0.5*-0.1753*12).

        Finally, we turn our attention to the dollar measure of the value extracted from capital markets

introduced in Berk and Van Binsbergen (2015). We compute this measure as the product of the fund's

beginning-of-the-month TNA (this TNA is adjusted for inflation by the Consumer Price Index of the

Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and is expressed in millions of 2012 dollars) and its benchmark-

adjusted monthly return. This variable is different from the return-based measures of performance as it

explicitly takes into account the size of the fund portfolio. The size component is important, since the

neoclassical framework posits that fund size should adjust endogenously to the manager's ability through

flows, thus driving down the return-based measures of performance under the assumption of decreasing

returns to scale (Berk and Van Binsbergen (2015)). At the same time, as long as the equilibrium is not

reached, the value-added measure would understate the ability of managers who are constrained by fund

size. Moreover, the equity market grew rapidly over our sample period offering new investment

opportunities for fund managers every year, thus relaxing the effect of diminishing returns to scale.

Empirically, the dollar measure of value-added has correlation of 0.121 with the alpha and 0.220 with the



                                                     19
benchmark-adjusted return in our sample. The last two columns of Table 4 show the relationship between

this measure and the managers' family wealth. This relationship is negative and statistically significant at

5%. To interpret the economic effect, consider, as before, an increase in WealthRank of 0.5. This

increment is associated with a monthly loss of $3.34 million (=0.5*-6.6870), or about 58% of the

interquartile range of the value-added measure.

        Overall, our evidence indicates that higher wealth at birth is negatively related to various

measures of managers' performance, the result consistent with more stringent selection of the less

privileged candidates into the profession. It is possible that managers are allocated to funds non-randomly

and that some managers end up running funds where it is easier to earn abnormal returns, such as funds

investing in the least efficient market segments (Fang, Kempf, and Trapp (2015)). However, this channel

is unlikely to explain our main results. We specifically exclude non-U.S. and specialty-focus funds, so it

is difficult to predict the ex-ante performance solely on the basis on the characteristics of the funds in our

sample. Still, we include fund-level controls and style fixed effects to capture the possibility that funds'

institutional features or mandates drive performance, as opposed to the managers' decisions. Also, to the

extent that the allocation of managers to funds is biased, we would expect managers from wealthier

families to command the more lucrative investment opportunities and earn higher returns.




IV. Additional implications of selection

In this section we examine the implications of the selection mechanism that extend beyond the

relationship between family wealth and performance.

IV.A Directional heteroscedasticity

Our explanation of the results in Section III does not imply that managers born poor are ex ante more

skilled or grow to be more skilled. Rather, we contend that candidates from wealthy families face less

stringent screening standards and, for a given level of skill, are more likely to be appointed managers. On

the other hand, unskilled candidates from poor families are filtered out and only the skilled ones make it



                                                     20
into the sample. If this mechanism holds, we should observe a higher dispersion in performance among

the managers from wealthier families, because both the low and the high type wealthy candidates make it

though. In contrast, only the high type poor candidates are able to pass the selection hurdle. Such a

selection should produce the directional heteroscedasticity effect: the variance should increase in

WealthRank.

        Conventional tests for heteroscedasticity, such as White test or Breusch-Pagan-Godfrey test,

cannot identify the directional effect: any uneven pattern in residual variance will cause us to reject the

null hypothesis of no-heteroscedasticity. We therefore employ the Goldfeld-Quandt test that allows us to

compare the residual variance between low and high sub-samples of wealth. When the sample is divided

into the high and the low bin, some observations in between can be dropped to improve test precision.

Sacrificing these observations trades off Type I against Type II error. To ensure the robustness of our

findings, we consider three specifications for the Goldfeld-Quandt test: in specification 1 (2, 3) we assign

managers with WealthRank from the top half (top tercile, top quartile) of the distribution to the high bin

and managers with WealthRank from the bottom half (bottom tercile, bottom quartile) of the distribution

to the low bin. In specification 2 (3), managers from the middle tercile (two quartiles) of the distribution

are omitted from the test.

        We present the results in Table 5 where for both bins we report the full and the residual variance,

calculated as the (residual) sum of squares divided by the degrees of freedom, and the F-ratio along with

the associated p-value. As we improve the precision of the test by moving closer to the ends of the

distribution, the difference in the variance grows: e.g., the unconditional F-ratio in specification (1) is

only 1.035 (significant at 5%) while that in specification (3) is 1.284 (significant at 1%). The only case

where the ratio is below 1 (insignificant 0.99) is the full-controls sample in the least precise specification

(1).

        Overall, the results in this sub-section affirm the presence of the directional heteroscedasticity in

our sample. This effect is consistent with the major prediction of the selection hypothesis: that individuals

from wealthier backgrounds do not face a tight skill-contingent filter on their way to fund management.



                                                     21
Notably, our measure of performance is risk-adjusted and we also include return volatility as a control,

hence the results reported here are unlikely to be explained by differential risk-attitudes of wealthy and

poor individuals.




IV.B Promotion-to-performance sensitivity

If we could observe the whole set of prospective managers and compare it to the set of managers

eventually selected, this study would be trivial. Even though we cannot conduct such a test, we can

consider its in-sample analogue: conditional on being in the sample, a manager from a wealthier family

should find it easier to get promoted, while a manager from a poor family is only promoted if he proves

his high-quality type, i.e. shows strong performance. In conducting this analysis, we are effectively

assuming that the selection mechanism related to family wealth plays a similar role in promotions as it

plays in the initial hiring decisions.

        To indentify plausible promotion events in our sample we focus on the number of funds the

manager controls and the aggregate assets of these funds. We define as promotion an event when the

number of funds the manager is in charge of increases or when his managed assets increase in such a way

that this growth cannot be attributed to capital flows or returns earned by the funds. These two promotion

events are sometimes related: the assets grow significantly because a new fund is added to the manager's

portfolio, but sometimes the assets of the old fund increase because another fund is merged with it. We do

not attempt to identify any "demotion events" because most demotions result in the termination of a

manager's employment and his exit from the sample. However, we cannot use sample exits to proxy for

these firing events because managers can, and most often do, exit the sample when they voluntarily accept

a new position outside of the mutual fund industry (e.g., become hedge fund managers).

        Formally, we define two left-hand side variables as follows. IncreaseFunds is a dummy variable

equal to 1 if the number of funds the manager manages in the observation month is higher than in the

previous month, and 0 otherwise. IncreaseAssetsX2 is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the manager's total




                                                   22
managed assets in dollars in the observation month is more than double the assets in the previous month,

and 0 otherwise. The unconditional probability of being promoted in any given month is naturally low:

1.2% for IncreaseFunds and 0.75% for IncreaseAssetsX2.

         Next, we relate these promotion dummies to the manager's family wealth, his past performance,

and the interaction between the two. For this analysis we only consider managers with at least five years

of data and for these managers we define past performance as the average gross monthly alpha delivered

by the manager over the past 36 or 60 months, with both periods ending in month t-1. The full regression

specification is a liner probability model with fixed effects, as indicated:14


          Promotionmjt = β1PastGAlphamt + β2WealthRankm + β3PastGAlphamt*WealthRankm +
     Γ1×MControlsmt-1 + Γ2×FControlsjt-1 + αY + δF + εmjt .                                                        (2)


         Table 6 presents the results of this test. In the left pane the manager's past performance is

measured over the 36-month horizon (Past3YearGAlpha) and in the right pane it is measured over the 60-

month horizon (Past5YearGAlpha).

         We find that the promotion-to-performance sensitivity is higher for managers from less wealthy

families; in other words, these managers need to demonstrate better performance in order to get promoted.

The interaction coefficient has a consistent negative sign and is significant at the 10% level or better in six

out of eight specifications. This result is important for the selection mechanism because it suggests that

poor managers are more likely to be selected when they prove their skill whereas the selection of the

wealthier managers is less skill-dependent. We can evaluate the marginal economic effects by answering

the following question: how much better does the less wealthy manager's (25th percentile of wealth)

performance need to be so that he would stand the same chance of promotion as the wealthier manager

(75th percentile of wealth). If we consider the coefficients for the first promotion proxy in the five-year




14
  Since this is no longer a fund-level regression, fund-specific variables, such as volatility and skewness, are
omitted from this analysis.



                                                          23
specification, the answer to this question is 55 bp per month, or 6.6% annualized.15 Such a performance

differential is practically unfeasible, indicating that wealthier managers continue to hold the promotion

edge over the less wealthy at normal levels of performance.

         We note that while the evidence on the selective promotion is not definitive given our

measurement methodology, the actual promotion can be achieved in numerous ways which we do not

capture. A connected manager can be "promoted" by receiving a more lucrative compensation package or

a more senior title, without being given extra funds to manage. It is also likely that the selection

mechanism is much stronger at the time of entry to a job than at the time of a possible promotion,

especially considering that the selected pool of managers from less privileged backgrounds already

comprises the most talented candidates.




V. Fund management activities and flows

V.A Measures of fund activity

In this section we investigate whether managers from wealthier backgrounds pursue less or more active

fund management strategies. Of course, there are different measures of "activity" in fund management.

Most of them are based on the idea that active managers tend to trade more frequently, maintain more

concentrated portfolios with larger bets in certain stocks, and deviate more from common trading patterns.

Accordingly, we consider the following variables to proxy for managerial activity, each variable

reflecting a particular aspect of a fund manager's strategy (see Appendix 4 for the details on the variables'

construction, all fractional variables are expressed in percentage points).16



15
   If the past alpha is x, the gap in promotion probabilities is 0.0053*0.5-0.0096*0.5*x. Setting this expression to 0
and solving for x gives x=0.55.
16
   Most of the variables in this section make use of quarterly portfolio holdings disclosed in CDA filings and
available from Thomson Reuters. We match Morningstar funds to funds in the CRSP Mutual Fund Database by
CUSIP of the share class (this match is nearly 100% accurate as evidenced by similar fund names and a 0.99
correlation between Morningstar and CRSP fund returns) and then match CRSP funds to CDA portfolios. In the
latter step, we use the MF Links files maintained by Russ Wermers but extend the match to 2012 and verify its
quality by visually comparing fund names.



                                                          24
         Turnover is defined as the annualized ratio of the sum of absolute values of dollar changes in

equity positions of the fund over the quarter to the average dollar value of the fund's portfolio (similar to

Gaspar, Massa, and Matos (2005)). The turnover measure captures the fraction of the portfolio that is

"new" relative to the previously reported snapshot of holdings.

         PortfolioConcentration is the Herfindahl measure of the concentration of holdings in the fund's

portfolio at the end of the previous quarter.

         HoldingHorizon measures how many months, on average, the shares present in the fund's

portfolio at the end of the quarter are held in that portfolio. This variable is calculated as in Lan, Moneta,

and Wermers (2015) "FIFO Horizon Measure" and is based on the assumption that shares bought first are

also sold first.

         Herding is computed as the correlation between changes in holdings (as measured by the

percentage change in the number of shares held) of the fund over the quarter and the corresponding

changes in holdings of a hypothetical average fund in the style, whose portfolio position in a given stock

is calculated as the sum of the aggregate positions in the stock of all the funds in the style. By

construction, each herding variable is constrained between -100 and 100 and is higher for funds whose

trades are closer to the style's average in both direction and magnitude.

         Next, we examine how each of these activity variables is related to the manager's family wealth

by running the following regression specification:


  ActivitymjT = βWealthRankm + Γ1×MControlsmT-1 + Γ2×FControlsT-1 + αY + δs + εmjT ,                 (3)

where the right-hand side variables are defined as in equation (1) and the left-hand side variables are our

measures of activity for fund j in quarter T. Table 7 presents the results of the estimation.

         The evidence is directionally consistent across all the activity measures: managers from less

wealthy families tend to be more active, i.e. they have higher turnover and portfolio concentration but

shorter holding horizons and weaker herding tendencies. However, only the turnover coefficient passes

the conventional hurdles of statistical significance. The associated economic effect is also sizable: a



                                                      25
reduction in WealthRank of 0.5 increases the fund's turnover by 5.41% (=-0.5*-10.8176) of the fund's

TNA, or approximately 21% of the unconditional turnover of the median fund in the sample. This result is

consistent with the idea that turnover can be conducive to value as long as the manager has skill (Pastor,

Stambaugh, and Taylor (2015)).

V.B Flow effects

If a manager's family wealth is an observable signal of his quality, how is this signal used by individual

investors, if at all? In our final test we focus on fund flows, computed as the dollar flow (the difference

between the end-of-quarter fund TNA and the previous-quarter fund TNA multiplied by one plus the

gross return of the fund over the quarter) divided by the previous-quarter fund TNA. We regress fund

flows on WealthRank and separately consider specifications which include fund past performance

(average fund alpha over the previous twelve months) as one of the control variables. The results are

reported in Table 8. WealthRank is not significant in any specification even though it has a consistent

negative sign. In contrast, the effect of past performance – the more salient statistic – is positive and

strongly significant. Overall, it appears that most fund investors do not condition their capital allocation

on fund managers' family backgrounds. This result is hardly surprising given that information on

managers' descent is difficult to collect and that mutual fund investors lack skill and resources to perform

such an investigation.




Conclusion

We study the relation between fund managers’ family backgrounds and their professional performance

and find that managers from poor families deliver higher risk-adjusted returns than managers from rich

families. Our evidence suggests that managers endowed with a low economic status at birth face higher

entry barriers into asset management, and only the highest-quality candidates succeed in entering the

profession. This explanation is supported by the evidence on managers’ promotions, which shows that

managers with a low endowed status must deliver higher returns to stand a comparable chance of




                                                    26
promotion with their high-status peers. We also document that, consistent with the selection mechanism,

managers from wealthier backgrounds show a much higher dispersion in their performance than managers

of modest decent.

        We believe our findings have implications that extend beyond asset management. Our evidence

suggests that an individual’s social status at birth may serve as an important signal of quality in other

industries with high barriers to entry, such as corporate management or professional services. We hope

that an increased focus on the role of an agent’s family background will yield valuable insights into

professional decisions of financial intermediaries, corporate managers, and other economic agents.

Appendix 1. Matching of fund managers and identification of their ancestry

1.A Matching of fund managers to the Lexis Nexis Public Records (LNPR) Database

To identify the manager in LNPR, we first establish his full name and age. In our sample, there are no
cases of multiple fund managers with identical full names, regardless of age.
        To establish a manager’s age, we use the annual editions of the Nelson Directory of Investment
Managers, which was first published in print in 1988 and was later followed by electronic versions of the
directory. For a minority of managers, we obtain data on the fund manager’s age from fund registration
filings available from the SEC. For managers who do not appear in these sources (such as those who
finished their careers before 1988), we approximate a manager’s age from the date of college graduation,
which we retrieve from the manager’s biography or obtain by contacting the university registrar.
        Next, obtain the most complete version of the manager’s name, including the full middle name
and name suffixes, such as Jr., Sr., or III. If the manager’s middle name is abbreviated in fund records to a
one-letter initial, we first establish the complete middle name (e.g., the full middle name “Atkinson” that
spells out the middle initial “A”). For the majority of managers, we are able to establish the complete
names and name suffixes by using the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) investment
adviser registration records. These records include both active and inactive investment professionals who
are or were registered as investment advisers and went through the security industry's registration and
licensing process. Because these reports are based on official registration records, they include the most
complete versions of managers’ names. We use the manager’s employment history provided in FINRA
reports to confirm the accuracy of the match.
        Using the manager’s full name and age, we search for that manager nationwide in LNPR. After
we establish a match based on the name and age, we require a confirmation of the match according to one
of the following criteria: (a) the individual’s LNPR employment records include the company where the
fund manager has worked; (b) the individual’s email addresses in LNPR indicate the domain of the
company where the fund manager has worked (e.g., @fidelity.com); (c) the individual lists his occupation
on voter registration records as “portfolio manager”, “investment manager”, or “investment adviser; (d)
the individual’s professional licenses in LNPR include those in the securities industry; (e) one of the
individual’s addresses in LNPR matches the official business address of the fund manager’s company.




                                                     30
1.B Identifying the ancestry of fund managers

We follow a three-step algorithm to identify a manager’s household in the census by sequentially
checking three types of records – birth, marriage, and death – for the manager and his relatives.
        In the first step in this process, we retrieve a manager’s birth record by using his or her name
(including the full middle name), date of birth (year and month, from social security records in LNPR),
and the state issuing the manager’s social security number (from LNPR). Birth records are available from
the health department of each state, and we retrieve them via the database maintained by the genealogy
research service ancestry.com. The exhibit below provides an example of a birth records in our sample.
The amount of detail in each record varies by state: some states provide the full names and birth places of
both parents, others provide these data for only one parent, and still others provide only the date of birth
or place of birth.
        If the full names of the manager’s parents are not available from the birth record, we proceed with
the second step, which investigates the manager’s marriage record(s). This analysis is motivated by the
fact that some marriage records provide the names of the parents of the bride and groom (the format of
the marriage record varies with the state of marriage). The exhibit below illustrates this by showing an
example of a fund manager’s marriage record in our sample. We retrieve the fund manager’s marriage
record from the database of state marriage records maintained by ancestry.com and establish a unique
match by obtaining the full names and birth years of the bride and the groom. We identify the manager’s
spouse, including ex-spouses, from the manager’s home deed records available on LNPR. In the
overwhelming majority of cases, the manager’s home deeds are written to both spouses. For managers
that have had multiple spouses, we check marriage records with all the spouses. If the names of the
manager’s parents do not appear on the marriage record, we search for the announcement of the
manager’s engagement or marriage in the digital newspaper archive provided by the University of
Michigan library, which contains historical copies of over 3,000 publications, including small local
newspapers. Marriage announcements usually identify the parents of the bride and the groom.
        If we are unable to identify the manager’s parents in the first two steps, or if we need to confirm
other members of the household, we proceed with the analysis of death records. Using social security
records, LNPR identifies deceased individuals and shows their date of death. For fund managers that are
deceased at the time of writing, we obtain their obituaries by searching the digital archive of newspaper
publications and the database of obituaries maintained by the service provider legacy.com. These records
provide information on the manager’s parents and siblings (an example is shown in the exhibits below).
For the rest of the managers with missing data, we search for obituaries of their parents, most of whom
are deceased at the time of writing (the median birth year of the managers’ parents is 1908). Because
obituaries typically discuss the surviving members of the family and their spouses, we identify the
managers’ parents by locating the obituaries where the manager and his spouse are listed as the surviving
family members. These searches bring up the obituaries of managers’ parents and siblings and allow us to
reconstruct the entire immediate family of the fund manager.

                           First, for each stock i in fund j's portfolio at the end of quarter T, we

                           (2015). Next, we aggregate these stock-level variables to the fund level as

                           First, we construct a hypothetical style portfolio by aggregating (for each

                           fund j from quarter T-1 to quarter T with the corresponding changes in

Table 1. Summary statistics
This table shows summary statistics (Panel A) and sample composition statistics (Panel B) for the main sample of 267 managers. Data
on managers' careers and education is obtained from Morningstar/FactSet manager biographies and is complemented with university
records. Managers' parents' household data is from the 1940 Census household records. Tract-level demographic variables are
computed from the summary files for the 1940 Census compiled by Elizabeth Bogue. Mutual fund and family characteristics are from
Morningstar. The procedures for the classification of fund managers' scholarly specialization and their parents' employment type are
described in Appendix 3.

Table 2. Relationships among the main variables
Panels A and B of this table show the correlation coefficients among the main variables of interest. Panel A focuses on the demographic characteristics of households and Census
tracts and Panel B focuses on education-related variables. The procedures for the classification of fund managers' scholarly specialization and their parents' employment type are
described in Appendix 3. Panel C shows mean and median values for some variables of interest for each quintile of the managers' parents' household wealth distribution as proxied
by the father's income and home value/rent. Exact variable construction methodologies are detailed in Appendix 4.

Table 3. Family wealth and performance of fund managers
Panel A of this table shows the regressions of the funds' four-factor monthly alphas (Alpha, expressed in pp) on the measures of the
managers' parents' household wealth during the 1940 Census. FatherIncome and HomeValue are expressed in $000. HomeValue and Rent
are defined on the non-overlapping sub-samples. Panel B shows the regressions of Alpha on the percentile rank of wealth (WealthRank) –
defined as the percentile rank of FatherIncome in the sample, if its value is not missing, and the percentile rank of HomeValue or Rent in
the sample, otherwise – and the dummy variables indicating WealthRank quintiles. The percentile ranks are scaled by 0.01 and thus range
from 0 to 1. The control variables capture the manager's characteristics, his parents' education depth and employment type, as well as key
mutual fund and fund family characteristics. All the control variables are taken as of the end of the month before the observation month.
Exact variable definitions are given in Appendix 4. The inclusion of Morningstar style fixed effects and time fixed effects is indicated at
the bottom of the table. T-statistics (reported in parentheses) are based on standard errors clustered at the fund level. * (**, ***) indicates
the significance of the coefficient at the 10% (5%, 1%) level.

Table 4. Family wealth and performance of fund managers, alternative measures
This table shows the regressions of alternative measures of fund performance on the managers' parents' household wealth rank during the
1940 Census (defined as in Table 3). GrossAlpha is computed as the fund's before-fees return minus the return predicted by the four-
factor model, BenchmarkAdjReturn is the fund's return net of the prospectus benchmark index return, AbnReturnOverBenchmark is the
fund's gross return minus the return predicted by the benchmark-based factor model, and ValueExtracted is the dollar measure of value
extracted from capital markets (in $mil) computed as the product between the fund's benchmark-adjusted return and the fund's inflation-
adjusted TNA (expressed in 2012 dollars) from the previous period. The control variables capture the manager's characteristics, his
parents' education depth and employment type, as well as key mutual fund and fund family characteristics. All the control variables are
taken as of the end of the month before the observation month. Exact variable definitions are given in Appendix 4. The inclusion of the
fixed effects is indicated at the bottom of the table. T-statistics (reported in parentheses) are based on standard errors clustered at the fund
level. * (**, ***) indicates the significance of the coefficient at the 10% (5%, 1%) level.

Table 5. Goldfeld-Quandt test for heteroscedasticity due to selection on family wealth
This table shows the Goldfeld-Quandt test for the directional heteroscedasticity induced by WealthRank (defined as in Table 3). The sample of managers is split
into high and low sub-samples of WealthRank for which the (residual) variance of Alpha is compared; for example, in column (2) the middle tercile is dropped
from the analysis. The third row reports the F-statistics for the ratio of variances and the associated p-value in squared brackets.

Table 6. Family wealth and managers' promotion-performance sensitivity
This table shows the linear probability regressions of the manager's promotion dummies on his past performance, his parents' household wealth rank during the
1940 Census (defined as in Table 3), and the interaction between the two. The promotion dummies indicate events when the number of funds the manager was in
charge of increased from the previous month (IncreaseFunds) or the total assets the manager controlled increased by more than twofold from the previous month
(IncreaseAssetsX2). Past performance is defined as the average monthly alpha (expressed in pp) of funds the manager managed over the past three (left pane) or
five (right pane) years. The control variables include the manager's and the firm's characteristics and are taken as of the end of the month before the observation
month. Exact variable definitions are given in Appendix 4. The inclusion of the fixed effects is indicated at the bottom of the table. T-statistics (reported in
parentheses) are based on standard errors clustered at the fund level. * (**, ***) indicates the significance of the coefficient at the 10% (5%, 1%) level.

Table 7. Family wealth and measures of fund management activity
This table shows the tests relating measures of fund management activity to the managers' parents' household wealth rank
during the 1940 Census (defined as in Table 3). The activity measures include the annualized portfolio turnover (Turnover,
expressed in pp), the Herfindahl portfolio concentration measure (PortfolioConcentration, expressed in pp), the average
duration that the shares are held in the fund's portfolio (HoldingHorizon, expressed in months, based on the FIFO assumption
of purchases and sales), and the correlation between the changes in positions of the fund and the changes in positions of the
(hypothetical) average fund in the style (Herding, expressed in pp). The control variables reflect the manager's
characteristics, his parents' education depth and employment type, as well as key mutual fund and fund family characteristics.
All the control variables are taken as of the end of the previous quarter. Exact variable definitions are given in Appendix 4.
The inclusion of the fixed effects is indicated at the bottom of the table. T-statistics (reported in parentheses) are based on
standard errors clustered at the fund level. * (**, ***) indicates the significance of the coefficient at the 10% (5%, 1%) level.

Table 8. Family wealth and fund flows
This table shows the regressions of fund flows on the managers' parents' household wealth rank during 1940 Census
(defined as in Table 3) and the average monthly alpha of the fund over the previous 12 months. Flow is expressed in
pp and is computed as the dollar flow (i.e., the difference between the end-of-quarter fund TNA and the previous-
quarter fund TNA multiplied by one plus the gross return of the fund over the quarter) divided by the previous-
quarter fund TNA. The control variables reflect the manager's characteristics, his parents' education depth and
employment type, as well as key mutual fund and fund family characteristics. All the control variables are taken as
of the end of the previous quarter. Exact variable definitions are given in Appendix 4. The inclusion of the fixed
effects is indicated at the bottom of the table. T-statistics (reported in parentheses) are based on standard errors
clustered at the fund level. * (**, ***) indicates the significance of the coefficient at the 10% (5%, 1%) level.
