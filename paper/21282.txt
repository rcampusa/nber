Core Inflation and Trend Inflation

JEL No. E31

                                                ABSTRACT

An important input to monetary policymaking is estimating the current level of inflation. This paper
examines empirically whether the measurement of trend inflation can be improved by using disaggregated
data on sectoral inflation to construct indexes akin to core inflation, but with time-varying distributed
lags of weights, where the sectoral weight depends on the time-varying volatility and persistence of
the sectoral inflation series, and on the comovement among sectors. The model is estimated using
U.S. data on 17 components of the personal consumption expenditure inflation index. The modeling
framework is a dynamic factor model with time-varying coefficients and stochastic volatility as in
del Negro and Otrok (2008); this is the multivariate extension of the univariate unobserved components-stochastic
volatility model of trend inflation in Stock and Watson (2007). Our main empirical results are (i) the
resulting multivariate estimate of trend inflation is similar to the univariate estimate of trend inflation
computed using core PCE inflation (excluding food and energy) in the first half of the sample, but
introduces food in the second half of the sample: early in the sample, food inflation was noisy and
a poor indicator of trend inflation, but now food inflation is less volatile, more persistent, and a useful
indicator; (ii) the model-based filtering uncertainty about trend inflation is substantially reduced by
using the disaggregated series in a multivariate model, relative to computing the trend using only headline
inflation; (iii) the multivariate trend and the univariate trend constructed using core measures of inflation
forecast average inflation over the 1-3 year horizon more accurately than a variety of other benchmark
inflation measures, although there is considerable sampling uncertainty in these forecast comparisons.

                                               1. Introduction


        A classic yet still-important problem of measuring the rate of price inflation is filtering
out the noise in inflation data to provide an estimate of the “trend” value of inflation. Following
Bryan and Cecchetti (1994), we think of trend inflation as the long-term estimate of the inflation
rate based on data on prices through the present. Having a good estimate of trend inflation is an
important input to monetary policy and to a myriad of private decisions. For example, as this is
written, a pressing question in the United States and the Eurozone is how far trend inflation
actually is below the 2% target. Because there are multiple sources of noise in inflation data and
because the nature of the noise can change over time, the task of estimating trend inflation is
both difficult and of ongoing relevance.
        Producing an accurate estimate of trend inflation requires distinguishing which variations
in inflation are persistent from those that are unlikely to persist into the future. Broadly speaking,
there are two distinct approaches to this signal extraction problem.
        The first approach is to use cross-sectional data on inflation (sectoral-level inflation data),
with a weighting scheme that downweights series with large non-persistent variation. The most
important example of this approach is the standard measure of core inflation, which excludes
food and energy prices (Gordon (1975), Eckstein (1981); see Wynne (2008) for a discussion of
the history of core inflation). Other methods that exploit cross-sectional smoothing include using
trimmed means or medians of sectoral inflation rates, see Bryan and Cecchetti (1994); these
methods impose zero/one weighting on each component, with weights that vary over time.1 For
recent references on core inflation see Crone, Khettry, Mester, and Novak (2013).
        The second common approach to the signal extraction problem is to use univariate time-
series smoothing methods. Simple yet effective smoothers include the IMA(1,1) model of Nelson
and Schwert (1977) and the four-quarter average of quarterly inflation (Atkeson and Ohanian
(2001)). Stock and Watson (2007) and Cogley and Sargent (2015) provide methods that allow

for time-variation in the filter depending on changes in the signal-to-noise ratio via time variation
in the innovation variance of persistent and non-persistent components.
       We follow this literature on core and trend inflation and consider only estimates derived
from the price indexes and corresponding expenditure share weights used in the construction of
the headline inflation series of interest. A vast literature considers the problem of using other
series, such as measures of economic activity, interest rates, and terms of trade to forecast
inflation. At an abstract level, the distinction between using only price data, and price data
combined with other data, can be thought of as measurement vs. forecasting; the focus here is
measurement. At a practical level, at least for the U.S., some forecasting models using non-price
data can improve upon forecasts based solely on prices, but those improvements are small and, in
many cases, ephemeral, which underscores the practical relevance of considering estimates of
trend inflation based on constituent sectoral price data.
       This paper combines the cross-sectional and time-series smoothing approaches to
examine four questions about the measurement of trend inflation and its relation to core inflation.
First, can more precise measures of trend inflation be obtained using disaggregated sectoral
inflation measures, relative to time series smoothing of headline inflation? Second, if there are
improvements to be had by using sectoral inflation measures, do the implied sectoral weights
evolve over time or are they stable, and how do they compare to the corresponding sectoral
shares in consumption? Third, how do the implied time-varying weights and the resulting
multivariate estimate of trend inflation compare to conventional core inflation measures? And
fourth, do these trend inflation measures improve upon conventional core inflation when it
comes to forecasting inflation over the one through three year horizon?
       We investigate these questions empirically using a univariate and multivariate
unobserved-components stochastic volatility outlier-adjusted (UCSVO) model that allows for
common persistent and transitory factors, time-variation in the factor loadings, and stochastic
volatility of the common and sectoral components. The time-varying factor loadings allow for
changes in the comovements across sectors, such as the reduction in energy price pass-through
into core. Introducing separate sectoral and common stochastic volatility in transitory and
permanent innovations allows for changes in the persistence of sectoral inflation innovations and
for sector-specific changes in volatility. One source of the changing volatility in the component
inflation rates is changes in the methods and/or underlying data sources used to construct the

                                                  3
historical series. A strength of the method implemented here is that the resulting estimates of
historical trends adjust for changes in measurement methods as well as for fundamental changes
in the volatility and persistence of the component series.
       At a technical level, the model closest to that used here is del Negro and Otrok (2008),
which has time-varying factor loadings and stochastic volatility (their application is to
international business cycles, not inflation). Our model has some technical differences to fit our
application to U.S. sectoral data, including distinct sectoral trends, a common trend, and model-
based detection of and adjustment for outliers.
       The data we use are 17 sectors comprising the personal consumption expenditure (PCE)
price index for the United States, 1959Q1-2014Q4. Our main findings are: (i) the multivariate
trend estimates are substantially more precise than the univariate estimates: the model-based
estimate of the root mean squared error of the smoothed multivariate estimate of the latent trend
is roughly half that of the univariate trend estimate based solely on headline inflation; (ii)
although the implied weights in the multivariate trend on most sectoral components are close to
their share weights, the implied weight on some series varies substantially as the series drops out
of or enters the multivariate trend; (iii) broadly speaking, the multivariate trend estimate is a
temporally smoothed version of core (ex food & energy) through the 1970s, but starting in the
1980s places more weight on food (both off-premises and food services & accommodation) and
less weight on financial services, so that the composition of multivariate trend in the 2000s is
roughly similar to PCE ex energy; and (iv) viewed as forecasts, the multivariate and univariate
trend estimates improve upon headline inflation alone, but (consistent with other research)
neither the multivariate trend estimates nor the univariate trend in core or PCE ex energy make
statistically significant forecasts improvements over the univariate trend estimate based on
headline inflation.
       In addition to the literatures discussed above on core and trend inflation, this work is
related to three other large literatures. First, our modeling framework extends work estimating
common factors of multiple inflation series, including Cristadoro, Forni, Reichlin, and Veronese
(2005), Amstad and Simon M. Potter (2007), Altissimo, Mojon, and Zaffaroni (2009), Boivin,
Giannoni, and Mihov (2009), Reis and Watson (2010), and Sbrana, Silvestrini, and Venditti
(2015). Mumtaz and Surico (2012) introduce stochastic volatility and time-varying factor
dynamics into a model of 13 international inflation rates. Second, the issues of including or

                                                  4
excluding energy inflation is related to the literature on changes in the pass-through of energy
prices to headline or core inflation (something allowed for in our model); see Hooker (2002), De
Gregorio, Landerretche, and Neilson (2007), van den Noord and André (2007), Chen (2009),
Blanchard and Galı (2010), Clark and Terry (2010), and Baumeister and Peersman (2013). Also
related is work that uses series other than price series to measure trend inflation, e.g. Mertens
(2012), Garnier, Mertens, and Nelson (2013), and Mertens and Nason (2015).
       The next section presents the univariate and multivariate UCSVO models and discusses
their estimation. Section 3 provides the resulting univariate trend estimates for headline, core,
and PCE ex energy. Section 4 presents multivariate results, first for the 17-sector model then for
a model with only three components: core, food, and energy. Section 5 compares the forecasting
performance of the various trend estimates over the 1-3 year horizon, and Section 6 concludes.


 2. The Unobserved Components Model with Stochastic Volatility, Common Factors, and
                                             Outlier Adjustment


       The univariate UCSVO model. The univariate unobserved components/stochastic
volatility outlier-adjustment (UCSVO) model used in this paper expresses the rate of inflation as
the sum of a permanent and transitory component, where the innovations to both components
have variances that evolve over time according to independent stochastic volatility processes,
and where the innovation to the temporary component can have heavy tails (outliers):


                    πt = τt + εt                                                                    (1)
                    τt = τt-1 + σ∆τ,t × ητ,t                                                        (2)
                    εt = σε,t × st × ηε,t.                                                          (3)
                    ∆ln( σ ε2,t ) = γενε,t                                                          (4)

                    ∆ln( σ ∆2τ ,t ) = γ∆τν∆τ,t                                                      (5)


where (ηε, ητ, νε, ν∆τ) are iidN(0, I4), and where st is an i.i.d. multinomial variable.
       This model expresses the rate of inflation πt as the sum of a permanent component τt
(trend) and a transitory component εt (1), in which τt follows a martingale (2) and the transitory


                                                     5
component is serially uncorrelated (3), and in which both innovations follow a logarithmic
random walk stochastic volatility process (4) and (5). Conditional on the stochastic volatility
process, the transitory innovation εt is modeled in (3) as a mixture of normal via the i.i.d.
multinomial variable st, which is set a-priori to take on the values 1, 5, and 10 with probabilities
.975, 1/60, and 1/120. This mixture model allows for outliers in the rate of inflation, which
correspond to large one-time shifts in the price level.
         The UCSVO model (1) - (5) has only two parameters, γε and γ∆τ, which govern the scale
of the innovation in the stochastic volatility process. At a given point in time, the autocovariance
structure of πt is that of a IMA(1,1) process, however the mixture-of-normals distribution of the
transitory innovation means that the filtered estimate of πt is not always well approximated by a
local IMA(1,1) filter.
         This difference between (1) - (5) and the Stock-Watson (2007) UCSV model is that the
USCVO model includes an explicit model-based treatment of outliers. As will be seen below,
large one-time spikes in inflation are observed in the data, especially in the sectoral components.2
Stock and Watson (2007) made preliminary judgmental adjustments for outliers prior to model
estimation, however that approach is not feasible for real-time trend estimation because it
requires knowing ex post whether a large change will mean-revert. Ignoring outliers is not
appealing because doing so runs the risk of mistaking a single large outlier for a more systematic
increase in the volatility of the transitory component. Because we are interested in real-time
trend estimation, (3) therefore extends the Stock-Watson (2007) model to make outlier
adjustments part of the model by modeling the transitory innovation as a mixture-of-normals.
         The multivariate UCSVO model. This multivariate UCSVO (MUCSVO) model extends
the UCSVO model to include a common latent factor in both the trend and idiosyncratic
components of inflation, where the factor loadings are also time-varying. Let the subscripts c
denote the common latent factor and i denote the sector. The multivariate model is the del Negro
and Otrok (2008) dynamic factor model with time-varying factor loadings and stochastic
volatility, extended to have permanent and transitory components and extended to handle outliers
in the transitory disturbance.

 An example of such a sectoral outlier is the April 2009 increase in the Federal cigarette tax, which resulted in a
22% increase in cigarette prices that month. This tax increase drove a one-time jump in the rate of PCE inflation for
other nondurable goods (the category that contains tobacco) in 2009Q2 of 10.4% at an annual rate, well above the
2.7% average rate of inflation for that category in 2008 and 2009 excluding that quarter.

         The multivariate UCSV model is,


                  πi,t = αi,τ,t τc,t + αi,ε,t εc,t + τi,t + εi,t,                                                          (6)
                  τc,t = τc,t-1 + σ∆τ,c,t × ητ,c,t                                                                         (7)
                  εc,t = σε,c,t × sc,t × ηε,c,t                                                                            (8)
                  τi,t = τi,t-1 + σ∆τ,i,t × ητ,i,t                                                                         (9)
                  εi,t = σε,i,t × si,t × ηε,i,t                                                                           (10)
                  αi,τ,t = α i,τ, t-1 + λi,τζ i,τ,t and αi,ε,t = α i,ε,t-1 + λi,εζ i,εt                                   (11)
                  ∆ln( σ ∆2τ ,c ,t ) = γ∆τ,cν∆τ,c,t, ∆ln( σ ε2,c ,t ) = γε,cνε,c,t, ∆ln( σ ∆2τ ,i ,t ) = γ∆τ,iνi,t, and

                               ∆ln( σ ε2,i ,t ) = γε,iνi,t,                                                               (12)


where the disturbances (εc,t, εi,t, ηc,t, ηi,t, ζc,t, ζi,t,ν∆τ,c,t,νε,c,t,ν∆τ,i,t,νε,i,t) are i.i.d. standard normal.
Following Del Negro and Otrok (2008), we adopt an inverse Gamma prior for λ. In addition, the
prior for the initial values ατ,c,0 or αε,c,0 is α ~ N(0, κ 12 ll’ + κ 22 In) where l is an n × 1 vector of

1’s, so that κ1 governs the prior uncertainty about the average value of factor loadings, and κ2
governs the variability of each factor loading from the average value.
         Equation (6) represents sector i inflation as the sum of a latent common factor for trend
inflation is τc,t, a latent common transient component εc,t, and sector-specific trends and transient
components, where the factor loadings evolve according to a random walk (11). Equations (7) -
(10) allow for stochastic volatility in the latent common and sector-specific components, where
the stochastic volatility evolves according to a logarithmic random walk (12). Like the univariate
model, the multivariate model allows for outliers in the common and sectoral transitory
components through the independent multinomial variables sc,t and si,t in (8) and (10), where the
st variables take on 1, 5, 10 with probability .975, 1/60, and 1/120.
         The trend sectoral inflation is the sum of the contribution of the common latent factor to
that sector and the sectoral trend, that is, the sectoral trend is αi,τ,tτc,t + τi,t. The aggregate trend
inflation is the sum of the sectoral trend, weighted by the share weight wit of sector i in total
inflation:




                                                                 7
                                                17
                   Aggregate trend = τt =   ∑   i =1
                                                       wit (αi ,τ ,tτ c ,t + τ i ,t ) .              (13)


       The definition (13) of the aggregate trend τt nests a range of possibilities, from the
common trend providing all the trend movements in sectoral inflation (so that there are n-1
cointegrating vectors among the n sectors) to all sectoral inflation being independent with no
cointegration. In this latter case, the common trend in aggregate inflation would just be the sum
of the idiosyncratic trends, weighted by the sectoral share weights.
       Estimation. Estimation of the univariate and multivariate models proceeds using Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The parameters γε and γ∆τ (univariate model) and γi
(multivariate model) have an independent U(0,.5) prior. The initial value for the trend has a
diffuse prior in the univariate model as do the initial values for the idiosyncratic trends in the
multivariate model. The initial value of the common trend is set to zero in the multivariate
model. The parameters for the prior on ατ,c,0 or αε,c,0 in the multivariate model are κ1 = 10 and κ2
= 0.4. The stochastic volatility is handled following Kim, Shephard, and Chib (1998), modified
to use the Omori, Chib, Shephard, and Nakajima (2007) 10-component Gaussian mixture
approximation for the log-chi squared error. The MCMC iterations in Stock and Watson (2007)
have been corrected for an error pointed out by Del Negro and Primiceri (2014) that applies
generally to models with stochastic volatility.
       Throughout this paper, we refer to the smoothed estimate of an unobserved component at
date t to be the posterior mean of the component, given the full data set. The filtered estimate of
an unobserved component at date t is the conditional mean given only the data through date t,
except that the parameters are evaluated using their posterior mean given the full data set. Thus
the same posterior distribution of the parameters is used in the filtered and smoothed estimates, a
treatment that parallels the standard frequentist approach in which the one-sided filtered and two-
sided smoothed estimates are evaluated at the full-sample parameter estimates.


                                  3. Data and Univariate Results


       The data. The full data set consists of quarterly data from 1959Q1-2015Q1 on 17
components of inflation used to construct the PCE price index. The lowest-level components in
NIPA Table 2.3.4 consist of 16 components (4 durable goods sectors, 4 nondurable good sectors,
                                                         8
and 8 service sectors). Core PCE excludes two of these 16 components (food for off-premises
consumption and gasoline & energy goods), and additionally excludes energy & gas utilities.
Because energy & gas utilities does not appear separately in Table 2.3.4, but rather is contained
in housing & utilities, core PCE cannot be constructed directly from these 16 components. So
that our 17-sector treatment nests core, we further disaggregate housing & utilities into gas &
electric utilities and housing excluding gas & electric utilities, for a total of 17 sectoral
components. Expenditure share weights for these components can be computed using the
nominal PCE values in NIPA table 2.3.5. These components and their expenditure share weights
for selected periods are given in Table 1.
        In addition, we consider three aggregate indexes: the headline (all-components) PCE
price index (PCE-all), the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s PCE price index excluding energy
(PCExE), and the BEA core PCE price index excluding food and energy (PCExFE).
        The data are all final estimates of these series. Some of the component series have
undergone significant methodological changes over the years and have been subject to major
historical revisions. For example, in 2013 the price index for financial services was revised,
including changing the method for measuring implicitly priced services produced by commercial
banks (Hood (2013)). Prior to the revision, the category “financial services furnished without
payment” (e.g. checks processed without fees) used imputed prices based on market interest
rates, so those prices fluctuated substantially during periods of interest rate volatility. The 2013
revision changed the method for computing the reference interest rate for unpriced financial
services, reducing the volatility of this component. Because this revision was implemented
retroactively only to 1985, different methods are used to compute this component of the financial
services price index pre-1985 and post-1985.
        As another example, in the 2009 revision, the category of food and tobacco (which until
then had been excluded from core) was distributed across three categories: food & beverages
purchased for off-premise consumption, other non-durable goods (which since 2009 includes
tobacco), and food services & accommodations; only the first of these is now excluded from core
PCE. Because the fully revised series reflect this change, it does not cause a break in the data

somewhat different concept than the current definition of core. Changing definitions and

measurement methods combined with partial historical adjustment are commonplace, and we
return to the implications of these methodological changes below.
        Univariate results for PCE-all, PCExE, and PCExFE. Figure 1 shows PCE-all
inflation, its smoothed estimate from the UCSVO model and the smoothed trend estimate from
the Stock-Watson (2007) UCSV model (no judgmental or model-based outlier adjustment). As
can be seen in the figure, both estimates of trend inflation are considerably less volatile post-
1990 than during the 1970s. Mechanically, this arises because the variance of the trend
innovation of inflation fell, relative to the variance of the idiosyncratic innovation, starting in the
early 1980s through the 1990s. These univariate results extend and are consistent with those in
Stock and Watson (2007).
        Comparison of the trend estimates with and without the outlier adjustment shows some
notable differences. The outlier adjustment treats three events as outliers, the sharp one-quarter
drops in headline inflation in 1986Q2, 2006Q4, 2008Q4. Each of these outliers was associated
with sharp falls in oil prices, so that in effect the outlier adjustment is trimming out large oil
price changes. In each of these quarters, the UCSV trend places some probability on this event
being a permanent not transitory innovation in inflation, so the trend adjusts downward then
reverts, whereas the UCSVO trend treats these large movements as entirely transitory and does
not adjust.
        Given the relatively smooth UCSVO trend in Figure 1, a logical question is whether the
errors associated with the estimation of the trend are small enough to be ignored for purposes of
forecasting. Because we never observe the trend, this question cannot be answered just based on
data, however it can be answered within the context of the model. Within the model, forecast
errors are the sum of three uncorrelated parts: (i) filtering error in estimation of the trend, (ii)
evolution of the (true unobserved) trend over the forecast horizon, and (iii) unanticipated
transitory disturbances. Based on the UCSVO model estimates using PCE-all, during the 1970s
the filtering error was relatively unimportant, accounting for less than 15% of the 8 quarter ahead
forecast error variance. In contrast, with inflation more stable during the 1990s and 2000s,
roughly 35% of the 8-quarter ahead forecast error variance arises from filtering error. These
estimates suggest that reducing the filtering error has the potential to make trend estimates more
precise and, possibly, to improve mid-term forecasts.

       Figure 2 compares the smoothed USCVO trend for PCE-all with PCExFE, PCExE, and
the UCSVO smoothed trends for the xFE and xE measures. The PCE-all trend measure is often
close to the xFE and xE trend measures, with notable exceptions during periods of persistent
energy swings (the late 1970s and 2006-2010). Of the three inflation series, the model detects
(and ignores) outliers only for PCE-all.
       Figure 3 shows the smoothed estimates of the stochastic volatility of the permanent and
transitory components from the UCSVO model for PCE-all, PCExFE, and PCExE. The time path
of the volatility of the permanent component is similar for all three series. The main differences
between the three filters arise in the volatility of the transitory innovation (Figure 3(b)) and in the
treatment of outliers (the model detects outliers only for PCE-all; Figure 3(c)). For all three
series, the ratio of the transitory to permanent variance is greater post-1990 than during the
1970s, implying more time series smoothing for the estimate of trend inflation post-1990 than in
the 1970s.


                                      4. Multivariate Results


       17-sector model. Figure 4 shows the multivariate and univariate UCSVO smoothed
estimates of trend inflation based on all 17 sectors, along with PCExE and PCExFE. The
multivariate trend estimate diverges from the univariate trend at a number of dates. Broadly
speaking, the multivariate trend looks more like a time-averaged version of the two core
measures than like the univariate trend in PCE. The divergence between the univariate PCE-all
trend and the multivariate trend is largest in the mid-1970s, the early 1980s, in the 2000s, and in
the final quarters of the data set. Figure 4b focuses on the trends since 2000. During 2001-2007,
the multivariate trend tracks PCExE and PCExFE, while in contrast the univariate PCE-all trend
tracks PCE-all; because of rising energy prices over this period, the univariate PCE trend is
approximately 0.3-0.5 percentage point higher than the multivariate trend. During 2009-10, the
univariate trend remains above both core and the multivariate trend, mechanically because the
univariate trend excludes the large negative spike in inflation in 2008Q4. During 2014Q3-
2015Q1, the univariate trend does not treat the large prolonged decline in energy prices (led by
the fall in oil prices from July 2014 to February 2015) as an outlier or noise but rather as being
persistent, so the univariate trend tracks downward and in fact estimates negative trend inflation

                                                  11
in 2015Q1. In contrast, the multivariate trend falls, along with PCExE and PCExFE, but by a
modest amount.
The similarities between the multivariate trend, PCExE, and PCExFE in Figure 4 raise the
question of whether the multivariate trend is in effect a temporally smoothed version of core
inflation and, more generally, what are the time-varying weights implicitly used in the
multivariate trend. At any given point in time, the filtered multivariate trend is a nonlinear
function of current and past values of the 17 sectoral inflation rates. Because of the time-varying
parameters in the MUCSVO model, these weights evolve over time, and they involve lags
because of the time series smoothing implied by the model. The function of current and past
values is also nonlinear because of the outlier variable. For these reasons, an exact representation
in terms of a time-varying linear weighted average is not feasible. Nevertheless, useful insights
into the cross-sectional smoothing can be obtained by looking at approximate time-varying
weights. Specifically, at a given date, a linear approximation to the filtered index can be
computed using a Kalman filter based on (6) – (10), holding fixed the values of the time-varying
factor loadings and volatilities (αc,t, αi,t, ∆ln( σ ∆2τ ,c ,t ), ∆ln( σ ε2,c ,t ). ∆ln( σ ∆2τ ,i ,t ), and ∆ln( σ ε2,i ,t )) at

their full-sample posterior mean values at that date.
          Figure 5 plots the approximate linear weights on the 17 components implicit in the
filtered multivariate estimate of the trend, specifically, the sum of the weights on the current and
first three lagged values of the component inflation series. Comparing the approximate
MUCSVO weight to the expenditure share shows whether, at a given date, the sector is getting
more or less weight in the MUSCVO trend than it does in PCE-all.
          As can be seen in Figure 5, roughly half of the 17 components receive weight similar to
their expenditure shares. The fact that so many of these weights track expenditure shares is by
itself interesting, since the expenditure shares are not used in the MUCSVO model (expenditure
shares are used in (13) to construct the overall trend estimates based on the 17 filtered individual
trends and the filtered common trend, but not in the calculation of those filtered individual and
common trends). Components with weights that track expenditure shares include motor vehicles
& parts, recreational goods & vehicles, other durable goods, other nondurable goods, housing
excluding gas & electric utilities, health care, transportation services, NPISHs, and other
services.



                                                                12
       Other series have large swings in their weights. The weight on food & beverages for off-
premises consumption (“food at home”) increases substantially and, since the mid-1990s,
essentially equals its expenditure share, and the weight on food services & accommodations rises
from its share in the mid-1970s to nearly double its share since the mid-1980s. Relative to their
expenditure shares, the weights fell on financial services & insurance (since the late 1970s), on
clothing and footwear (since the early 1980s), on furnishings & durable household equipment
(since the mid-1980s), and on recreation services (since the mid-1980s). Except during the
1960s, gasoline & energy goods (“energy products”) receives essentially zero weight.
       Figure 6 shows these sectoral weights aggregated to core, food, and energy, where food is
food for off-premises consumption, energy is gasoline & other energy goods and gas & electric
utilities, and core consists of the remaining 14 sectors. As can be seen from these weights, the
multivariate trend estimate evolves from having nearly all its weight on the core sectors to
placing increasing weight on food around 1990.
       To better understand the reasons for these time-varying weights, we now take a closer
look at three of the components, which are plotted in Figures 7-9. The first (Figure 7) is food
services & accommodations, which tracks PCE-all inflation for the full sample, in many periods
with less volatility than PCE inflation. For this series, the factor loading coefficients (panels (b)
and (c) are fairly stable, and the factor loading coefficient on the common trend has a confidence
band that excludes zero for the full sample. The variance of the transitory innovation is greater in
the 1970s than in the 1990s, consistent with the estimated trend for this series having more time
series smoothing in the second half of the sample than the first. Because this series stably tracks
PCE inflation for the full sample period, with less short-run volatility than PCE inflation, it is not
surprising that this component receives considerable weight (roughly twice its expenditure share)
over the full sample in the MUCSVO trend estimate.
       Figure 8 shows the same set of graphs as Figure 7, but for food & beverages for off-
premises consumption. This series is very noisy early in the sample but less so later in the
sample, and these changes in its short-run volatility are associated with a sharp decrease in the
variance of the idiosyncratic transitory innovation. The loading on the common trend increases
over the sample period. Accordingly, this series receives very little weight in the MUCSVO
trend pre-1980, however as the volatility of the series subsides in the 1980s and then further in
the 1990s, the weight on this series rises to its expenditure share.

                                                  13
       The final series (Figure 9) is furnishing & durable household equipment, which smoothly
tracks PCE inflation early in the sample but diverges and exhibits volatility since the mid-1990s.
Its loading on the common trend falls in the 1980s and the variance of its idiosyncratic transitory
component rises in the late 1980s. While this component receives considerable weight – more
than twice its expenditure share – in the MUCSVO trend through the early 1980s, its weight
drops to its expenditure share since 1900.
       Three-sector model. The results for the 17-setor model raise the question of whether
similar results can be obtained using a simpler 3-sector model consisting of core (PCExFE),
energy (the two components excluded from core, combined with their share weights), and food
(off-premises). We therefore estimated this 3-component model using the multivariate model of
Section 2.
       Figure 10 compares the resulting filtered and smoothed 3-sector estimated multivariate
trend to the 17-sector estimated multivariate trend. While not identical, the two estimated trends
are clearly very similar. A recent episode in which these trends diverge somewhat is 2008, when
the three-sector trend was somewhat higher than the 17-sector trend. During most of the 1990s
and since 2011 the differences between the two multivariate trends is quite small, typically less
than 0.1 percentage point (although the gap is larger in 2015Q1).
       Root Mean Square Estimation Error. One of the motivating questions of this work is
whether using sectoral information can improve the precision of the estimator of the trend in
headline inflation. Because trend inflation is never observed, the precision of the various
estimators cannot be computed directly from the data. We therefore use the 17-variable model to
estimate the precision of different estimators of trend inflation. As analogy, were the model
linear and time-invariant, the Kalman filter could be used to estimate the variance of the
conditional mean of trend inflation given all 17 series or a weighted average of the series such as
core. Similarly, the 17-sector model can be used to compute the variance of various estimators of
the trend, including the univariate trends of Section 3 and contemporaneous values of inflation
(PCE, PCExE, or PCExFE). We compute these RMSEs using the full-sample posterior means so
these RMSEs focus on the different amounts of information used to estimate the trends, given the
parameters.
       Table 2 summarizes these model-based estimated root mean squared errors (RMSE) for
the multivariate and univariate trend estimators, for contemporaneous inflation as a measure of

                                                14
the trend, and for four-quarter averages of inflation as measures of the trend. The table has four
noteworthy features. First, smoothing over time improves the estimates of PCE inflation, either
by four-quarter averaging or, for additional improvements, using the univariate trend estimate.
The gains from temporal smoothing are large, reducing the RMSE by 30% for PCE-all over the
full sample. Second, further reductions in the RMSE are obtained by cross-sectional smoothing,
either using 3 variables or, better, all 17 variables. Together, time-series and cross-sectional
smoothing reduces the RMSE for PCE-all by nearly two-thirds, relative to using
contemporaneous measure of inflation. In a practical sense, this reduction is very large, from a
RMSE of 1 percentage point for PCE to only 0.31 percentage point post-1990 for the 17-variable
trend. Third, the multivariate trend estimate is substantially more precise post-1990 than before.
Fourth, if the aim is to estimate the trend in PCExE or PCExFE, while there are meaningful gains
to time-series smoothing, the gains from cross-sectional smoothing are small, especially in the
post-1990 period.
       The improved precision using the multivariate model corresponds to tighter posterior
coverage regions for the multivariate trend estimates, compared to univariate estimates, at a
given date. These tighter bands are illustrated in Table 3 for trend inflation estimates at selected
dates of interest, including the drop in energy prices and negative PCE inflation during 2008Q4
and 2009Q1, and the period of falling energy prices in 2014Q3-2015Q1. In both cases, the
multivariate estimate differs substantially from the univariate trend estimate of PCE and has a
much tighter coverage interval. Also in both cases, both the point estimates and 67% intervals
are similar for the multivariate and for the univariate PCExE and PCExFE trends, except for
temporary deviations during 2008Q3-2008Q4.


                                   5. Forecasting performance


       The definition of trend inflation as the forecast of inflation over the long run suggests
using forecasting performance to evaluate candidate estimates of trend empirically. Following
much of the literature on inflation forecasting using core inflation, we focus on forecasts at the 1-
3 year horizon.




                                                 15
         Figure 11 summarizes the rolling forecasting performance of the filtered univariate and
multivariate trend measures, compared with core PCE and PCE ex energy.3 The rolling RMSEs
of the different forecasts are typically quite close, but differences emerge in a few episodes.
During the 1970s, the multivariate trend estimate behaved like core inflation, and as a forecast
core inflation was outperformed by PCE ex energy and by the univariate trend. In contrast,
during the 1980s, the multivariate trend has the lowest RMSE. During the 2000s, typically the
worst performance comes from the UCSV univariate trend estimate, with the univariate core
trend estimate having the best performance at the end of the sample.
         Table 4 compares the mean squared forecast errors (MSFEs) over 1990Q1-2015Q1 using
the multivariate (17- and 3-variable model) trend inflation estimates, the three univariate trend
inflation estimates, and the six benchmark inflation forecasts in Table 2: random walk models
using (separately) lagged PCE-all, lagged PCExE, and lagged PCExFE, and the Atkeson-
Ohanian (2001) four-quarter random walk model computed using (separately) PCE-all, PCExE,
and PCExFE. Results are shown forecasts of average inflation over the 4, 8, and 12-quarter
horizons. The table reports mean square forecast errors (MSFE) and the difference between
MSFE for each of the forecasts and the 17-variable model. Heteroskedasticity- and
autocorrelation-robust standard errors are given in parentheses. Panel (a) shows results for the
entire sample period; panel (b) excludes the large forecast errors for 2008Q4 and 2009Q1
associated with collapse in oil prices.
         Three main conclusions emerge from Table 4. First, for many of the forecasts the MSFE
over the entire sample period is nearly twice as large as the MSFE for the sample that excludes
the two quarters 2008Q4 and 2009Q1. The quarters dominate the full-sample MSFE and result
in large standard errors for the estimates. Second, now concentrating on panel (b) which
excludes these two quarters, the multivariate trend forecasts (both 3- and 17-variable) improve
upon simply using lagged inflation (the random walk model), using core inflation, and using
four-quarter averages of inflation. Third, the univariate trend for PCExFE provides the lowest
MSFE forecast at the 8- and 12-quarter horizon, whether or not 2008Q4-2009Q1 is excluded,
and the forecasts based on the univariate trend in PCExE are nearly as good as those based on
PCExFE. Fourth, among those inflation forecasts that perform relatively well, the small

3
 As discussed above, although the filters are one-sided the parameter paths are not (they are evaluated using the
full-sample posterior), so this exercise is not a pseudo out-of-sample forecast comparison in the usual sense.


                                                         16
differences in RMSEs among those forecasts are not statistically significant. In particular, from
the perspective of statistical significance, over the post-1990 period only the random walk
forecast performs worse than than the 17-variable model at standard significance levels. This
finding is consistent with Crone, Khettry, Mester, and Novak (2013), who find no statistically
significant improvements in forecasts made using core inflation.


                                  6. Discussion and Conclusions


       The results in Section 4 found that the multivariate estimates of trend inflation
substantially enhanced the precision of trend estimates of PCE inflation, both through time-series
and cross-sectional smoothing. But in Section 5, while these improvements in the precision of
the estimates of trend inflation resulted in lower mean squared forecast errors, those forecasting
improvements are not statistically significant. There are at least two explanations that could
reconcile these seemingly conflicting results. First, the improvements in the precision of the
trend estimates, while economically meaningful, are relatively small compared to the forecast
errors made by any of the inflation forecasts. Thus the improvements in the precision of the trend
estimates might simply be too small to result in statistically significant forecast improvements,
given the large forecast errors of all inflation forecasts. Second, because the precision of the
various trend estimates was estimated using the 17-sector model, if the model is misspecified
those improvements in precision could be overestimated in the first place. These explanations are
not mutually exclusive and while both contain elements of plausibility, neither is entirely
satisfactory. For example, the ordering across trend estimates of trend precision differs from the
ordering of forecast improvement, raising some questions about the first explanation. But
because the same model was used to estimate the precisions of the various trend estimates, model
misspecification would need to affect the respective precision estimates differently. While
recognizing the limitations of the model-based precision estimates, our interpretation of these
results is that the multivariate trend estimates improve precision, but not by enough to make a
statistically significant difference in forecasting. Given the widely recognized difficulty of
forecasting inflation, this is perhaps not surprising.
       These results also lead to two other high-level conclusions. The first is that the reduced
volatility of food prices, relative to before the mid-1980s, led the multivariate model to include

                                                  17
food in the trend estimate post-1990, with a weight close to its expenditure share. This finding
suggests paying more attention to PCExE than to PCExFE. Second, the multivariate model has
the advantage of producing measures of precision of trend estimates (posterior coverage
regions). Currently, the width of these 67% regions is approximately 0.6 percentage point using
the 17-variable trend estimate. We see merit to reporting these estimates of the precision of trend
inflation along with estimates of that trend.
