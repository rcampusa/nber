                                          ABSTRACT

Concerns about the impact on large-scale earth systems have taken center stage in the scientific
and economic analysis of climate change. The present study analyzes the economic impact of a
potential disintegration of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS). The method is to combine a small
geophysical model of the GIS with the DICE integrated assessment model. The result shows that
the GIS is likely to disappear over the next millennium or so without climate policy, but an active
climate policy may prevent the GIS from crossing the threshold of irreversibility. Additionally,
the study estimates the impact of the GIS on the social cost of carbon (SCC) and finds that adding
GIS dynamics would add less than 5%to the SCC under alternative discount rates and estimates
of the GIS dynamics. Simulations of geo-engineering options indicate that the dynamics of
disintegration and rebuilding are extremely asymmetric, implying that GIS disintegration should
be treated as irreversible.

              Concerns about the impact on large-scale earth systems have taken
       center stage in the scientific and economic analysis of climate change. The
       present study analyzes the economic impact of a potential disintegration
       of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS). The method is to combine a small
       geophysical model of the GIS with the DICE integrated assessment model.
       The result shows that the GIS is likely to disappear over the next
       millennium or so without climate policy, but an active climate policy may
       prevent the GIS from crossing the threshold of irreversibility.
       Additionally, the study estimates the impact of the GIS on the social cost
       of carbon (SCC) and finds that adding GIS dynamics would add less than
       5% to the SCC under alternative discount rates and estimates of the GIS
       dynamics. Simulations of geo-engineering options indicate that the
       dynamics of disintegration and rebuilding are extremely asymmetric,
       implying that GIS disintegration should be treated as irreversible.


I.     Overview and Summary
       The future of the mammoth Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) is one of the largest
and most complicated issues facing environmental policy in the coming years.
Complete disintegration of the GIS would raise the level of the oceans by more
than 7 meters, inundating many of the world’s major human settlements.
Paleoclimatic findings, as well as ice-sheet modeling, indicate that the current
trajectory of global temperatures would lead to nearly complete disintegration
over the coming millennia. The critical questions are, how fast will the ice sheet

decline, and what can be done to stop the disintegration and resulting
inundation?

       The present study examines economic aspects of the disintegration of the
GIS by incorporating a small reduced-form model of the GIS into the DICE
model of the economics of climate change. Studies find that a rise in
temperature a few degrees above the current levels will lead to a nearly total ice-
sheet loss. However, the warming at which the ice sheet will disappear is poorly
understood and ranges from 1½ to 4 °C above twentieth-century levels. It is
unclear whether there is a single set or multiple sets of equilibria of temperature
and GIS volume, but the best modeling evidence suggests multiple equilibria
with hysteresis.

       An additional factor is the dynamics of disintegration and rebuilding
between equilibria. Modeling studies indicate that the path of melting is slow,
with the central estimate being that, at a 6 °C global warming, the GIS would
lose 10% of its volume in four to five centuries. The exact dynamics vary widely
among alternative models.

       The current study develops a model of GIS equilibrium and dynamics
that is based on current studies but sufficiently small to integrate fully into an
economic model. The result is the DICE-GIS model, which includes the standard
components of the DICE-2016R2 integrated assessment model. Based on this
augmented model, the study then examines baseline and optimal climate
policies along with different constraints, parameters, and discount rates.

        Here are the major results of the study. First, the study finds that a
“baseline” path of no climate policy will lead to the gradual disintegration of the
GIS over the coming millennium. The ice-sheet decline is slow, with a GIS half-
life of approximately eight centuries in the baseline path, but once past the
tipping points, disintegration is difficult to reverse.

       Second, strong climate policy can stop the GIS decline well short of
complete disintegration or critical tipping points. Full-scale ice-sheet models
have different predictions about hysteresis and reversibility. However, most
would agree that, if temperature peaks at 2 to 3 °C and then declines relatively
soon, the ice sheet will stabilize at somewhere between 70% and 95% of current
volume.

       Third, it is useful to consider the impact of the GIS on climate policy
either through including a damage coefficient or through putting a volumetric
limit on the decline of the GIS. These give roughly the same answers for the
social cost of carbon at moderate discount rates and standard melt rates and
differ significantly only at tight volumetric constraints and high melt rates.


                                                                                   2
       Fourth, a useful way of understanding the impact of GIS disintegration on
climate policy is to estimate how much adding GIS damages or volumetric
constraints changes the social cost of carbon (SCC). The addition is near zero at
moderate discount rates and as high as 5% of the total SCC at very low discount
rates and high melt rates. At the discount rate used by the US government, the
addition of GIS damages to the SCC is essentially zero.

      Fifth, the study considers four alternative approaches to dynamics: linear,
non-linear monotonic, irreversible, and hysteretic. The basic finding is that,
although the exact numbers and timing differ slightly, the results are essentially
the same for all approaches.

        Finally, the consideration of geo-engineering options leads to a surprising
and important implication. Simulations with DICE-GIS as well as with larger
scale ice-sheet models indicate that there is a sharp non-linearity in the response
of ice-sheet changes to temperature. A policy that reduces global and GIS
temperature to pre-industrial levels produces a very slow rebuilding of the GIS.
In the estimates here, the rebuild rate in the cold (geo-engineered) scenario is
less than one-tenth of the decline rate in the warm period. From an economic
and policy perspective, the implication is that disintegration should be viewed
as an irreversible process. Put differently, while the GIS may eventually rebuild
to its current volume if temperature declines to pre-industrial levels, the rate of
rebuilding is so slow that the damage cannot be undone within the perspective
of climate policy and human settlements.

II.   Greenland Ice Sheet in the Context of Tipping of Large Earth Systems

       Concerns about the impact of climate change on large-scale and
unmanageable earth systems have taken center stage in the scientific and
economic analysis of climate change. Continued warming threatens to push
large-scale earth systems beyond tipping points. This issue was highlighted in
an influential paper on key “tipping points” of the earth system (Lenton et al.
2008). They write:
      Human activities may have the potential to push components of the Earth
      system past critical states into qualitatively different modes of operation,
      implying large-scale impacts on human and ecological systems. Examples that
      have received recent attention include the potential collapse of the Atlantic
      thermohaline circulation (THC), dieback of the Amazon rainforest, and decay of
      the Greenland ice sheet (GIS). Such phenomena have been described as ‘‘tipping
      points’’ following the popular notion that, at a particular moment in time, a
      small change can have large, long-term consequences for a system…

      Three important types of non-linear responses considered here are
systems that are reversible, irreversible or highly asymmetrical, and hysteretic
(displaying path-dependence or hysteresis).
                                                                                   3
       Here are simple definitions of these processes: A reversible system is one
with no memory, as with a stick that bends then returns to its original position.
An irreversible or highly asymmetrical system is one that breaks or changes to a
new state once a threshold is passed, as with a stick that is broken when bent too
far. A hysteretic system is one with memory of its history. Here an example
would be the consequence of an abrupt climatic event. With a given climate,
certain species (such as dinosaurs) would thrive, whereas, after a sharp climatic
change (such as a sharp cooling for a few centuries), an entirely new ecosystem
might evolve when the climate returned to its original state.

       In developing the DICE-GIS model, it is necessary to find a numerical
structure that represents GIS behavior in a robust and parsimonious manner.
Call this a “reduced-form model.” The model must be simple enough to include
in a few equations, yet reliable enough to represent the larger models. For
example, the standard SICOPOLIS model has thousands of equations and
clearly cannot be run in an optimization model.

       The literature on the impacts of major or catastrophic changes in earth
systems is vast. In the scientific domain, the IPCC reviewed several potential
major “abrupt” changes (IPCC, Science, 2013, section 12.5.5). The report
concluded, “Several components or phenomena in the climate system could
potentially exhibit abrupt or nonlinear changes, but for many phenomena, there
is low confidence and little consensus on the likelihood of such events over the
21st century.”

       Studies of complex non-linear dynamic processes have a long research
history in ecology and economics. In the study of climate change, integrated
assessment models (IAMs) have analyzed Atlantic circulation collapse and ice-
sheet collapse (see Keller et al. 2004 and Diaz and Keller 2016). The methods
applied here can also be used for the Antarctic Ice Sheet, which has been
examined in other studies (Bakker et al. 2017 and Wong et al. 2017). To date,
IAMs have not attempted to link structural earth-systems models of the abrupt
phenomena mentioned above to economic models. That is the approach taken in
the present study.

       The plan of the paper is the following. It begins with a discussion of the
structure of the Greenland Ice Sheet. This is followed by modeling details and
results. The subsequent sections analyze alternative equilibrium structures and
uncertainty. The final section presents reservations and qualifications.




                                                                                    4
III.   Further Analysis of the Greenland Ice Sheet
      With few exceptions, modeling “tipping points” and “catastrophes” has
been schematic and has not relied on realistic physical models of the
phenomena of concern. Exceptions are Keller and Bradford (1995), Keller, Hall,
Kim, Bradford, and Oppenheimer (2005), and a 2016 session of the American
Economic Association on valuing climate change catastrophes (see Diaz and
Keller 2016). The study by Bakker et al. (2016) develops a calibrated model
(“SIMPLE”) similar to the one used here to test the impacts of geo-engineering.
To my knowledge, none of the studies incorporates simplified structural
geophysical models within an economic framework.

      This section begins with a review of current physical GIS models and
what current science suggests about the dynamic structure of giant ice sheets. It
then develops a manageable dynamic model of the GIS and to include that in
the DICE integrated assessment model.
       Physical models of the Greenland Ice Sheet

       A brief description of the GIS may be useful for non-specialists.
Greenland is the world’s largest island, with an area of 2.17 million km2 or about
five times the size of California.The ice sheet covers 1.76 million km2, or about
80% of the area, with an average thickness of 1,667 meters, for a total of 2.85
million km3 of ice. While the ice sheet has waxed and waned during ice ages and
warm periods, it appears to have remained partially glaciated for at least 1
million years. Over the last century, the GIS has been volumetrically stable, with
precipitation (adding volume) offset by melting and iceberg discharge (reducing
volume). However, the GIS during the last decade has lost about 280 km3
annually, which is the equivalent of 0.8 mm of sea-level rise equivalent (SLRe)
per year.

       The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, Science (IPCC 2013) reviewed the evidence on the GIS. It concluded
that (1) several stable states of the Greenland Ice Sheet might exist; (2) the ice
sheet might irreversibly shrink to a stable smaller state once a warming
threshold is crossed for a certain amount of time; (3) the critical duration would
depend on how far the temperature threshold has been exceeded and for how
long; and (4) an irreversible decrease of the Greenland ice sheet appears very
unlikely in the 21st century but is likely on multi-centennial to millennial time
scales in the largest warming scenarios. See Appendix C for a further discussion.

       Models find a threshold temperature for GIS disintegration variously
between 1 and 5 °C above baseline levels (mid-twentieth century). However, it
is misleading to suggest that complete GIS disintegration is inevitable when the
temperature threshold is passed because the disintegration is relatively slow.

                                                                                    5
Rather, as the IPCC (2013) notes, “The complete loss of the ice sheet is not
inevitable because it has a long time scale (tens of millennia near the threshold
and a millennium or more for temperatures a few degrees above the threshold).
If the surrounding temperatures decline before the ice sheet is eliminated, the
ice sheet might regrow.” (1170) In thinking about tipping points for the GIS, it
would be more accurate (although still oversimplified) to consider a threshold
regarding degree-years rather than degrees.




Figure 1. Estimated equilibrium temperature-volume relationship for the
GIS
This figure summarizes the equilibrium relationship based on paleoclimatic
findings. Note that the temperature is over the Greenland ice sheet. The
standard conversion from average GIS temperature to global temperature is
1.5:1 for warming over the next century or so. Source: Alley et al. (2010), p. 23.



       The first question involves the equilibrium temperature-volume
relationship. The paleoclimatic history of the GIS was thoroughly reviewed in
Alley et al. (2010). They summarize as follows
      Paleoclimatic records show that the Greenland Ice Sheet consistently has lost
      mass in response to warming, and grown in response to cooling. [M]ajor
      changes of central regions of the ice sheet are thought to require centuries to
      millennia. The paleoclimatic record does not yet strongly constrain how rapidly
      a major shrinkage or nearly complete loss of the ice sheet could occur. The
      evidence suggests nearly total ice-sheet loss may result from warming of more
      than a few degrees above mean 20th-century values, but this threshold is poorly
      defined (perhaps as little as 2 °C or more than 7 °C [in regional temperature]).


                                                                                     6
       In their summary of the paleoclimatic record, Alley et al. provide an
equilibrium relationship between SLRe and temperature, shown in Figure 1.
Note that the temperature in Figure 1 is on the ice sheet, and to get the global
temperature would require dividing by 1.5. At temperatures around those of
recent centuries, the GIS has an equilibrium volume close to the current level of
7.2 m of SLRe. Furthermore, at temperatures of 5 to 6 °C regional above current
levels, or 3 to 4 °C global mean temperature, the ice sheet will eventually be
completely or nearly completely melted. Figure 1 seems the most reliable
estimate of the equilibrium relationship based on historical observations.

       Ridley et al. (2010) examine the question of whether there are multiple
stable states (see Figure 2). They do this by simulating the long-run dynamics of
the GIS with preindustrial forcings and different starting points from 0% to
100% of current volume. They find that the ice sheet volumes eventually
converge towards three stable equilibrium states at about 100%, 80%, and 20%
of present-day volume (V0). There are presumably two unstable points; one is
around 90% of V0, and that is the divide between the 80% and 100% of V0. The
other unstable point is around 50% of V0, which is the divide between 20% and
80% of V0. At 6 °C increase in global mean temperature, the median time to the
90% instability threshold is 430 years in their modeling.

       Similarly, a study by Robinson et al. (2012) examines the stability
properties of the GIS for different temperature trajectories. They find hysteretic
dynamics with multiple equilibria as shown in Figure 3 and its legend. There are
three stable equilibrium paths traced out, the top and bottom solid lines and the
middle dashed line. The points E1, E2, and E3 indicate three stable equilibria. At
1 °C warming, there are stable equilibria at 95%, 60%, and 15% of current
volume. As in many other studies, a small residual ice sheet (about 10% of V0)
remains even with high temperatures. Transient experiments indicate that at a 6
°C increase, the 90% threshold is reached in around 450 years, consistent with
the Ridley et al. (2010) estimate.

       According to Robinson et al., the tipping points, or volumes that separate
the long-run equilibria, will depend upon the temperature. At a global
temperature of 1 °C, the separation point between the upper and middle
equilibria is 80% of current volume, while the separating point between the
middle and lower equilibria is about 40%. At low temperatures (< ½ °C), all
considered paths go to the upper equilibrium eventually, while at high
temperatures (> 2 °C), all paths eventually go to the lower equilibrium.




                                                                                    7
 Figure 2. Long-run instability
 This simulation calculates trajectories of ice-sheet volumes from different
 initial states toward the final equilibrium. Each simulation assumes pre-
 industrial greenhouse-gas concentrations. The paths show the approach to ice-
 sheet equilibrium. The figure suggests convergence toward three equilibrium
 states, at about 100, 80, and 20% of present-day volume. (Ridley et al., 2010, p.
 1068)



        At first blush, the GIS appears to be a clear example of a threshold that
justifies the 2 °C ceiling for global temperature. However, here is where the
integrated analysis of economics and geosciences becomes essential.
Disintegration does not inevitably occur once the temperature threshold is
passed. Rather, rapid and near-irreversible disintegration occurs only if a volumetric
threshold is passed. A high-temperature path might well reduce the size of the GIS
over, say, the next two centuries. However, as long as the GIS volume is above
the volumetric threshold (say 80% of current volume), then reducing
temperature back below the threshold will avoid passing the tipping point and
prevent catastrophic flooding.



                                                                                     8

III. Comparative Results of Alternative Ice Sheet Dynamics
       The paleoclimatic data do not yet provide a clear record for estimating the
transient response of the GIS to different temperature trajectories.
Understanding dynamics relies on ice-sheet modeling.

       A warning is in order, however, that current models give highly
divergent estimates of the transient response to warming. For example,
Bindschadler et al. (2013) experimented for 500 years with seven ice-sheet
models. For the highest temperature path, the mean SLRe increase after 500
years was 72 cm, but the range was 9 – 143 cm. One concern is therefore that
existing ice-sheet models cannot precisely resolve the transient path associated
with climate change.

       As background, I examined the paths in several studies of GIS dynamics.
Most studies take a trajectory for global or GIS warming and then track the ice-
sheet volume. A convenient way of summarizing the results is the melt rate per
unit time per unit warming (in cm/century/°C). The results of the comparison

                                                                                   9
are shown in Figure 4. (For this discussion, the term “melt rate” is shorthand for
the rate of decline of GIS volume.) 2

      For calibration purposes, the DICE-GIS relies on the results from
Robinson et al. (2012), where the volume projections at different temperatures
are shown in Figure 5. The advantage of relying on this simulation is that the
numerical results are available, and it has a wide range of temperatures as well

2 There are many reasons for the model differences, such as the way that warming in the
form of positive degree-days enters the model, the higher-order treatment of dynamics,
and the use of the shallow-ice approximation in some but not all models. The SICOPOLIS
model (which is widely used) is close to the model median in Bindschadler, and this is the
model that I rely on in the calibration below.

as a long simulation period. The calibration was primarily at high temperatures,
as is seen in Figure 4. The model comparison study (Bindschadler et al. 2013)
has a slightly higher average melt rate than Robinson, while the other three
studies bracket Robinson.
IV.   Modeling the Greenland Ice Sheet for Inclusion in Integrated
      Assessment Models
      General considerations

      Ice-sheet models are highly complex as they require not only
representations of the surrounding air and ocean temperatures but also, in the
complete form, a three-dimensional model of the dynamics of the ice sheet. The
studies shown in Figure 4 link climate models with ice sheet models (ISMs).
Such models allow changes in climate simulated by the climate models to
interact with the ISM through surface mass balance (SMB) feedbacks. The
feedbacks include changes in surface albedo and elevation, circulation changes
induced by topographical change, and changes caused by changes in freshwater
runoff.

       Since the modeling here relies on Robinson et al. (2012), that study’s
methods will be briefly described. The study starts with global climate models,
which produce near-surface temperature anomalies prescribed over the
boundary ocean points near Greenland. A regional energy-moisture balance
model (REMBO) then takes the boundary conditions as well as the outputs of
the ISM to simulate daily temperature and precipitation as well as surface mass
balance (SMB), snowpack thickness, and albedo. The REMBO outputs are inputs
to SICOPOLIS, which is a widely used three-dimensional, polythermal shallow-
ice approximation ice-sheet model. The relevant outputs of REMBO are SMB
and surface temperature, which are inputs to SICOPOLIS; changes in
topography and ice-sheet extent calculated by the ice-sheet model are the output
of SICOPOLIS and inputs to REMBO. The climate and SMB are updated every
ten ice-sheet-model-years to provide accurate surface forcings to the ice sheet.
Note that because REMBO is coupled to SICOPOLIS, the approach explicitly
captures elevation and albedo feedbacks in the climate ice-sheet system at
relatively high resolution (20 km grid).

      It is important to understand how the albedo-altitude feedback leads to
instability. Warming will reduce the elevation of the ice sheet, which will lead to
higher temperatures at the top of the ice sheet. Additionally, a warmer ice sheet
will have less snow cover, reducing the albedo and adding further heat. For
example, snow has an assumed albedo of as high as 0.8, while ice-free land has
an assumed albedo of 0.2. Therefore, while only 20% of solar radiation would be
absorbed by a cold ice sheet covered with snow, 80% of radiation would be
absorbed by ice-free land. It is easily seen how this feedback could lead to
continued deglaciation. The offset to this factor, it turns out, is the positive
association of temperature and precipitation, which can offset some or all of the
albedo-elevation feedback.
         Modeling details

       The strategy in developing the DICE-GIS model is to incorporate a
simplified representation of more complex GIS models. The following presents a
small structural dynamic model that allows for any of the three types of
dynamics (reversible, hysteretic, and irreversible). It is small, can be calibrated
to larger realistic models, and can be incorporated into integrated assessment
models.

     The basic equations are as follows: Begin with an equilibrium relationship
between temperature (T*) and ice-sheet volume (V*):

   (1)      T* = f(V*)

The equation is written in this form because there is a unique temperature for
each volume. In the central specification used in this study, the inverse function

                                                                                12
is one-to-one. However, in other specifications, such as one displaying
hysteresis discussed in a later section, the inverse function does not hold
uniquely (that is, there may be multiple equilibrium volumes associated with a
single temperature, as shown in Figure 2).

       Figure 6 shows three alternative versions of equation (1). Figure 6a is a
completely reversible dynamic system such as shown in Figure 1, where the ice
sheet marches down the f(V*) curve in a warming world, and then marches back
up the same curve as temperatures fall. Figure 6b is the hysteresis diagram such
as is shown in Figure 2. Note that the irreversible case is at one extreme of the
hysteresis curve, while the reversible case is at the other pole where the two
branches in 6b collapse into one branch.

                                                             irreversible because rebuilding
                                                             requires ice-age conditions.

       For most dynamic systems with two stable equilibria, as shown in Figures
6 and simulated below, there will also be one unstable equilibrium. The upper
equilibrium will be traced out as the GIS melts, and the lower equilibrium will
be traced out as the GIS rebuilds. The unstable middle curve between A and B in
Figure 6b will not be observed.ii

                                                                                                         13
      The next question involves the dynamics of volume adjustment. The
simplest relationship is a differential equation (discretized in practice) in which
the volume adjusts as a function of actual and equilibrium temperature and
actual volume.3

                V (t )
    (2)                  g[T (t ), T *(t ), V (t )]
                 t
       The present study focuses primarily on the completely reversible system,
shown in Figure 6a. It also assumes that the equilibrium function is linear to
simplify the analysis. The dynamic equation for the linear model is estimated
from Robinson’s simulations using the data shown in Figure 5 (see Appendix B
for the results). The final equations are the following:

          (3)        T *(t )  3.4 [1  V (t ) /100]2
                     V (t )
          (4)                 0.0053sgn[T (t )  T *(t )][T (t )  T *(t )]2 [V (t ) / 100]0.2
                       t
        Here, V*(t) and T*(t) are equilibrium volumes and temperature, while T(t)
and V(t) are actual values. Equation (3) takes the paleoclimatic equilibrium
shown in Figure 1 above and linearizes the relationship between the modern era
and the interglacial period. Note that the coefficient (3.4 °C) is the difference
between the global interglacial temperature and the global glacial maximum
temperature. At full volume (V = 100%), the equilibrium temperature is 0 °C,
while the GIS fully melts in equilibrium at 3.4 °C global above pre-industrial
levels.

      Equation (4) is the melt-rate equation. The first term is the coefficient
determined from a regression analysis. The second term introduces the sign of
the temperature difference. The temperature difference enters as a squared
                                               0.2
function. The last term, [V (t ) /100] , ensures that volume is positive. To take an
example, at an initial volume of 100% and a global temperature of 6 °C, the ice-
sheet decline is 0.19% per five years, or 28 cm of SLRe per century. If the actual
temperature is less than equilibrium, the ice sheet rebuilds.

      Figure 7 and Table 1, as well as Figures B-1 and B-2 in Appendix B, show
a comparison of the Robinson et al. model runs with those of the DICE-GIS. The
Robinson calculation declines more slowly at the beginning, but the two models
have similar long-run trajectories. The differences between the Robinson and



3An alternative used in Bakker et al. (2016) uses quadratic functions in temperature for
both the adjustment and the equilibrium. This approach was tested against the Robinson
data and has a significantly poorer statistical fit than equations (3) and (4).

V.    Model Structure
      The DICE-GIS model is a straightforward integration of the GIS model
discussed in the last section with the DICE-2016R2 model.4 A few changes have
been introduced into the standard DICE model to reflect the long time period.
The full set of variables and equations for the GIS addition are provided in
Appendices D and E.

       The new assumptions in the standard DICE module are the following.
First, no negative emissions are allowed past 2200. If these are allowed, then the
optimal solution is to run atmospheric carbon concentrations low enough that
the GIS stays at current volume. Second, the rate of decarbonization is set at zero
after 2200. Without this assumption, emissions go quickly to zero. Third, several
parameters are set as constants after 2200 for computational stability. These
include the savings rate and the rate of productivity growth. The runs are for
1500 years.

      The following list shows the scenarios used for the present study.

      1. Discounting. Because of the long time lags, disintegration has a small
         impact on policy under normal discounting. The simplest way to deal
         with this concern is to consider as well low discount rate. This
         approach is consistent with other studies that advocate low
         discounting to reflect major losses in the distant future.
      2. Damages on SLR. A second assumption concerns the damages from sea-
         level rise. The present study takes the results of Diaz (2016). This study
         finds that SLR of 0.8 meters in 2100 has an impact of 1.5% of global
         output without adaptation and 0.18% of output with adaptation. This
         study takes the intermediate estimate of 1% of global output lost for
         each 1 meter of SLR. The damage function is linear in SLR in light of
         findings from Diaz. This function implies that complete disintegration
         of the GIS would lead to ≈ 7% loss in global income each year. Note
         that if modeling takes the constrained volume approach in #4b, the
         GIS component of damages is omitted.
      3. Alternative melt rates. The standard melt rate (or more precisely, GIS
         volume change) has been discussed above. For sensitivity analyses, I
         assume a melt rate two times the calibrated level. This takes the melt
         rate beyond any of the estimates that have been included in the IPCC
         Fifth Assessment Report (2013) but is useful for analytical purposes.

      4. Economic calculations. There are two alternative methods of treating the
         economic impact of the disintegration of the GIS.
            a. Damage function approach. The first is to modify the damage
               function to include damages as described above.
            b. Constrained volume approach. A second approach is to constrain
               the GIS volume to be above a given threshold. For example, GIS
               volume might be constrained above 90% of its original volume.
               The volumetric approach is useful if estimates of GIS damages
               are imprecise, if the damage-function approach is unacceptable,
               or if it is desired to avoid tipping points in the ice-sheet
               dynamics.

       This list provides a large array of potential strategies for including the GIS
in integrated assessment models. Another set of issues is the potential for
irreversibility and hysteresis, whose dynamics are examined in later sections.
VI.   Results for the DICE-GIS Model


      Baseline results

      Begin with the results of the standard DICE model with the new GIS
module added. Figure 8 shows the trajectory of GIS volume for three cases: an
optimal climate policy; a baseline of no climate policy; and a baseline policy
followed by geo-engineering after 500 years.

      The results are straightforward. With standard damages, discounting, and
melt rate, the baseline path has the GIS disintegrating gradually over the coming
centuries. By contrast, the optimal path has a much slower decline, staying
above the upper tipping point of 80% volume.

         Figure 8 also shows the result of a geo-engineering experiment. This run
assumes that a geo-engineering technology reduces the temperature over the
GIS to 0 °C at year 500 into the run. The GIS model used here suggests that there
is little rebuilding of the GIS from the geo-engineering, but the decline does
stop. This point is further analyzed in section D below. The arrow in Figure 8
shows IPCC estimates of the impact of baseline radiative forcings on the GIS at
500 years for different ice-sheet models.

       It is useful to compare the social cost of carbon for three cases: normal
damages, GIS damages only, and combined damages. Table 2 shows the
components. For completeness, this also shows the results for low discounting
(1% per year). These calculations suggest that the damages associated with GIS
disintegration are a small fraction of the total damages. GIS damages are 0.4% of
the total at normal discounting and 1.8% with low discounting.

                                                                                  17
       Table 2 is relevant for the question of whether current estimates of the
social cost of carbon underestimate the “true” SCC because of omissions of
major tipping points such as the GIS. While the GIS is but one of the potential
omissions in current methods, the baseline and low-discounting calculations
suggest that the GIS omission is somewhere between negligible and small.

 See text for discussion. The arrow is the range of model estimates for a
 high warming scenario (RCP 8.5) from IPCC (2013) p. 1191, and has
 comparable forcings as the DICE-GIS baseline run. The optimal policy
 stays above the unstable tipping point for the GIS for many centuries,
 while the baseline passes the threshold. The run labeled “Base-geo” shows
 the result if a geo-engineering experiment begins at year 500 (see section
 on geo-engineering below for details).iv



      Impact of discounting

       The question of the appropriate discount rate is a deep and unsettled one.
The standard DICE model uses a discount rate on goods that is calibrated to the
rate of return on capital. Alternatives proposed by scholars, such as in the Stern
Review (2005), use a lower discount rate that is based on intergenerational
neutrality. While there are strong arguments on both sides, it is useful to
determine the impact of different discount rates on the optimal climate
                                                                                               18
trajectory. The easiest way to implement alternatives is to assume different
constant discount rates, here 0.1%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, and 5% per year. The lower
two rates raise economic issues because the discount rate is lower than the
growth of output for two centuries. Because of numerical problems, the model
with low discount rates does not converge for periods longer than 2000 years.

      Table 3 shows the results for different discount rates and two alternative
melt rates. The first two columns show the SCC for the GIS only and the SCC for
all damages. As is well known, the SCC rises sharply as the discount rate falls.

       The more interesting feature is the relationship between the SCC with and
without GIS damages, shown in the last column of Table 3. This ratio is virtually
zero for relatively high discount rates (3% and above) and the standard melt
rate. For the lowest discount rates and the higher melt rate, the ratio of the SCC
with only GIS damage to that with all damages rises to 5% of the total. In all
cases examined, the GIS adds little to the SCC.

 Note that GIS damages are a small percent of the total, although larger for low
 discounting. These calculations use a 1000-year time horizon, but using a
 2000-year horizon makes little difference.v



      Volume constraints

      Estimates of the damage from sea-level rise due to GIS melt are highly
uncertain. The damage estimate used in the modeling assumes limited
adaptation, whereas high adaptation would produce about one-fifth of the
damages based on the Diaz (2016) study.

      An alternative approach is to limit the decline in the volume of the GIS. A
natural set of limits would use the thresholds that have been suggested by
current research. Ridley et al. (2010), as shown in Figure 2, has tipping points at
                                                                                          19
10%, 50%, and 90% of current volume. These are thresholds for a global
temperature of 0 °C. Analogous experiments by Robinson et al. also find three
stable equilibria and two tipping points. The present calculations use the Ridley
et al. (2010) thresholds to constrain the GIS volume above 10, 50, and 90% of
current volume.

The estimates show the SCC with all damages and only GIS damages. The last
column shows how much the GIS adds to the SCC. Stern discounting is
approximately 1.3% per year asymptotically. Super-low discounting is 0.1%
per year but does not converge numerically.vi



      Table 4 shows the results of the volumetric approach. These estimates
show DICE discounting, the 3% discount rate used by the US government, and
the low discount rate of 1% per year. The runs are optimized and include
normal damages. However, GIS economic damages are removed and replaced
by the volumetric constraint.

 Table 4. Comparison of optimal policy under both volumetric constraints
 and damage function.
 For the calculations with “volume limited,” the DICE-GIS model is run
 constraining volume to be above three tipping volumes. The paths are
 optimized including standard damages but replace the assumed GIS damages
 with the volumetric constraint. These are compared with the standard
 calculations. The SCC is lower with the GIS volume constraint when it is not
 binding. Four cases with shaded regions at the bottom are ones where the 90%
 volume constraint is binding. The SCC is between 6% and 175% higher in
 those cases.vii


       For most cases, the volumetric constraint is not binding, and the SCC is
slightly lower than the standard estimates in Table 3. For the cases of the upper
threshold (90% minimum) and the two higher discount rates, the volume
constraint is binding, and the SCC is higher than the standard. With a 2X melt
rate and a 90% volume constraint, the SCC is elevated and on the order of $100
per ton of CO2.

       The important result of imposing the volume constraint is that it requires
a relatively high SCC to meet the tightest constraint of limiting to a 10% melt.


                                                                                     21
For looser constraints, the appropriate SCC is little changed from the standard
value.
      Geo-engineering to limit temperature

       A final set of experiments examines geo-engineering which reduces
temperature to reverse the GIS disintegration. These experiments assume that
global and GIS temperatures are reduced to 0 °C after a given year. The geo-
engineering might occur through radiation management (putting particles in the
atmosphere) or carbon reduction (say through carbon-removal technologies).
       In looking at these geo-engineering simulations, the striking result is that
rebuilding the GIS is quantitatively different from disintegration. The
asymmetry is seen in Figure 1, where the disequilibrium dynamics are very
different in a melt mode from a rebuild mode.
       The asymmetry can also be seen in the Applegate-Keller results shown in
Figure 9. They run experiments with rapid warming followed by geo-
engineering at different times. In the experiment with a 6 °C increase in global
temperature, the melt rate rises to approximately 13 mm/yr. However, when
the temperature is reduced to 0 °C, the ice sheet rebuilds at a rate of only 0.5
mm/yr. A similar pattern is seen in the hysteresis tests in Robinson et al. (2012),
Figure SI-S4. This study has a scenario in which temperature is reduced to 0.4 °C
starting from a volume of 20% of current levels. In the Robinson simulation, the
ice sheet rebuilds to 70% of volume after 50,000 years. This result represents an
increase of 0.07 mm/yr. The estimates in the Ridley et al. (2010) calculations in
Figure 1 indicate a buildup of about 0.1 mm/yr in the accumulation phase.
       The geo-engineering experiments in DICE-GIS are roughly the same as
the results from the three modeling studies. Consider a scenario in which GIS
volume is reduced to 20% of current levels, at which time temperature is
reduced to 0.4 °C. The rebuilding rate is around 0.25 mm/year in the DICE-GIS.
A GIS temperature anomaly of 6 °C global for 300 years leads to approximately
2 meters of SLR at that time. If the temperature is reduced to zero in a geo-
engineering experiment, the GIS is estimated to rebuild by only 0.2 meters after
1000 years, or about 0.2 mm/year.
       The reasons for the strong asymmetry may puzzle those outside of the
geosciences. The asymmetry can be understood in a mathematical way and in a
physical way. The mathematics involves the melt-rate function. We have
estimated that the melt rate is a function of the squared difference between the
actual and equilibrium temperature, that is V (t ) t T (t )  T *(t )  . In the
                                                                          2


warm phase, the difference is large, perhaps 6 °C, so the melt rate is a constant
times 36. In the cooling phase, the equilibrium volume is close to the actual
volume, so T (t)  T *(t) is small, perhaps 1. So the melt rate would be about
1/36th of the rate in the warm phase.


                                                                                  22
       The physics provides a different explanation. (I am grateful to Klaus
Keller for this explanation.) An ice sheet melts when the temperature is elevated,
and the decumulation (here meaning melting plus glacial discharge) exceeds
accumulation (precipitation). However, there is no “negative melting” in the
cold phase. Rather, to build an ice sheet requires not just cold temperatures, but
also precipitation. The precipitation rate over the ice sheets is, however, quite
small. So when the melting slows to close to zero, the net volume change is
determined by precipitation minus glacial discharge. Since melting is a function
of positive degree-days, positive degree days approach zero with cooling. This
implies that there is a sharp asymmetry in the response of the ice sheet to
positive and negative temperature shocks.




 Figure 9. Sea-level rise with temperature increase and decrease
 The horizontal lines show the decline in sea level during geo-engineering
 experiments in the SICOPOLIS model from Applegate and Keller (2015). The
 lines represent scenarios that reduce temperature to zero at different starting
 points from 2025 to 2475. The key finding is the slow ice-sheet buildup during
 geo-engineering.

       The conclusions of the geo-engineering simulations have important
implications for climate policy. Moreover, the results apply to mitigation and
carbon removal as well as solar-radiation management. They suggest that
disintegration of the GIS is essentially irreversible on a relevant societal time
scale. It might be that the GIS will rebuild, but to the extent that existing model
calculations are accurate, the rebuilding is so slow that from an analytical
perspective disintegration should be considered irreversible. This conclusion
has the important reservation that it has not been validated in multiple model
calculations, so it should be treated with caution.




                                                                                  23
VII. Alternative Equilibrium Specifications: Non-linear, Irreversible, and
     Hysteretic

       The basic model analyzed here uses a linear relationship between
equilibrium volume and temperature. This section considers alternative
specifications of the equilibrium relationship: non-linear, irreversible, and
hysteretic.
      Non-linear equilibrium function

      The first alternative is to assume that the equilibrium volume-temperature
function is non-linear as shown by the finding from paleoclimatic studies and
summarized in Figure 1. Figure 1 shows V* is a concave function of T*. As noted
above, the modeling needs to invert this to ensure uniqueness. This relationship
can be represented by a function of the form T *  3.4 1  V */100 . To maintain
                                                                   0.5



the same temperature-volume trajectory as the linear function for the first two
centuries, the melt-rate coefficient is adjusted upward by about 10%.

       Calculations indicate that the optimal and baseline paths are virtually
identical for the standard coefficients and discount rates. For example, the SCC
associated with only GIS damages is $0.134 per ton CO2 with the linear model
and $0.133 per ton CO2 with the non-linear model. Differences appear with low
and super-low discount rates (1% and 0.1% per year). At these low rates, the ice
sheet melts slightly more slowly with the non-linear specification than the linear
specification. This leads to higher long-run volumes and a lower SCC with the
non-linear equilibrium function.

       So the conclusion on introducing a non-linear (concave) equilibrium
temperature-volume relationship is that there are negligible changes in the near
term with standard parameters, while long-run disintegration is slightly lower
with the non-linear function. Numerical results are not presented as they are not
interesting.viii
      Irreversible disintegration

       A second alternative structure assumes irreversible disintegration, as in
Figure 6c. That is, once melted to a given volume, the ice sheet cannot rebuild.
To begin with, this is both physically and historically unrealistic. Paleoclimatic
data (such as reported in Figure 1) indicate a reversible pattern during ice ages
and interglacial periods. Moreover, all models that allow for wide variations of
forcings indicate changes from virtually ice-free to highly glaciated conditions.

      On the other hand, as the experiments with geo-engineering indicate, the
rebuilding of the GIS in a period of colder conditions is extremely slow. The
pace of rebuilding is so slow, indeed, that from a societal vantage point, the
dynamics can usefully be thought of as irreversible.
                                                                                  24
       A final observation is to examine the different runs for the linear model.
In the baseline and optimal runs, none of the sixteen runs examined displays a
rebuilding of the ice sheet. There might be situations where the path is rebuilt,
but these do not appear in the DICE-GIS model.

       All these results indicate that, for the modeling of the ice sheet used in the
present study, there are no further implications of imposing irreversibility. The
system is already so close to irreversible that adding complete irreversibility has
no effect.
      Hysteresis in equilibrium temperature-volume relationship

      A final approach is to examine the implications of an ice sheet displaying
hysteresis. To modify the model for this property, the equilibrium temperature-
volume relationship was assumed to follow a cubic function with the shape
shown by the curved line in Figure 10 (for comparison, the linear relationship is
shown as a dashed line). The hysteretic curve is generated to resemble the
estimates in Robinson et al. (2012) shown in Figure 3. The equation has an
upper-branch tipping point at a temperature of 2½ °C and a volume of 70% of
current volume. The lower branch has a tipping point at 1 °C and 25% of current
volume. The equation has an equilibrium of zero volume at a temperature of 3.4
°C. This cubic equation then replaced the linear equilibrium temperature-
volume relationship in the standard DICE-GIS model. The melt rate is re-
estimated to fit the Robinson data.

        The major difference between the linear and hysteretic model is that the
latter has a lower melt rate at the initial volume. This is easily seen in Figure 10
and results from the concavity of the function in the neighborhood of full
volume. As a result, for the early years and a given temperature path, the GIS
volume is higher with the hysteretic specification than with the linear
specification. This result holds in all of the sixteen variants of discount rates and
melt rates for the optimal and baseline runs. This finding is essentially inevitable
if the two functions are tied down at the two ends (0 °C at 100% volume and 3.4
°C at 0% volume).

 hysteresis model.



       For the optimal policy, the results of the hysteretic model are very close to
the linear model. The SCC for standard DICE parameters is 0.02% lower in the
hysteretic case. The terminal volume (1500 years out) is higher in the hysteretic
case: 85.4% v. 90.8% of volume for baseline parameters and 96.8% v. 97.8% for
super-low discounting and the high melt rate.

       For the baseline case, the results are more interesting. The SCC is lower in
all cases for the hysteretic case (because of the lower initial melt rate). However,
the ice sheet melts much faster once the threshold volume is passed, and this
leads to much more rapid ice-sheet decline at that point. With no policy,
therefore, complete disintegration occurs more rapidly with hysteresis.

       So an interesting finding for the GIS is that the introduction of hysteresis
makes little difference to the optimal policy. The reason is that the optimal
policy stays away from the hysteretic threshold. However, for policies that pass
the tipping point, hysteresis may make the outcome worse more quickly
(although still very slowly).
VIII. Uncertainty

       One of the paralytic features of analyzing climate change and particularly
the role of the giant ice sheets is the presence of large uncertainties (see Figure
                                                                                       26
4). An important question is how uncertainty would affect the outcomes and
optimal policies.

       To address this question, this study examined the very limited question of
the effect of uncertainty about GIS variables. The experiment looked at the
uncertainty of the melt rate and the damage coefficient. The distributions for
each variable are assumed to be discrete with three equally likely values equal
to (0.5, 1, 1.5) times the deterministic value. This assumption produced nine
equally likely states of the world. I then compared the expected value of the
policies and outcomes for three discount rates: DICE discounting, 1% per year,
and 3% per year.

      The impacts of uncertainty in the base and optimal cases were negligible.
The SCC under uncertainty differed from the deterministic values by at most
½% for the six cases (optimal and base for three different discount rates). The
GIS volumes differed by less than 1% at 500 years in the future.

       The reason why uncertainty has so little effect is because the impact on
the ice sheet is close to a linear function of the uncertain variables (see Nordhaus
2018 for a discussion of this point). Ice-sheet disintegration is a function of
temperature-years, while temperature is a function of the stock of carbon
concentrations, which in turn are a function of past emissions. Because of all the
smoothing, shocks have a close-to-linear effect on all outcome and policy
variables.ix

       If the uncertainty involved quantitative constraints that triggered
thresholds, uncertainty might be more important. For example, consider instead
of a damage function that the optimization involves volumetric constraints with
a mean value of 70%, with the three values of 50%, 70%, and 90%. In the case of
high discounting, the volume constraints would apply and raise the SCC by
about 10%. In the case of low discounting, the volume constraint would be met,
and there would be no impact on the SCC. However, the impact of quantitative
constraints depends critically on their levels as well as other parameters.


IX.   Conclusion and Qualifications

       The present study incorporates a small model of the Greenland Ice Sheet
(GIS) into the DICE integrated assessment model of the economics of climate
change. The resulting model, DICE-GIS, allows an integrated study of the
impact of economic activity and climate policy on emissions, concentrations,
global and GIS temperature, GIS disintegration, sea-level rise, and damages.
While all the different modules are simplified relative to high-resolution
models, they have the advantage of integrating the different parts so that
alternative policies can be assessed.

                                                                                 27
      The major results were provided in the introductory section. This section
concludes with a discussion of some of the qualifications with the current
analysis, focusing on the major issues that arise from adding the ice-sheet
modeling. It leaves to the side standard issues of integrated assessment models
such as DICE, which have been subject to vigorous attacks and defenses.

       One major concern about including the GIS is that the equilibrium
behavior is imperfectly understood. In particular, the question of whether there
are single or multiple equilibria is not completely clear. The best evidence
appears to be that there are multiple equilibria for global temperatures between
0 °C (pre-industrial) and 4 °C. The evidence seems clear that virtually complete
disintegration will eventually occur at global temperature increases above 6 °C,
although “eventually” is many centuries.

       A second issue is the transitory dynamics of disintegration. As the survey
above indicates, current models provide highly divergent estimates of the melt
rate at different temperatures. A multi-model survey gives a range of estimates
of nearly a factor of four. The divergence arises because of the complexity of ice-
sheet dynamics and the absence of a precise history of the transition in the
paleoclimatic record.

       A third uncertainty is the economic impact of sea-level rise. The most
careful study to date (Diaz 2016) indicates that there is a range of a factor of ten
for estimated impacts between a full-adaptation and a no-adaptation scenario.
This uncertainty can be avoided by employing policies that constrain the
disintegration of the GIS, but quantitative limits have the disadvantage of not
having a strong economic basis.

       Next, note that the present analysis is largely deterministic and provides
only a cursory analysis of the impact of uncertainties on policies. As noted
above, however, it seems unlikely that uncertainty will make a major difference
for the social cost of carbon or ice-sheet disintegration.

       Finally, it is necessary to emphasize the challenge of understanding the
dynamics of geo-engineering strategies (or, more generally, strategies that
return global temperatures back to pre-industrial or current levels). The present
modeling, consistent with the sparse literature on the subject, finds there is a
strong asymmetry between disintegration in a warm period and rebuilding the
ice sheet in cooler periods. Determining whether this tentative finding is correct
is an important issue for future research.

Appendix A. Estimates of Melt Rates From Different Models
       This study examined different simulations of GIS models to determine the
pattern of melt rates at different temperature profiles. Note that the term “melt
rate” is used to denote the decrease in volume which is determined by the sum
of runoff and glacial discharge minus precipitation.) There are multiple possible
GIS approaches and results that can be used for developing the DICE-GIS
model. The calibrations relied on the calculations of Robinson et al. 2012 (see
Figure 4 of the main text) both because they show hysteresis in the simulations
and because they have a complete trajectory for a wide range of temperature
increases.

       A comparison of the estimates from Robinson with other studies is shown
in Figure 4 in the main text. Robinson et al. estimates are low for the lowest
temperature increases (2 °C global increase) but in the middle of the studies for
the higher ones (4 to 8 °C). There is considerable dispersion among studies, as is
also shown by the SeaRise model comparison study (Bindschadler et al. 2013).
Alternative studies differ by at least a factor of four in the studies shown in
Figure 4, and by almost a factor of twenty in the high-temperature comparison
(C3) in Bindschadler et al. The survey of models is shown in Table A-1.

These estimates are the melt rate for the first 100 – 500 years in the different

Appendix B. Estimates of Melt-Rate Function for DICE-GIS
       The DICE-GIS model used the simulations from Robinson et al. (2012).
These data were provided by Prof. Robinson. The data come in steps of 10 years
for model runs of 5000 years. The temperature trajectory was a linear ramp from
0 °C to the target, over a period of 100 years. The regressions used only four
target trajectories (2, 4, 6, and 8 °C) for the estimates. The authors state that the
global mean temperature is 90% of the summer temperature used for the runs,
so the ice-sheet temperature was converted to global mean temperature by
multiplying each of the targets by 1.111.

      There were several estimates of the melt-rate function. The central
equation was the following:

       For numerical optimization in the GAMS algorithm, β is set equal to 2 and
γ is rounded to 0.2. This yields the following equation which has a virtually
identical fit for the period. Note that the calibration starts at 200 years because
the spin-up has erratic behavior.

      The model outputs (Robinson) and DICE-GIS equation fit from Table B-2
are shown in Figure B-1. The fit is reasonably close for the present purposes. The
model overpredicts the melt at the lowest temperature and has the wrong tilt in
the middle-temperature ranges, but the overall fit is very strong.

       As a final model output, Figure B-2 shows the trajectory for GIS volume
with the 8.9 °C global warming. The static DICE uses actual lagged volume in
the simulation, while dynamic DICE uses projected volumes. Both are very close
to the Robinson trajectory. The summary is that the DICE-GIS can simulate the
Robinson et al. calculations reasonably closely. The major issue is the difference
across different GIS models (as shown in Appendix A), not the difference
between the DICE-GIS and the Robinson simulations.

 Appendix C. Estimates of melt rates from different modelsxii
      This appendix explains the derivation of the melt rates in the different
 models.
1. Furst et al. (2015)

 This paper uses temperature over the ice sheet, apparently annual. It calculates
 using four temperature paths to 2100 and two to 2300. The following shows the
 basic results. The results are not intuitive as 2300 is not much higher than 2100.




2. Bindschadler et al. (2103)

 This study is a model comparison. However, the results are sometimes difficult
 to decipher. The major problem is understanding the temperature trajectories
 associated with the different scenarios. We have chosen only C1 – C3 as these
 seem clearest. Additionally, concentrate on the 500-year results. C1 is the A1B
 scenario from the IPCC, while C2 is 1.5 times C1 and C3 is two times C1. The
 following shows the basic results.




  The following shows the results for individual models. Note that the units are
 40x1014 m3 = 1 m SLRe.

   Keller (2014)

   Applegate et al. (2014) do simulations of the SCIOPOLIS model and use it to
   calibrate a small model for use in experiments. I was unable to get numerical
   values of their simulations, and the estimates here may be unreliable. Estimates
   in the text were derived from Figure 3, reproduced below.

   This study was explained in the text. The major results are from the following
   table.




                                                                                       37

from Ridley et al. (2010).

5. IPCC (2013), Chapter 13

   The IPCC repeats the studies reviewed above. It concludes that there is a
   threshold, but they cannot determine where it is. The conclusion of the IPCC
   report is as follows:
        With currently available information, we do not have sufficient confidence to
        assign a likely range for the threshold. If the threshold is exceeded temporarily,
        an irreversible loss of part or most of the Greenland ice sheet could result,
        depending on the duration and amount that the threshold is exceeded. (p 1169)

        The available evidence indicates that sustained global warming greater than a
        certain threshold above pre-industrial would lead to the near-complete loss of
        the Greenland ice sheet over a millennium or more, causing a global mean sea
        level rise of about 7 m. Studies with fixed ice-sheet topography indicate the
        threshold is greater than 2°C but less than 4°C (medium confidence) of global
        mean surface temperature rise concerning pre-industrial. The one study with a
        dynamical ice sheet suggests the threshold is greater than about 1°C (low
        confidence) global mean warming concerning pre-industrial. We are unable to
        quantify a likely range. Whether or not a decrease in the Greenland ice sheet
        mass loss is irreversible depends on the duration and degree of exceedance of
        the threshold. Abrupt and irreversible ice loss from a potential instability of
        marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet in response to climate forcing is
        possible, but current evidence and understanding are insufficient to make a
        quantitative assessment. {5.8, 13.3, 13.4} (p. 1140)
