                                              ABSTRACT

The Great Recession from December 2007 to June 2009 is associated with a dramatic weakening of
the labor market from which, by some measures, it has not completely recovered. I use data from
the Displaced Workers Survey (DWS) from 1984-2014 to investigate the incidence and consequences
of job loss from 1981-2013. In particular, the 2010, 2012, and 2014 DWSs provide a window through
which to examine the experience of job losers in the Great Recession and its aftermath and to compare
their experience to that of earlier job losers. These data show a record high rate of job loss in the Great
Recession, with almost one in six workers reporting having lost a job in the 2007-2009 period, that
has not yet returned to pre-recession levels. The employment consequences of job loss are also
very serious during this period with very low rates of reemployment and difficulty finding full-time
employment. The reduction in weekly earnings for those job losers during the 2007-2013 period who
were able to find new employment are not unusually large by historical standards.

1         Introduction

The Great Recession from December 2007 to June 2009 is associated with a dramatic weaken-
ing of the labor market from which it only recovered very slowly. Indeed, by some measures
the recovery is not yet complete. The unemployment rate remained stubbornly high for
several years, and durations of unemployment continue to be unprecedentedly long. The
weakening of the labor market in the Great Recession was associated with tremendous job
destruction and costly adjustment for those whose jobs were lost. In this study I use the
Displaced Workers Surveys (DWS), administered every two years from 1984-2014 as a sup-
plement to the Current Population Survey (CPS), to examine the experience of job losers
during and after the Great Recession and to compare their experience to that of earlier job
losers. The January 2010 DWS is of particular interest since it covers job loss during the
period of the Great Recession (2007-2009), and the succeeding two DWSs (2012 and 2014)
shed important light on the experience of post-recession job losers in a labor market that
was still recovering from the Great Recession (2009-2013).1
        The study of worker displacement, both through plant closings, large layoffs, and smaller
events is an important focus of work in recent years. While much earlier work uses data from
the DWS, a body of recent work builds on the seminal study of Jacobsen, LaLonde, and
Sullivan (1993) and uses adminstrative data (e.g., Couch and Placzek, 2010; Davis and von
Wachter, 2011); Song and Von Wachter, 2014). The work using the DWS and the work using
administrative data are complementary in the sense that they address related but somewhat
different dimensions of the cost of job loss. The DWS is well suited for the study of short
run employment outcomes of job losers and declines in weekly earnings for reemployed job
losers. The administrative data, usually quarterly data from state unemployment insurance
records or Social Security Administration data, is well suited for studying earnings losses
over longer periods of time and calculating the total dollar value of lost income.
        I begin in the next section with a brief presentation of movements over time in key
labor market indicators derived from the CPS. These include the unemployment rate, the
average duration of unemployment spells, the employment-population ratio, and key monthly
transition rates between labor force states (exit rates from employment and unemployment).
These highlight the severity of the Great Recession and the slow recovery. In section 3 I

describe the data I use from the DWS and discuss measurement and data issues relevant to
the analysis of job loss. Section 4 contains my analysis of the incidence of job loss. Next,
I analyze the consequences of job loss in several dimensions. I begin in section 5 with an
investigation of post-displacement labor force status and employment probabilities. Next in
section 6, I consider the quality of job-displacement jobs including the full-time/part-time
status of reemployed job losers and the decline in weekly earnings due to displacement.
Section 7 contains a discussion of the findings and concluding remarks.


2     Overview of Labor Market Conditions

The high unemployment rate experienced in the Great Recession has been very slow to return
to pre-recession levels. The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate peaked at 10.0 percent
in the first quarter of 2010, was still at 9.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, more than
one full year after the “official” end of the recession in June 2009.2
    Figure 1 contains a plot of the quarterly seasonally adjusted civilian unemployment rate

     This is the NBER dating of the recession. See http://www.nber.org/cycles.html and NBER (2010) for
more information of the NBER business cycle dating procedure. The labor market historically lags the
NBER dates, which are based largely on GDP growth. For example, the NBER dated the end of the Great
Recession in June 2009 while the unemployment rate reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics peaked
in October 2009.

from 1978 through 2014.3 There has been substantial variation in labor market conditions
over the period covered by the DWS (1981-2013). The early 1980s saw a sharp increase
in the unemployment rate to more than 10 percent during the July 1981 - November 1982
recession. This increase was followed by a long decline in during the remainder of the 1980s.
The unemployment rate then increased to almost 8 percent in 1992 before beginning a long
decline to about 4 percent in 2000. After the comparatively mild recession in 2001, with a
6 percent unemployment rate, the unemployment rate again declined to about 4.5 percent
in 2007 before increasing sharply to about 10 percent by early 2010. Since that time the
unemployment rate has fallen slowly but steadily to about 6 percent in 2014q4. Note that
more than 5 years after the end of the Great Recession, the unemployment rate remains
above its level at the onset of the recession (unemployment rate of 5.8 percent in 2014q4 vs.
5.0 percent in 2007q4).
       A related concern is the unprecedentedly long average duration of unemployment spells.
This is illustrated in figure 2, which shows both the mean and median seasonally adjusted
duration of unemployment for spells in progress, quarterly from 1978-2014. This figure clearly
shows the counter-cyclical nature of unemployment duration. The mean unemployment rate
reached about 20 weeks in the three earlier recessions show but rose to 37 weeks in the

     The unemployment rates that I refer to in the text and in the figures are based on my own calculations
using the basic CPS public use files available for this period. I weight by the CPS final sampling weights. In
order to seasonally adjust a series Yt with overall mean Ȳ , I regress Yt on a complete set of seasonal dummy
variables and calculate the residuals, et . I then compute the seasonally adjusted series as Ytsa = Ȳ + et .

Great Recession. The figure further indicates a continuing increase in mean unemployment
duration into 2011 (mean duration 36.9 weeks in 2011Q4) before falls somewhat to just under
30 weeks in 2014q4. The median showed a similar pattern, reaching about 10 weeks in earlier
recession but increasing to 25 weeks in the most recent recession. Again more than 5 years
after end of the Great Recession, both mean and median duration of unemployment spells
in progress remain above anything seen prior to the Great Recession.
   These high unemployment rates reflect in large measure changes in flows between labor
force states. Figure 3, uses month-to-month matched CPS data from 1994 onward to show
flow rates from “employed” (E) to “employed” (E), unemployed” (U), and “not in the labor
force” (NILF). The E-E flow (left scale), which represents the probability that an employed
person remains employed, drops from 0.96 to 0.955 in 2008 and slowly recovers by late 2014.
While this sounds small, consider the complement. The probability of leaving employment
increased from 0.04 to 0.45, an increase of 12.5 percent. Virtually all of this was movement
from employment to unemployment (rather than exit from the labor force). The E-U flow
rate (right scale) increased from about .011 in late 2007 to .018 by early 2009 (an increase
of 63 percent) and slowly decreased by late 2014.
   Figure 4, shows flow rates from “unemployed” to each of the three labor force states. The
U-E flow, which represents the probability that an unemployed person finds employment,
dropped from 0.27 in late 2007 to about 0.16 to 0.17 in 2009 and 2010 (a drop of 37 percent)

before partially recovering to 0.23 in late 2014. The probability of remaining unemployed
(U-U flow) increased from 0.5 in late 2007 to 0.65 in late 2009 (an increase of 30 percent)
before recovering by late 2014.
    The labor force flows shown in figures 3 and 4 are consistent with the sharp elevation
and slow declines in the unemployment rate and unemployment durations shown in figures 1
and 2. The Great Recession was a period of serious disruption of employment relationships,
and it is clear that unemployed workers had a difficult time finding new jobs. The dynamics
of unemployment in the Great Recession and its aftermath were fundamentally different
from unemployment dynamics in earlier recessions, where the changes in the unemployment
rate, unemployment durations, and flows out of employment and unemployment were less
pronounced and recovered to pre-recession levels relatively quickly.
    I turn now to analyses of the experience of displaced workers in order to understand
more about the incidence and consequences of job loss in the Great Recession and the slow
recovery and how labor market outcomes for job losers differ from the experience in earlier
time periods.


3     The Displaced Workers Survey

I analyze data on 1,203,109 individuals between the ages of twenty and sixty-four from the
DWS conducted as part of the January or February CPS in even years from 1984 through

                                                                                                                    5
2014. The survey is meant to capture worker terminations as the result of business decisions
of the employer (e.g., a plant closing, a layoff, the abolition of a job) unrelated to the
performance or choices of the particular employee. As such, it is not meant to capture
voluntary job changes (quits) or termination “for cause.” While the precise question asked
varied somewhat over time, in January 2010 respondents were asked:

         “During the last 3 calendar years, that is, January 2007 through December 2009,
         did (name/you) lose a job or leave one because: (your/his/her) plant or company
         closed or moved, (your/his/her) position or shift was abolished, insufficient work
         or another similar reason?”

The recall window was five years in the 1984-1992 DWS, and it changed to three years in
1994.4
       In order to investigate the consequences of job loss, I use a set of followup questions in the
DWS asked of workers who report having lost a job. Unfortunately, since 1994, the follow-up
questions were asked only of job losers whose reported reason for the job loss was one of three
reasons: slack work, plant closing, or position/shift abolished. I term these the “big three”
reasons. Workers who lost jobs due to the ending of a temporary job, the ending of a self-
employment situation, or “other” reasons were not asked the follow-up questions. In order
to maintain comparability across years my analysis of post-job-loss experience, regardless of
year, uses only workers who lost jobs for one of the “big three” reasons. Additionally, in
order to have a consistent sample over time, I do not use information on the post job-loss
experience of job losers in the 1984-1992 DWS whose reported job loss was more than three
years prior to the interview date.
       There are some important issues of definition implicit in the design of this question that
are not always recognized in analyses using the DWS. Job loss as measured in these data
almost certainly does not represent all job loss about which we ought to be concerned.
Specifically, the distinction between quits and layoffs is not always clear. Firms may wish to
reduce employment without laying off workers, and they might accomplish this by reducing or
failing to raise wages.5 This can encourage workers (perhaps those having better alternatives)

   4
     There are important issues of measurement and interpretation that arise when comparing job loss rates
calculated using the DWS over time, including changes in wording of the key questions as well as the change
in 1994 in the recall period from five years to three years. See Farber (1997) and Farber (2004) for detailed
discussions of these issues and the procedures I use to reweight the data to yield adjusted job loss rates that
are comparable over time.
   5
     This is consistent with work by Jacobsen, LaLonde, and Sullivan (1993) who find that displaced workers
suffer earnings declines even before they are displaced.

to quit. Other workers (perhaps those having worse alternatives) might be willing to continue
to work at reduced wages. To the extent that these are important phenomena, the sample
of individuals observed to be displaced by the definition used in the DWS is a potentially
non-random sub-sample of “truly displaced” workers. The consequences of this are difficult
to measure, but it is worth noting that the ability of employers to offer at least nominal
wage decreases to their workers can be quite limited (Bewley, 1999), a factor that may be
particularly important in the relatively low inflation environment of the last 20 years.


4        The Rate of Job Loss

Figure 5 contains plots of adjusted three-year job loss rates computed from each of the 16
DWSs from 1984-2014 along with the civilian unemployment rate for the year preceding each
survey.6 The cyclical behavior of job loss is apparent, with job-loss rates clearly positively
correlated with the unemployment rate (ρ = 0.79).7 Both unemployment and job-loss rates

        All counts in the figures I present are weighted using the CPS sampling weights.
    7
     Another possibility would be to use the average unemployment rate for the three years preceding each
survey. However, reported rates of job loss are always higher in the year immediately preceding the survey
relative to the rates of job loss two and three years preceding the survey. This may be the result of recall
bias noted by Topel (1990). Empirically, the correlation of the rate of job loss with the unemployment rate
in the year preceding the survey (ρ =0.79) is much higher than the correlation of the rate of job loss with



                                                                                     7

were very high in the two most serious recessionary periods (1981-83 and 2007-09, the 1984
and 2010 survey years respectively). While the unemployment rates were comparable in 1983
and 2009 (9.6 percent vs. 9.3 percent), the job loss rate was much higher in the 2007-2009
period than in the 1981-83 period (16.0 percent vs. 12.8 percent). Additionally, the job loss
rate fell much more sharply after the 2010 DWS than did the unemployment rate. These
patterns suggest that the Great Recession was associated with a much higher job loss rate
than the norm, which makes it of particular interest to study the consequences of job loss in
the Great Recession and its aftermath.


4.1     Education and Job Loss
Figure 6 contains three-year rates of job loss by year for each of four education categories.
Not surprisingly, job loss rates are dramatically higher for less educated workers than for
more educated workers. For example, the job loss rate for workers with twelve years of
education was 9.4 percent in 1997-99 (the lowest in the sample period) compared with 14.3
percent in 1981-83 and 19.4 percent in 2007-09. In contrast, the job loss rate for workers
with at least sixteen years of education was 5.4 percent in 1987-89 compared with 6.9 percent
in 1981-83 and 11.0 percent in 2007-2009. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, the job

loss rate fell for workers in all education groups and converged somewhat. Clearly, there is a
cyclical pattern in job loss rates for all educational groups, but the cyclical fluctuations are
much larger for less educated workers.
   Cyclical fluctuations in job loss rates have grown over time for more educated workers.
Early on, there was little cyclical movement of job loss rates for workers with at least 16 years
of education. Job loss rates for these workers fell only slightly in the recovery from the early
1980s recession. However, the rate of job loss increased substantially in the 1989-91 period,
did not fall much during the subsequent recovery, increased again from 1997-2003, before
falling through 2007. In the 2007-09 period, the job loss rate of college graduates increased
sharply (from 6 percent in 2005-07 to 11 percent in 2007-09) before declining. While the
2007-09 rate of job loss for college graduates was substantially below the rate for workers
with less education, it was at a historically high level. One conclusion is that more educated
workers are less vulnerable to job loss, but even their vulnerability has increased over time.
A final point is that job loss rates have declined since 2009 for workers in all educational
groups. However, they remain above rates of job loss for educationally comparable workers
in the pre-recession period. For example, the rate of job loss for college educated workers
was 7.4 percent in 2011-13 versus 6.0 percent in 2005-07.


4.2    Age and Job Loss
Figure 7 contains three-year job loss rates by year for four age groups covering the range
from 20-64. Job loss rates are highest for the youngest workers (20-29) and generally show
the standard cyclical pattern. The job loss rates of the oldest two groups, ages 40-49 and
50-64, are very similar. There has been some convergence over time in rates of job loss by
age, with the rates for older workers increasing relative to those for younger workers. As
expected, the job loss rates for each age group spiked sharply in the Great Recession period
and declined sharply in the aftermath but remain above the levels of the pre-recession period.
For example, the rate of job loss workers aged 30-39 was 10.1 percent in 2011-13 versus 8.2
percent in 2005-07.


4.3    Tenure and Job Loss
Job tenure is an important job characteristic that is related to job security and job quality
(e.g., earnings). Abraham and Medoff (1984) documented that many employers (even non-
union) have policies that take tenure into account when selecting workers for layoff. Given

the well-documented decline in long-term employment in the United States (e.g., Farber
(2007)) it is worth investigating the relationship between tenure and job loss. This analysis
is facilitated by the fact that, since 1996, the Current Population Surveys that contain a
Displaced Workers Survey also contain a mobility supplement with information on how long
an individual has worked for his current employer. I assign tenure for the job losers from
their response on the DWS to question asking how long they had worked for the employer on
the lost job. I assign tenure for those workers who did not lose a job based on their response
to a question in the mobility supplement asking how long they had worked for their current
employer.
   This combined measure is not perfect. The timing is not quite right. Respondents to
the DWS and mobility supplements were at risk to lose a job during a three-year window
preceding the date of the survey, and a job loser’s tenure referred to some time in that
three-year window. The tenure for those who did not lose jobs is measured as of the date of
the DWS/mobility survey (January or February of the survey year). Some of these workers
(those with low tenure) would likely have been on different jobs during the earlier three-year
window. And some of those who did not lose jobs but are not employed at the survey date
will not be included in the analysis. Still, as long as the tenure distribution is changing
slowly, the survey-date distribution of tenure for those employed who did not report a job
loss is likely a good approximation to the tenure distribution among those employed during

the three-year window for job loss. I proceed using this mixed measure.
   Figure 8 contains a plot of the job loss rate over the 20-year period from 1993-2013 broken
down by tenure category. In every year, the job loss rate is monotonically decreasing with
tenure. This is not a surprise. The job loss rate is far higher for workers on the first year of
their job than for workers in any other tenure category. This is due to at least three factors.
First, these are the workers most vulnerable to layoff in a demand downturn. Second, the
first year of the job is a period of learning about match quality, and low quality matches are
likely to end early (Jovanovic, 1979). Third, there is surely heterogeneity across workers in
their underlying turnover rates resulting is very high turnover rates early in jobs among high
mobility workers (Farber, 1999). And some of this will come in the form of job loss rather
than quits.
   Workers with 1-3 years of tenure have somewhat lower job loss rates, but still high
compared with workers with more than 3 years of tenure. Workers in the two lowest tenure
categories (less than 1 year and 1-3 years) have seen substantial cyclical variation in their job
loss rates, with the increase in the Great Recession being particularly sharp. Workers in the
highest two tenure categories (3-10 years and more than 10 years) had relatively low rates
of job loss that, until the great recession, did not vary very much with the cycle. However,
in the Great Recession, even these workers saw a sharp increase (relative to their low base
rate) in their job loss rate. For example, workers with more than 10 years tenure had a job

5         Consequences of Job Loss: Employment and Unemployment

I start with an examination of how the distribution o f survey-date labor force status of job
losers has varied over time. Figure 9 contains plots of the fraction employed, unemployed,
and not in the labor force at the DWS survey dates for job losers in each of the DWSs.
It is clear from this figure that the post-displacement employment rate is pro-cyclical, with
relatively low employment rates in surveys covering the slack labor markets 1984, 1992, 2002,
and 2010. The most striking feature of this plot is that the post-displacement employment
rate is substantially lower, at less than 50 percent, in the 2010 survey (covering job loss in
the 2007-2009 period of the Great Recession) than in any earlier period. And, while the
post-displacement employment rate of job losers increased in the 2012 and 2014 surveys
(covering the 2009-2013 periods), the employment rate remains lower than in any earlier
period, including those with very strong labor markets.
        Not surprisingly, the fraction of job losers who report being unemployed at the survey-
date moves counter-cyclically, with peak unemployment shares at the 1984, 1992, 2002, and
2010 survey dates.8 The most striking feature of the unemployment plot is that the post-

displacement unemployment share is substantially higher, about 40 percent, in the 2010
survey than in any earlier period. And, while the post-displacement unemployment share
of job losers decreased in the 2012 and 2014 surveys (covering the 2009-2013 periods), the
unemployment share remains high by historical standards.
    The survey-date fraction of job losers not in the labor force is remarkably constant across
all years, at about 10 percent. There is no evidence that job losers are disproportionately
discouraged in recessions, including the most recent recession, leading to withdrawal from
the labor force.
    There are important differences in post-displacement labor force status across workers
with different demographic characteristics, and changes in these characteristics could account
for some of the time series patterns shown in figure 9. In order to address this I estimate a
linear probability model of the post-job-loss employment status that accounts for differences
in sex, race, age (5 categories), education (4 categories), tenure on the lost job (5 categories),
the number of years between the job loss and the survey date (3 categories), and survey year
(16 categories).
    Figure 10 contains plots of the raw and regression-adjusted fraction employed at the DWS


losers. The fraction of job losers who report being unemployed uses as a base the number of job losers while
the unemployment rate of job losers is uses as a base the number of job losers in the labor force (employed
plus unemployed).



                                                                                                    13
survey date for job losers in each of the DWSs. The raw fractions are simple tabulations
of the data (identical to the appropriate series in figure 9) while the adjusted fractions are
derived from the linear probability model of survey-date employment status I described.9
The key result is that the raw and adjusted probabilities are almost identical throughout
(simple correlation = 0.989), which implies that any changes in the characteristics of job
losers over time are unrelated to the time-series movements in post-displacement employment
probabilities.
      The linear probability model shows substantial differences in post-displacement employ-
ment probabilities for workers of different characteristics, and I examine these directly. The
first column of table 1 contains estimates of the linear probability model of post-job-loss
employment at the DWS survey date that underlie the adjusted estimates of the year effects
in figure 10. These estimates show that more educated workers are substantially more likely
to be employed subsequent to job loss, with a college - high school gap in the employment
probability of 12.5 percentage points. Older workers are less likely to be employed, with
workers aged 55-64 about 16 percentage points less likely than workers aged 35-44 to be
employed. Females are about 6 percentage points less likely than men to be employed, while
nonwhites are about 10 percentage points less likely than whites to be employed. Workers
who lost jobs with 1-20 years tenure are 3 to 4 percentage points more likely than workers
who lost short-term (less than one year) job to be employed, while workers who lost jobs
with more than 20 years tenure are about 8 percentage points less likely than workers who
lost jobs with 1-20 years tenure to be employed. Finally, elapsed time since job loss has an
important effect on the likelihood of employment at the survey date. Workers who lost jobs
more than one year prior to the DWS survey date are about 20 percentage points more likely
to be employed then are workers who lost a job in the year immediately prior to the survey
date.
      While the plot of the fraction not in the labor force (NILF) at the DWS survey date
subsequent to a job loss does not show much movement over time, I calculated adjusted
post-job-loss NILF rates using the same specification (controlling for education, age, sex,
race, tenure on the lost job, and years since job loss) underlying figure 10 for post-job-loss
employment rates. A plot of the adjusted and unadjusted post-job-loss NILF fractions are
presented in figure 11. I have expanded the vertical scale to provide more definition, and

  9
     The actual numbers presented for the adjusted probabilities are the coefficients on the survey year
dummy variables in the linear probability model plus the measured average employment probability for the
omitted survey year (1984).

    Figure 11: Fraction of Job Losers Not in the Labor Force at Survey Date, by Year


it appears that movement out of the labor force after job loss has become slightly more
common since the early 1990s. Again, there is not much difference between the raw NILF
fractions and the adjusted NILF fractions.
   Column 2 of table 1 contains estimates of the linear probability model for being out of
the labor force subsequent to job loss. I do not go through all of the results, but a few bear
mentioning. First, females are about 10 percentage points more likely to exit the labor force
subsequent to job loss. Second, job losers aged 55-64 are at least 10 percentage points more
likely to exit the labor force than are younger job losers, perhaps moving to early retirement.
Third, those who lose jobs with more than 20 years tenure are at least 7 percentage points
more likely than workers with less tenure to exit the labor force. Again, this may reflect
a move toward retirement, as workers who have been in their jobs more than 20 years are
likely to have access to more generous pension benefits.
   Workers who lose jobs may have unstable subsequent employment histories. A job loser
may move in and out of jobs, at least for some period. Beginning with the 1986 DWS, job
losers were asked if they ever were employed subsequent to the job loss. All job losers who
were employed at the DWS survey data would answer this question affirmatively, but others,
who found and then left a job after the job loss, would also answer affirmatively. Figure 12
contains plots of the fraction ever employed subsequent to the job loss overall and broken
down by time since job loss. First note that there is a substantial gap between this fraction

                                Figure 12: Fraction Ever Employed Subsequent to Job Loss, by Year


and the fraction employed at the survey date (figure 10). For example, in the great recession
period (2010 DWS), about 50 percent of job losers 2007-09 where employed in January 2010
while about 56 percent of job losers 2007-2009 had held at least one subsequent job. Second,
the probability of having held a job increases with the time since job loss. Again looking
at job losses in the 2007-09 period, 69 percent of workers who lost jobs in 2007 or 2008 had
held at least one job by January 2010. In contrast, only 44 percent of workers who lost jobs
in 2009 had held at least one job by January 2010. Third, there is a clear counter-cyclical
pattern to job finding that is particularly apparent in the Great Recession, and there has
only been a small recovery in its aftermath. The fraction of workers who lost jobs in the
2011-13 period who subsequently found another job remains lower (at 68 percent) than in
any period prior to the Great Recession.
   Column 3 of table 1 contains estimates of the linear probability model for ever being
employed subsequent to the job loss. Not surprisingly, the patterns here are very similar to
those for survey-date employment (column 1 of the table).
   Next, I examine the length of time it takes job losers to find another job. However, the
DWS is not well designed to study this question. The core question in the DWS, included
in the survey from 1988 on, is “After that job [referring to the lost job] ended, how many
weeks went by before you started working again at another job?” However, this question is
asked of all job losers only from 1988-1992. From 1996 on the question is asked only of job

losers who found another job.10 Therefore, consistent data are available from the 1988-92
and 1996-2014 DWSs, and there is no consistent information for job losers who did not find
another job.
      I proceed with an analysis of average weeks to find a job conditional on finding a job.
This is plotted in figure 13. The time to find a job increased dramatically from 2005-07
to 2009-11 after declining from the mid 1980s through 2000. The job-finding time fell in
most recent period (2011-13), but it is still higher than any pre-Great-Recession period.
The multivariate analysis of job-finding time, contained in column 4 of table 1 shows small
differences by education (a college high-school gap of less than one week) but large gaps
by age. Reemployed job losers who are 45-64 take 3-4 weeks longer to find jobs than the
youngest job losers. Similarly, reemployed high-tenure job losers take longer to find a new
job. The relationship is monotone. Relative to workers who lost very short jobs, those who
lost a job with 3-10 years tenure take 2 weeks longer to find a job while those with more
than 20 year tenure on the lost job take 4 weeks longer. Reemployed females and nonwhites
take one to two weeks longer to find jobs.
      Interestingly, those who lost their job more than one year ago take substantially more
time to find their new job (6 to 8 weeks more). It may be that those who report losing a

                                                                    18
job in the year immediately prior to the survey have not had much time to search (and so
mechanically cannot report long durations). This is also consistent with the pattern of lower
employment probabilities for those who lost jobs in the year prior to the survey (columns
1 and 3 of table 1).11 Another explanation may be related to recall bias (Topel, 1990). If,
with the passage of time, job losses with more serious consequences are more likely to be
recalled, then the job losses reported having happened more than one year before the survey
date would be more likely those with longer post-job-loss spells of non-employment.
      The overall pattern that I have described in this section and summarized in figures 9-13
highlight just how serious the effect of the Great Recession was on the ability of job losers to
find employment. The perhaps surprising general finding is that even by 2013 (the last year
covered by the DWS and 4 years after the end of the Great Recession) is that the ability
of workers to find jobs remains compromised. None of the measures I have presented and
discussed has returned to what would have been considered normal levels prior to the Great
Recession.


6       Consequences of Job Loss: Job Quality

6.1      Post-Displacement Full-Time/Part-Time Status
Many reemployed job losers are employed part time subsequent to job loss. Some of these
workers lost part-time jobs but many had lost full-time jobs. In addition to having lower
weekly earnings, it is well known that part-time workers have substantially lower hourly
wage rates and less access to fringe benefits like health insurance than do full-time workers
(Farber and Levy (2000)). The DWS collects information on part-time status (less than
35 hours per week) on the lost job, and it is straightforward to compute part-time status
on post-displacement jobs from the standard CPS hours information. The analysis in this
section focuses only on individuals employed at the survey date, and all part-time rates are
computed based on this group of workers.
      Figure 14 contains plots of part-time status on the lost job and the new job. The fact that
a substantially higher fraction of post-job-loss jobs than lost jobs are part time, implies that
a potentially important cost of job loss is movement from full-time to part-time employment.
The rate of part-time employment after jobs loss has been increasing since 2000 and jumped
sharply in the Great Recession, from 17.7 percent in 2008 to 23.6 percent in 2010. Once

 11
      It is unfortunate, that the DWS does not collect information on the precise date of job loss.

again, there has been only an incomplete recovery in since 2010, but the post-job-loss part-
time rate remains higher than in any previous period (at 21.7 percent in 2014).
       Another perpsective on these data is provided by figure 15, which contains a plot of the
fraction of employed job losers who are employed part-time at each survey date conditional
on part-time status on the lost job.12 Not surprisingly, workers who lose part-time jobs are
substantially more likely to be working on part-time jobs at the survey date. Many of these
workers are part-time due to labor supply choices, and it is reasonable to expect that these
workers would continue to choose to work part time. It is noteworthy, then, that on the
order of 50 percent of part-time job losers are working full-time at the survey date, although
this fraction has decreased substantially since the late 1980s. Among reemployed part-time
job losers in the 2007-09 period, about 46 percent were working full-time in January 2010.
       In terms of the cost of job loss, the more interesting group to study consists of those
workers who lost full-time jobs. Between 10 and 15 percent of these job losers were working
part-time at the survey dates from 1984-2008. The part-time rate among full-time job losers
increased substantially to 20 percent in 2010. Thus, even among the 50 percent of job losers

  12
     Note that there is a problem of temporal comparability of the data on part-time employment at the
survey date. The new survey instrument, first used in the 1994 CPS, asks a different battery of questions
about hours of work on the current job, and this may have the effect of raising the fraction of workers
reporting they are currently working part time (Polivka and Miller, 1998). The survey question regarding
whether the lost job was part-time is unchanged in the 1994 and later DWSs.

who were reemployed in January 2010, a substantial fraction of full-time job losers did not
find full time employment. Again, there has been only a partial recovery from the Great
Recession. The part-time rate among full-time job losers fell from 20 percent in January
2010 to 15.9 percent in January 2014, higher than at any point prior to the Great Recession.
   Columns 5 and 6 of table 1 contain a pair of multivariate analyses of the probability
of part-time employment. The first analysis, in column 5, is an analysis of the probability
of part-time employment among all job losers, both full-time and part-time, and includes a
control for part-time status on the lost job. Not surprisingly given that part-time status is
strongly influenced by labor supply, losers of part-time jobs are 30 percentage points more
likely than full-time job losers to be working on a part-time job at the DWS survey date.
There are some other regularities. Females are about 10 percentage points more likely to
be working part-time after job loss, even after accounting for part-time status on the lost
job. The post-job-loss part-time rate is negatively related to education. With regard to
age, the youngest (aged 20-24) and oldest (aged 55-64) job losers are, 5 and 7 percentage
points repsectively, more likely to be in part-time jobs subsequent to job loss. This may
reflect young job losers returning to school and old job losers moving toward retirement.
Interestingly, the post-job-loss part-time rate is significantly higher for workers who lost a
job in the year immediately preceding the DWS survey date. This suggests that some job
losers may take part-time jobs while they continue to search for full-time employemnt. The



                                                                                                    21
second analysis of part-time employment, in column 6 of table 1, focuses on full-time job
losers only, and the results are very similar to those for all job losers.
       The conclusion from the analysis of part-time vs. full-time employment after job loss is
that an important component of the cost of job loss is the inability of a substantial fraction of
job losers, especially full-time job losers, to find a full-time job. This problem was particularly
severe in the Great Recession but remains a problem even for workers who lost jobs in the
2011-2013 period.


6.2       Decreased Weekly Earnings Due to Displacement
The analysis of the decrease in weekly earnings of reemployed displaced workers proceeds in
two stages. First, I investigate the change in earnings between the lost job and the job held
at the DWS survey date. However, had the displaced worker not lost his or her job, earnings
may have grown over the interval between the date of job loss and the DWS survey date.
While it is not possible to know what the counterfactual course of wages would have been
absent displacement, one potential estimate is to use the earnings of observationally similar
workers who were not displaced over the same period. Thus, second, I create estimates of the
weekly earnings decrease suffered by displaced workers, including both the decline in earnings
of the displaced workers and the increase in earnings over the same period experienced by
non-displaced workers. In order to measure this earnings drop, a control group of non-
displaced workers is required, and, later in this section, I provide such a control group using
data from the CPS outgoing rotation groups.

6.2.1      Difference Estimates of the Change in Earnings as a Result of Job Loss

I begin the analysis of earnings changes by examining the difference in real weekly earnings
for job losers between the post-displacement job and the job from which the worker was
displaced.13 The solid line in figure 16 shows the average proportional decline, by survey
year, in real weekly earnings between the lost job and the survey-date job for all workers
who lost a job, were reemployed at the survey date, and were not self-employed on either
the lost job or the new job. It is clear that there is a cyclical component to the earnings
decline, with larger declines in slack labor market periods. The average earnings decline in

  13
     Earnings are deflated by the 1982-84=100 consumer price index (CPI). The CPI in the reported year
of displacement is used to deflate earnings on the old job. The CPI for the DWS survey month is used to
deflate current earnings.

the Great Recession is the largest in my sample period at 17.5 percent. This compares with
a decline of 14.1 percent in 1984 and 15.9 percent in 1992. In contrast to the incomplete
recovery in the aftermath of the Great Recession of the employment measures I examined,
the average earnings decline of job losers was much less severe, with a decline of only 6.4
percent for jobs lost 2011-13.
   Because my measure of earnings is weekly, part of the measured earnings change reflects
voluntary or involuntary hours change (movement to or from full-time work). The lower
dashed line in figure 16 is the average earnings change of full-time job losers. Not surprisingly,
this closely parallels the earnings change of all job losers (correlation 0.986) because most
reported loss is of full-time jobs (almost 90 percent). The reason full-time job losers have
larger average earnings declines is that some full-time workers are reemployed on part-time
jobs (figure 15). The upper dashed line in figure 16 is the average earnings change of part-
time job losers. This is positive in every period because many losers of part-time jobs are
employed subsequently on full-time jobs (48 percent overall, figure 15). In summary, job
losers suffer substantial earnings declines on average, and the average decline was largest for
jobs lost in the Great Recession.
   Given that a large majority of job losers lost full-time jobs, I focus on the experience
of these workers. The solid line in figure 17, which reproduces the lower dashed line in
the figure 16, is the average earnings change of full-time job losers. The upper dashed line

in figure 17 is the average earnings change of job losers who make a full-time to full-time
transition. This closely parallels the earnings change of all full-time job losers (correlation
0.927) because most reemployed full-time job losers are reemployed full time. (86.8 percent).
The lower dashed line in figure 17 is the average earnings change of job losers who have made
a FT-PT transition. This is substantial and negative, because of the decline in weekly hours
in moving from full-time to part-time.
       All of these series show a cyclical pattern, with larger earnings declines in weaker labor
markets. That this decline is largest for job loss during the Great Recession (2010 DWS)
is due largely to the higher incidence of part-time employment on the new job among both
full-time and part-time job losers. The earnings decline holding FT-PT status fixed is not
particularly large in this period relative to other slack labor market periods.14
       In table 2, I present the results of multivariate regression analyses of the log earnings
change of reemployed displaced workers, controlling for year, education, age, race, sex, tenure
on the lost job, and years since job loss. The estimates in the first column of the table refer
to all job losers, and there are important regularities. Job losers with at least a 4-year college
education have a significantly smaller wage decline than do high school graduates. Older
job losers suffer substantially larger earnings declines, with the oldest group (aged 55-64)

  14
     The differences between the earnings decline holding FT-PT status fixed between 2010 and earlier slack
labor market periods (1984, 1992, 1994, and 2004) are not statistically significant.

Note: Based on data from the 1984-2014 DWS. Weighted by CPS sampling weights. The base category
consists of white males in 1984 aged 20-24 with 12 years of education and less than one year of tenure and
who lost a job in the calendar year immediately prior to the survey date. All models include a complete set
of survey year fixed effects. Robust standard errors are in parentheses.

suffering a 20 log point larger decline than do workers aged 20-24. Middle aged job losers
(aged 35-54) suffer a 10 log point larger decline. There is a very strong relationship between
the change in earnings and tenure on the lost job. The average earnings decline is much
larger when the worker had accumulated substantial tenure on the lost job (34 log points
for workers who lose a job with more than 20 years tenure). This is consistent with the
destruction of job or industry specific human capital when a long-term job ends.15 There
are only small differences by sex and race, and workers who lost a job more than one year
prior to the survey date have slightly smaller earnings losses.
       Given that an important component of earnings changes are due to movement from full-
time to part-time or the reverse, I reestimated the model including indicators for part-time
status on the lost and new jobs. These estimates are contained in column 2 of table 2, and
they indicate, not surprisingly, that hours on the lost and new jobs strongly affect the change
in weekly earnings.16 The effects are approximately equal in magnitude and of opposite sign,
with the change in earnings 69 log points higher if the lost job was part time and 73 log
points lower if the new job is part time. This implies that workers making a part-time to
part-time transition have about a 4 percentage point larger earnings decline than do workers
who make a full-time to full-time transition. The general pattern of results with respect to
the other variables included in the model are similar to that seen in column 1 of the table.17
       The next two columns of table 2 consider full-time and part-time job losers separately.
The estimates for full-time job losers in column 3 show a similar pattern to those for the
overall sample in column 1. This is not surprising given that most job loss is of full-time
jobs. The estimates for part-time job losers are somewhat noisy given the small size of the
sample, though it appears that females who report losing a part-time job suffer substantially
larger earnings declines (about 16 log points) than do males.
       The final two columns of table 2 examine the experience of full-time job losers separately
by whether they made a FT-FT transition or a FT-PT transition. The estimates for the
FT-FT group are in column 5, and they show very little relationship with education. Age
and tenure continue to have strong negative effects on earnings decline though not as large as
for all losers (column 1) or all full-time losers (column 3). The estimates in the last column of

  15
     Kletzer (1989), Neal (1995), and Parent (2000) address the issue of job loss and specific capital, both
at the firm and industry level. See also Podgursky and Swaim (1987), Topel (1990), and de la Rica (1992).
  16
     This drives the increase in the R-squared from 0.03 when hours are not accounted for (column 1) to
0.21 when hours are accounted for (column 2).
  17
      One exception is that, once part-time status on the lost and new jobs are accounted for, there is no
difference in the earnings change between job losers with high school and 4-year college educations.

table 2, for job losers who make a FT-PT transition show stark differences. College graduates
who make a FT-PT transition suffer much large earnings losses (about 21 log points) than
do high school graduates who make the same transition. In addition, age and tenure have
much larger effects on the earnings loss for workers making at FT-PT transition. Taken
together, the results in columns 5 and 6 of table 2 are consistent with the idea that when
high wage workers (more educated, older, higher tenure) lose a full-time job and do not find
another full-time job, their earnings declines are substantial, perhaps reflecting a sharp drop
in the skill requirements from the lost full-time job to the new part-time job. The was a
particularly serious problem in the Great Recession and its aftermath given the relatively
high rate of post-displacement part-time employment.
   The estimated differences in earnings decline by year are not shown for the various models
estimated in table 2 but are presented graphically. Figure 18 contains plots of the year effects
associated with the estimates in columns 1, 3, and 4 of the table for all job losers, full-time job
losers, and part-time job losers respectively. They are normalized to the 1984 mean earnings
loss for the appropriate group to facilitate comparison with the unadjusted earnings losses
by year shown in figure 16. These regression adjusted average earnings losses by year are
slightly attenuated relative to the unadjusted earnings losses but otherwise show very similar
time-series movement.

6.2.2   Difference-in-Difference Estimates of the Effect of Job Loss on Earnings

In order to provide an estimate of the extent to which earnings might have grown had workers
not been displaced, I generate a comparison group of workers using a random sample from
the merged outgoing rotation group (MOGRG) files of the CPS for the three calendar years
prior to each DWS (period 0) together with all workers from the outgoing rotation groups of
the CPSs containing the DWSs (period t). The data from MOGRG files of the CPS provide
the period 0 earnings, and the data from the outgoing rotation rotation groups in the CPSs
containing the DWSs provide the period t earnings.
   This analysis is restricted to full-time workers. In particular, the job losers considered
are only those who are reemployed and make full-time to full-time transitions. As such, it
will understate the true earnings loss of displacement for two reasons. First, it considers
only those who are reemployed (50 percent of job losers in the Great Recession and about
60 percent in the most recent period). Second, it ignores the fact that many full-time job
losers are reemployed in part-time jobs (about 20 percent in the Great Recession and 16
percent in the most recent period), offset to some extent by those part-time job losers who

                                                                                                       28
are reemployed in full-time jobs.
       Define the change in log real earnings for displaced workers as

                                          ∆d = (lnWdt − lnWd0 ),                                              (1)

and define the difference in log real earnings for workers in the comparison group as

                                          ∆c = (lnWct − lnWc0 ),                                              (2)

where d refers to displaced workers (the “treatment” group), c refers to non-displaced workers
(the “control” group), t refers to ”current” (post-displacement) period, and 0 refers to the
“initial” (pre-displacement) period. The difference-in-difference estimate of the change in
log real weekly earnings due to job loss in is computed as

                                               ∆∆ = ∆d − ∆c .                                                 (3)

To the extent that average earnings would have grown rather than declined in the absence of
displacement, ∆c will be positive so that the difference-in-difference estimate of the average
earnings decline (∆∆) will be larger in absolute value than the simple difference estimate
(∆d ).
       I generate initial earnings for the comparison group (lnWg0 ) from a random sub-sample
of the merged outgoing rotation group CPS file (MOGRG) each year from 1981-2013.18
The resulting comparison sample of initial earnings for full-time workers contains 174,736
observations.The CPSs containing the DWSs have two outgoing rotation groups (OGRGs)
with earnings data for all workers. These provide the observations on current earnings for
the comparison group of non-displaced workers (lnWgt ). This sample contains observations
on full-time earnings for 181,799 workers at the DWS survey date.
       The data for the treatment group (job losers) come from the DWSs, where lnWdt is
survey-date earnings for displaced workers and lnWd0 is earnings on the lost job. The pre-
displacement sample consists of all displaced workers who were not self-employed but were

  18
     The size of the random sample was set so that 1) the size of the sample with initial earnings on the
control group was expected to be the same size as that with current earnings on the control group (two
rotation groups) and 2) the distribution of years since the associated DWS survey date roughly mimicked
the distribution of years since displacement in the sample of displaced workers. In other words, a separate
control sample was drawn for each DWS from the three MOGRGs for the years immediately prior to the
DWS that reflected the distribution of time since job loss. Each MOGRG file has 24 rotation groups (2 per
month for 12 months). Denote the share of reported job loss one, two, and three years prior to the survey
date t as p1t , p2t , and p3t respectively. In order to get the appropriate sample size in survey year t, I took a
random sample with probability (p1t )(2)/24. Similarly, for the second and third years prior to to the DWS
I took random samples with probability (p2t )(2)/24 and (p3t )(2)/24, respectively.

                                                       29
employed full-time on the lost job and who were employed with earnings available at the
survey date (n=30,106). The postdisplacement sample consists of all displaced workers who
were not self-employed but were employed full-time at the survey date and who had earnings
data available on the lost job (n=26,850).
       The difference-in-difference estimates are derived using these data from separate ordinary
least squares (OLS) regressions for each DWS survey year of log real earnings (deflated by
the CPI) on a set of worker characteristics and an indicator for time period (before or after
displacement), an indicator for whether the observation is part of the “contaminated” control
sample or part of the displacement sample, and the interaction of the time period and sample
indicators.19 This is of the form year of the form

                             lnWis = Xis β + γ1 Ts + γ2 Di + γ3 Ts Di + is ,                               (4)

where lnWis measures log real full-time earnings for individual i in period s (either 0 or
t), X is a vector of individual characteristics, β is a vector of coefficients, Ts is a dummy
variable indicating the post-displacement period, Di is a dummy variable indicating the
displacement sample, and  is an error term.20 The estimates of the parameters γj are used
along with information from the DWS on period-specific job loss rates to adjust for the
fact that the control group from the MOGRG data in period 0 is “contaminated” with job
losers to compute estimates of the earnings effects21 My adjustment procedure is described
in Appendix I.
       Figure 20 contains the overall regression-adjusted difference-in-difference estimates of
the proportional earnings change from job loss for each year.22 In order for the figure to
be clearly readable, the earnings decline for displaced workers in presented as a positive

  19
      Note that I do not calculate first-differenced estimates for the displaced workers, as I did in section
6.2.1, despite the fact that the observations are paired. This is because observations for the control group
are from a set of cross-sections and are not paired. I do not account for the correlation over time in the two
observations for each displaced worker.
  20
     The X vector includes a constant, dummy variables for sex, race, nine age categories, and four educa-
tional categories.
  21
      Ideally, the comparison groups based on the MOGRG samples would contain only workers who had not
lost a job during the relevant period. While I can identify the non-displaced workers in period t (since the
data come from the CPSs with DWSs), I cannot identify the non-displaced workers in the period 0 MOGRG
samples.
  22
      Note that the differences (or DIDs) in log earnings are approximations to the appropriate proportional
differences (or DIDs) in earnings. I transform the differences in log earnings to proportional differences using
the usual relationship that, with a log difference of δ, the proportional difference is eδ − 1. The difference-
in-difference estimate plotted in the figure is then calculated as the difference of the transformed differences
(∆∆ = e∆d − e∆c ).

number (the negative of the earnings change for displaced workers: −∆d ). The foregone
earnings increase is ∆c , and the difference-in-difference earnings effect is ∆∆. Note that
these estimates incorporate the effect of normal growth along the age-earnings profile. This
is because the age variables in the regression are measured at the DWS survey date (period
t) for both the period 0 and period t observations.23
       The results show that in the 1980s displaced workers earned about 9 percent less on
average after displacement than before while earnings for the control group rose by about
4.5 percent over the same period. The difference-in-difference estimate of the earnings loss is
the difference between these numbers, which is a loss of about 13 percent during the 1980s.24
The 1990s show a different pattern. The earnings decline of displaced workers in the 1990s
dropped sharply during the decade, from 11.3 percent in the 1989-91 period to a statistically
insignificant 0.9 percent in 1997-99. During the same period, the earnings growth of the
control group increased from 1.8 percent in 1989-91 to 6.9 percent in 1997-99, reflecting a
general increase in real wages in the late 1990s. The difference-in-difference estimate of the

    This is one reason why it is important that the sample fractions in the initial-earnings control group
mimic the fractions in the treatment group with respect to the time until the DWS survey date. See footnote

  24
     Since in the figure I present the earnings decline rather than the earnings change for displaced workers,
the difference-in-difference estimate is the negative of the sum of the earnings decline for displaced workers
and the foregone earnings increase.


                                                                        31
earnings loss associated with job loss decreased during the 1990s (from a high of 13.1 percent
in 1989-91 to a low of 7.8 percent later in the decade), reflecting the fact that the earnings
decline suffered by displaced workers fell by more than the increase in earnings growth among
the comparison group.
    The picture changed in the 2000s. The foregone earnings increase fell from 5.9 percent
in 1997-1999 to zero in 2005-2007 while the earnings decline suffered by displaced workers
increased substantially from 0.9 percent in the 1997-99 period to 13.7 percent in 2001-03
before declining to 5.4 percent in 2005-2007. In the period covering the Great Recession
(2007-09), the earnings decline of job losers making a FT-FT transition is 7.6 percent with
a foregone earnings increase of 4.4 percent. This implies a total earnings loss from job
displacement for these workers of 12 percent, which is not unusually large by historical
standards. In the aftermath of the Great Recession earnings losses from both sources have
fallen. By 2011-2013, the earnings decline of job losers was 1.6 percent with a foregone
earnings increase of 2 percent for a total earnings loss of 3.6 percent, the lowest in the
sample period.


7     Concluding Remarks

My estimates of the costs of job loss based on the DWS show that displacement imposes a
significant economic burden on job losers. The first part of these costs are in the form of
difficulty in finding new employment and, importantly, difficulty in finding full-time employ-
ment. This component of costs was particularly severe for workers losing jobs in the Great
Recession, when only 50 percent of job losers reported being employed at the next DWS sur-
vey date (January 2010). And almost 25 percent of those job losers who did find jobs were
employed full time. Even among losers of full-time jobs between 2007 and 2009, only about
52 percent were employed in January 2010 and only 80 percent of those were reemployed in
a full-time job. Thus, only about 35-40 percent of those in the DWS who reported losing
a job from 2007-2009 period were employed full-time in January 2010. This was by far the
worst post-displacement employment experience in the sample period (1981-2014).
    Importantly, the adverse employment experience of job losers continued beyond the Great
Recession. While employment rates and full-time employment rates improved, those who lost
jobs even two to four years after the Great Recession (2011-2013) had very low employment
rates and very low full-time employment rates by historical standards. This is consistent
with the rather slow decline in the unemployment rate and the continuing high level of long-
term unemployment in the aftermath of the Great Recession. The long run consequences

                                             32
of the decreased ability to find employment subsequent to job loss and resulting long spells
of unemployment may be self-reinforcing in that some of these job losers, perhaps by being
scarred by a long spell of unemployment or simply perceived by employers as less able
workers, may have serious long-run difficulty in finding work.25 The second part of the cost
of job loss concerns post-displacement earnings on new jobs relative to earnings on the lost
job. While my analysis of the DWS shows substantial weekly earnings declines for reemployed
job losers (even those reemployed full-time), the earnings losses were not especially large by
historical standards in the Great Recession or its aftermath.
       The earnings declines I estimate generally are smaller than those that are derived using
administrative data.26 This is true for several reasons. Importantly, the concept of earning
change that I estimate using the DWS, weekly earnings for full-time workers, is more like a
wage rate. In contrast, the administrative data, typically from UI or Social Security records,
records quarterly earnings. Quarterly hours are likely be quite variable across weeks within
a quarter relative to the weekly hours of a full-time worker, particularly after a job loss.
Immediately after job loss, there will be whole or part quarters during which workers are
without jobs. Additionally, The earnings loss measure from administrative data includes the
loss in quarterly earnings that comes from a move from full-time to part-time employment
that is a consequence of job loss I document using the DWS. And, to the extent that the
employment experience of workers subsequent to job loss is less secure, there are likely
to be partial quarters of non-employment even later. The result will be continued lower
earnings that are due to lower hours worked as well as potentially lower weekly earnings
when employed full time.
       The earnings decline measure from the DWS is appropriate for understanding how job loss
affects the earnings that a full-time employed former job-loser is able to command (essentially
a wage rate). This is important for understanding a range of important issues. One example
is the relationship between earnings loss and tenure focusing on the potential importance of
specific capital (Kletzer, 1989; Topel, 1990; Neal, 1995; Parent, 2000). However, the DWS
measure of weekly earnings change alone does not capture the full earnings cost of job loss

  25
     Kroft, Lange, and Notowidigdo (2013) find in an audit study that the callback rate for job applica-
tions “submitted by” younger workers (less than 35 years of age) is negatively related to the duration of
unemployment.
  26
      The large earnings losses found in administrative data were highlighted by Jacobsen, LaLonde, and
Sullivan (1993). von Wachter, Handwerker, and Hildreth (2009) explicitly investigate reasons why the DWS
and administrative data from California in the 1990s seem to yield different measures of earnings loss. Couch
and Placzek (2010) and Davis and von Wachter (2011) are other examples of relatively large estimates of
earning loss after displacement.


                                                     33
because it does not account for time spent without a job or time spent working part-time
after loss of a full-time job. I did examine post-job-loss employment rates and part-time
employment rates based on the DWS and found strong adverse effects. However, the DWS
lacks detailed information on the timing of job loss and any subsequent reemployment that
would make it very difficult to calculate a dollar value of total lost earnings due to the loss
of a particular job.
   The administrative data are perhaps better suited than the DWS to measure the overall
dollar cost of job loss. First, the administrative data measure total earnings directly. Second,
the administrative data offer the possibility of following individuals for many quarters after
the job loss in order to measure the intermediate and long-run earnings loss. In contrast,
the DWS measures earnings in a single week (at the time of the DWS) and cannot get at
long-run costs. However, the DWS may dominate the administrative data in the demo-
graphic detail available that allows investigation of how the cost of job loss varies by worker
characteristics. Additionally, the DWS provides the the ability to examine more detailed
measures of outcomes, such as hours of employment.
   The measures I focused on likely substantially understate the true economic cost of job
loss. First, time spent unemployed by those workers who are reemployed is not considered.
Second, more hinges on employment, particularly full-time employment, in the U.S. than in
other developed countries. Health insurance and pensions are closely linked to employment,
and many workers do not have alternative access to these important benefits. This makes
job loss an expensive and damaging event on average.
   To conclude, while job loss is a fact of life in the U.S., the employment consequences
of job loss in the Great Recession have been unusually severe and remain substantial years
later. Most importantly, job losers in the Great Recession and its aftermath have been much
less successful at finding new jobs (particularly full-time jobs) than in earlier periods. The
decreased ability of job losers in recent years to find new employment reinforces the findings
from studies of job loss using administrative data that job loss has very long run adverse
consequences for employment and earnings.

APPENDIX I – Details of the Difference-In-Difference Procedure

The observed log wage change of workers in the outgoing rotation groups (which include
both displaced and non-displaced workers) is a probability-of-job-loss weighted average of
the change in log earnings for displaced and non-displaced workers. Define the change in log
earnings for the outgoing rotation groups as

                                      ∆g = (1 − θ)∆c + θ∆d ,                                       (5)

where ∆g is the log earnings change in the outgoing rotation group sample (lnWgt − lnWg0 )
and θ is the fraction of workers in the outgoing rotation group sample who lost a job (the
displacement rate).
   The observable quantities are ∆g and ∆d , but calculation of the difference-in-difference
estimate of the log earnings change due to job loss requires both ∆d and ∆c (equations 1
and 2).27 I can compute ∆c with the available data on ∆g , ∆d , and θ. Using equation 5, the
change in log earnings for the comparison group is
                                           ∆g − θ∆d
                                     ∆c =           ,                                              (6)
                                            (1 − θ)
and the difference-in-difference estimate of the effect of job loss on earnings is
                                              ∆d − ∆g
                                       ∆∆ =             .                                          (7)
                                               (1 − θ)
Intuitively, the samples from the outgoing rotation groups are “contaminated” with displaced
workers so that the difference-in-difference estimate computed using this contaminated con-
                                                     1
trol group need to be scaled up by the factor      (1−θ)
                                                           to compensate.
   The parameters γj , estimated by separate OLS regressions for each DWS survey year
from equation 4, are used along with information from the DWS on period-specific job loss
rates (θ) to compute estimates of the log earnings effects as follows:

                                    ∆d = γ1 + γ3 ,                                                 (8)
                                                 θγ3
                                    ∆c = γ1 −          , and                                       (9)
                                               (1 − θ)
                                            γ3
                                   ∆∆ =           .                                               (10)
                                         (1 − θ)


  27
     Note that I do not use the information on who is displaced that is available in the DWS outgoing
rotation groups. My estimate of ∆g includes both displaced and non-displaced workers at both time 0 and
time t.
