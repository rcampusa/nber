Utilizing a large dataset on U.S. federal government employees covering 24 years, we estimate
and analyze the persistent wage effect of entering government employment during recessions for
recent college graduates and other new employees. Contrary to previous results in the literature
for private sector employees, we document a significant and long-term wage increase for federal
civil servants who enter government service in recessions. We show this result is robust to
alternative samples and model specifications. We conclude by examining agency occupation
composition and job matching as mechanisms for these results.

1         Introduction
    There is increasing evidence that new college graduates who enter the labor market during
a recession have a significant and long-term negative effect on wage prospects relative to those
hired in a macroeconomic growth period (Genda et al. (2010); Kahn (2010); Oreopoulos et al.
(2012); Altonji et al. (2016)). Additional evidence shows that this long-term wage decrease
is not limited to new college workers, but extends to all types of workers starting new jobs
in recessions (Baker et al. (1994); Beaudry and DiNardo (1991); Devereux (2002)), from
displaced workers to graduating doctoral students in economics (Oyer (2006); Schmieder and
Von Wachter (2010)).

    There is, however, a positive side to graduating or switching jobs in a recession. The gov-
ernment is hiring. We show those cohorts of employees hired by the U.S. federal government
in recessions have a significant and long-term wage increase relative to those hired in boom
periods. Using a longitudinal dataset of over 3 million U.S. Federal Government employees
over 24 years, we track the entry level wage and the subsequent annual wage profile of each
individual over a 10-year period.
    We document that, contrary to previous work on the private sector, recent college cohorts
joining the government in recessions obtain a persistent wage advantage. We demonstrate
that for a 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate, recent college graduates
experience on average a 1% long-term wage increase relative to those cohorts hired in a boom.
The full wage advantage takes 3-4 years to be realized and it persists for up to 10 years after
entry into government service. The results stand in contrast to Oreopoulos et al. (2012) who
have shown a 1.5% decrease in wages followed by a gradual recovery in the following ten
years for all college students in Canada graduating in recessions.


2       Data and sample
    Our longitudinal dataset is obtained from the Central Personnel Data File (CPDF) of
the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the human resources department of the
federal government. The dataset records broad arrays of information, including individual
characteristics and employment status on 3 million non-sensitive, non-Department of Defense
federal employees in total, over the 24-year period from 1988 to 2011. The longitudinal data
allow us to track each individual’s career history and assign each person a vector of the
preceding unemployment rates he or she has experienced. This dataset allows us to map each
individual to the state in which he or she is hired and thus to exploit both cross-sectional
variation across, and time-series variation within, states for each cohort.
    For this study, the relevant variables are: annual basic real earnings as reported by OPM
and unemployment rates for the 50 states of the US across the 24 years as reported by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.
    We include in our sample frame only full-time and non-seasonal employees because part-
time or seasonal workers are likely to have different labor supply behavior. In addition, we
retain in the main sample only individuals from 20 to 24 years of age (at entry) with college
degrees to proxy for recent college graduates entering the labor market.1 Finally, we keep
only those individuals who entered between 1989 and 2011 so that we can conduct a complete
cohort analysis. The main sample includes 226,268 individuals.


3       Empirical strategy
   Over seventy percent of federal employees work outside of the DC-Metro area. In this
paper, we map each individual in the sample to the state in which they work, and we exploit

    1
     OPM released data to us only in age ranges because age is considered a highly sensitive personnel
variable. We used the 20-24 years age range because we believe civil servants in that age range with four-year
college degrees are likely to be a representative proxy, albeit imperfect, of new college graduates.

                                                      2
cross-sectional and time-varying state level unemployment rates as our main independent
variables of interest, assuming unemployment rates are exogenous macroeconomic variables.
In order to make concrete comparisons, we estimate the effects of recessions on real earnings
using the dynamic cell level model employed by Oreopoulos et al. (2012).
    The main independent variables, unemployment rates (UR), have variation only at the
state-year level. Following Oreopoulos et al. (2012), we collapse the individual level data into
cells. For each cohort (c), first duty state (s0 ) and calendar year (t), we create a cell, calculate
the log cell mean real earnings and associate each cell with its corresponding unemployment
rate at entry. The model is specified as

             log(w̄cs0 t ) = β0 + βe,0 U Rs0 ,0 + βe,1 U Rs1 ,1 + βe,2 U Rs2 ,2 + ⋯ + βe,e U Rst ,e
                                + φc + ηs0 + λt + χe + cs0 t                                         (1)

We can write (1) more explicitly and efficiently. Assume, a given individual with l years’
working experience enters into the following regressions

                   log(w̄cs0 0 ) = β0,0 U Rs0 ,0 + β0 + ,
                   log(w̄cs0 1 ) = β1,0 U Rs0 ,0 + β1,1 U Rs1 ,1 + β0 + ,
                          ⋯⋯
                   log(w̄cs0 l ) = βl,0 U Rs0 ,0 + βl,1 U Rs1 ,1 + ⋯ + βl,l U Rsl ,l + β0 + .        (2)

For simplicity, fixed effects are not presented in (2). We define experience (e) as the difference
between calendar year (t) and the entry year (c). After controlling for cohort fixed effects
(φc ), first duty state fixed effects (ηs0 ), calendar year fixed effects (λt ) and experience fixed
effects (χe ), the coefficients β⋅,0 represent the short- and long-term effects of entering in
recessions on average real earnings. We allow correlations within first duty state and cohort,
thus using multi-level clustering at first-duty-state-cohort level.
    The dynamic cell level model fully exploits individual level information. We keep track
of each individual’s career history and record all the unemployment rates she faces. Also,
the model controls for unemployment autocorrelation across years and cross-sectional corre-
lation across states. We include both the initial unemployment rate and all the subsequent
unemployment rates to isolate the effect of the very first shock.


4     Main results
4.1    College graduates
    Overall, we find a persistent positive effect of recessions on wages in the federal govern-
ment. Figure 1 shows the effect of the recession at entry on real earnings of recent college
graduates. By comparison, we also include in the figure the estimates of Oreopoulos et al.
(2012) who use Canadian college graduates to answer the same question we examine for the
private sector. They report that in the face of each additional 1 percentage point increase
in the unemployment rate, the average wage drops by 1.5% initially followed by a gradual
recovery, and the negative wage effect almost vanishes after 10 years.


                                                       3
    On the contrary, our results show that even though recent college graduates who enter
the government in recessions also suffer a wage disadvantage at first, the initial wage cut
disappears one year after entry and becomes a wage advantage in the second and later years.
The full advantage takes 3-4 years to be completely realized, and the positive effect remains
strong even at years 9-10.

                          College Graduates by Year Since Entry.
Notes: This figure shows estimates from regressing log average real earnings on unemployment rates for
recent college graduates. The results for the private sector in Oreopoulos et al. (2012) are also presented. All
point estimates can be found in Table A.1.


4.2     Non-college graduates
    We also examine whether this increasing wage effect is restricted to new college graduates
or if it can be extended to other types of workers. In Figure 2 we present results for employees
who start with the government in recessions but do not have a college degree or are not in
the age range 20-24 (“non-College graduates”, n=2,843,594).
    Our results indicate that the positive wage effect is experienced on average by all workers
starting their jobs in the government during recessions. New entrants of non-College gradu-
ates follow similar patterns as college graduates, experiencing a positive wage effect that is
even stronger than that experienced by college graduates. This would indicate that the wage
advantage is a universal effect that applies on average to all federal government employees.

4.3     Entrants versus incumbents
   Finally, we examine continuing workers (“incumbents”) who entered the government as
new college graduates but prior to the recession, to explore whether they are affected in the
same ways as new college graduates who enter right in the recession.

                                                                 4
    Our results indicate that the continuing workers who enter government service just one
to three years before the recession are shielded from these external economic fluctuations. In
the empirical model, the coefficients β⋅,1 in (2) denote a recession’s effects on insiders with 1-2
years’ experience, and β⋅,2 denote a recession’s effect on insiders with 2-3 years’ experience.
As shown in Figure 2, the point estimates for incumbents are close to zero and have no
statistical significance.2 In view of our results, one can deduce that the very first shock at
entry has much stronger effects than shocks occurring at higher years of experience.

the government for 1-2 years when the recession occurs. The same interpretation applies to “Incumbent23”.


4.4     Robustness
4.4.1    Model Specification
    To draw comparison to related research in the private sector (e.g. Kahn (2010); Altonji
et al. (2016)), we consider a specification where we include only U Rs0 ,0 and the multiple
fixed effects in (1), without controlling for unemployment rates between year c and year t.
In this specification, all intervening labor market changes between c and t are absorbed by
U Rs0 ,0 , and thus, results of this regression can be interpreted as the overall effect of joining

   2
     Because of the structure of our model (see (2)), we will lose one estimate for employees with 1-2 years’
experience and two estimates for employees with 2-3 years’ experience. The curves of “Incumbents12” and
“Incumbents23” are placed on the left end of the figure so that the effect year 0 denotes the start of a
recession.

                                                            5
the government in recessions. The results, presented Table A.1, are robust to this alternative
specification and are similar to those presented in Figure 1.

4.4.2     Attrition
    Another concern that may arise with this analysis is the positive wage effects may be a
result of attrition of poorly-matched workers who typically underperform in the government.
Under this argument, poorly-matched workers who are paid less than well-matched workers
will depart the government for the private sector when the recession is over. If this is true,
it could generate the positive wage effect in later years.
    To address this concern, we first study the effect of recessions on the departure rates of
each (cohort and initial state) cell over different experience-years.3 As shown in Table A.2,
the departure rates are statistically higher for those hired in recessions than for those hired
in growth periods, especially in the first three years after entry. This result indicates that
college graduates hired by the government in recessions are more likely to be short-term
employees compared to those hired in booms.
    To control for this effect, we compare the estimated wage curve for all recent college
graduates to recent college graduates who stay in the dataset for at least 10 years (n=135,730)
(a sample where is no attrition). Figure 3 presents our result. The estimated wage curve
of longtime workers is similar to the estimated wage curve of all workers, suggesting that
worker attrition is not likely to be a major driving force of our results.




    3
     The regression model used here takes the form Ycs0 e = β0 + βe,0 U Rs0 ,0 + φc + ηs0 + χe + cs0 e , where Ycs0 e
denotes the departure rate at different experience-years for a (cohort and initial-state) cell. The regression
is weighted by the number of individuals.

5       Mechanisms
5.1      Occupation Composition
    One evident pattern in our main results is a noticeable negative initial wage for college
graduates who join the government in recessions, followed by a rapid recovery after one
year of employment, which transforms into a wage advantage in the long-run. A change
of the composition of occupations hired over time contributes to explaining this finding.
College graduate occupations fall into three main categories: administrative, professional,
and technical, and their shares of hiring fluctuate around the 40%, 40% and 20%-level,
respectively. During recessions, college graduates tend to enter into administrative jobs with
higher incidence; these jobs have lower initial wages but higher wage growth than other job
categories (see Table 1 and Figure 4). A 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment
rate at entry results in a 1.86 percentage point increase in administrative jobs filled by the
new college graduates.4 In contrast, professional jobs, a category that has a higher starting
wage but lower wage growth rate than administrative jobs, witnesses a 1.20 percentage point

    We also examine the effect of recessions on the job composition at entry for short-term
college graduate employees who stay in the federal service for no more than 3 years. In fact, we
find that the effect is particularly strong for this group. A 1 percentage point increase in the
unemployment rate will lead to a 3.32 percentage point increase in the hiring of administrative
jobs and a 2.11 percentage point decrease in professional jobs.6 This finding, together with
employee attrition, can partly explain the relative magnitudes of the initial effects at year
0 and their convergence in later years (shown in Figure 3) for longtime employees and all
recent college graduates.

5.2     Matching
    Another possible contributing factor for the long-term wage increase for college graduates
joining the government during recession is that hires during recessions are better matched
to government jobs than those hired in booms (Lazear et al. (2016)). Although we cannot
measure the quality of employees directly, we can investigate matching using the data on
awards won. Awards are given by government agencies to those employees who perform
exceptionally well in their units. Conditional on winning awards, it takes an average of three
years for college graduates to earn an award after entry into government service. We therefore
look six years out after a new employee’s entry into the government agency to calculate per
capita awards for each entering (cohort and initial state) cell, and eliminate all employees
with less than six years of experience.
    Conditional on staying, our results show that a 1 percentage point increase in the unem-
ployment rate at hiring results in higher per capita awards for employees within the first six

   6
     Technical occupations also witnesses a 0.74 percentage point decrease for 1 percentage point increase in
the initial unemployment rate.

                                                     8
years of service.7 Though the effect is small, a 1.4% (0.28 percentage point) rise in awards
on a base award rate of 20.15%, the result is statistically significant at the 1% level of confi-
dence. Although awards is a small and imperfect measure of matching, we believe that this
result does provide suggestive evidence that better employee-job matching may be occurring
in recessions for new college graduates who stay in government service for at least six years.
    Together, the results of Sections 5.1 and 5.2 suggest the underlying cause of this lower
initial wage and higher wage growth could be a combination of both shifts in the composition
of jobs created by government agencies and the unobservable quality of matched employees
hired during recessions.


6       Discussion
    This paper has shown that individuals who join the government in recessions will receive
a long-term wage gain relative to those who join the government in boom periods. This
result is in contrast to the private sector where the opposite has been shown to be true. We
suggest that two possible explanations are contributing to this result: changes over time in
occupation composition and employee-job matching. However, other explanations for this
difference are possible, as well. It may be that politics enters into the timing and magnitude
of nominal wage increases for the civil service-politics that is not pervasive in the private
sector. In addition, these results may be related to the differences in sorting between workers
who are mission oriented and those who are wage oriented. We leave it to future work to
explore these and other possible explanations.




    7
    We calculate for each cell (initial state and cohort) the per capita awards in the first 6 year horizon
and regress it on UR at entry, controlling for initial state and cohort fixed effects. The regression is again
weighted by the number of individuals.
