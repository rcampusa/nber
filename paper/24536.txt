                                          ABSTRACT

This study employs a two-way fixed effects research design to measure the mortality impact and
cost-effectiveness of cancer drugs: it analyzes the correlation across 36 countries between relative
mortality from 19 types of cancer in 2015 and the relative number of drugs previously launched
in that country to treat that type of cancer, controlling for relative incidence.

One additional drug for a cancer site launched during 2006-2010 is estimated to have reduced the
number of 2015 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to cancer at that site by 5.8%.
The estimated cost per life-year gained at all ages in 2015 from cancer drugs launched during
2006-2010 is $1635.

We estimate that drugs launched during the entire 1982-2010 period reduced the number of
cancer DALYs lost in 2015 by about 23%. In the absence of new drug launches during
1982-2010, there would have been 26.3 million additional DALYs lost in 2015.

               The impact of new drug launches on life-years lost in 2015 from

                                        Extended abstract

        This study employs a two-way fixed effects research design to measure the mortality
impact and cost-effectiveness of cancer drugs: it analyzes the correlation across 36 countries
between relative mortality from 19 types of cancer in 2015 and the relative number of drugs
previously launched in that country to treat that type of cancer, controlling for relative incidence.
The sample size (both in terms of number of observations and population covered) of this study
is considerably larger than the sample sizes of previous studies; a new and improved method of
analyzing the lag structure of the relationship between drug launches and life-years lost is used;
and a larger set of measures of the burden of cancer is analyzed.
        The number of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and life-years lost are unrelated to
drug launches 0-4 years earlier. This is not surprising, since utilization of a drug tends to be
quite low during the first few post-launch years. Moreover, there is likely to be a lag of several
years between utilization of a drug and its impact on mortality. However, mortality is
significantly inversely related to the number of drug launches at least 5 years earlier, especially
to drug launches 5-9 years earlier. One additional drug for a cancer site launched during 2006-
2010 is estimated to have reduced the number of 2015 DALYs due to cancer at that site by 5.8%;
one additional drug launched during 1982-2005 is estimated to have reduced the number of 2015
DALYs by about 2.6%. Lower quality (or effectiveness) of earlier-vintage drugs may account
for their smaller estimated effect.
        We estimate that drugs launched during the entire 1982-2010 period reduced the number
of cancer DALYs in 2015 by about 23.0%, and that, in the absence of new drug launches during
1982-2010, there would have been 26.3 million additional DALYs in 2015. Also, the 9 countries
with the largest number of drug launches during 1982-2010 are estimated to have had 14% fewer
cancer DALYs (controlling for incidence) in 2015 than the 9 countries with the smallest number
of drug launches during 1982-2010.
        Estimates of the cost per life-year gained in 2015 from drugs launched during 2006-2010
range between $1635 (life-years gained at all ages) and $2820 (life-years gained before age 65).
These estimates are similar to those obtained in previous country-specific studies of Belgium,
Canada, and Mexico, and are well below the estimate obtained in one study of Switzerland.
        Mortality in 2015 is strongly inversely related to the number of drug launches in 2006-
2010. If the relationship between mortality in 2020 and the number of drug launches in 2011-
2015 is similar, drug launches 5-9 years earlier will reduce mortality even more (by 9.9%)
between 2015 and 2020 than they did (by 8.4%) between 2010 and 2015.

I.       Introduction


         During the period 1982-2014, 186 new chemical entities (NCEs) for treating cancer were
launched worldwide: about 5.6 new cancer drugs per year. 1 Moreover, the annual number of
new cancer drug launches has been increasing: as shown in Figure 1, the number of new cancer
drugs launched during 2005-2014 (76) was 77% larger than the number launched during 1985-
1994 (43). In contrast, the number of new drugs for other diseases (e.g. cardiovascular and
infectious diseases) launched during 2005-2014 (242) was 42% lower than the number launched
during 1985-1994 (417). The acceleration in cancer drug innovation has contributed to sharply
increasing cancer drug expenditure: costs of oncology therapeutics and supportive care drugs
were $107 billion globally in 2015, an increase of 11.5% over 2014 (on a constant dollar basis)
and up from $84 billion in 2010, as measured at invoice price levels. These costs are expected to
reach $150 billion globally by 2020 (IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics (2016, p. 4)).
         The number of cancer drug launches has varied across cancer sites (breast, lung, colon,
etc.). Figure 2 shows the average (across 36 countries) number of drug launches during 1982-
2015 for 19 cancer sites. 2 The average number of launches was greater than 10 for 4 cancer sites
(e.g. breast cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma), and lower than 2 for 4 cancer sites (e.g. thyroid
cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma). The number of cancer drug launches has also varied across
countries. Figure 3 shows the average (across the 19 cancer sites) number of drug launches
during 1982-2015 for 36 countries. The mean number of cancer drugs launched in Canada (5.9)
was 24% lower than the mean number of cancer drugs launched in the USA (7.8).
         This study seeks to determine the extent to which the number of years of life lost (YLL)
due to cancer 3 in 36 countries in 2015 was reduced by previous launches of new cancer drugs,

  A New Molecular Entity (NME) or New Chemical Entity (NCE) is a drug or chemical that is without precedent
among regulated and approved drug products. The NME designation indicates that a drug in development is not a
version or derivative of an existing and previously investigated, trialed and approved substance.
http://www.glossary.pharma-mkting.com/NME.htm

  Some cancer drugs are used to treat several types of cancer. I consider the launch of a drug used to treat 3 types of
cancer as 3 launches: one launch for each type of cancer.

  If 100 people die from lung cancer at age 60, they have collectively lost 500 (= 100 * (65 – 60)) years of life before
age 65, and 1500 (= 100 * (75 – 60)) years of life before age 75. Hence YLL depends on the number of deaths, age
at death, and the age cutoff that is used. Brustugun et al (2014, p. 1014) argue that “number of years of life lost
(YLL) may be a more appropriate indicator of [the] impact [of cancer] on society” than the number of deaths, and
Burnet et al (2005, p. 241) argue that “years of life lost (YLL) from cancer is an important measure of population
burden—and should be considered when allocating research funds.” Kirch (2008, p. 1365) also states that “the most
widely used summary health indexes [which are used to analyze the benefits of health interventions] are: disability-
                                                                                                                        4


and to measure the average cost-effectiveness of (cost per life-year gained from) those drugs.
Several previous studies (Lichtenberg (2015, 2016a, 2016b, 2017)) have provided evidence
about the mortality impact and cost-effectiveness of new cancer drugs in single (mostly small)
countries (Canada, Belgium, Switzerland, and Mexico). These studies employed a difference-in-
differences research design: they analyzed, within each country, the correlation across cancer
sites between long-run increases in the number of drugs ever launched and mortality changes.
All four studies found that new cancer drug launches had a significant negative impact on cancer
mortality, and that new cancer drugs were highly cost-effective, according to a standard (based
on per capita GDP) endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
         The present study will employ a two-way fixed effects research design (Somaini and
Wolak (2016)): in effect, I will analyze the correlation across countries between relative
mortality from each type of cancer in 2015 and the relative number of drugs previously launched
in that country to treat that type of cancer, controlling for relative incidence. 4 The mortality
models I will estimate will include both country fixed effects, which control for the average
(across cancer sites) level of cancer mortality in each country, and cancer-site fixed effects,
which control for the average (across countries) level of mortality from each cancer site. This
approach is feasible because the relative number of drugs launched for different types of cancer
has varied considerably across countries. This is illustrated by Figure 4, which shows the
number of drugs launched during 2006-2015 in Japan and Portugal for 19 types of cancer. 5 The
mean (across cancer sites) number of drugs launched during 2006-2015 was almost identical in
Japan and Portugal (3.3 and 3.2, respectively), but Japan launched 4 more drugs for leukemia
and 4 fewer drugs for ovary cancer. I will test the hypothesis that a relatively large number of
drugs tend to be launched for a cancer site in a country when the relative incidence of cancer at
that site in that country is high.

adjusted life years (DALY), quality-adjusted life years (QALY), healthy life expectancy (HALE), and years of
potential life lost (YPLL).”

  A two-way fixed effects model in effect analyzes the correlation between Y’ and X’, where Y’ = [(YA2 – YA1) –
(YB2 – YB1)] and Ysc (s = A, B; c = 1, 2) is the mean value of Y of observations where the first attribute equals s and
the second attribute equals c; X’ and Xsc are similarly defined. One of the most common types of two-way fixed
effects models is a “difference-in-difference model,” in which s refers to different sectors (e.g. industries or states),
and c refers to different time periods. In the two-way fixed effects models that I will estimate, s will refer to 19
different cancer sites, and c will refer to 36 different countries. Although I will in effect be analyzing the correlation
between Y’ and X’ (as defined above), to avoid confusion I won’t refer to my model as a difference-in-differences
model.

         In addition to providing a means of triangulating 6 the results of earlier studies, the
approach pursued in this study has a number of advantages. First, the sample size (both in terms
of number of observations and population covered) of this study is considerably larger. Some of
the previous studies were based on about 38 observations (19 cancer sites * 2 years (e.g. 2000
and 2011)); this study is based on 684 observations (19 cancer sites * 36 countries). The size of
the population covered in this study (2322 million) is almost 13 times as large as the sum of the
populations covered by the 4 previous studies (181 million). Second, a new and improved
method of analyzing the lag structure of the relationship between drug launches and life-years
lost will be used. 7 Third, a larger set of measures of the burden of cancer will be analyzed: the
number of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), the number of years of healthy life lost due to
disability, and the number of life-years lost based on three different age thresholds.
         In the next section, I provide background and motivation for the econometric model of
life-years lost from cancer, which is developed in Section III. Data sources are discussed in
Section IV. Section V provides evidence about the effect of incidence on the number of new
drug launches. Cancer mortality model estimates are presented in Section VI. Implications of
the results are discussed in Section VII. Section VIII concludes.


II.      Background and motivation


         Before describing the econometric model I will use to estimate the effect of new drug
launches on life-years lost from cancer, I will provide some theoretical and empirical background
and motivation for the model, which can be summarized by the following figure:

    R&D                        Technological progress (new ideas)                        Economic growth
    • Private                  • Embodied (new products)                                 • GDP growth
    • Public                   • Disembodied                                             • Longevity growth

         Starting on the right of this figure: longevity increase is a very important part of
economic growth, broadly defined. Nordhaus (2005) argued that “improvements in health status

  In the social sciences, triangulation is often used to indicate that two (or more) methods are used to check the
results of one and the same subject. The idea is that one can be more confident with a result if different methods lead
to the same result. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_(social_science)
7
  The new method allows us to test the hypothesis that, due to offsetting trends in drug quantity (utilization) and
quality (effectiveness), the relationship between the year in which a drug was launched and its effect on mortality in
2015 is nonmonotonic (U-shaped).
                                                                                                                  6


have been a major contributor to economic welfare over the twentieth century. To a first
approximation, the economic value of increases in longevity in the last hundred years is about as
large as the value of measured growth in non-health goods and services.” Murphy and Topel
(2006) estimated that cumulative gains in life expectancy after 1900 were worth over $1.2
million to the representative American in 2000, whereas post-1970 gains added about $3.2
trillion per year to national wealth, equal to about half of GDP. The United Nations’ Human
Development Index, which is used to rank countries into four tiers of human development, is a
composite statistic of life expectancy, income per capita, and education (United Nations (2017)).
        There is a consensus among macroeconomists that technological progress is the principal
source of GDP growth. Romer (1990) argued that “growth…is driven by technological change
that arises from intentional investment decisions made by profit-maximizing agents” (S71).
Jones argued that “long-run growth is driven by the discovery of new ideas throughout the
world.” 8 And Chien (2015) said that “it has been shown, both theoretically and empirically, that
technological progress is the main driver of long-run growth.”
        Since technological progress, or the discovery of new ideas, is the fundamental source of
one of the major components—GDP growth—of “human development,” or economic growth,
broadly defined, it is quite plausible that the discovery of new ideas has also played a major role
in longevity growth. Some previous authors have suggested that this is the case. Fuchs (2010)
said that “since World War II…biomedical innovations (new drugs, devices, and procedures)
have been the primary source of increases in longevity,” although he did not provide evidence to
support this claim. Cutler, Deaton and Lleras-Muney (2006) performed a survey of a large and
diverse literature on the determinants of mortality, and “tentatively identif[ied] the application of
scientific advance and technical progress (some of which is induced by income and facilitated by
education) as the ultimate determinant of health.” They concluded that “knowledge, science, and
technology are the keys to any coherent explanation” of mortality.
        In general, measuring the number of ideas is challenging. One potential measure is the
number of patents, but Patterson (2012, p. 8) noted that only 1% of patent applications made by
Bell Labs “generated [commercial] value.” Fortunately, measuring pharmaceutical “ideas” is


8
  The discovery of new ideas could increase economic output for two different reasons. First, output could simply
be positively related to the quantity (and variety) of ideas ever discovered. Second, output could be positively
related to the (mean or maximum) quality of ideas ever discovered, and new ideas may be better (of higher quality),
on average, than old ideas.
                                                                                                                7


considerably easier than measuring ideas in general. The measure of pharmaceutical ideas I will
use is the number of new molecular entities used to treat a disease launched in a country. Since
we have precise information about when those ideas reached the market and the diseases to
which they apply, we can assess the impact of those ideas on longevity in a two-way fixed
effects framework.
        Technological change may be either disembodied or embodied. Suppose firm X invests
in R&D, and that this investment results in a valuable discovery. If the technological advance is
disembodied, consumers and other firms could benefit from the discovery without purchasing
firm X’s goods or services; they could benefit just by reading or hearing about the discovery.
However, if the technological advance is embodied, consumers and other firms must purchase
firm X’s goods or services to benefit from its discovery. Solow (1960) argued that “many if not
most innovations need to be embodied in new kinds of durable equipment before they can be
made effective. Improvements in technology affect output only to the extent that they are carried
into practice either by net capital formation or by the replacement of old-fashioned equipment by
the latest models…” 9 Romer (1990) also assumed that technological progress is embodied in
new goods: “new knowledge is translated into goods with practical value,” and “a firm incurs
fixed design or research and development costs when it creates a new good. It recovers those
costs by selling the new good for a price that is higher than its constant cost of production.”
Hercowitz (1998, p. 223) concluded that “‘embodiment’ is the main transmission mechanism of
technological progress to economic growth.”
        Most scholars agree with Jones’ (1998, pp. 89-90) statement that “technological progress
is driven by research and development (R&D) in the advanced world.” In 1997, the medical
substances and devices sector was the most R&D-intensive 10 major industrial sector: almost
twice as R&D-intensive as the next-highest sector (information and electronics), and three times
as R&D-intensive as the average for all major sectors. (National Science Foundation (2017)). In
2007, 89% of private biomedical research expenditure was funded by pharmaceutical and
biotechnology firms; the remaining 11% was funded by medical device firms (Dorsey et al
(2010)).


9
  We hypothesize that innovations may be embodied in nondurable goods (e.g. drugs) and services as well as in
durable equipment.
10
   R&D intensity is the ratio of R&D to sales.
                                                                                                                   8


          A U.S. government institute (the National Cancer Institute (NCI)) has also played an
important role in cancer drug discovery and development. 11 Frequently, NCI’s drug
development efforts focus on unmet needs that are not being adequately addressed by the private
sector. NCI’s cancer drug discovery and development activities originated from a
congressionally mandated initiative known as the Cancer Chemotherapy National Service Center
(CCNSC), which, in 1955, established a national resource to facilitate the evaluation of potential
anticancer agents. In 1976, the CCNSC’s functions were incorporated into the Developmental
Therapeutics Program (DTP) in NCI’s Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (National
Cancer Institute (2017)).


III.      Econometric model of life-years lost from cancer


          To investigate the impact that new drugs launched during 1982-2015 had on the number
of years of life lost from cancer in 2015, conditional on incidence in 2012, I will estimate the
following two-way fixed effects model:

          ln(Ysc) = β0-4 LAUNCHES_2011_2015sc +β5-9 LAUNCHES_2006_2010sc
                      + β10-14 LAUNCHES_2001_2005sc + β15-33 LAUNCHES_1982_2000sc
                      + γ ln(CASES_2012sc) + αs + πc + εsc                                                  (1)
where Ysc is one of the following variables:
 DALYS_2015sc = the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 12 lost due to cancer
              at site s in country c in 2015

       YLL_2015sc = the number of years of life lost (as measured in the WHO Global Burden
                  of Disease Estimates) due to cancer at site s in country c in 2015

       YLD_2015sc = the number of years lost to disability due to cancer at site s in country c in
                  2015

11
   Sampat and Lichtenberg (2011) showed that government funding has played an indirect role—for example, by
funding basic underlying research that is built on in the drug discovery process—in almost half of the drugs
approved and in almost two-thirds of priority-review drugs.
12
   The DALY is a summary measure which combines time lost through premature death and time lived in states of
less than optimal health, loosely referred to as “disability”. The DALY is a generalization of the well-known
Potential Years of Life Lost measure (PYLLs) to include lost good health. One DALY can be thought of as one lost
year of ‘healthy’ life and the measured disease burden is the gap between a population’s health status and that of a
normative reference population. DALYs for a specific cause are calculated as the sum of the YLLs from that cause
and the YLDs for people living in states of less than good health resulting from the specific cause (World Health
Organization (2017a), p. 5).

                  country c in 2015

                  country c in 2015

                      cancer at site s launched in country c during 2006-2010

 LAUNCHES_2001_2005sc = the number of post-1981 new chemical entities used to treat
                      cancer at site s launched in country c during 2001-2005

 LAUNCHES_1982_2000sc = the number of post-1981 new chemical entities used to treat
                      cancer at site s launched in country c during 1982-2000

          Eq. (1) will be estimated by weighted least squares, weighting by Ysc. 14 The disturbances
of eq. (1) will be clustered within countries or within cancer sites.
          In eq. (1), drugs launched in 4 different periods (0-4 years, 5-9 years, 10-14 years, and
15-33 years before 2015) are permitted to have different effects on mortality or disability in
2015. The model is specified in this way because the effect of a drug’s launch on mortality is
hypothesized to depend on both the quantity and the quality (or effectiveness) of the drug.
Indeed, it is likely to depend on the interaction between quantity and quality: a quality
improvement will have a greater impact on mortality if drug utilization (quantity) is high. Drugs



13
   My data on drug launches are left-censored: I only have data on drugs launched after 1981. A post-1981 new
chemical entity is one that was first launched anywhere in the world after 1981.
14
   When eq. (1) is estimated without weighting, the residuals clearly exhibit heteroskedasticity: the variance of the
residuals is strongly inversely related to Ysc,2015.
                                                                                                                10


launched in the 4 different periods are likely to vary (in opposite ways) with respect to both
quantity (in 2015) and quality. Newer drugs are likely to be of higher quality than older drugs. 15
On the other hand, utilization of new drugs tends to be much lower than utilization of old drugs.
        To provide evidence about the process of diffusion of new medicines, I estimated the
following model, using annual data for the period 2010-2014 on global utilization of 80 cancer
drugs (molecules):
        ln(N_SUmn) = ρm + πn + εmn                                                               (2)
where
               N_SUmn = the number of standard units of molecule m sold worldwide n
                      years after it was first launched (n = 0, 1,…, 17)

                      ρm = a fixed effect for molecule m

                       πn = a fixed effect for age n
Data on the world launch year of molecule m were obtained from the IMS Health New Product
Focus database. Data on the annual number of standard units of molecule m sold worldwide
during 2010-2014 were obtained from the IMS Health MIDAS database. The expression exp(πn
- π5) is a “relative utilization index”: it is the mean ratio of the quantity of a cancer drug sold n
years after it was launched to the quantity of the same drug sold 5 years after it was launched.
        Estimates of the “relative utilization index” are shown in Figure5. These estimates
indicate that utilization of a cancer drug is generally increasing, at a decreasing rate, with respect
to time since launch. As shown in the following table, mean utilization of a drug is about twice
as high 5-9 years after launch as it was 0-4 years after launch:
     years since launch              mean utilization (relative to utilization 5 years after launch)
             0-4                                                  0.55
             5-9                                                  1.13
           10-14                                                  1.33
           15-31                                                  1.49




15
  Grossman and Helpman (1993) argued that “innovative goods are better than older products simply because they
provide more ‘product services’ in relation to their cost of production.” Bresnahan and Gordon (1996) stated simply
that “new goods are at the heart of economic progress,” and Bils (2004) said that “much of economic growth occurs
through growth in quality as new models of consumer goods replace older, sometimes inferior, models.” As noted
by Jovanovic and Yatsenko (2012), in “the Spence–Dixit–Stiglitz tradition…new goods [are] of higher quality than
old goods.”
                                                                                                                    11


If the quality of later-vintage drugs is greater than the quality of earlier-vintage drugs, the
relationship between the age of a drug (number of years since launch) and its impact on mortality
(which depends on quality*quantity) may have an inverted-U shape. 16 This is illustrated by
Figure 6, which is based on the assumption that drug quality increases at a constant 3% annual
rate with respect to vintage (e.g. a drug launched in 2018 is 3% better than a drug launched in
2017). Under this assumption, the drugs that have the largest impact on mortality are those that
were launched 10 years before. Their impact would be 48% larger than that of drugs that were
launched 30 years before, despite the fact that their utilization is 18% lower, because their
quality is 81% higher. 17


IV.      Data and descriptive statistics


         Data on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLL) and years lost
due to disability (YLD) were obtained from the WHO Global Health Estimates 2015: Disease
burden by Cause database (World Health Organization (2016a)). 18 Data on years of potential
life lost before ages 75 and 65 were constructed using data obtained from the WHO Global
Health Estimates 2015: Deaths by Cause database (World Health Organization (2016b)).
         That source provides data on the number of deaths by 5-year age group, cancer site,
country, and year. I assume that all deaths in an age group occur at the midpoint of the age
group, e.g. deaths in age-group 65-69 occur at age 67.5. Data on the number of patients
diagnosed, by cancer site, country, and year, were obtained from GLOBOCAN 2002 (Ferlay et al
(2004), a computer software package) and GLOBOCAN 2012 (International Agency for
Research on Cancer (2017b)).
         Summary statistics for the 19 major cancer sites in the 36 countries we analyze 19 are
shown in Table 1. In 2015, 76.6 million disability-adjusted life years were lost. Ninety-five


16
   The mortality impact will increase with respect to drug age (time since launch) if the rate of increase of quantity
with respect to age is greater than the rate of decline of quality with respect to age; otherwise the mortality impact
will decline.
17
   A smaller estimated impact on mortality of drugs launched in earlier periods could also be partly attributable to
left-censoring of the data on drug launches: unmeasured launches of pre-1983 drugs were more likely to occur in
earlier years than in more recent years.
18
   See World Health Organization (2017a) for a description of WHO methods and data sources for global burden of
disease estimates.
19
   The 19 cancer sites account for 87% of all cancer DALYs and about 80% of YLL65.
                                                                                                      12


percent of this loss was due to premature mortality, rather than to disability. The number of
DALYs increased by 12% between 2005 and 2015. However, the number of patients diagnosed
3 years earlier increased by 28%. 20 Therefore, the number of DALYs per patient diagnosed
declined by 16% (= 28% - 12%). The number of years of potential life lost before age 65 per
patient diagnosed declined by even more: 25% (= 28% - 3%).
           Data on drugs with indications for different types of cancer were obtained from the
Thériaque database (Centre National Hospitalier d’Information sur le Médicament (2017)). .
These data are shown in Appendix Table 2.
           Data on drug launch years, by molecule and country, were obtained from the IMS Health
New Product Focus database. These data are shown in Appendix Table 3. A blank cell
indicates that the drug had not been launched in that country by the end of 2015.
           Data on the annual number of standard units of cancer drugs sold worldwide during the
period 2010-1014, by molecule, were obtained from the IMS Health MIDAS database.


V.         The effect of incidence on the number of new drug launches


           As discussed in the introduction, estimation of the two-way fixed effects model of life-
years lost (eq. (1)) is feasible because the relative number of drugs launched for different types
of cancer varies across countries, as illustrated by Figure 4. Why did Japan have more leukemia
drug launches, but fewer ovary cancer drug launches, than Portugal? Previous studies have
shown that both innovation (the number of drugs developed) and diffusion (the number of drugs
launched in a country) depend on market size. Acemoglu and Linn (2004) found “economically
significant and relatively robust effects of market size on innovation.” Danzon et al (2005)
found that “countries with lower expected prices or smaller expected market size experience
longer delays in new drug access, controlling for per capita income and other country and firm
characteristics” (emphasis added).
           The hypothesis that the number of drug launches is influenced by market size can be
investigated in a two-way fixed effects framework by estimating the following equation:
           N_LAUNCHES_2003_2012sc = σ ln(CASES_2002sc) + αs + δc + εsc                        (3)



20
     Improved cancer screening and detection may account for part of this increase.
                                                                                                   13


where

 N_LAUNCHES_2003_2012sc = the number of drugs to treat cancer at site s launched in
                                       country c during 2003-2012

                    CASES_2002sc = the number of patients diagnosed with cancer at site s in
                                       country c in 2002

The estimate of σ is positive and significant: estimate = 0.1872; standard error = .0662; Z = 2.83;
p-value = .0047. This signifies that larger relative market size (number of patients diagnosed)
increases the relative number of drugs launched.
These findings are broadly consistent with the notion that “misery loves company” (Lichtenberg
and Waldfogel (2009)): the relative number of drugs launched for a cancer site in a country is
higher when the relative incidence of that cancer is greater. As illustrated by Figure 7, the direct
positive effect of incidence on mortality may be partially offset by an indirect negative effect, via
increased drug launches.


VI.        Cancer mortality model estimates


           Estimates of parameters of eq. (1) are presented in Table 2; to conserve space, estimates
of 19 cancer-site fixed-effects (αs) and 36 country fixed effects (πc) are not shown. Rows 1-5
show estimates of eq. (1) when the dependent variable is ln(DALYS_2015sc). 21 The estimate (in
row 1) of β0-4 is not statistically significant. This indicates that new drugs launched during 2011-
2015 did not have a significant impact on the number of DALYs in 2015. This is not surprising
since, as shown in Figure 5, utilization of a drug tends to be quite low during the first few years
after it was launched. Moreover, there is likely to be a lag of several years between utilization of
a drug and its impact on mortality. The estimate (in row 2) of β5-9 is negative and highly
significant (p-value < .0001). This indicates that new drugs launched during 2006-2010 had a
highly significant negative impact on the number of DALYs in 2015. One additional drug for a
cancer site launched during 2006-2010 is estimated to have reduced the number of 2015 DALYs
due to cancer at that site by 5.8%. The estimates (in rows 3 and 4) of β10-14 and β15+ are also
negative and highly significant (p-value < .0187), but their magnitudes are about 45% of the


21
     Estimates of all parameters of this model are shown in Appendix Table 4.
                                                                                                                           14


magnitude of β5-9. 22 One additional drug for a cancer site launched during 1982-2005 is
estimated to have reduced the number of 2015 DALYs due to cancer at that site by about 2.6%.
The smaller magnitudes of β10-14 and β15+ may be due to lower quality (or effectiveness) of
earlier-vintage drugs, and to left-censoring of the drug launch data. Panel A of Figure 8 is a
graph of the point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the estimates in rows 1-4. Row 5
of Table 2 shows the estimate of the coefficient γ on the incidence variable, ln(CASES_2012sc).
As expected, this coefficient is positive and highly significant (p-value < .0001); the fact that it is
significantly less than 1 may be partly attributable to errors in the measurement of incidence. 23, 24
         When we include the log of the number of cases in 2002 (ln(CASES_2002sc)) well as the
log of the number of cases in 2012 in the model, the coefficient on ln(CASES_2002sc) is not
statistically significant (estimate = .064; Z = 1.35; p-value = 0.177); the sum of the incidence
coefficients is almost identical to the coefficient in row 5 of Table 2; and the estimates of the
drug launch coefficients are virtually unchanged. Incidence is highly serially correlated: the
estimate of κ from the weighted (by CASES_2012sc) regression ln(CASES_2012sc) = κ
ln(CASES_2002sc) + αs + πc + εsc is 0.778 (Z = 15.58; p-value < .0001). When we include both
ln(CASES_2002sc) and ln(CASES_2012sc) in the model, and exclude both
LAUNCHES_2001_2005sc and LAUNCHES_1982_2000sc, the estimate of β0-4 is far from
significant, and the estimate of β5-9 remains highly significant (p-value = .0013) and is slightly
smaller than the estimate in row 2 of Table 2 (estimate = -.051; Z = 3.22).
         Rows 6-10 of Table 2 show estimates of eq. (1) when the dependent variable is
ln(YLL_2015sc). The estimates of this equation are very similar to the estimates of the
ln(DALYS_2015sc) equation in rows 1-5. This is not surprising since, as noted above, 95% of
DALYs were due to premature mortality, rather than to disability. Rows 11-15 of Table 2 show
estimates of eq. (1) when the dependent variable is ln(YLD_2015sc). The only drug launch
coefficient that is statistically significant (p-value = .0254) is β15+; it implies that one additional


22
   The difference (β5-9 - β10-14) is highly significant (p-value = .0006); the difference (β10-14 - β15+) is insignificant (p-
value = .9149).
23
   See http://globocan.iarc.fr/Pages/DataSource_and_methods.aspx for a discussion of GLOBOCAN 2012 incidence
measurement.
24
   I also estimated eq. (1) where the dependent variable was the log of the number of deaths from cancer at site s in
country c in 2015. The only launch coefficient that was statistically significant was the coefficient on
LAUNCHES_2006_2010 (estimate = -.031; Z = 2.49; p-value = .0127).
                                                                                                     15


drug for a cancer site launched during 1982-2000 reduced the number of years lost to disability
due to cancer at that site in 2015 by 2.4%.
       Rows 16-20 and 21-25 of Table 2 show estimates of eq. (1) when the dependent variable
is ln(YLL75_2015sc) and ln(YLL65_2015sc), respectively. The estimates are qualitatively
similar to those in rows 1-5 and 6-10: the estimate of β0-4 is insignificant; the estimates of the
other launch coefficients are all negative and significant; and the magnitudes of β10-14 and β15+
are significantly smaller than the magnitude of β5-9. But the magnitudes of β5-9, β10-14 and β15+
are larger in rows 16-20 and 21-25 than they are in rows 1-5 and 6-10. For example, as shown in
row 22, one additional drug for a cancer site launched during 2006-2010 is estimated to have
reduced the number of years of potential life lost before age 65 due to cancer at that site in 2015
by 10.0%. Panel B of Figure 8 is a graph of the point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of
the estimates in rows 21-24.
       The estimates in Table 2 are based on data for 36 countries, including the United States.
I estimated similar models using data for 35 countries, i.e. excluding the United States. These
estimates are shown in Appendix Table 5. The magnitude of the point estimates based on the
USA-excluded sample are generally about 15% smaller than the magnitude of the point estimates
based on the full sample (although some are larger), and the USA-excluded estimates are
somewhat less significant. However, most of the estimates continue to be highly significant (p-
value < .04), and the basic pattern of the estimates remains: DALYs and life-years lost are
unrelated to drug launches 0-4 years earlier, and inversely related to drug launches at least 5
years earlier, especially to drug launches 5-9 years earlier.


VII.   Discussion



       By combining the estimates in Table 2 with other data, we can estimate the number of
life-years gained (i.e., the reduction in life-years lost) in 2015 attributable to previous new drug
launches. We can also estimate expenditure in 2015 on these drugs, so we can obtain estimates
of an important indicator of cost-effectiveness: pharmaceutical expenditure per life-year gained.
       Due to limitations of available data, we can estimate (under reasonable assumptions)
expenditure in 2015 on drugs launched during 2006-2010, but we cannot estimate expenditure in
2015 on drugs launched during earlier periods. Therefore, although the estimates in Table 2
                                                                                                           16


indicate that drugs launched before 2006 as well as those launched during 2006-2010 reduced the
number of life-years lost in 2015, I will only provide estimates of the cost-effectiveness in 2015
of drugs launched during 2006-2010. 25
        Calculations of the number of life-years gained in 2015 from, and of the cost-
effectiveness of, drugs launched during 2006-2010 are shown in Table 3. The first column
shows the calculations for the first disease burden measure: disability-adjusted life-years. Row 1
shows the point estimates of the β5-9 coefficients from Table 2. Row 2 of Table 3 shows the
weighted mean value of LAUNCHES_2006_2010, weighted by the corresponding disease
burden measure. The average number of drugs launched during 2006-2010 for a cancer site was
about 1.5. Row 3 shows the log-change in 2015 life-years lost due to LAUNCHES_2006_2010
(= β5-9 * mean(LAUNCHES_2006_2010)). The estimates imply that drugs launched during
2006-2010 reduced the number of cancer DALYs by about 8.4% (= - (exp(-.087) – 1)). As
shown in row 4, there were 88.1 million DALYs from all types of cancer in the 36 countries in
2015. The estimates imply that, in the absence of new drug launches during 2006-2010, there
would have been 8.04 million additional DALYs. Similar calculations in columns 2-4 imply
that, in the absence of new drug launches during 2006-2010, there would have been 8.28 million
additional YLL (years of life lost at all ages), 4.51 million additional YLL75 (years of life lost
before age 75), and 2.52 million additional YLL65 (years of life lost before age 65).
        Additional calculations indicate that drugs launched during the entire 1982-2010 period
reduced the number of cancer DALYs in 2015 by about 23.0%, and that, in the absence of new
drug launches during 1982-2010, there would have been 26.3 million additional DALYs in 2015.
Also, the 9 countries with the largest number of drug launches during 1982-2010 (weighted by
the coefficients in rows 2-4 of Table 2) are estimated to have had 14% fewer cancer DALYs
(controlling for incidence) in 2015 than the 9 countries with the smallest number of drug
launches during 1982-2010.
        Calculations of 2015 expenditure on drugs launched during 2006-2010 are shown in rows
6-13. As shown in row 6, according to the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics (2016, p. 4),
“the total [global] cost of oncology therapeutics and supportive care drugs rose from $90 billion



25
  These drugs are probably more expensive than older drugs because they are more likely to retain patent
protection; the estimates in Table 2 indicate that they are also more effective.
                                                                                                               17


in 2011 to $107 billion in 2015, measured at invoice price levels.” 26 The 36 countries in our
sample accounted for 78% of world pharmaceutical expenditure in 2014 (row 7); I assume that
they also accounted for 78% of world oncology drug expenditure in 2015, so I estimate the 36-
country cost of oncology therapeutics and supportive care drugs in 2015 to be $83.1 billion (=
78% * $107 billion; row 8). This is an estimate of expenditure in the 36 countries in 2015 on all
cancer drugs, i.e. drugs launched in all previous years. To estimate expenditure on cancer drugs
launched during 2006-2010, we should multiply this estimate by the fraction of 2015 expenditure
that was on drugs launched 5-9 years earlier. Data on expenditure in 2015, by molecule and
country, are not available, but data on expenditure in 2010, by molecule and country, are
available for 31 of the 36 countries from the IMS MIDAS database. As shown in row 9, those
data indicate that about one-sixth (16%) of 2010 pharmaceutical expenditure was on drugs
launched in the respective country 5-9 years earlier (i.e. during 2001-2005). 27 Assuming that the
same fraction applies to 2015 cancer drug expenditure, 2015 expenditure in the 36 countries on
cancer drugs launched during 2006-2010 was $13.5 billion (= 16% * $83.1 billion; row 10).
This is an estimate of expenditure by, or on behalf of, all cancer patients, i.e. patients of all ages.
To calculate cost per-life year gained before ages 75 and 65, we require estimates of the fractions
of cancer drug expenditure by, or on behalf of, cancer patients below ages 75 and 65. According
to GLOBOCAN 2012, globally 76% of cancer patients are diagnosed before age 75, and 52% are
diagnosed before age 65 (International Agency for Research on Cancer (2017b); row 11). I
therefore assume that 76% of cancer drug expenditure was on patients below age 75, and 52% of
cancer drug expenditure was on patients below age 65 (row 12). These estimates may be
conservative (i.e. overestimates), because some drug expenditure on a patient diagnosed before
age x may occur after the patient is older than age x.
        Estimates of the cost-effectiveness measure—the ratio of estimated 2015 expenditure on
drugs launched during 2006-2010 (row 12) to the reduction in 2015 life-years lost due to those
drugs (row 5)—are shown in row 13. The estimated cost per life-year gained ranges between

   This amount is 9.74% of world pharmaceutical expenditure ($1098 million) in 2014 (International Federation of
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (2017, Annex 2)). According to the IMS Institute, “the U.S. derives
11.5% of its total drug costs from oncology, up from 10.5% in 2011. In developed countries, between 8.6% and
15.9% of the total drug bill is spent on oncology and supportive care medicines. Oncology accounts for a smaller
portion of total medicines costs in pharmerging countries, where between 2.5% and 11.5% of total drug cost is for
cancer treatments” (IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics (2016, p. 22).
27
   That estimate applies to all drugs, not just cancer drugs.
                                                                                                                      18


$1635 (life-years gained at all ages) and $2820 (life-years gained before age 65. These estimates
are similar to those obtained in three previous country-specific studies (Belgium: €1311
(Lichtenberg (2016a)); Mexico $2146 (Lichtenberg (2017)); Canada: $2730 (Lichtenberg
(2015))); it is well below the estimate obtained in one country-specific study (Switzerland:
$21,228-$28,673 (Lichtenberg (2016b))).
         As noted by Bertram et al (2016), authors writing on behalf of the WHO’s Choosing
Interventions that are Cost–Effective project (WHO-CHOICE) suggested in 2005 that
“interventions that avert one DALY for less than average per capita income for a given country
or region are considered very cost–effective; interventions that cost less than three times average
per capita income per DALY averted are still considered cost–effective.” Population-weighted
average per capita income (GDP) in the 36 countries in 2015 was $US 21,359, so these estimates
indicate that the new drugs launched during 2006-2010 were very cost–effective, overall.
         Two considerations suggest that the figures in row 13 of Table 3 may overestimate the
true net cost per life-year gained. First, those estimates are based on drug cost measured at
invoice price levels, but “cancer medicines are subject to different types of off-invoice discounts,
rebates and price concessions based on how the medicines are reimbursed or administered to
patients” (IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics (2016, p. 26)). 28 Second, a previous study
based on U.S. data (Lichtenberg (2014)) showed that about 25% of the cost of new drugs (for all
diseases) is offset by reduced expenditure on old drugs. 29



VIII. Summary



         Several previous studies have provided evidence about the mortality impact and cost-
effectiveness of new cancer drugs in single (mostly small) countries, by employing one kind of
two-way fixed effects research design: they analyzed, within each country, the correlation across
cancer sites between long-run increases in the number of drugs ever launched and mortality
changes. This study has employed a different kind of two-way fixed effects research design to

28
   According to the IMS Institute, in the U.S., net price growth on existing branded oncology drugs is estimated to
have averaged 4.8% in 2015, versus 6.4% invoice price growth. In Europe, a range of discounts and other
mechanisms also exist, resulting in lower realized prices by manufacturers” (IMS Institute for Healthcare
Informatics (2016, p. 5).
29
   That study also demonstrated that pharmaceutical innovation has reduced work-loss days.
                                                                                                    19


measure the mortality impact and cost-effectiveness of cancer drugs: it analyzed the correlation
across 36 countries between relative mortality from 19 types of cancer in 2015 and the relative
number of drugs previously launched in that country to treat that type of cancer, controlling for
relative incidence. The sample size (both in terms of number of observations and population
covered) of this study was considerably larger than the sample sizes of previous studies; a new
and improved method of analyzing the lag structure of the relationship between drug launches
and life-years lost was used; and a larger set of measures of the burden of cancer was analyzed.
We showed that the relative number of drugs launched for a cancer site in a country is positively
related to relative market size (number of patients diagnosed).
       DALYs and life-years lost are unrelated to drug launches 0-4 years earlier. This is not
surprising, since utilization of a drug tends to be quite low during the first few post-launch years.
Moreover, there is likely to be a lag of several years between utilization of a drug and its impact
on mortality. However, mortality is significantly inversely related to the number of drug
launches at least 5 years earlier, especially to drug launches 5-9 years earlier. One additional
drug for a cancer site launched during 2006-2010 is estimated to have reduced the number of
2015 DALYs due to cancer at that site by 5.8%; one additional drug launched during 1982-2005
is estimated to have reduced the number of 2015 DALYs by about 2.6%. Lower quality (or
effectiveness) of earlier-vintage drugs may account for their smaller estimated effect.
       When the United States is excluded from the sample, the magnitude of the point
estimates is generally about 15% smaller than the magnitude of the point estimates based on the
full sample (although some are larger), and the USA-excluded estimates are somewhat less
significant. However, most of the estimates continue to be highly significant (p-value < .04), and
the basic pattern of the estimates remains.
       The estimates implied that drugs launched during 2006-2010 reduced the number of
cancer DALYs in 2015 by about 8.7% and that, in the absence of new drug launches during
2006-2010, there would have been 8.04 million additional DALYs due to cancer in the 36
countries. The estimates also implied that, in the absence of new drug launches during 2006-
2010, there would have been 4.51 million additional years of life lost before age 75, and 2.52
million additional years of life lost before age 65.
       We also estimated that drugs launched during the entire 1982-2010 period reduced the
number of cancer DALYs in 2015 by about 23.0%, and that, in the absence of new drug launches
                                                                                                 20


during 1982-2010, there would have been 26.3 million additional DALYs in 2015. Also, the 9
countries with the largest number of drug launches during 1982-2010 are estimated to have had
14% fewer cancer DALYs (controlling for incidence) in 2015 than the 9 countries with the
smallest number of drug launches during 1982-2010.
       Estimates of the cost per life-year gained in 2015 from drugs launched during 2006-2010
ranged between $1635 (life-years gained at all ages) and $2820 (life-years gained before age 65).
These estimates are similar to those obtained in previous country-specific studies of Belgium,
Canada, and Mexico, and are well below the estimate obtained in one study of Switzerland.
       Mortality in 2015 is strongly inversely related to the number of drug launches in 2006-
2010. If the relationship between mortality in 2020 and the number of drug launches in 2011-
2015 is similar, drug launches 5-9 years earlier will reduce mortality even more (by 9.9%)
between 2015 and 2020 than they did (by 8.4%) between 2010 and 2015.
