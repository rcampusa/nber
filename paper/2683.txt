               NEWS AND THE DOLLAR/YEN EXCHANGE RATE, 1931-1933:
      THE END OF THE GOLD STANDARD, IMPERIALISM, AND THE GREAT DEPRESSION


                                      ABSTRACT


        According to the efficient market hypothesis, news in Tokyo is

 responsible for the exchange rate changes during the Tokyo market hours,

 while the U.S. news is responsible for changes in the New York hours.      The

 intra-daily dynamics of the $/yen exchange rate from December 1931 to

 November 1933 is analyzed. Japan's decision to go off gold in December 1931

 depreciated yen by 30% in a month, mostly in the Tokyo market. During 1932,

 the yen depreciated another 30%, mainly due to Japan's aggression in China

 and resulting diplomatic isolation. In 1933, the yen appreciated against

 the dollar, mainly in the New York market, due to the U.S. decision to go

 off gold.   However, exchange rate volatility and its sensitivity to news

declined over the two year period, because of increasing capital controls.

Changes in the interest rate differential was found insignificant for the

changes in the exchange rate. Political regime changes, such as a decision

to go off gold, most influenced the exchange rate for the period considered.

There were no policy decisions by Japan to cause yen depreciation to promote

export and limit import in 1931-33.

 1.    Introduction

          This paper considers the news and its effects on the dollar/yen

 exchange rate from December 1931 to November 1933. The intra-daily data,

 i.e. ,    the Tokyo and New York quotes of the day, are analyzed for the two

 year period, so that sources of the rapid exchange rate change can be better

 identified.

          The investigation of exchange rate dynamics during this period is

 important for at least three reasons. First, it was the time that the

 exchange rate moved most for a short period of time. By identifying the

 factors affecting rapid depreciation, we gain insights into determinants of

the exchange rate during the interwar period. Second, by analyzing the

intra-daily data, it is possible to infer how efficient the international

financial markets were during the interwar period. Third, the rapid yen

depreciation in this period is often credited for the fast recovery of the

Japanese economy after the depression of 1929-31. It is interesting to

investigate whether the depreciation was planned for the concurrent and

subsequent export drive or it was a result of market force.

       In order to accomplish the objectives a news (event) analysis is

employed.       If the market is efficient, relevant news is reflected in the

asset price, or the exchange rate in this case, within minutes of its
revelation.      It is also reasonable to assume, at least for the first

approximation, that relevant news concerning the economic and political

events in Japan are revealed during the Japanese market hours, and those in

the U.S. are revealed during the U.S. market hours. Because of the time

difference between Tokyo and New York, business hours of the two markets do

not overlap. By recording the closing quotes of the two markets in the same

day,      it is possible to identify which market was more responsible for the


                                   1
  exchange rate changes, and hence to infer the origin of the news relevant to

  the changes. This method has been successfully
                                                   employed for the period from
  1980 to 1985 by Ito and Roley (1986), and for a one-year period after the

 Group of Five Plaza Agreement by Ito (1987). Including these studies, there

 have been many studies of exchange rate dynamics after   1973, but this paper
 is a first attempt, to the best of our knowledge, that investigate the

 dynamics of the intra-daily exchange rate during the floating exchange rate

 regime of the interwar period.

 2. Background

      From 1874 to       1897, the yen depreciate from about $100/100   yen to
 $50/100 yen. The yen was on the gold standard from 1897 to 1917.
                                                                        During
 the l920s, many European countries restored the gold standard, and Japan

 attempted to restore the gold standard.       These countries restored (or
 attempted to restore) the exchange rate at the "prewar (old) parity," the

 rate prevailing before the First World War."1"    This is one of the reasons
 that European countries and Japan experienced a decade of stagnant,

deflationary economy. (See Figure 1 for the dollar/yen exchange rate up to

the Second World War.)


                     Insert FIGURE 1 about here


     In Japan, the Great Kanto Earthquake of September 1923 and the
F-inancjal Panic of March 1927 were also marks of the troubled l920s.
                                                                           In

July 1929, Junnosuke Inouye became the Finance Minister of the Hamaguchi
cabinet.
           He introduced a deflationary policy in order to restore the gold

standard for the yen, a stated goal of the cabinet. There was no bond

financing for the general budget of 1930, for the first time since 1907.



                                  2
 The central government expenditure decreased by 10.2 percent from 1929       to

 1930, and decreased 5.2 percent from 1930 to 1931.    The gold standard of

 yen, which was called "the resumption of gold export" in Japan, was restored

 in January 11, 1930. The value of yen had risen from $43/l0O yen before the

announcement of intention to restore the gold standard in 1929 to $49/100

yen in December 1929.

     In addition to the deflationary policies, other external events, such

as the agricultural crisis of 1930, and the decline in export to the U.S.

following the U.S. stock market crash of October 1929, worsened the economic

performance of Japan. For a two-year period from 1929 to 1931, the price of

all farm goods declined by 39 percent, the Wholesale Price Index declined   by
30 percent, and real Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation declined by 12

percent.   At the same time, the real GNP stalled (to be precise, increased

by 1.5 percent in two years) and real export increased by only 6.7 percent

over the two years. However, the economic situation from 1929 to 1931 in

Japan was much better than the United States, where real income dropped by

19 percent for the same period (and was still on its way down), and it was

much worse in the 1921-23 recession in Japan when the real GNP dropped by 7

percent.

     On September 21, 1931, British sterling went off gold, and the pound

immediately depreciated. Many European countries followed suit:     Denmark,

Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland left the gold standard within a week after

Britain's decision, as did Finland in October. In September 1931, Japan

started to invade Manchuria. These events created strong pressure to invest

in U.S. dollars. The Yokohama Shokin Bank, the predecessor of the Bank of

Tokyo and the official bank for foreign exchange, met all the buy orders of

dollars by taking sell positions. However, in order to settle the position,


                                3
  the bank later needed transport species abroad. At the end of 1929, shortly

  before the return to the gold standard, the amount of gold reserves in the

  Bank of Japan was 1,072 million yen. By the end of 1931, shortly after the

  gold embargo, the gold reserve was reduced to 470 million yen, less than

  half of the level two years earlier. (Bank of
                                                   Japan (1985, p.71).)

      Japan decided to go off gold on December 13, l93l/'2                The yen
 depreciated about 30 percent within a month and about 60 percent in a year.

 This is one of the most dramatic changes in the
                                                    yen/dollar exchange rate in
 the market/3 Although one of the reasons for the rapid depreciation was

 an adjustment from the overvalued parity during the gold standard, other

 reasons may have contributed to depreciation,     especially after the initial
 phase of the exchange rate adjustment.
                                          Japan launched a military assault on
 mainland China, and was condemned in the League of Nations.
                                                                      The Great
 Depression of the United States was getting worse, and the United States

went off the gold standard in 1933. This paper will carefully considerd

these various events and will quantify their effects on the changes in the

exchange rate.

     The depreciation of yen, along with the fiscal and monetary stimulus,

is often credited for the fast
                                 recovery of the Japanese economy from 1931 to
1933/       though the effect of the yen depreciation of 1931-1932 on the

Japanese recovery is an interesting topic of investigation, it is beyond the

scope of this paper. (For European economies, see Eighengreen and Sachs

(1985) for the effect of exchange rates on the economic recovery.) Instead,

we will investigate whether the yen depreciation was engineered as a policy

objective or determined in the efficient market.

3. Data and Definitions

     The closing rate of the exchange rate (in units of dollars per 100 yen)

in the Tokyo and New York markets are collected daily from newspaper, cai

Shogyo Shinpo from December 1, 1931 to November 30, 1933."" The Japanese

Standard Time (JST) is fourteen hours ahead of the Eastcoast Standard Time

(EST).   Tokyo is the first major market to open in a day. It opens a few

hours after closing of the New York market of the preceding day.        Since

there is no major market or news coming out between the New York closing and

the Tokyo opening, the Tokyo opening can       well approximated by the New

York closing quote. (See Ito and Roley (1987) for the validity of this

claim in the 1980s.) When the Tokyo market closes, the Shanghai and Indian

markets are still open, and the London market opens in a few hours after the

Tokyo market closes.        The late afternoon session of the London market

overlaps for a few hours with the morning session of the New York market.

     We define the change in the Tokyo market on day t, TOKYO(T) as the

change from the New York close of day T-l, NYDY(T-1), to the Tokyo close,

TKDY(T), and the change in the New York market, NYORK(T), is defined as the

change from the Tokyo close to the New York close of the day.

     TOKYO(T)   TKDY(T) - NYDY(T-l)

     NYORK(T)   NYDY(T) - TKDY(T).

Note that in this definition, the New York market includes changes in the

Indian and European markets, too. Whenever the New York market is mentioned

in the rest of this paper, this proviso applies.

     For purposes of comparison, the 24-hour change in New York, NYORK24(T),

is also defined and used.

     NYORK24(T) — NYDY(T)-NYDY(T-1)

The advantage of having the intra-daily data over the daily data will be


                                  5
 evident from considering the information contents of the TOKYO and NYORK

 decornpsition   compared with NYORK24.

      The call rate in Tokyo, TKR. and the call rate in New York,      NYR, are
 also collected from the same source. The interest differential between     the

 two countries is defined as,

      INTDIF(T)     NYR(T)-TKR(T).

      If capital flows attracted by the interest rate differential were a

 major determinant of the exchange rate changes in the i930s, like the     case
 in the l980s, then the interest rate differential should explain the

 exchange rate changes. This conjecture will be tested in section 8.

     The daily exchange rate (the New York quote) from December        1931 to
November 1933 is plotted in Figure 2, and the summary statistics including

the decomposed market changes are shown in Table 1.


            Insert Figure 2a, 2b and Table I about here


Observe, first, that a rapid change in the exchange rate came in various

waves (regimes), A wave of rapid changes was followed by a relatively calm

period before another wave of changes. This pattern is common to the post

Bretton Woods experiences.6 Theoretically, a regime of yen depreciation

(or appreciation) should correspond to a bunch of news relevant to the

exchange rate determinations      Second, the yen depreciated by about $30/100

yen in one year following the gold embargo, and then stabilized around

$2l/lOOyen for several months. After the U.S. went off gold, the yen slowly

appreciated by $10/laO yen in several months. Thus, in net over the two

year period, the yen depreciated by $19/lao yen. Clearly, a different force

on the value of yen appeared in 1933. Third, the geographical source of



                                     6
major disturbances shifted from Asia to the United States over the two years

of our sample. The standard deviation in the Tokyo market was larger than

in the New York market for one year following the Japanese gold embargo.

However, from December 1932 to November 1933, the volatility of the New York

market exceeded that of the Tokyo market.

     As indicated in figures, various regimes are identified over the two

year period. In most cases, when. a regime started and ended is clearcut/7''

Table 2 is a statistical summary of changes in the dollar/yen exchange rate

for each regime. In the following sections, each regime will be examined

closely.

4. Regime I: Takahashi's Decision to Go Off the Gold Standard

     In the three weeks starting on December 11, 1931 (Regime 1), the yen

depreciated by about 30 percent. In fact, there were two phases in this

regime. First, the drop occurred immediately before and after December 13,

the day the yen went off gold. Second, the yen depreciated for three days

starting December 27 apparently with no significant news.

     When the cabinet collapsed on December 11 citing the "incompatibility"

within the cabinet, there was widespread anticipation that the yen would go

off gold.   On that day, the leading business newspaper began a serial of

articles about what would happen to the economy if gold exports were

suspended, and the market was reasonably certain that this would occur.

However, there was great uncertainty about the political future and trading

on the Tokyo exchange virtually came to a standstill.       On December 12,

another large drop in quotes in the Tokyo market was recorded. We may

conclude that a drop in the value of yen from $48 to $40 over ten days from


                                7
 December 11 was a direct reaction to the (anticipations of) a
                                                                 gold embargo.
 The source of disturbances was clearly in the Tokyo market and           so was
 revealed by statistics.      In fact, most of the drop of the yen occurred

 before the forthcoming announcement of the gold embargo. This is      evidence

 in support of the view that markets were efficient and expectations were

 rational in the beginning of the 1930s.

      Another drop of $5/100 yen at the end of the month was caused with no

 new information. It is not obvious why the yen depreciated on December 28

 (in Tokyo) and on December 29 (in New York). The drop on December 28,

 according to newspapers, was due to speculations. For example, due to the

 anticipated decline in the yen, importers of (raw) cotton hastened the    deal

 (i.e., a classical case of leads). The newspaper on December 30,          1931

 carried an article written in New York about the drop on December 29 in the

 New York market which said that "Bankers and financial experts cannot find

 particular causes for the crash of the yen." Since there are instances in

which large movements in the exchange rate       cannot be associated with
significant news events even in the 1980s, it is not surprising to find an

episode of a speculative attack in the 1930s.


5 Adventures in Imperialism and the Yen's Depreciation in Early 1932

     During the first month and a half of 1932 (Regime Q-I), the
                                                                       foreign
exchange market was volatile, although the depreciation,         which mainly
happened in Tokyo, and appreciation, which mainly happened in New York,

cancelled each other out. In February and June, there were waves of yen

depreciation, which were results of Japan's aggressions in China, which drew

criticism from the rest of the world.

    Although Japanese imperialism started earlier, its speed of aggression


                                8
accelerated during the year of 1932, In January and February, Japan

attacked Shianghai.     In March, Manchuria became "independent" with a

government many western nations regarded as a puppet of the Japanese

military.     When these conflicts developed, the yen depreciated.       In

particular, a sharp decline on January 29 was a response to the Japanese

attack on Shianghai on January 28. These aggressions took place during the

Tokyo market hours, thus causing a yen depreciation in the Tokyo market. In

a few instances, signs of truce caused the yen to appreciate (for example,

on February 29 and March 10).

     In January, depreciation occurred in the Tokyo market, responding to

the news of the attack on Shianghai combined with the fear of losing the

Chinese market for export. However, the depreciation was countered by

appreciation in the New York market. The news of the Japanese aggression

might not have been taken seriously enough in New York, and the dollar was

weakening with the news of the troubled U.S. economy (to be discussed in

detail shortly).

     From the middle to the end of February, the yen depreciated by $4/lOO

yen (Regime II).      This reflects the reaction of foreign investors to

increasing political criticism of the Japanese activities in Shianghai and

Manchuria. On February 16, the League of Nations adopted an appeal to Japan

on the issue of the Shianghai incidents, and a fact-finding mission was

dispatched by the League of Nations, arriving at Japan on February 29. Most

yen depreciation this time occurred in the New York market.        This is

evidence that foreign governments' reaction to the Japanese military

adventures were the key to the yen depreciation. Let us elaborate on this

conclusion.



                                9
         Newspapers reported that major sellers of yen against dollars (in New

 York) were American banks, while the Japanese banks sold dollars for profit-

 taking, although the pressure of selling yen dominated buying yen.      (Chugai

 Shogyo Sinpo, February 26, 1932.) It was also reported that the loss of

 reputation made it difficult for Japan to issue, or rollover, the dollar-

denominated bonds issued abroad.       It seemed that American investors were

more informed about the determination of the U.S. government to penalize

Japan for her military adventures in China.

      In the U.S., the Great Depression was in progress.     New York stock

prices lost 40-50 percent of their value in the first half of the year. The

government countered with measures to inflate the money supply. The fear of

possible inflation caused the European investors to pull their investments

from the United States. The net flow of gold out of the U.S. amounted to

623 million dollars, making the balance at the end of June at 3.92 billion

dollars. This large outflow of gold prompted rumors of the gold embargo      by

the U.S., for example, on March 29, and depreciated the dollar against     yen.

However, these events were dominated by the yen depreciation news mentioned

above.

     The Japanese political instability in the 1930s was twofold.            As

mentioned above, international criticism of Japanese aggressions in China

was a great factor in yen depreciation. However, there were other domestic

disturbances in Japan.       There were several political assassinations in

Japan. On February 9, ex-Finance Minister Inouye was assassinated; on March

5, Mituj Zajbatsu executive Takuma Dan was assassinated; and on May 15,

Prime Minister Inukai was assassinated. However, the domestic      political

instability did not cause an immediate sharp change in the value of       yen.

The exchange rate did not show any significant movement on February 9 or 10,


                                  10
and the assassination of the Prime Minister caused a yen depreciation of

only a small amount (less than by $1) temporarily on May 16.

     New Prime Minister Saito formed an all-party coalition government on

May 26 and called a special parliamentary session from June 1 to June 15.

The special session passed, among others, the Act of Preventing Capital

Flight [Shihon Tohi Boshi HoJ (which became effective on July 1).

     However, the parliamentary session was followed by another wave of yen

depreciations (Regime III). This time, according to newspapers, speculators

in Shianghai were to blame, combined with hightened political instability

caused by a conflict at the Manchurian customs office (on June 27).       The

drop in yen might also have been hastened by import leads (of cotton) and by

speculations which tried to avoid the capital controls that were soon to be
•
           /8/
imposed.

     In sum,        the Japanese yen depreciated due to the U.S. criticisms of

Japanese imperialism. The instability between military aggression and signs

of truce, combined with the uncertainties in the U.S. economic prospects,

caused great volatility, as can be seen in the standard deviations in Table

2, Regimes Q-I, Q-II, and III.

6. Increasing International Conflicts in the Second Half of 1932

     During the month f July 1932 (Regime Q-III), the exchange rate market

was rather calm.         This was mainly because of the newly enacted capital

controls.        Although the law of preventing capital flight would be found

ineffective later, uncertainty about implementing procedures in the first

month under the law made the transaction very thin, resulting in minor

volatility (with standard deviations, less than .20).

     In the second half of 1932, there were two waves of yen depreciations,



                                    11
 one from August 5 to 19 (Regime IV) and another from October 26 to November

 29 (Regime V). Yen depreciations in both regimes were mainly caused by

 speculations outside Japan.

      Since the capital flight prevention act was found to be ineffective as

 a means of stopping capital movement, domestic speculations were not

 effectively sealed by the new law to prevent capital flight. Investors and

 speculators saw the weakening of the yen due to the diplomatic isolation of

Japan, which in turn was caused by increasing criticism from the United

States and other countries of Japan for its handling of Manchuria and

aggression toward China.

      The   Japanese activity in Manchuria and in mainland China           was

investigated by the League of Nations. A fact-finding mission, which came

to Japan in February and submitted a report in October, was surprisingly (to

the Japanese) critical of Japan. The increasing tensions between Japan and

the western nations prompted foreign speculators to sell yen.           It was

considered at the time, "the movement of the yen depends on the foreign

countries' attitude toward Japan." (Chugai Shogyo Shinpo, October 4.)

      The speculations occurred outside Japan, as evidenced by a larger share

of yen depreciation in the New York market during regimes IV and V.         As

Finance Minister Takahashj defended himself from the growing criticism for

yen depreciation, by saying that "speculations abroad cannot be controlled

[by the Japanese government]." (Chugaj Shogyo Shinpo, August 25, 1932)


7.   U.s. Financial Crisis, FDR's New Deal, and the Dollar Off Gold

     The dollar/yen exchange rate changes in 1933 were dominated by the

U.S. -oriented news. The yen appreciation was evident in the New York market

rather than in the Tokyo market, becuase the dollar was    depreciating (not



                                 12
only against yen but also against sterling) in response to the U.S. news.

The financial crisis in March 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, the

decision to move dollars off the gold standard, and the increase in the

purchase price of gold contributed to the dollar depreciation throughout

1933.      Let us consider in detail exactly how each event corresponds to the

dollar depreciation (yen appreciation).

        After being criticized for its military activities in China and

Manchuria, Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in March 1933.      Japan

became gradually, but steadily, isolated in the international political

circles.

        From December 1932 to mid April 1933 (Regime Q-V), the dollar/yen

exchange rate was rather stable. Although the yen had started to appreciate

from a low of $20 recorded in November 1932, the process was very slow. The

stability in the $/yen level was rather surprising in light of many events

which we would consider fundamental to the determination of the exchange

rate.      In the spring of 1933, a financial crisis developed in the United

States. On February 14, a bank moratorium was imposed in Michigan, followed

by other states. On March 3, New York and Illinois declared moratoria.      By

this time, moratorium had spread to 38 states and operations and withdrawal

were limited in 10 other states and the District of Columbia. On March 4,

Franklin D. Roosevelt was inaugurated and new policies and directives were

issued immediately.      The nationwide bank moratorium, the suspention of

convertibility, and the gold embargo was announced on March 5.             The

financial market, including the exchange market was closed from March 4 to

March 12. When the market was reopened on March 13, strict capital controls

were imposed to prevent capital flight and speculation. The gold export was

restored with a licensing system (effective on March 10). It was not until


                                   13
April 19 that the dollar went off gold.

      The interest rate was raised sharply when the moratorium was lifted.

The New York Federal Reserve Bank raised the discount rate to 3.5 percent,

and the call rate jumped to 5 percent. The quotes of the dollar/yen rate

were not available in the Tokyo market during the period of moratorium. The

Japanese finaicial market was unaffected by the sharp increase in the call

rate in the United States.


      It is puzzling from the viewpoint of the efficient market hypothesis

that the dollar did not depreciate (so that the yen against the dollar did

not appreciate) in March, when it became obvious from various news stories

that the dollar was going to be off gold soon. It is possible that resuming

gold export, though licenses were needed, was enough to reassure the market.

It may also have been the case that capital controls in Japan were strict

and    effective,   so   that the speculations could      not   take      place.

Alternatively, the appreciation pressure from widening the interest rate

spread was just enough to cancel the depreciation pressure from an increased

probability of going off gold permanently.

      In the beginning of April, applications for gold export increased

sharply.    President Roosevelt announced the gold embargo on April 19.      The

dollar depreciation from April 19 to April 25 (Regime VI) was solely caused

by the decision by the United States to go off gold. Most depreciation took

place in the New York market, and the volatility in the New York market was

very large. The interest rate was stable at 0.725 percent in Tokyo and 1.0

percent during this period. The stability of the interest rates with the

exchange rate changes contrasts the March episode described above.




                                 14
       From the end of April to the beginning of June (Regime Q-VI), the

market was rather quiet. Although the total change was small, there is some

evidence from "market decomposed accumulated changes" that news in the Tokyo

market was causing the yen to depreciate while news in the New York market

was appreciating it.         On May 1, 1933, the Foreign Exchange Control Law

became effective. This superceded and strengthened the Law of Preventing

Capital Flight introduced a year earlier. With this new law, the government

was given the authority to control every aspect of foreign exchange.       In

fact, Japan tried to stabilize the value of yen with this exchange control

law.    When the dollar left the gold standard on April 20, Japan decided to

fix the value of yen to sterling, with a wide band. After April 20, the yen

was between 1 shilling 2 pence and a half and 1 shilling 2 pence and 1/16

for the rest of the year. Therefore, any change in the $/yen value after

April was actually the change in the value of the dollar against sterling

and yen.

       From June 3 to July 18 (Regime VII-R), the dollar depreciated by more

than $5/100 yen. At the end of May, the U.S. formally abolished the gold

linkage,    setting    off    another depreciation wave.    When   the   U.S.

representative opposed taking measures to stabilize the exchange rate     (on

June 28) in the Monetary and Economic Conference in London (June 21 -    July
27), and when President Roosevelt further indicated that he would put a

priority on domestic stimulation, another wave of dollar depreciation

resulted.    Again, most of the relevant news originated in New York.    This

scenario is confirmed by a high mean of depreciation of dollars and high

volatility in the New York market for the VII-R regime.

       The yen depreciated from mid-July to the end of July by $3/lOOyen

(Regime VIII).        The depreciation was mainly caused in Tokyo market.


                                   15
 However, no obvious reason for this is found.

      From August to the end of October (Regime Q-VIII), the exchange market

 was quiet. A strong recovery of the U.S. economy was expected due to the

 policy package under the New Deal during the summer of 1933.      The stock
 price increased by 50% from the bottom recorded in March.       However, in
 September, it became evident that production and employment rates were not

 improving as planned. The performance of the economy disappointed workers

 and the number of strikes increased.

      On October 22, President Roosevelt announced that the government would

purchase gold at higher prices. A government agency, the Reconstruction
Finance    Corporation,   started buying domestically produced     gold     at

$3l.36/troy oz. on October 25, and then the price was gradually raised to

$34.06 on December 18. Moreover, the New York Federal Reserve      Bank was
instructed to purchase gold from abroad. The U.S. bought $12 million of

domestic gold and $5 million of foreign gold.         More money would be
circulated, prices would be increased and the production would be increased.

Essentially, this was a deliberate dollar devaluation (depreciation)
                                                                       policy.

     These events were responsible for a large depreciation of the dollar

against yen from October 21 to November 21 (Regime IX).          The dollar

depreciated against yen by more than $4/yen, about 5% for this period.

Since the major news originated in the New York market, the New York market

was responsible for the depreciation of the dollar, and the   volatility of
the New York market far exceeded that of the Tokyo market.

8. Interest Rate Effects on the Exchange Rate Determination

     In the modern view of the portfolio balance approach, the exchange rate

strongly responds to the interest rate differential. In fact, exchange rate

fluctuations back in 1927 and 1928 were caused by capital flows prompted by

interest rate differentials (Bank of Tokyo (1969)). It is of our interest

to check whether the interest rate differentials between Japan and the

United States was at all relevant to the exchange rate movement from 1931 to

1933. The time series of the differential in the call rates of the U.S. and

Japan is depicted in Figure 3a. The change in the exchange rate is shown in

Figure 3b for comparison. Casual observations of these figures do not

convince us that the interest differential was dominantly responsible for

changes of the exchange rate. In order to rigorously evaluate the effect of

the interest rate differential on the exchange rate, we proceed to test a

particular hypothesis.


                       Insert Figures 3a and 3b about here


     If uncovered interest parity and rational expectations hold, the

interest rate differential between the U.S. and Japan would predict movement

in the dolar/yen exchange rate (for example, see Ito (1988) for arithmetics

of uncovered interest parity). In particular, a higher U.S. interest rate,

              to   uncovered interest parity implies         the   expected   yen
according

appreciation.      If expectations are rational (unbiased), the realized (ex

post) rate is the sum of the expected rate and the random forecast errors.

From this point of view, one may want to regress the change in the realized

future exchange rate, NYDY(t÷1)-NYDY(t), on the interest rate differential,

INTDIF(t) =   NYR(t)-TKR(t). We expect the positive sign on the interest rate
differential. Results are shown in Panel A of the Table 3. An estimated


                                  17
coefficient of INTDIF has a wrong sign but insignificantly different from

zero.      This conclusion is valid with or without the constant term.     The

result is also robust with respect to a sample split.         Thus, uncovered

interest parity combined with rational expectations would not explain the

exchange rate movement. However, the predicted change in the exchange rate

overnight due to the interest rate differential would be very small, so that

it would not be depicted in the regression.


                            Insert Table 3 about here


        An alternative link between the interest rate and the exchange rate is

the following channel.       If the monetary policy is going to change, the

interest rate is most likely to pick up first. In other words, the change

in the interest rate differential represents the news to the financial

market.      Therefore, if this is a major source, the change in the interest

rate differential would be significant in the exchange rate equation.      The

portfolio balance approach would predict that an increase in the U.S.

interest rate attracts the foreign investment into the U.S., thus causes the

dollar appreciation (yen depreciation). Therefore, according to theory, the

coefficient of INTDIF(t+l)-JNTDIF(t) on the should be negative.            The

regression results are shown in panel B of Table 3.             The estimated

coefficients in all equations are insignificant, with or without the

constant term, and whether a full or a split sample is considered.

Therefore, the explanatory power of the interest rate on the exchange rate

changes is very weak. However, the failure of ditecting any influence from

the interest rate to the exchange rate may not be surprising, considering

the fact that the exchange rate was much more volatile than the interest



                                  18
rate differentials, as depicted in Figure 3b.

     In sum, only a fraction of the exchange rate volatility is explained by

the interest rate differential or its changes.         This negative result

justifies our news analysis approach in preceding sections, in that the

exchange rate responded primarily to political decisions and actions during

the two year period.


9. Was Yen Depreciation a Policy Objective?

     The conventional wisdom is that Takahashi's policy depreciated the yen

and the depreciation helped export. See Nanto and Takagi (1985. p.371) and

Nakamura (1983, ch. 9).    The view is correct to the extent that Takahashi

decided to go off gold and allowed a hard landing in December 1931.

However, it would be misleading to say that Japan pursued a deliberate

depreciation policy to help an export drive in 1932.

     Our close examination of the exchange rate movements reveals that the

yen depreciation ! se was not a policy objective. After the hard landing,

the yen depreciated further. Our analysis shows that military aggressions

and foreign criticisms against them are resposible for a substantial part of

the yen depreciation of the 1931-32 period.      The financial market was

sensitive to the political risk in holding the yen-denominated asset.    The

market might have foreseen trade sanctions, an embargo or a blockade against

Japan, although actual problems as such did not materialize until years

later.   In the meantime, the Japanese export soared and the balance of

payments started to improve in 1932.

     We dismissed the (changes of) interest rate differential as a major

source of changes of the exchange rate. However, one might counter to our

position saying that fiscal and monetary policies were conducted, though not



                                 19
evident in the interest rate, so that the exchange rate could be influenced.

It is well-known that Finance Minister Takahashi conducted a debt-financed

fiscal expansion. In fact, the (central) government expenditures increased

by 32.5 percent and by 15.6 percent in Fiscal Years 1932 and 1933,

respectively. However, money supply (Ml) increased only 6.9 percent and 4.8

percent in 1932 and 1933, respectively.    It is granted that fiscal policies

contributed to the early recovery of the Japanese economy. However, it is

quite questionable that those policies were conducted to prompt yen

depreciation      which in turn helped export and output.

      If the yen depreciation was designed to promote export, it would have

been promoted so by the government and the business. On the contrary, the

Japanese business leaders were asking the government to stop the yen

depreciation.     The Chamber of Commerce in Osaka asked the government to

stabilize (i.e., prevent depreciation of) the yen as early as January, 1932.

The Tokyo Chamber of Commerce followed the suit in February. However, the

opinions were mixed in the first half of 1932. After the yen dropped below

$25/100 yen in the summer of 1932, the public opinion became solid in asking

the government to stop the depreciation.

      Although Finance Minister Takahashi had stuck to a position that he

would let the market determine the level and there would be nothing the

government could do to prevent yen depreciation, , the government gradually

shifted its position. In July 1932, the Act of Preventing Capital Flight

was introduced, although it soon became clear that loopholes were so large

that the Act did not stop capital movement effectively. (See Bank of Japan

(1985, pp.      84-89).) Facing a further depreciation in the second half of

1932, the government introduced a stricter law. The Foreign Exchange Control

Law   was   introduced to the Parliament on February 14, 1933, passed the


                                  20
Parliament on March 17, and became effective on May 1, 1933. This law was

     Nanto    and     Takagi   (1985), citing Nakamura   (1983),     gave   the

interpretation that the exchange rate control was introduced to limit import

and to improve balance of payments, and preceded the United States, England

and Germany. On the contrary, the law of 1933 was intended to limit capital

export, thus preventing further depreciation of the yen. Exchange controls

at least at the time of introduction were not aimed at limiting import or

promoting export.


10. Concluding Remarks

     In the beginning of our sample period, the international financial

market were well organized and free from regulations.          Exchange rate

             in     1931-32, without capital controls, had    most     of   the
dynamics
characteristics common to that in late 1970s and the 1980s. The exchange

rate changes came in waves, and they corresponded to many news relevant to

the value of currencies. This observation is supported by a general success

of our "news analysis." Major news, such as decisions to go off gold (which

happend in 1931 in Japan, and in 1933 in the U.S.), caused the exchange rate

flucutuations immediatly in the home market. (However, there were a few

instances that the correspondence between relevant news and a large exchange

rate movement broke down.) As capital controls were introduced in Japan (in

the second half of 1932) and the United States (in 1933), capital movements

with speculative motives were significantly curtailed.

     In sum, reasons for the yen depreciation from December 1931 to November

1932 can be summarized as follows. The yen depreciated by about 30 percent

($50 to $35 per 100 yen) in three weeks following (the anticipation and

reality of) the yen going off gold in December 1931 (Regime I).      This was a


                                   21
clear-cut hard-landing from the overvalued "old parity." Most depreciation

took place in the Tokyo market just before and after the announcement of

gold embargo. During the year of 1932, the yen lost another 40 percent ($35

to $20 per 100 yen) of its value in several waves of depreciations separated

by calm periods (Regimes Q-I through Q-V).          These depreciation waves

correspond    in    timing to various episodes of       Japanese    imperialism

aggressions. During the year of 1932, sources of depreciation and volatility

gradually shifted from the Tokyo market to markets abroad.         This is an

evidence that foreign investors and speculators became more sensitive to the

political risk of holding the yen as Japan became criticized by the

international diplomatic circles.       Clearly this depreciation was      not

engineered for export drive by the Japanese government's policy, but rather

a byproduct of its military adventures.

       The the dollar/yen exchange rate moved from $20 to $30 per 100 yen in

1933. However, this was not the yen appreciation, but the dollar deprecia-

don.     The main news which affected the exchange rate originated in the

United States.      The effects of worsening of the Great Depression and the

decision to go off gold by the United States dominated the market.

       The end of gold standard and political events mainly drove the exchange

market. The interest rate differential had little explanatory power on the

exchange rate movement.

/1/. Japan joined the gold standard in 1897 after receiving the 311 million

yen (38 million British Pounds) indemnity from China as a result of the

Sino-Japanese war of 1894-95. The established parity implied approximately

2 yen to the dollar. Japan, along with European countries, suspended the

gold standard during the First World War.          Sweden, after a      strong

deflationary policy, returned to the gold standard at the old parity in the

beginning of the 192Os. British sterling returned to the gold standard in

1925, despite the advice of John M. Keynes against it.      In 1926. France
joined the gold standard, but at a fraction of the pre World War I parity

due to the severe inflation after the war.

        Although many European countries resumed the gold standard system in

the 1920s, Japan did not formally return to the gold standard until January

1930.      However, the domestic policies of l920s were conducted in order to

keep the exchange rate near the old parity, that is, approximately 2

yen/dollar or 10 yen/L. At the time, it was believed that returning to the

gold standard would be stimulating to the sagging economy. However, the yen

was overvalued, and the demand from United States was declining due to the

weak economy and protectionism. Cold reserve drained and the Japanese

economy was in a recession. This prompted the policy change under the new

cabinet.




/2/ The Japanese gold reserve was declining quickly in 1931. Britain

already left the gold standard in September.          The market was

expecting Japan to follow the suit after the Britain's decision.

However, it took more than two months and cabinet change for Japan to


                      Footnotes page -   1 -
suspend its gold export.

     Finance Minister Jun-nosuke Inouye in the Wakatsuki cabinet

believed in the gold standard, for the stability of foreign trades,

and repeatedly denied the rumor of suspension of gold embargo.          On

December 11,    1931, Prime Minister Wakatsuki and his cabinet members

resigned.      In an interview after the resignation is submitted,

Finance Minister Inouye said, "It has been my belief that gold export

should not be suspended.        Considering current economic conditions, I

do not recognize any reason for the suspension.        Therefore,   I will

not suspend gold export so long as this cabinet lasts.        The issue of

gold should be considered by the next cabinet." (Chugai Shogyo

Shinpo, December 12, 1931; authors' translation.)

     The dramatic mistake of sticking to the fixed exchange rate when

economic conditions were changed was going to be repeated some forty

years later in Japan.

     The new government led by Prime Minister Inugai was formed on

December 13,      1931.     The new Finance Minister, Korekiyo Takahashi

immediately suspended the export of gold, and the convertibility of

yen. The Ministry Directive No. 36, issued and effective on December

13, stated that "(i) Export of gold coins and bars is subject to

approval of the Finance Minister; (ii) Violaters to (i) shall be

imprisoned for a period not exceeding three months or shall be

subject to a penalty not exceeding 100 yen; (iii) If a person sells

gold bars, or if a person collects, melts, or defaces gold coins to

be resold, then the person is subject to the same penalty as

described in (ii)." For the basis of the directive, Finance Minister



                                               -
                          Footnotes page - 2
Takahashi explained that "the economy and the fiscal budget have

recently choked since the gold export (standard) is resumed.        The

government revenue has declined sharply, causing a massive budget

imbalance; the industries has been stalling without any sign of

recovery; the species has flowed out; the business community has been

suffering tremendously; the interest rate has increased, causing a

monetary crunch.      The present course of the situation is not

bearable.     It is unavoidable to put the suspension of gold export as

a pillar of new policy.     This is the reason to announce the order of

gold export suspension as the first action of the new government."

(Chugai Shogyo Shinpo, December 13, extra, special edition, authors'

translation.) During the days immediately after this order, Finance

Minister repeatedly pointed out that the yen was overvalued and the

depreciation would be good for the Japanese industry, and that it

would be the best to let the market determine the exchange rate.


/3/      This period includes the suspension of gold export on December

13,     1931, experienced the 60 percent change (depreciation) from

December 1,     1931 ($50/loOyen) to November 30,   1932 ($20/lOOyen).

This is all-time record for the most volatility for one year period,

only rivaled with the period of rapid yen appreciation which includes

the episode of the Group of Five, Plaza agreement on September 22,

1985.     The yen/dollar rate changed slightly more than 60 percents,

from May 25, 1985 ($l/251 yen) to May 24, 1986 ($1/l55 yen).       Note

that the calculation of both periods is based on the value of dollar

against yen (the IMF method).

        There was no yen/$ exchange rate market during the Second World



                      Footnotes page -   3   -
War.      Hence, the 84-fold change in nine years, from the pre-WW II

($23.4/lOOyen) to the post-WW II level ($1/36Oyen, set in 1949), was

an exception for the volatility record.

/4/      Finance Minister Takahashi is credited for the Keynesian-type

monetary and fiscal policies in the early 1930s. (See for details,

Nakamura (1983, ch.9), Shima (1983) and Yamamura (1972).) Government

expenditures were increased and financed by bonds which were

monetized by the Bank of Japan.      The interest rates were lowered in

1932 and 1933.       In literature on the Japanese economic history,

Finance Minister Takahashi is often nicknamed as a Keynes of Japan

(for example, in Nanto and Takagi (1985)).        It is also emphasized

that his policies were executed before Keynes' General Theory was

written, and even before the New Deal was announced in the United

States.



/5/      The daily exchange rate is expressed in the T.T. selling rate

(i.e., the rate for wire transfer). However, the quotes in Japan are

expressed as the rate that banks are willing to sell the U.S.

dollars bound for the New York, while the quotes in New York are

expressed as the rate that banks are willing to sell the Japanese

yen bound for Tokyo.      Thus, the bid-ask spread has to be adjusted

before     the statistical summary is calculated.       The following

information is available for making inference on the size of bid-ask

spread during the period in question.

       First, for selected days, the newspaper also reports the ask

rate in the Tokyo market.    When the exchange rate experiences a very

rapid change, such as one after the gold embargo, the bid-ask spread



                      Footnotes page - 4   -
was as much as $1 (when the level was $40/lOOyen, that is 2.5%).

However, most of the time, the spread was between $.50 (i.e., 1.67%)

and $.25 when the rate is volatile, and it was between $.25 (i.e.,

0.83% at $30/l00yen) and $.125 (i.e., 0.42% at $30/lOOyen) when the

rate is calm.    Second, the bid-ask spread for the pound/yen rate in

the London market is available daily from December 1933 on.         It

suggests that the spread is mostly between 0.7 and 0.9 ¼, and

occasionaly up to 1.4%.    Third, if during each quiet period there is

no particular bias in depreciation and appreciation news falling in

the Tokyo and N.Y., then the per-day average change should be near

zero in each market in each quiet (Q) regime after the bid-ask spread

is adjusted.

      These observations make us confident that the bid-ask spread can

be inferred as notes in Table 2.     It is not essential to precisely

estimate the day-by-day bid-ask spread for our purpose.    It suffices

to estimate the average bid-ask spread for the regime. Moreover, our

volatility measure, the standard error of the exchange rate change in

a market, is independent from the estimate of the bid-ask spread,

given that the bid-ask spread is taken to be a unknown constant.


/6/ A pattern of alternating tremulous and tranquil periods is common

to the experiences in the post Smithsonian period.    It is one of the

"regularities" found by Mussa (1979).         See, for example, waves

identified by Ito (1987) for the period after the Group of Five,

Plaza Agreement of 1985.


/7/    For the beginning and ending of some regims, dating other than

one adopted in this paper could be conceivable. For example, the end


                     Footnotes page - 5   -
of the second regime could be March 8 instead of February 26, 1932.

However, dating is not crucial to so long as the alternatives are

reasonably close each other.


/8/   Bank of Japan (1985; p.65) lists another reason fore the           yen

depreciation of this period: Seiyuukai, the majority party, advocated a

further yen depreciation, and the advocated policy caused a speculative

selling of yen outside Japan. This explanation is consistent with the fact

that most of yen appreciation took place in the New York market.    However,

there is a difficulty with this explanation. The Japanese government at the

time was going to impose the Act of preventing capital flight in order to

stop yen depreciation caused by speculation. Policies of advocating the

depreciation and of preventing capital flight are conflicting in their

effects.

      Moreover, the above-mentioned explanation implies the delayed reaction

of the exchange rate to the news. If Yen moves in the New York market

reacting to Japan-oriented news, it implies either that it took time to

digest news or that the Japanese traders could not foresee how American

traders would react to the news. Note that, in the l980s, even if traders

of different nationalities are heterogeneous, a reaction to the news is

immediate since all traders can, and do, participate in any market in the

world via telephone. The communication technology available in the 1930s

did not allow the institutions in New York to trade in real time in Tokyo.

Notes to Table 2

1. A number in [   ] is   a total change for the regime.

2.   The bid-ask spread is assumed as follows:         (i) $0501100 yen from
December 11, 1931 to December 30, 1932; (ii) $0.20/lOU yen from December 31,

1931 to November 29, 1932; (iii) $0.15/lOO yen from November 30, 1932 to

April 18, 1933; (iv) $0.20/lOO yen from April 19, to November 21, 1933. For

the basis of this assumption, see footnote 5.


3. Since there are missing observations, the number of observations do not

necessarily match the number of business days.             When the changes are

measured, one missing observation in a market will cause two missing

observations in "changes."
